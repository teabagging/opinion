Compounding issues involving epigenetics, environmental exposure and a lack of nutrient rich foods among other examples have led many people to high weights in which they cannot control through diet and exercise. Couple that with generationally poorer families having limited access to overpriced healthy foods and its even worse. Medical intervention is needed not only to help these people but also as a preventive measure to decrease their long term cost on other health care cost associated with chronic conditions and to help them live longer. In 2025 with all the research that is present it is asinine to assume that obesity in the US is only caused by poor eating and lack of physical activity. It is so much more than that and the nuance is always lost because of the stereotype in this country. Some of the leading researchers explained this as well on a 60 minutes special last year and went in depth on the complexities and even had patients they were treating that did diet right and exercise and were incapable of losing weight without medical intervention.

He seems to especially dislike people from certain places, but he's happy to exploit them as long as they are willing to toil for him at low wages and hard conditions.It's indisputable that Silicon Valley's use of the H-1B visa program is not a mechanism to bring in the best and the brightest but a tool for obtaining cheap foreign labor. Over the years, the program was often exploited to replace American workers, some even forced to train their visa replacements before being laid off as part of their severance agreement. Musk and Sacks' defense failed to resonate because it was nonsense.The data reveals that H-1B visas are frequently used to bring in ordinary workers filling routine jobs at much lower wages than their American counterparts. Even Musk's own company, Tesla, has been using the visa to source cheap labor. Furthermore, a significant portion of the H-1B visa program's sponsorship comes from Indian IT outsourcing companies, which are not driving innovation but enabling U.S. companies to outsource entire departments to these outsourcing companies, who eventually offshore these U.S. jobs to low-labor cost countries like India.","title":"Trump Used to Understand That Legal Immigration Hurts American Workers, Too.

What Happened? | Opinion"},{"text":"\\\\Because they learned it from watching us.If I may -and I know others have- I'd like to disagree with this.While you're certainly right that western colonialism played a role in spreading a particular kind of (so called) \\"scientific\\" racism, and its attendant hierarchies, across the world, I'm far from convinced it was the only factor. Indeed,  I'd go so far as to say there were many kinds of \\"proto-racisms\\" already on the go in many non European countries long before the white man showed up.For example, in 17th Century China, we see Han Chinese thinkers arguing the Han were a superior race given their proximity to \\"Heaven\\", in contrast with the less divinely ordained 'barbarian' peoples. The Han were, after all, the residents of the Middle Kingdom closest to heaven, and thus surely a  more blessed people than the barbarian hordes surrounding them.Indeed, to quote Ming Dynasty scholar Wang Fuzhi directly:\\"The Chinese...must be distinguished absolutely from the barbarians. Why is this so? Because if man does not mark himself off from things, the principle of Heaven is violated. If the Chinese do not mark themselves off from the barbarians, then the principle of earth is violated...if men do not mark themselves off and preserve an absolute distinction between societies, then the principle of man is violated\\".This idea of Chinese racial superiority would play a role in their dealings with various barbarian groups - particularly during their numerous occupations of present day Vietnam. Interestingly, the Vietnamese would adopt these ideas, and use them to assert their own racial superiority during their invasions of Cambodia and the Cham kingdoms in the 19th century.Of course, anti-black sentiment was also present  in the minds of numerous Arabic thinkers during the Middle Ages (I concede it wasn't codified into law as it was in the European slave colonies - but we do see black African slaves under the whip of some Arabic slave masters being given the worse jobs compared to their paler counterparts), and there have long been racialised overtones in Japanese thinking, especially with regards to Korea.I just find the idea that Europeans alone \\"invented\\" and spread the idea of racism (the belief one ethnic/racial group is superior to another for whatever reason) somewhat disturbing, when we find numerous non European groups asserting their superiority over others throughout time and place across the world, long before the Europeans arrived.","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"They move with how leftists feel and if they work.

Japan is unique in racializing its ethnic group by referring to the \\"Japanese race.\\" Europeans, however, invented modern racism, dehumanizing the rest of humanity by considering them as inferior or even subhuman (as evidenced by atrocities such as human zoos). This ideology was used to justify genocide, colonization, enslavement, and the forced assimilation of people of color under the guise of \\"saving them from their inferior ways.\\" Such actions are profoundly heinous and far surpass the tribal conflicts or xenophobia seen in non-white countries.The way non-white countries display hatred tends to be more overt and less insidious than European racism. For example, if you move to Saudi Arabia or South Korea, the locals might treat you as different, but they generally won't pressure you to erase your cultural identity or fully assimilate. You may face xenophobia from certain individuals, but it rarely reaches the institutionalized and systemic levels of racism prevalent in Western countries. In these non-white countries, you're often allowed to maintain your cultural practices within the bounds of local customs.In contrast, racism and xenophobia in Western societies are deeply embedded in institutions and societal norms. This makes them more pervasive and insidious, often accompanied by a cultural disdain for foreigners, especially Muslims, Arabs, and Black people. In addition, there is immense pressure to assimilate to the dominant culture, even though, for many, full acceptance remains unattainable. Regardless of how much effort one makes to adopt local customs, features such as Arab or Black physical characteristics often lead to being treated as a perpetual outsider or, at best, a second-class citizen.When tensions rise, the same societies that demand assimilation often use these differences to exclude and \\"other\\" people. This process is dehumanizing in a different wayone that strips individuals of their cultural identities while denying them true belonging. Given the choice, I would prefer living in a country where people are honest about my status as an outsider rather than one that demands cultural erasure, only to ultimately marginalize me.","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"Give it until Trump causes a recession and a bunch of these will switch back to Independent out of shame again","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"They won't do it because Trump won this time.

It's intended to prevent the construction of unnecessary and excess healthcare facilities in places that do not need those facilities, while encouraging builders and systems to expand to underserved areas.Things I was not able to verify:Whether or not these laws have been effective.Whether or not these laws have been used to push needed care away from minorities, or restrict access to certain types of healthcare which Tennessean (Republican) leadership doesn't like.Whether or not the supposed limitations of Certificate of Need requirements have caused any harm in terms of healthcare access.Whether or not there are benefits to keeping these restrictions in place.Whether or not the movement against them is grassroots or manufactured.In short, I don't know much. I will say this: The first article I found (across multiple sites) cheers on \\"protecting workers' freedom to decide\\", in other words, Right to Work, a major force in the destruction of unions presented as false empowerment. The article also talks up how the legislature struck down a corporate tax hike and implemented education reform (No idea what that reform was, to be fair).They quote Mercatus Center Scholars (the Mercatus Center is a libertarian free-market thinktank) about how the red tape of CON laws has caused problems.They heavily emphasize that unelected bureaucrats \\"act as gatekeepers\\".There's also a cheap shot or two at COVID lockdowns, suggesting that the government shouldn't have the power to enact those either.... Oh, also, the author is affiliated with the Center for Individual Freedom, a conservative policy advocacy organization best known for trying to say that we should really stop with all those restrictions on smoking tobacco.For reference, two of the places I found the article:https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/09/tennessee-amendments-2022-election-results-1-2-3-4-tn/69610893007/https://www.tennesseeorthopaedicsociety.com/news/why-its-finally-time-to-eliminate-all-certificate-of-need-laws-in-tennesseeFor opposing viewpoints, here's one by Wendy Long, who is CEO and president of the Tennessee Hospital Association.https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2024/03/18/tennessee-health-care-certificate-of-need-law/72972244007/Main point in that one seems to be that, without CON laws, facilities that are more heavily for-profit and ignore or avoid un- or under-insured patients would propagate unrestricted, with the non-profit facilities that desperately need the wealthier patients to help balance their books being effectively stripped of funding by proximity.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"Ive lived in NYC and the Midwest.

Democrats only need 20% of both houses to disqualify Trump as an insurrectionist under the recently-amended Electoral Count Act: Third, specific legislation designed for this situation already exists. The Electoral Count Act was first enacted in 1887 and later amended and restated in 2022. That statute provides a detailed mechanism for resolving disputes as to the validity of Electoral College votes. The act specifies two grounds for objection to an electoral vote: If the electors from a state were not lawfully certified or if the vote of one or more electors was not regularly given. A vote for a candidate disqualified by the Constitution is plainly in accordance with the normal use of words not regularly given. Disqualification for engaging in insurrection is no different from disqualification based on other constitutional requirements such as age, citizenship from birth and 14 years residency in the United States. To make an objection under the Count Act requires a petition signed by 20 percent of the members of each House. If the objection is sustained by majority vote in each house, the vote is not counted and the number of votes required to be elected is reduced by the number of disqualified votes. If all votes for Trump were not counted, Kamala Harris would be elected president.https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5055171-constitution-insurrection-trump-disqualification/","title":"Congress has the power to block Trump from taking office, but lawmakers must act now (it only takes 1/5th of Congress to vote for this!)"},{"text":"Correct, they are using the fact that he was a Muslim (and most likely an ISIS-sympathizer) as their support.

Democrats voted against this.Since then, every Democrat has opposed money=speech and every Republican has supported it. In 2016, there was an open seat at the Supreme Court--the deciding seat on this very issue.

Disqualification for engaging in insurrection is no different from disqualification based on other constitutional requirements such as age, citizenship from birth and 14 years residency in the United States.

People in ethnically homogeneous countries do not experience interactions with people from minority cultures every day. Empathy should ideally look like thinking about how the other person is feeling from their perspective, but people in the majority ethnic group of a homogeneous country can operate from the assumption that the other person is feeling what they would also be feeling, as a person from that same cultural background. A Han Chinese person living in a Han-majority city wont find themselves having to hold an unfamiliar perspective in their head, or learn to empathize with it, unless they seek that experience out, for example. In the same way, a white American in a white American town might never meet a non-white person, then make assumptions about what they mean because of cultural differences (and implicit biases that have gone uncombatted by real world interactions with people of different cultures). However, that white American has a better chance of meeting non-white people by moving to a big city, and learning to empathize with a different perspective. In contrast, a person of the majority ethnic group of a homogeneous country moving to the city probably wont expose them to the same degree of diverse perspectives and cultures. The UK, the US, Canada, and Australia are all immigration-based countries. The opportunities for conflict and racial discord, and forms of society-wide conflict resolution, allow for growth and acceptance as a society. Finland, Japan, any country with homogeneous populations (which is pretty much all of the world) have not had the same opportunities for internal conflict and conflict resolution because their minority ethnic groups dont have the plain numbers to speak up for themselves and demand empathy and respect in the same way. Im familiar with the phenomenon you speak of, but I think it makes more sense to think of the difference as homogeneous countries vs heterogeneous (or diverse, or immigration-based). Its a spectrum, too. I lived in the UK under a decade ago, and while I was there, the most popular Halloween costume was just Mexican. (I wish I were kidding, it got me into a few fights.) The UK might be decent at parsing Islamophobia issues, but idk if Id want to be Latino or Black over there.","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"It's time-limited now.

We know because of research funded by the department of education and from statistics gathered by the department of education. But, like in many realms in the US, there is an anti-intellectual/anti-science thread running through *why* our schools arent teaching reading the correct way.We know that teaching reading requires students to be directly and systematically taught phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Right around the time Millennials were kids, the focus moved from teaching these things directly to providing kids with literacy rich environments with the assumption that children who are surrounded by books and have adults read to them would automatically learn to read. This method felt good because it didnt require drilling, primers, or boring decodeable texts. Kids could read real books and foster a love of reading by making it less boring. But its not scientifically backed, its not equitable because poorer children had less access to high quality books as well as adult time, and it let a lot of kids down. There are still quite a few teachers and even whole districts who eschew phonics and phonemic awareness because it is boring and not fun and students dont enjoy it regardless of what the science says.","title":"Kids' low reading scores are 'a 5-alarm fire,' says DOGE's Ramaswamy.

After all, if one has steady work as eg an HVAC repair person, the work life can end at 5PM, with scheduled long vacations, leaving enough time to eg take classes in a nearby college on any number of interesting subjects. yet without the pressure of having to turn such enlightened knowledge somehow into a job.Which kind of gives me an idea - may be I am not the only one seeing it this way. May be the prestige of BSc, which is fast losing its aura anyways, is not worth the price. May be there's room for new kinds of educational institutions that could cater to such a class of people?BTW, some of th absolutely most rewarding times I had in such \\"extra-curricular\\" studies ere in the quarter long classes I took through Stanford's vaunted Continuing Education courses. The classes I took included 2 that dealt with history (outside the US), 2 in Creative writing and 3 in Philosophy. all subjects in which I always had great interest. Thjses classes were full of people like me - already long employed in professions ranging from Law to medicine to IT etc. They, like me, felt the need to improve their knowledge without pressure. Just for knowledge's sake.Alas, while this model is great, the particular one I participated in was expensive so that shut out too many people.

For years, it was trendy for Republicans to pass these laws to create the illusion of concern for infant life, and to bolster their false claims to be \\"pro-life.\\" But it was never a sincere effort to allow women in dire circumstances a chance to save a baby's life without getting into legal trouble. The programs are underfunded,?[barely advertised and subsequently barely used](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/26/texas-safe-haven-law/). \\"Despite the legislative promise that the safe haven laws will increase child safety and legal compliance, the efficacy is suspect as the laws do not appear to protect mothers or their babies,\\"?[Alexandra Schrader-Dobris explained last year?](https://lawandinequality.org/2023/10/26/are-infant-safe-haven-laws-fulfilling-their-intended-purpose/)in the?Minnesota Journal of Law &amp; Inequality.Texas Republicans show no interest in educating people about safe haven laws, however. Instead, as?Hennessy-Fiske reports, they allocated $165 million to \\"alternatives to abortion,\\" mostly so-called crisis pregnancy centers. The?[goal of a crisis pregnancy center is not to help women](https://www.salon.com/2017/08/29/surprise-crisis-pregnancy-centers-totally-fail-at-replacing-planned-parenthood/)?in crisis. It's to do whatever it takes to keep her pregnant until it's too late to get an abortion, including through lies, threats, bullying, shaming, and false promises of help. **The goal is not \\"life,\\" but punishing the young woman for perceived sexual transgression, either because she had consensual sex or because she \\"tempted\\" a man into raping her.**?**Because the goal is punishment, there's no reason for Republicans to invest in safe haven laws, which shield young women from legal consequences for abandoning a newborn.** When a young woman throws a baby in a dumpster, however, that's a crime and she can be arrested. More resources into the safe haven program would save lives, but would reduce the number of women that can be thrown in jail. Given a choice between living babies or imprisoned women, Republicans pick the latter. Even the Republican who wrote the state's safe haven law,?Rep. Geanie Morrison, explained that she has no interest in making it easier for women to use it. \\"The problem is, if you do state funding, then youre tied to it,\\" she explained, not even bothering to come up with a more plausible-sounding non sequitur.?[https://www.salon.com/2025/01/02/newborns-are-being-left-in-dumpsters-in-texas-but-dont-seem-to-care/](https://www.salon.com/2025/01/02/newborns-are-being-left-in-dumpsters-in-texas-but-dont-seem-to-care/)","title":"Newborns are being left in dumpsters in Texas, but Republicans don't seem to care"},{"text":"I want there to be a heaven and hell so desperately as an afterlife just so these people can suffer so deeply and understand what absolute vile pieces of shit they actually are.

The IRA appropriates more than $142 billion to carry out activities designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect against the impacts of climate change. This includes up to $37 billion in appropriations for federal loans and loan guarantees, and nearly $105 billion allocated for grants, awards, and other direct spending by federal agencies. In addition, the IRA creates and expands a number of tax credit programs designed to support a broad range of climate-related activities, including investments in clean and renewable energy, electric vehicles and vehicle charging infrastructure, and energy efficiency projects. The total value of these tax credits is hard to evaluate since many of the IRAs credits are not capped, but recent studies estimate that Americans may claim between $780 billion and $1.2 trillion in tax credits over the IRAs 10-year life. While the spending and tax credit provisions comprise the bulk of the IRA, the Act also makes important changes to existing federal land leasing programs, mandates updates to existing greenhouse gas reporting regulations, and requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to collect fees for certain methane emissions. The next Presidential election may jeopardize the IRAs climate programs. Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation, recommends that the next conservative administration should push for full repeal of the IRA. Perhaps recognizing that could be difficult to achieve, Project 2025 also outlines a suite of measures that a future conservative administration may take to undermine the IRA, should it remain in place. These include measures to redirect climate-related funds and, more broadly, roll back environmental protections. Such proposals threaten to thwart climate action in the United States, and undo hard-won gains in the global fight against climate change.","title":"Trump Wont Confront the Climate Crisis.

The US would blockade the entrance to the greater pacific between the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan, and provide resources to the east side of the island. China's main advantage in this scenario is US unwillingness to risk an all-out war by striking into mainland China, which preserves China's logistical advantage. This means air defenses and supply lines are safe, and they can extend significant air support into the island from their primarily land-based air force. The US would likely focus on providing Taiwan with AA resources to deny China complete air superiority.If China escalated beyond Taiwan, very different story. Air superiority is lost the moment they leave the straight, as the majority of their air force is land-based. US Naval air forces outnumber them 4:1, with far more experience and support from ground and naval-based Counterair assets in the region. They'd lose those 3 carriers to an AGM-84 or their newer brethren in a heartbeat, and be immediately restricted to land-based operations in the region.That last bit is the kicker. The size of their navy becomes moot beyond the SCS if they lose those carriers. You cannot fight a modern war without air support.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"Looks like thill will just be something will have to reinstate every time we come back into office huh...","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"Guys, I asked for any hope, not more doom and gloom lol.

The reason China can take Taiwan is because no one in the US actually believes that they will try this any time soon.  So all of our resources are elsewhere. It wont be a surprise but we can't react in time to stop an invasion. And Taiwan only has about 300,000 active military personnel. China can pour millions onto the island relatively quickly. But taking land and holding land are different.  Taiwan has 23 million people who don't want to be POC and millions with compulsory miliary service.  That means almost everyone has some kind of military training. They are going to go into the mountains and punish China to the extent that China will need to bring in materials fairly regularly. Most of those materials are going to the bottom of the Taiwan Strait because we only have to park subs there to sink those boats. And if we park several carrier groups there once we get our resources in line, then there is little China can do to stop an allied fleet. They just don't have the navy capable of taking on the US, Japan, some of Europe. That fleet is likely to include Japan, UK, SK, several other European countries. Maybe even Vietnam and the Philippines. Chinese military personnel wont be able to get the resources necessary to hold the island. China only hope at holding Taiwan is about one of two options: The US doesn't care and doesn't actually support Taiwan. That means we don't even fight. Or the Taiwanese accept Chinese authority and the US accepts that.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":" I disconnected from politics through the holidays.A break is always a good thing.

Every country acts in accordance to its own self-intrests. To say \\"something is selfish therefore wrong\\" is a principle that could be applied to all countries when they want something limitedThis utterly misunderstands my points and also puts blinkers on your own geopolitical understanding.Yes selfishness is an aspect of geopolitics. So is reciprocity, the rules based order, respecting that other nations. If you stop doing those things then other nations will not work with you as much or as well.Trump is about to test this, especially with his tariff threats - and many economists and geopolitical experts are warning of the severe impacts it could have. This is because it breaks those principles of reciprocity, rules and respect.Is Iceland selfish for its fishing claims because it benefits them? Is this small country now bad?Great comparison to compare and contrast.In one way - no, we don't begrudge Iceland for its fish and other ocean resource claims because it is a small island nation in the middle of a large ocean. Even if it gets a bit cheeky sometimes, we (as a global population and as nationstates) realise they are just trying to do a bit better for themselves.This doesn't compare well to the US, which is one of the richest countries in the world, trying to enrich itself even further. There is a general sentiment of \\"you've already got plenty mate, back off\\" But in cases like the [Rockall Dispute](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48724832) (BBC) ([Rockall Bank dispute - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockall_Bank_dispute)) where Iceland is genuinely encroaching on another country's claims - then yes it does become a point of geopolitical friction that worsens relations with Britain and makes more problems within the EEZ.But ultimately that is still a relatively minor dispute - the sort most have with their neighbours at least sometimes and can be smoothed over with time. It isn't the global stage gaff which is offering to buy Iceland.//That is what I mean when I say that it is insensitive and selfish. Not just that it is in the US's best interest - but that the offer increases geopolitical friction. If Greenland did, as you desire, vote to join the US then that is completely different (and may spark completely different tension). It is the viewing an entire country and people as just a hunk of land to be traded, and salivating over how much the US would gain from it that is insensitive.","title":"CMV: Trump is right about Greenland acquisition being a necessity to the United States of America.

From the Internet: Taiwan's military includes around 169,000 active-duty personnel with a reserve force of up to 2.5 million.

Its navy has over 117 ships, including destroyers and frigates, focusing on defending against regional threats with advanced, agile capabilities.Those numbers pale in comparison to China, but consider the Taiwanese home advantage, local hostility/insurgency (invading armies always suffer), plus even indirect support from the US, it won't be a walk in the park for China.

(Havent even mentioned the Aussies, who may want in on the scrum too).Its possible that China could win a limited, local engagement, but like you said: it would be pyrrhic at best and would have a very adverse impact on their economics with little other than a symbolic victory to show for it (even if they take Taiwan, all of the manufacturing and industrial capability there would be scrap as the companies themselves have said).","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"It may suck but the union should buckle and allow Trump to do his thing Let my union brothers and sisters see what the actually voted for.

This is something Noah Smith has written about many, many times, such as [in this article](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/manufacturing-is-a-war-now?r=1pduu4&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false), which is headlined by the graph showing China controlling half of all manufacturing in the near future.Your other points showing Chinas relative inferiority to WWII America are valid, but Id point out that most of the West is also experiencing demographic decline. The US itself is in a better position, but many US allies, including Taiwan and especially South Korea, are in worse positions than China.As for German tech superiority being a myth, Ive _heard_ of it being a myth (hence I literally didnt repeat the 5 Shermans for one Tiger tank line verbatim). But its still hard to shake off such a strong preconceived notion.Not to mention its not just about Nazi Germany, but its also the modus operandi of the whole reformer movement. Its easy to clown on them for their most inane suggestions (like not including ejector seats to simplify designs), but the whole idea of a few overengineered boondoggles will lose to many simpler but more rugged weapons seems appealing to a layperson like myself.As for the whole a Taiwan invasion will be a limited operation, eh I can very easily see it becoming a protracted war of attrition, even if it started out anything but. After all, the Russo-Ukraine war started out as a three-day special military operation.

It has nothing to do with the US: China is too massive, too close, to rich and considers Taiwan their own land (which it arguably is for any Chinese person ever). That's why everyone is trying to replicate Taiwan's chip manufacture: everyone know that the island's position isn't sustainable under Chinese assault. However, I can certainly hope that the CCP's success can jolt America back into shape, at least the military aspect of the US.

The shot appeared to be self-inflicted, officials said.Damage from the blast was mostly limited to the interior of the truck.

There is *always* something unexpected that hits. Which means the national credit card never gets paid off.So... maybe I'm in the minority here... but I'd rather plan for the unexpected and cut federal spending *before* giving us tax cuts.

There are valid reasons for it to exist, while also ways that it gets abused.The purpose of having H1B's is so that if there is a special need RIGHT NOW, you don't have to wait 8 years for someone to complete their education and get the relevant experience. Instead, we get the best and brightest from another country to fill that role right away.The problem however is threefold:1. Employers aren't motivated to educate and foster American Citizens to fill these roles in the future. Thus, there will ALWAYS be a shortfall of talent, and you will constantly need H1B's to fill the gap.2. Employers have found loop holes to abuse the system. They hire companies to write hyper-specific job requirements designed to make it impossible for an American to tick all the boxes, and pre-select a foreigner that magically meets all the requirements. H1B's are supposed to be paid the the same rate (or better) than an equivalent American worker, but since the companies control the Visa and could revoke it, they are essentially able to blackmail the foreign worker to do extra or unpaid work.3. It has happened time and time again that American workers have been forced to train a H1B to replace them. This is a complete abuse of what the system was created for.These kinds of visas need to be tightly controlled and audited to ensure that they aren't bein abused. Additionally, if companies want to make use these Visas, as a condition they need to invest in training American Citizens to be able to do the job.","title":"Do we like H1B now?

Let's say the US and China engage in a conventional war over Panama, who do you think would win? I would say the US, and it wouldn't be particularly close. US naval and air superiority would make it exceedingly difficult for China to manage the logistics to even make landfall, let alone conquer Panama.

Imo, the US would have an easy time winning on these fronts. They can expatriate the knowledge people from Taiwan and destroy the factories.Punishing China would be incredibly easy, China wouldn't be able to secure their oil source. Despite their advance in naval capabilities, the US is still far superior in deep water. China's oil supply could be cut by over 80% which would crash their economy and manufacturing capabilities. They'd turn around and use their own coal, but that's still a massive downgrade in terms of total output. What they could manufacture would soon find no market for their export. Manufacturers would relocate to India, Pakistan, Nigeria, etc. With the demographic decline of China, cheap manufacturing will have to be relocated within a few decades, so China would only precipitate that exodus. China would take over Taiwan but end up with a shattered economy.

Besides, having been to China and its cities I find it hard to believe that China would sink to those depths of incompetency in the first place.Now yes the US is more than able to do Yellow Peril and Red Scare fearmongering (which would probably focus on harming Chinese-Americans more than actually helping with wartime morale). But I think with the rise of isolationism and populism, times have changed. The neocons have had their influence diminished, and many Americans are skeptical that democracy, let alone the American alliance, is worth preserving in the first place.And since you mentioned the information war aspect, China is even more likely to win that.

This would mean that there were a lot fewer cisfemale athletes competing in their sports because their opportunities would be greatly diminished.  However, the reality is that there are very few trans persons and even fewer that are athletes.  So, there is a low liklihood that there will be some huge influx of trans athletes that are better than the cis competitors.Regardless, it makes more sense to allow the sports oganizations to set the rules regarding their athletes and to determine what is and isn't fair.

US GDP is 27 trillion. About 1/4 of GDP is government spending. So call the total 20 trillion. It would take 2 years of throwing the entire balance of trade at it to pay it off, and thats impossible anyway. So no, it will never be paid off under a single administration, even if the administration wins two terms. It would most likely not be paid off under 16 years of consistent fiscal policy by successive presidents. The solution, under Trumps economic ideology, is to boost GDP, which boost tax revenues, and cut spending. GDP can theoretically be boosted by lowering tax rates when they are too high, which leaves more money in the economy, which theoretically increases trade and tax revenue. Combine that with spending cuts and it could theoretically be paid off. But its like a mortgage: as it stands, most payments service the debt rather than lowering the principal. It would take a lot of successive payments above the minimum to service the debt to see any progress, and a lot of budget cuts to make those payments possible. \\nSo yes, Trump is not going to try and pay off the national debt because its impossible for the foreseeable future. Hes trying to lay a frame for a strong economy that would make it possible to pay it off, or at least get it back to manageable levels, sometime in the future if the U.S. electorate maintains the fortitude to do so. Thats unlikely because most voters like the idea of spending cuts, but loathe the reality of spending cuts, so hes doing the best he can with the cards he was dealt.","title":"Trump Says He Will Deliver The Largest Tax Cuts In The History of Our Country"},{"text":"Remind the senator from Louisiana that without NBC, and the fantasy that was the apprentice, Trump would probably never had been President.","title":"Republican Senator Makes Left-Wing Joke About NBC During Terror Attack New Conference"},{"text":"Enshittification of government is just standard GOP operating procedure and has been for years","title":"Enshittification Comes to Washington: Our tech overlords have ruined the online platforms that Americans depend on.

Is the example I gave an important one?  No, and that is why you really didn't and won't hear a ton about it.  However, when it is something like the 'bathroom issue,' or 'trans athletes,' then I think the topic is much more important because the right is actively trying to harm these people and reduce their right to choose and to live comfortably. To my understanding, the bathroom issue arose when a group of college kids asked their university to make more gender neutral restrooms.  Gender neutral in this instance meaning single use restrooms.  They argued that this would help transitioning students to feel comfortable not having to choose a gendered restroom.  The right essentially caught wind of this and then painted this as being the left wanting restrooms open for multiple people regardless of gender.  So, they began to push for laws that restricted bathroom use to the 'gender at birth.'  The left pushed back because this definition was harmful to trans people, which the right only latched onto more.  Of course, the left could have done nothing, but then it would have meant that a minority would have been targeted and harmed.There are certainly issues that effect more people and in that sense are bigger issues, but these sort of things matter as well given that they target minorities.","title":"Trans rights to be marquee fight for House Republicans"},{"text":"The party of openly encouraging terrorism has things to say.","title":"Republican Senator Makes Left-Wing Joke About NBC During Terror Attack New Conference"},{"text":"Yup.

They are all into their 30s and 40s, therefore past their military prime, and the following generations are so meager, the Chinese army will run out of soldiers before they could even make it past the largest Naval force in the world. The third largest and most capable deep water navy is their neighbor, enemy, and our ally, Japan. \\nIn order for China to defeat the US in open war, they would first need to cross the pacific, against the US Navy and Airforce, then breach our shores following combat with the US Coastguard and the USMC. Followed by the US Army and National Guard, let alone the Gravy Seals, Antifa, and even organized crime groups. \\nThey could be successful if they divided the population by infiltration of social media, used propaganda to further the divide and cause civil unrest to the point of civil war. Then they could possibly create such disorder that the US may need to allocate National Guard and Coastguard personnel for domestic issues, but they still have everything else to contend with. \\nAs for the links regarding Chinas PLAN from AEI, you should look at the board of directors of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, known simply as the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). It will explain a lot about their war mongering claims. Just follow the money. \\nThe Chinese Navy may have more ships, but the vast majority are shallow water vessels, not massive deep sea military vessels like 80% of the US Navy.\\nGeopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan covers the China situation extensively in his writing. Heres an excerpt and link to his website. [Chinas got the first island chain, and any vessel that leaves China has to get by Japan or Taiwan or the Philippines or Indonesia or Singapore. Assuming the United States isnt playing at all, thats going to be really hard. And one of the things that the U.S. Navy is working on right now is something called the Replicator Initiative, which will turn its ships into not just combat platforms, but manufacturing platforms to produce exactly the sorts of drones that would be needed to sink everything that the Chinese have in a short period of time.  In the case of a war. Hopefully itll never come to that, but Replicator is supposed to be operational by the end of calendar year 2027. Thats not that far away.](https://zeihan.com/the-future-of-naval-tech-war-on-the-seas/)\\nPeter also points out the fact that Russia is on the verge of a population collapse, like China and will likely experience a civilizational collapse in the next twenty years.

This analysis is incorrect because that model is flawed, and the players in this theoretical contest *do not* match up as you're asserting.First, there are a multitude of flaws and counterarguments to the material analysis - I can dig up just as many quotes suggesting that China is not catching up militarily. But there's also two structural reasons that the China = WWII USA and USA = WWII Germany parallels are absurd. On the one hand, Chinese manufacturing and demographics are relatively inferior to American manufacturing and demographics at the time of the war. In WWII, American manufacturing couldn't be affected by enemy attacks, the American economy (by GDP) was 90% of the entire Axis powers *on its own*, and America had a relatively youthful workforce. Chinese manufacturing is easily within range of American weapons, the Chinese GDP isn't even as large as the American GDP, let alone including US allies, and China is suffering a relative demographic crunch, due to the One-Child Policy.On the other hand, the Nazis simply *didn't* have the best tanks or planes or anything, really, at the opening of the war. They had superior tactics - which the USA might, also, as its military apparatus has been more sophisticated, for longer - but the myth of Nazi technological superiority has been post-facto generated to, among other things, explain the rational for operation paper clip. If the Germans actually had RADAR and the T-34, they might've been able to knock out either Russia or Britain. As it was, British RADAR allowed the RAF to massacre the Luftwaffe in the *Battle of Britain*, and German-made tanks probably only had the edge from the Fall of France to the introduction of the T-34, if we're being generous. Obviously, we cannot know the extent of the USA technological edge in secret military hardware, but it's highly unlikely that the USA and its allies are *actually behind* China in the Air War, e.g.But even if you disagree with that, the second point dispenses with such minutia. WWII is a *bad* proxy for a conflict over Taiwan, because a conflict over Taiwan is more likely to be a limited war, where a full war economy doesn't even come into play. That's because, since WWII, the intercontinental ballistic missile has been invented.   \\n  \\nDuring the Cold War, the US and the Soviets avoided actually engaging in large scale warfare even during the Korean War. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan is far more likely to look like some new kind of limited theater, blitzkrieg-style, undeclared martial action than a true global war. Now, China might win that kind of war! If it can surprise American defenses, and get control over the Taiwanese state apparatus without needing to get a hundred thousand soliders landing through a fully prepared American carrier group, the US might negotiate some face-saving settlement. But China knows it can't risk a protracted war that threatens America's status as a superpower, the same way the US knows it can't drop a Tomahawk missile on the Chinese Premier the day hostilities open. Avoiding nuclear war is more important than annexing territory, which is why essentially no one starts a war that obligates a nuclear-capable nation to bring its full weight to bear.So, we shouldn't be analyzing who would win an Iran-Iraq style total war between the US and China - we should be analyzing if either side will believe it can win a limited war before the opponent believes its status is at stake. Maybe the Chinese could conquer Taiwan under that analysis, and maybe that means they'll try to. But without doing that analysis, it's foolhardy to hold the view stated in the title.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"What happened with her?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"I think we're in the RPM timeline. where an AI computer virus infects the worlds computer systems and takes over the world. and makes a robotic army. and kills 90% of humanityThat sounds more accurate to our current situation","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"It's explicit","title":"Trump wants to end birthright citizenship.

The British sent two of the capital ships to intimidate the Japanese and they were sunk by a couple of planes (sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse).  A 100 million dollar ship loses to a few million dollar airplanes.  From then on, the sea was ruled by aircraft carriers not by battle ships.You are worried about China's ability to manufacture ships, and by 20th century rules that makes sense.  But in world war 2 they only have very inaccurate V1 and V2 missals.  What good is a ship, even an aircraft carrier, when it can be destroyed by a missile that costs 1/1000th the price of the ship?A LRASM (long range anti ship missel) costs about 4 million dollars.  An aircraft carrier costs 4 billion dollars, that is a difference of about 4 billion dollars. No major world powers have gone to war with each other in nearly 100 years, so its anybody's guess what a major war would look like, especially because a lot of the relevant capabilities are classified.  But I think we'd discover pretty quickly that missile technology (including ability to survey targets using satellites) along with firing first would be just about all that matters.  One side very likely loses all of their capital ships in the first hour, and the other side wins.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"I dreaded seeing that.

Early 1940s US came out of a crippling economy from the Great Depression, and then not only recovered itself, but also managed to have a war-based economy as well in time to actively take part in Europe. As for the technological advancements in the military, yes it is impressive, but who knows what both countries are packing that the public doesn't know about. Also that one time that nuclear submarine sank immediately really put a bad image to the military system.Speaking of which, the rampant corruption and mismanagement in the Chinese inner workings can definitely get China shot in the foot. All I'm saying is, this may result to an \\"all bark, no bite\\" kind of situation.And last but certainly not least, the \\"Why We Fight\\" debate. China and its people, in its ideological core, it's mentally prepared to fight the West through propaganda and perhaps even the use of history.

For instance, years ago there was a segment on Tucker Carlson where he spoke about how 'the left,' was trying to ban the word 'man.'  The entire point of this segment was to take some outrageous talking point and attribute it as being a mainstream left-wing policy/ideology/movement.  Doing so would make the left look crazy while making the right look like the party of common sense and sanity.The source that Carlson had for this allegation was that Purdue University's English/Writing department published a writing guide for their students that suggested ways in which a writer could/should use gender neutral titles for certain characters.  For instance, using mailperson or mail carrier instead of mailman.  Of course, this was not pushing/forcing people not to use the word man, but was just a suggestion on how to be more gender neutral with titles in writing.  It was certainly not some sort of mainstream ideology or policy push.  Just a suggestion for a relatively small group of people.  Yet, Carlson painted it as being a mainstream left-wing policy.He mocked the writing guide for being so crazy and trying to 'ban the word man.'  Then he brought on a guest who was allegedly a liberal.  She defended the suggestion not in the way I have, as it really being Tucker who was being absurd, but by confirming his take.  By saying they should stop using the word man and even changing the name of Manhattan.  Of course, this was all designed to tell a story.  That story being that the left is/was crazy and that you cannot possibly vote for that level of crazy while the right is the party of common sense and reason and no matter how bad their candidate is... at least he's not crazy like those on the left.Of course, a ton of Fox News viewers ate this type of coverage up and will still believe that the most outlandish things are mainstream left policies when it is quite often just the right making it up.Video of segment:[https://youtu.be/nZ0GH6qB0gs](https://youtu.be/nZ0GH6qB0gs)","title":"Trans rights to be marquee fight for House Republicans"},{"text":"Yeah.

Racism against Indians has always existed and has been prevalent and continues to get little pushback because oddly enough, Indians aren't the first thing that comes to mind when we picture a minority that we absolutely should not joke about because of power imbalances (like making classless jokes about Black People or Native Americans). When Americans think of Indian-Americans, they often picture something a bit closer to the Model Minority of like Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese people all doing extremely well in U.S.A as well as being more willing to assimilate into American society and not do crimes. So Indian Racism doesn't get pushback like people would get for being racist to Black people because on a similar but also different level, Indian Racism is like racism against White people. We're kind of in power, we kind of have to expect that people ain't going to like us and may make unsavory accusations and jokes against us. Jokes about Indian people doesn't usually feel like it's punching down because the perception is that Indians, on average, do extremely well in America and so they've got power and influence.

China is already at war with America, while America is not at war with China. Their population isn't as big of an advantage as many think. They don't have the capacity to mobilize that population or deploy it beyond their shores. Also, they don't have that high of moral, with movements like the Lie Flat and the Let It Rot movements. They also have a lot of issues with corruption due to the authoritian nature of their government. This creates pressure on lower levels to inflate numbers and cut corners. Additionally, their army is large, but it has no experience and has never fought a modern conflict. This, combined with the corruption, suggests their officer corp will be less effective than it could be due to political appointments. Finally, their industrial production is greater than ours, but its less advanced. They can't produce the next generation technologies at the same scale we can.America has a lot of advantages in that fight, and the training and experience to make the most of them.

Not going to debate you on semantics here, gods = alternate beings.  In regards to Genesis 1:3-5 describing God creating light and separating it from darkness on the first day and Genesis 1:14-19 mentions the creation of the sun, moon, and stars on the fourth day.\\nThere are many who believe that the light created on the first day was a different form of light, possibly Gods own glory or an initial illumination a sort of force( the force of light and dark), which existed before the physical celestial bodies were created. This suggests that the concept of \\"light\\" can transcend our current understanding of it being solely derived from physical sources as the sun, moon and such which would be more celestial bodies assigned to said light and dark.\\nAgain there is no certainty in regards to all of this since we're speaking of God's work, but to say that it's a discrepancy is plain wrong and ignorant.As for the days just to further promote the point that not everything known is a 1:1 with the Bible and its concepts of how God works.The Hebrew word for \\"day\\" (yom) can refer to a 24-hour period or a longer, unspecified time. As mentioned in 2 Peter 3:8, But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. it indicates that the creation days may not correspond directly to our modern 24-hour days but could represent longer epochs which does not translate to your previously mentioned 5000 years of age for the earth.Getting to Noahs instructions, Genesis 6:19-20 does instruct him to bring two of every living thing into the ark and in Genesis 7:2-3 specifies that he is to take clean animals by sevens and unclean animals by twos as you've mentioned. Without context and cultural knowledge this may come off as a discrepancy, but it can be easily understood that the instruction in Genesis 6 refers to the basic number of species to preserve life, while the ones in Genesis 7 elaborates the specific instructions for the types of animals needed for sacrificial purposes and dietary laws that is to be established later in Leviticus.  Again, context, you can't isolate the Bible.The texts can harmonize when considering the nature of time and the context of divine instructions if your heart is open to it. The differences in the creation narrative and Noah's instructions can be seen as complementary rather than contradictory when viewed through the lens of ancient literary styles and the nature of divine revelation.","title":"Seems like they are unleashing the stockpile of MK Ultra sleepers"},{"text":"Surely terrorists would not violate the law by  jumping the curb and driving on sidewalks.

China's cannot, they do not have nuclear powered ships as we do, or anything resembling our logistical ability and supply network.So China's navy cannot reach the strait of Malacca, and that is where their food and oil stops. So while the war would carry on, China would be starving for food and oil very quickly, and there is nothing they could do about it.As to the war itself, please read on the first, second and third island chains, a series of island bases and allies the US has built over five decades plus to contain China.So the USA would have carrier battlegroups outside of this chain hitting coastal targets, where the bulk of Chinese manufacture is, and there isn't much China could do about it, because if they send their navy out, it dies, so in wargames their navy is predicted to stay close to the coast.China's missile forces? You might have missed the news that some of China's rocket forces have been filled with water instead of fuel, compromising all of it as the leader of that branch was fired, and they have to verify the condition of all.

Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand are all strong US allies and at least 3 of those are strong regional powers in their own right. China has no allies that are willing to tangle with the US except Russia and north korea and Russia has been shown to be nothing but a paper tiger and north Korea can barely keep.itself together.Now, moving to manufacturing capacity, the US could ramp up production pretty quickly if push came to shove. Currently, there is no need or interest in doing so, but the massive advantages that lead to US dominance still exist even if they have been largely squandered in the last 50 years. Current factories can be scaled up and the knowledge on how to do so exists and is available to the US.We also don't truly know about the US tech lead. There are rumours that the US has been testing 6th gen planes for some time in secret. China can barely compete with current 5th gen planes and although they are catching up are still over a decade away from doing so. The main problem with China is that it cannot project power.

China cant realistically invade the USA, nor can the USA invade China. If China throws its full weight into invading Taiwan, which is on its own doorstep - yeah theyll probably capture it eventually, although the costs are unlikely to be justified by the gains. But yes theyll conquer it. Andwhat then?If you are expecting the US Navy to be destroyed by such a fight, you arent predicting *how* the US would fight in such a conflict. Parking a carrier fleet on Taiwans shores might result in losing it, but theres no reason for the US Navy to do that. The tactical advantage of a Carrier has always been that it can participate in a fight from many miles away, and Chinas ability to destroy a carrier fleet in the middle of the Pacific is much more questionable than their ability to destroy one in the Taiwan Strait.The current Chinese fleet is designed to project power in a relatively small area around China. They arent really capable of attacking, say, Hawaii. Maybe they follow up the attack on Taiwan with an attack on South Korea? Now you can start to wargame some interesting scenarios, but one of the first results from this scenario is a blockade of Chinese shipping. And while China does have a massive manufacturing base right now, they are also very vulnerable to a blockade. Which is also part of why they want to conquer Taiwan, as that eventually lets them establish more secure shipping lanes.Ultimately the scenarios required for them to conquer anything beyond Taiwan probably arent thereyet. This might change in another decade. It also might not. Long term predictions get very fuzzy, and China is facing one of the more pressing demographic crises among major powers, so that has to be factored in as well.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"They blame the late term restrictions.

If victory means \\"expulsion of US interests in the South Pacific\\", then China have a solid chance at winning. Ignoring of course, the nuclear weapons. The issue with this analysis is that China, just like Russia, have a doubtful quality of military. I heard last year reports of Chinese corruption throughout the entire military, so it's unknown whether China has the arsenal for a long term war. Furthermore, though China has great manufacturing, it's current economic situation isn't great: deflation everywhere, falling population... It seems hardly a good spot to start a war against the US. Also, the US is well known for its ultra nationalistic racist response to foreign enemies. Any attack on US soil will transform the right into a nest of war hawks and the pressure on the establishment pro corporate left will create the consensus necessary to wage war. In conclusion, a third world war will in no way be similar to what the last two wars were like. The presence of nukes will make this a mass proxy war, a war of information and of foreign manipulation. And yes, it's true that China seems in a better position to win if the war is quick (China's economy is extremely dependant on exports and it's economy is shrinking), but this war will be different.

They are 100% the ones behind it all and suddenly global events and politics make complete sense when you research with that fact in mind.  Most or all of the elite today are Jesuit educated (and there are only like 27 Jesuit out of thousands of colleges/universities in the USA).This society has always been up to no good, they were behind the gunpowder plot in the 1600s to overthrow the government by literally blowing up UK Parliament. There are many more events like this around the world in history that they were held responsible for.In 1773 due to their worldwide shenanigans they were suppressed by the church and Catherine the Great preserved them, hiding them in secret masonic lodges then in 1776 the Illuminati formed.  132 days later the United States was officially declared.  They also practise kabbalah, due to the scottish rite of freemasonry being the secret society they adopted some of their practises during their suppression, of which numerology and gematria is included which I want to spread the word about.Today they broadcast this all over the world because of technology being lead by the likes of Bill Gates in the early days who is a Jesuit Puppet (look up Melinda Gates family) they have set it up exactly how they need to carry out their religious rituals for the entire world to see.  \\"William Henry Gates\\" = 201 like the founder of the Jesuits, \\"Ignatius of Loyola\\", and like the current (and first ever) Jesuit Pope, \\"Jorge Mario Bergoglio\\" all equal 201 by this code, proof to the theory that many or all celebrities/elites are born into these roles.  This Pope has just made [Suite 201](https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/pope-francis-live-vatican-guesthouse-not-papal-apartments) his new home in the Vatican, the building's name is \\"Domus Sanctae Marthae\\" which equates to 201.  For the record the founder of the Jesuits \\"Ignatius of Loyola\\" = 201.201 is important to them because the jesuit order were suppressed to 201 Priests during their suppression.

Vatican = 119.  The rabbit hole only gets deeper from here so if you read this with an open mind, you'll see it can only be a so called coincidence so many times before it becomes a pattern.

(I'm not the type to do something like that though)","title":"Trump and MAGA Are Desperately Trying to Pin New Orleans Attack on the Border"},{"text":"Their entire position relies on a few fallacies. The first is that when life begins is relevant to the conversation. The second is that abortion is murder.For the first to be important, life *across the board* would need to be sacred. That would mean no death penalty, actively taking any measure necessary to stop murders, universal healthcare so people were not dying from preventable causes, military deployments ceased, environmental pollution and contamination aggressively mitigated because of the effect on humans, etc. As you know, most supposed pro-life people have no interest in that, nor is it ever a part of their larger conversation. The second, that abortion is murder, is also patently false. In fact, all of the \\"fetal personhood\\" bills are nothing more than playing to their bases because *fetuses already have the same rights as a born baby.* Specifically, they have the right to life **provided they don't need to requisition someone else's unwilling body to live.**  Imagine for a moment that you found out today that you're a perfect kidney match for someone. It was a fluke that this was discovered -- you didn't sign up to be a donor, but a mixup in blood work led yours to being tested. How do you feel? Excited to be able to help? Not wanting to go through a major surgery and recovery and feeling guilty about saying no? Maybe you have a medical condition that could put your life at risk if you go through with donation. Regardless of how you feel, you recognize that it's ultimately your choice about whether to donate your kidney.Now imagine that you're told you don't have a choice; you're suddenly not allowed to leave the hospital. If you try to leave, you will be charged with murder. Well-meaning volunteers bring you books and food and tell you you're doing the right thing, but you're still being held against your will. You're restrained and forced to go through the surgery to have your organ removed. You need to take a medication for years as your body adapts to a single kidney, and it's going to cost over $200,000. It's not covered by insurance because, despite being forced to have the surgery, insurance considers it an elective, non-necessary procedure.The recovery time from the surgery and organ removal lasts months. Maybe you're lucky enough to have a job where you can work remotely, but maybe not. Maybe your inability to physically do the labor means you're now unemployed. Sorry about that. You probably should have considered it before you signed up to be an organ donor. What, you didn't sign up? Well, you should have known this sort of accident was a possibility.This would be patently unfair. You would feel outraged and trapped and helpless whether it was happening to you or even just knowing it was happening to someone else.Now, a kidney isn't a baby, but neither is a fetus. To be frank, it wouldn't matter if it was a baby. Nobody has the right to use someone else's body without their permission, even if it would save their life. That's why we can't just force people to give blood when the blood banks are low. It's why we can't take organs from a dead person unless they agreed to be an organ donor while alive. That's also why it's a crime to desecrate a corpse. Bodily autonomy is an involitable basic human right that we base our laws on: unless you committed an egregious crime, you determine what happens with your body. By forcing women to use their bodies to support another's, we violate that right. Again, you can try to convince her she should -- you could offer financial and moral support, provide religious justification, etc., You can bang on tables and yell that she's going to hell, you can offer to adopt the baby, but you have to understand that you can't justify jailing someone to stop it without gutting huge swaths of the legal system. Outlawing abortion reduces women to second-class citizens with fewer rights than men simply by virtue of having a uterus and exercising control over their own body: her bodily autonomy (again, a recognized human right) is conditional, whereas a man's never is. With abortion rights being struck down you can expect further erosion of freedom -- women being restricted from doing things like buying alcohol, criminalization of miscarriages (already happening), bans on birth control (already in the works) and unequal access to lifesaving medication because it could potentially harm a fetus if she were to get pregnant (again, already happening nationwide). This not only won't stop abortions (places that enact strict abortion restrictions actually see a [12% increase in the rate of abortions](https://www.cfr.org/article/abortion-law-global-comparisons)), it opens the door to things like forced blood or organ donation \\"to save a life.\\" And just so we're clear, I have no interest in changing anyone's mind on whether abortion is moral -- that's between them and whatever belief system they have. I'm only arguing that it must be legal.","title":"Newborns are being left in dumpsters in Texas, but Republicans don't seem to care"},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 2:  **Don't be rude or hostile to other users.** Your comment will be removed even if most of it is solid, another user was rude to you first, or you feel your remark was justified.
