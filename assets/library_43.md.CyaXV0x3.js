Some restaurants automatically report a percentage of sales to the government rather than asking servers to self report. Many of these same restaurants also require servers to tip out a percentage to the rest of the staff. Which means they are paying the taxes for everyone else they tip out and perhaps more if they made less than the reported average. With all that being said, very few people pay with cash since the pandemic. I would say the cash sales at the restaurant I worked at were reduced to about 10 percent of what it was before.

What do we do after they are all uneployed all at once?","title":"Trump Can Fire 2.9 Million Federal Workers"},{"text":"Servers rely heavily on tips, which are technically part of their income, just like a dishwashers hourly wage. The argument for not taxing tips often stems from the perception that tips are a bonus or a courtesy, rather than formal income. But that doesnt hold uptips are part of their earnings, just as a dishwashers paycheck is. If the goal is fairness, all income, regardless of its source, should be treated equally.The counterargument is that servers earn a much lower hourly base wage (often below minimum wage in tipped industries) and tips make up the majority of their income. Advocates for tax-free tips suggest that taxing tips unfairly burdens servers, who might already be underpaid. However, this ignores the fact that many servers, particularly in busy establishments, can earn more in total (wages + tips) than their non-tipped counterparts, like dishwashers or line cooks, who receive a flat hourly wage and no bonuses. Allowing tax-free tips could create a system where higher-earning servers pay less in taxes than lower-earning back-of-house workersa clear inequity.Instead of exempting tips from taxation, a better solution might be reforming the tipped minimum wage system entirely. If all workers were paid a livable base wage, tips could be treated as what they are: additional income, taxable like any other. That way, the dishwasher and the server are on an even playing field, and fairness in taxation is preserved.","title":"CMV: Servers should pay taxes like everybody else"},{"text":"Moral Orel type beat.","title":"Trump picks Brendan Carr, a Project 2025 co-author, to lead FCC"},{"text":"They have to go back","title":"Texas GOP Representative Tony Gonzales is speaking out against President Trump's mass deportation plans.

This is not the Islamic POV, which gives different rights to men vs. women (much like other religions) as it recognizes that men and women are equal in value but not equal in all else and therefore there is a need for equity between the two genders, not equality. So youre missing a lot of nuance.\\"**This is the intellectual equivalent of tossing sand in the air and pretending it's an argument. The Eurocentric red herring. Your immediate pivot to \\"Eurocentrism\\" is a weak attempt at deflection, not a valid critique. Universal human rights are not \\"Eurocentric\\"  they are precisely that: universal. Saudi Arabia is a signatory to international treaties such as the *Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women* (CEDAW). It claims to endorse these universal standards but flagrantly violates them. Is the Saudi government \\"Eurocentric\\" for signing onto these agreements? Or do they simply enjoy the diplomatic benefits of pretending to care about human rights while preserving oppressive practices at home?\\"Equal in value, but not equal in all else\\". This is the verbal equivalent of dressing a dictator in a tuxedo. The phrase \\"equal in value\\" is hollow when the systemic reality is that women are subordinate to men in almost every aspect of Saudi life. A woman cannot marry, travel, or even make basic decisions without male approval under the male guardianship system. If they are \\"equal in value,\\" why is their autonomy erased? Equality without agency is meaningless  its benevolent patriarchy, which is still patriarchy.Equity vs. equality is a false dichotomy. Equity requires assessing individual needs and circumstances to ensure fairness. Saudi Arabia's blanket oppression of women does not remotely fit this definition. Are you honestly arguing that a system where 50% of the population needs \\"permission\\" to exist independently is equitable? By this logic, apartheid was equitable because it \\"recognized differences\\" between races. If the concept of equity is just a euphemism for control, then youre not arguing equity  youre rationalizing systemic subjugation.If men and women are \\"equal in value,\\" why does the law enforce a system that inherently prioritizes male authority over female autonomy? Can you point to a single law in Saudi Arabia that gives women authority over men?--- **\\"The things you have a problem with, many conservative Muslim women dont. You think they have been brainwashed into 'oppression,' and they feel the exact way about Western women and their 'freedoms.' In fact, I personally know many conservative Muslim women who are not happy with the 'progressive' changes happening in Saudi Arabia.\\"**Anecdotes are not arguments. Your claim crumbles under scrutiny. Happiness under oppression reflects conditioning, not consent. Your argument rests on the idea that \\"many women dont have a problem with it.\\" Of course, they dont  decades of social conditioning have normalized their oppression. This is classic learned helplessness, a well-documented psychological phenomenon where individuals adapt to their conditions because fighting back seems futile. A battered woman who defends her abuser isnt evidence of a loving relationship; shes evidence of trauma. Are you truly arguing that centuries of indoctrination invalidate human rights abuses?The Stockholm Syndrome of Saudi women. When youre systematically told from birth that your worth is tied to obedience and subservience, you internalize those values. Women in Saudi Arabia have been raised to see their oppression as divine, making dissent a moral betrayal rather than an exercise of agency. This is not agreement  its survival.Western \\"freedoms\\" are not a mirror image of Saudi control. The idea that Western women are \\"slaves to corporate desires\\" is laughable when compared to the stark reality of Saudi women who require permission to travel, marry, or even seek medical care. Freedom isnt about perfection; its about agency. Western women have the option to reject corporate culture. Saudi women dont have the option to reject their guardians. Your attempt to conflate these vastly different realities is intellectually dishonest.If the happiness of oppressed individuals validates their oppression, does that mean enslaved Africans who sang spirituals in the fields validated slavery? Or do you acknowledge that resilience under duress is not an endorsement of the system causing the duress?--- **\\"As a woman who lived in conservative Saudi Arabia, I can definitely say its a much safer place for a woman: physically, spiritually, and mentally. I would argue that gender segregation and male guardianship certainly contribute to that because it is a mans responsibility to protect women.\\"**This argument collapses under the weight of its own contradictions. Safety through oppression is a gilded cage. You argue that Saudi Arabia is safer for women, but safety that comes at the expense of freedom is not safety  its captivity. Saudi women are \\"safe\\" because they are surveilled, restricted, and isolated. Its the same logic as saying a caged bird is safe because it cant fly into a storm. True safety is freedom from harm *and* freedom to make choices. Saudi Arabia fails on both counts.Domestic violence statistics expose the myth. Contrary to your claim, Saudi women are not \\"safer\\" within this system. Up to 50% of Saudi women experience domestic violence, and abuse was not even criminalized until 2013. Even now, enforcement is weak, and many women cannot escape abusive homes because their male guardians control their legal and financial lives. How is this safety?Globally, gender equality produces safety. Countries like Iceland and Norway, which rank highest in gender equality, also rank among the safest for women. By contrast, Saudi Arabias segregationist policies perpetuate gender-based violence by normalizing male control and female subservience. If segregation and male guardianship were effective, why do more equitable societies achieve better safety outcomes without these measures?If Saudi women are \\"safe\\" under male guardianship, why do thousands risk their lives every year trying to escape this \\"protection\\"? Would a truly safe system inspire such desperation to flee?--- **\\"People are happier, less stressed, less perverted, and community/family-oriented. I am willing to bet that holistically women are much happier in Saudi Arabia as compared to women in Western countries where they slave away to corporate desires.\\"**This is a textbook false equivalence. The myth of holistic happiness. Youre conflating surface-level contentment with genuine well-being. Saudi women may express happiness because theyve normalized their conditions, not because those conditions are just. By your logic, a prisoner in solitary confinement who finds peace through meditation is evidence that imprisonment is ideal.Freedom isnt stress-free, but its meaningful. Yes, freedom comes with challenges, but the existence of choice makes those challenges meaningful. Western women can choose to work, stay home, or pursue careers, while Saudi womens choices are dictated by male guardians. Comparing these realities is like comparing a marathon to a treadmill  one is effortful but self-directed; the other goes nowhere.Objective metrics refute your claim. The World Economic Forum ranks Saudi Arabia 127th in the Global Gender Gap Report (2022), far below Western countries. Women in Saudi Arabia participate in the workforce at only 33.2%. How does denying women economic independence and agency contribute to their happiness?If Saudi Arabia is such a haven of happiness, why does it consistently rank among the worst in global gender equity metrics, and why do so many women risk imprisonment and death to leave?---Your defense of Saudi Arabias systemic oppression of women is a house of cards built on anecdotes, fallacies, and romanticized lies. Every point youve raised crumbles under the weight of logic, data, and moral clarity. You cannot mask a system of control over women with the language of protection. You cannot defend a gilded cage for women by calling it a palace.If the Saudi system is so equitable for women, why does it require coercion, surveillance, and punishment to keep them compliant?

The point here being that wages paid by the employer should be perfectly qualified as taxable income.\\n2. tips by their nature are a gift. from a patron of any given establishment to a service worker. Given from that patron's own funds which by all measures should have already been taxed. Further a gift from one person to another should fall under such tax law; as such gifts given are not reportable until (currently) $18,000 per person per year. so unless the patron has gifted in excess of $18,000 that year no taxes should need to be filed. and if the patron has exceeded $18,000 it then is the responsibility of the Patron to properly record and file those taxes, not the service worker being tipped.This is of course completely apart form the \\"tipping industry\\" that allows so many to be underpaid in the first place. and my opinion that tipped jobs should simply go away.","title":"CMV: Servers should pay taxes like everybody else"},{"text":"Fuck X.","title":"Trump's Team Calls 60 Minutes 'Unhinged' After Opening Monologue Goes Viral"},{"text":"People against tipping often rely on magical thinking.

So youre missing a lot of nuance.The things you have a problem with, many conservative Muslim women dont. You think they have been brainwashed into oppression and the feel the exact way about western women and their freedoms. In fact, I personally know many conservative Muslim women who are not happy with the progressive changes happening in Saudi Arabia as they believe that its a sway towards liberalization which means that western societal issues (high divorce rate, poor mental health, broken families, substance use, low birth rate) are soon going to pour in their country.As a woman who lived in conservative Saudi Arabia, I can definitely say its a much safer place for a woman: physically, spiritually and mentally. I would argue that gender segregation and make guardianship certainly contributes to that because it is a mans responsibility to protect women. People are happier, less stressed, less perverted and community/family oriented. I am willing to bet that holistically women are much happier in Saudi Arabia as compared to women in western countries where they slave away to corporate desires.

By your logic, should all academic contributions made by non-Westerners educated in Western systems be dismissed outright?Who's dismissing anyone's contributions? You're shifting the goal posts. Your claim was that the document is not based on Western presuppositions because there were non-westerners who helped compile it. My counter is that although all 3 aren't native to the West, all three of them were educated in the West. My point: people educated in the West will have a West leaning outlook, especially Malik, who spent his entire youth in Western education, even when he was in Lebanon, he was attending Western schools there. implying that ones education nullifies their cultural insights, which is not only absurd but also reeks of colonialist undertonesNothing has been said about nullifying. However, it does color their cultural insights. Here's an example. An evangelical Christian, a Jehovah's witness, a Catholic, and an Orthodox Christian can all read the same Bible verse and take different meanings from it because their views are colored and shaped by their theological upbringing. The same will happen for people who study Western philosophy in Western liberal circles vs those that don't. This isn't an invalidation; it is a contextualization. If a global collaboration isnt valid simply because some participants were educated in Western institutions, what framework would you propose to determine legitimacy? Or is this just a desperate grasp to undermine an inconvenient truth?If all the participants were educated under one system of philosophical framework, then it's most definitely not a universal document. There is no legitimacy to the document beyond which humans decide to agree to it. Not every culture/society agrees with it because it is inherently a Western liberal, humanist document. If abstention signifies a lack of universality, does that mean nations abstaining from treaties like the Paris Agreement invalidate climate science?For the most part yes, or they disagree with a conclusion from the agreement or what that conclusion means that their country must do. This isn't some gotcha. Additionally, scientific data and philosophical abstractions are hardly the same thing. If the document is inherently Western and incompatible with their values, why does Saudi Arabia consistently reference these rights in diplomatic contexts?To discredit the West by showing its inherent hypocrisy. It's not that hard. The Soviets did it all the time. Trump regularly does this to his opponents. To argue that morality is universal while excusing actions that blatantly violate universal principles is a logical contradiction.What is morality? Cultures have \\"morality\\" is universal.

Here's a concise summary:Structure &amp; Background:\\n- The FCC is an independent regulatory agency overseeing interstate/international communications\\n- Led by 5 commissioners appointed by the President, with no more than 3 from the same political party\\n- Budget of approximately $390.2 million (FY2023), offset by regulatory fees\\n- Has authority over radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable communicationsFour Main Policy Priorities:1 Reining in Big Tech:- Reform Section 230 to limit immunities- Impose transparency rules on tech platforms- Require Big Tech to contribute to Universal Service Fund- Empower consumer choice in content moderation2 Protecting National Security:- Address TikTok security concerns- Expand the \\"Covered List\\" of risky communications equipment- Counter Chinese influence in telecommunications- Strengthen measures against foreign adversaries3 Unleashing Economic Prosperity:- Improve spectrum allocation for 5G networks- Modernize infrastructure rules- Streamline permitting processes- Advance U.S. space/satellite leadership4 Ensuring Accountability:- Prevent wasteful broadband spending- Coordinate national broadband strategy- Improve regulatory efficiency- Encourage market competitionThe document emphasizes the need for market-oriented reforms while maintaining necessary oversight of communications infrastructure and security.?","title":"Trump appoints a Project 2025 author the the chair of the FCC"},{"text":"So if I may posit a theory, just a theory of course since what I am about to propose could never be said out loud (yet) by these people but it tracks with their behavior in the past, specifically towards current prison populations:They know the impact deporting/removing illegals would have on many economic sectors. Primary concerns to the average person likely being farming and construction, though I am sure the impacts will be felt elsewhere.Now, knowing there will be a negative economic impact, plus the high base cost of moving/feeding/housing this many people (we haven't hit the gas them portion yet, and without a war breaking out likely won't so human rights even if just barely are still somewhat in the cards currently for these concentration camps that will need to be setup for this operation to have a chance at doing what they say it will), they are likely banking on being able to use these people as **slave labor** while they are being held, likely without release to be honest, as a way of recouping the cost of capturing and holding them. Utilized as such, the Trump team is banking on this being able to minimize losses to economic value from this policy in order to combat the inevitable inflation which removing this much workforce would cause, especially in combination with their planned tariffs. While horrific, it would be the only sensible way these people could see to utilize these people who they otherwise consider to be subhuman trash. As someone who works in construction, prisons already have deals worked out with temp labor companies to utilize (often unwilling) prisoners as temporary laborers which my company at least doesn't condone or use to my knowledge, but which other large companies do when the price of labor gets too high. Imagine if this round-up happens, it will occur much more frequently.Its vile, its horrific, its exactly what a certain group which has been getting name-dropped extremely frequently recently for good reason did with \\"undesirables\\", and all signs point to this being the extremely stupid way Trump and co think they can turn a profit from this situation without damaging the economy too much to satisfy their racist tendencies. Would also help explain the de-naturalization talk that has started up (granted that was an inevitable endpoint here, but the quickness is astonishing) as they know they need the widest, again **slave**, labor pool.","title":"Trumps immigration crackdown is expected to start on Day 1"},{"text":"Next time they complain about \\"muh dei hires\\" just remember all these unqualified white people Trump is trying to appoint","title":"Trump's Team Calls 60 Minutes 'Unhinged' After Opening Monologue Goes Viral"},{"text":"Dear Vice President Harris,  We write to alert you to serious election security breaches that have threatened the security and integrity...https://freespeechforpeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/letter-to-vp-harris-111324.pdf","title":"Trump vote count drops below majority"},{"text":"you are hilarious. lol my profession is in demand. but you dont need me and i would not work with you.","title":"Trump Says Its TRUE He Will Declare National Emergency and Use Military to Mass Deport Millions"},{"text":"My guy is fuming because a Wikipedia article about his Cult Leader is factually correct.","title":"Go look at what they did to Trumps Wikipedia page and the Wikipedia page about this election"},{"text":"The courts clarification indicates that it assumes the plaintiffs allegations are accurate for the purpose of analysis.

Okay then, get fucked, stay fucked, go to the corner and hang your in silent shame you lazy half wit.   \\n  \\nOh, you're aggrieved people are lumping you in with a fascist? Pull the boot tip out of your mouth and stop rewarding people who tick literally every single box there is from the actual dictionary definition of the word. No one else made you deep throat boot leather, you happily dropped down on your knees and slobbered all over it from heel to the laces to tip to show your adoration for a group of people who have outright openly said, \\"We will be using the military to persecute our enemies\\" and \\"We will be waging war against immigrants\\" and \\"gays and trans deserve a good hangin'\\". You don't get to be offended when someone points out you're just as shitty as Nazi-in-Armani. Oh, you're carrying an actual Nazi flag or Proud Boys banner in public? Coolsies. The government can't punish you, but your employer is well within the rights to fire your ass and a landlord is well within his/her/their right for refusing to rent to you because they don't want to be seen catering to white supremacist domestic terrorists.  \\n  \\nStop crying about \\"religious persecution\\" because, to you, that means you can't force other people to bend the knee to your magic faery wizard space daddy. It's not about God, it's about you and how YOU think people should live. Stone the fuck up and stop hiding behind the shadow of the Cross you carry. Quit hiding behind the word of God to justify shitty beliefs like, \\"Women are supposed to be subservient to men\\" or \\"Gays and trans are an abomination in the eyes of the lord.\\" because, motherfuckers, you're speaking for your God and, the last time I checked, he kinda-sorta-really does have a huge problem with that. His son especially had a problem with that, which is why Mr \\"turn the other cheek\\" had zero hesitation or issue with whipping and belting \\"Men of God\\" right out the front doors of their temples for blasphemy. You're not godly, you're just too cowardly to outright tell those around you that you want to control their lives. \\"I'm a high T alpha!\\" No...you're just a bitch. A bitch that peacocks, but still a bitch. Firstly, no one brags about high T; that's like bragging, \\"Look at my red blood cell count brah!\\" No one gives a shit and having high anything in a homeostatic system is usually indicative of a health problem in people. Secondly, if you actually passed biology at any level in school, you'd realize that high T is inherently meaningless if you don't have enough receptors for any of it to bind to. Thirdly, the \\"alpha\\" thing is a myth. Full stop. It doesn't apply to wolves. It doesn't even apply to our closest cousins (Chimps and Bonobos). Lions are patriarchal but...you aren't a lion, which means that obviously doesn't apply to you. Fourthly, you're only ever \\"alpha\\" when encountering people you perceive as weaker or inferior to you. That's not being \\"alpha\\", that makes you a bully...and also a bitch.","title":"Trump Is Reportedly Considering Criminal Charges for Military Leaders Over Afghanistan Exit"},{"text":"There's a link in the article.","title":"Trump appoints a Project 2025 author the the chair of the FCC"},{"text":"Chaos.","title":"The real reason Trump picked a sex fiend, dog killer, and anti-vaxxer for his cabinet"},{"text":"I wonder if he can even read \\"See Spot Run\\".","title":"Trumps War With the Press Takes a Terrifying Turn - Donald Trump has nominated a Project 2025 author to lead the Federal Communications Commission."},{"text":"I really really hope she is asked about it during her confirmation hearings!","title":"Rep.

So this only works if both the house AND senate agree not to adjourn. McConnell has little sway over the house recently, so his threats of not going to recess shouldnt be taken too seriously.Hopefully that all makes sense.EDIT: just to clarify - McConnell isnt necessarily saying they WONT approve some of Trumps picks,  but basically saying hey man, we gotta do this the right way and get congressional approval.

All three of them went to Western universities. Malik, in particular, was educated under Western education throughout his whole life.\\"**This argument is reductionist and intellectually dishonest. The notion that exposure to Western education somehow invalidates a persons contributions to a global, multicultural document like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a blatant attempt to delegitimize their perspectives. By your logic, should all academic contributions made by non-Westerners educated in Western systems be dismissed outright? This is a rhetorical dead end, implying that ones education nullifies their cultural insights, which is not only absurd but also reeks of colonialist undertones. Malik, Mehta, and Chang were not mere parrots of Western thoughtthey were architects of a document that synthesized philosophical, cultural, and moral principles from every corner of the globe, integrating their own cultural traditions into the final draft.If a Western education inherently makes one incapable of contributing authentically to a universal framework, does this mean that figures educated outside the West are automatically more legitimate? Would you similarly dismiss the Western-educated elite who have built Saudi Arabias modern legal and economic systems? Or does this selective skepticism only apply when it serves your narrative?If a global collaboration isnt valid simply because some participants were educated in Western institutions, what framework would you propose to determine legitimacy? Or is this just a desperate grasp to undermine an inconvenient truth?--- **\\"Saudi Arabia abstained from voting for it on the grounds that it violated Islamic law. No country voted against it, so the abstentions should be seen as disapproval of at least parts of the document.\\"**Saudi Arabia abstained, but you fail to mention the glaring inconsistency: despite its abstention, Saudi Arabia did not mount a formal challenge to the principles of the UDHR. In fact, Saudi officials have frequently co-opted human rights language in international discourse, selectively invoking these principles when convenient. If the document is inherently Western and incompatible with their values, why does Saudi Arabia consistently reference these rights in diplomatic contexts? Their abstention was not a wholesale rejection of universal human rights but a strategic maneuver to shield specific practices from scrutinypractices that are increasingly untenable under modern moral frameworks.Abstention does not equate to substantive critique. By abstaining, Saudi Arabia tacitly acknowledged the UDHRs legitimacy while avoiding the political cost of outright rejection. If Saudi opposition to the UDHR were rooted in deeply held philosophical principles, why not openly reject it and present an alternative? The absence of such an alternative speaks volumes about the lack of credible, comprehensive justifications for their systemic oppression.If abstention signifies a lack of universality, does that mean nations abstaining from treaties like the Paris Agreement invalidate climate science? Or is your logic only applied when convenient?--- **\\"The post-WWII era was an era where 3rd world countries tried to adopt Western views...because the majority of them were in the nascent and required aid from America or the USSR.\\"**This is an oversimplification bordering on intellectual laziness. The post-WWII adoption of human rights principles wasnt merely a concession to Western powersit was a response to the atrocities of global imperialism, fascism, and colonial exploitation. These principles gained traction because they addressed the shared human desire for dignity, autonomy, and justicevalues that resonate across cultures, irrespective of geopolitical power dynamics.Your framing ignores the agency of non-Western nations in shaping post-war global norms. Countries emerging from colonial rule were not passive recipients of Western ideology; they actively contributed to defining human rights frameworks that would protect against the abuses they had endured. To reduce this complex history to a narrative of coerced adoption is to erase the voices of those who fought for universal principles on their own terms.If these principles were merely imposed by Western powers, why have they been embraced and adapted by nations long after the Cold War ended? Why do non-Western nations continue to uphold and invoke them today?--- **\\"These are literally modern Western concepts that did not exist for most of human history, and in many parts of the world still do not exist.\\"**This claim is both ahistorical and myopic. Concepts of equality, autonomy, and justice have appeared in various forms across countless cultures throughout history. Ancient Indian philosophy emphasized the moral equality of individuals through the idea of Dharma. African communalist traditions like Ubuntu underscore shared humanity and mutual respect. Even pre-modern Chinese philosophy, particularly Confucianism, upheld the value of human dignity and harmonious relationships. These principles are not monopolized by the West; they are manifestations of a universal human quest for fairness and respect.The fact that these principles were not universally implemented historically is irrelevant to their moral validity today. The global rejection of slavery, apartheid, and colonialism demonstrates that societies evolve toward greater recognition of universal human rights, even if past practices contradict them. Your argument that these ideas are Western merely because they gained prominence in modern discourse betrays an ignorance of their deeper, more diverse origins.If freedom and equality are exclusively Western concepts, how do you explain their presence in moral systems predating Western dominance? Or are you implying that no civilization outside the West has ever valued human dignity?--- **\\"What exactly is morality? Who defines it? Why have different cultures had vastly different laws regarding morality? Morality is universal; what constitutes morality is not.\\"**This is a textbook case of intellectual evasion. You acknowledge the universality of morality but attempt to relativize its application to excuse systemic abuses. Yes, cultures differ in their interpretations of morality, but this does not absolve oppressive systems from scrutiny. The universality of morality lies in its core principlesjustice, autonomy, and dignity. These principles transcend cultural boundaries even if their specific manifestations vary.To argue that morality is universal while excusing actions that blatantly violate universal principles is a logical contradiction. If cultural differences justify subjugation, where do you draw the line? By your logic, should we condone honor killings, caste discrimination, or forced labor as culturally valid? If not, why carve out exceptions for Saudi Arabia?If morality has universal foundations, what criteria would you use to reject practices like slavery or genocide without invoking those same foundations against other forms of oppression?--- **\\"I dont accept those things, but the question isnt about whether I accept them. The question is about whether they are universals, and theyre not.\\"**Your admission here undermines your entire argument. If you personally reject slavery, genocide, and systemic rape, you are implicitly appealing to universal moral principles. The fact that you grew up in a culture that condemns these practices does not negate their universalityit reinforces the idea that societies can and should evolve toward greater moral clarity.By your logic, the rejection of atrocities like genocide and slavery is merely a product of cultural conditioning. Yet, history shows that movements against these practices often arose from marginalized voices within oppressive systems, challenging cultural norms and advocating for universal principles. This underscores the inherent tension between cultural relativism and moral progress.If universals dont exist, how do you justify rejecting some atrocities while condemning others? Is your moral framework coherent, or is it merely a convenient way to avoid uncomfortable truths?---Your argument collapses under the weight of its contradictions. You simultaneously deny the universality of morality while relying on universal principles to distance yourself from barbaric practices. Cultural relativism, as you wield it, is not a shield for diversityits a smokescreen for oppression.If morality isnt universal, what stops you from condoning every atrocity justified by culture? And if you reject some atrocities but not others, what objective framework supports your distinctions? If none, does your argument not lead to moral nihilism, leaving you complicit in enabling oppression?","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"sellouts","title":"Morning Joe Scarborough, Brzezinski say they traveled to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump"},{"text":"Hahaha lmao just as bad as Joe Biden authorizing the use of long and wide range missiles therefore successfully killing thousands of innocent civilians due to the range of the missiles and starting ww3 at the same time?

The House still has only a slim majority so hopefully its as dysfunctional as the last 2 years and basically is the Freedom Caucus fighting with the moderate Republicans with Democrats only helping to pass things needed to run the government like the budget. Senate wise Thune might be of help (more than Rick Scott for sure anyways) and as far as Im aware has stated theyre keeping the filibuster. Which means the Democrats should be able to use the stalling tactics the Republicans have been using on them. Executive order wise hopefully they get struck down by the federal judges (which Biden has confirmed more of than Trump) and even if the order ultimately goes through while its in the court it cant be implemented and that can take time.Also Im hoping that this Trump administration is as dysfunctional as the last one and they keep in fighting and cant get their agenda done. This is a coin flip, but just cause they have a plan this time doesnt mean theyll implement it well. Lastly, well need pockets of civil disobedience. If youre in a group of people that can hurt the economy for the rich use that power. Just like the air traffic controllers went on strike last time and then a few days later the Muslim ban was lifted.

The more representative a body the more tempering effect it has on the body. That doesnt mean things wont be *bad*, but people like Kinzinger continue to exist. Getting insane shit through congress wont be as easy as everyone thinks it will be, especially once poll numbers start tanking. Economic realities continue to effect things for people. Once the transition happens, the economy becomes Trumps. If things are still expensive, which they are, the outlook for the GOP immediately starts to erode.From an executive standpoint; the Supreme Court Court doctrine will need to be tested *granualarly* which means a slow slog through the courts. Trump demonstrated the power of judge shipping, two can play at that game. Expect more of it. So were talking lots and lots of lawsuits grinding the executive to a halt, meanwhile the things he attempts to do to some success, like ripping families apart via mass deportation, will cause republicans to instantly lose support. They wont be able to stop elections because those are controlled by the states.They wont be able to turn the military on American citizens because what would that even accomplish? He cant be a dictator because his power is entirely derived from the Constitution, so if he seeks to suspend it, he suspends his own power with it, and that power defaults to the organs of the government that remain and do not have the authority to suspend it.So basically any attempt to suspend the Constitution would be a defacto resignation by Trump.Plus, theres the reality that he didnt win by a massive margin, and he doesnt have anything like a sweeping mandate. He won, sure, but he wasnt given charge to change America from a democracy into something else.","title":"Schiff says hes not going to be intimidated by Trump"},{"text":"Trumps proposal was not just for servers or the service industry.

It also investigated his improper retention of classified documents from his presidency, which he kept in his Mar-a-Lago home.  \\n  \\nCharges from both investigations were rolled into an inquiry conducted by the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, who was appointed by the current attorney general, Merrick Garland.  \\n  \\n...  \\n  \\nObservers say his goal is to assert control over the justice department, which has been conventionally viewed as politically independent from White House interference since Watergate.  \\n  \\nStephen Gillers, an ethics professor at New York University law school, said Trumps objective was to end that independence.  \\n  \\nTrump aims to neutralize sources of power that may impede him, he told NBC.

Holm](https://casetext.com/case/smiley-v-holm). \\"In exercising this power, the Congress may supplement these state regulations or may substitute its own.\\"Moreover, political gerrymandering laws are non-justiciable, see [Rucho v. Common Cause](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf), so that erects a barrier for challengers to even get into a court in the first place.And there you have it, once even California and New York have to run elections under maps that will elect Republicans as a majority of their congressional delegations, there is pretty much no circumstance where the Democratic Party will ever have majority control of the House again (with a singular exception where Republican voters would have to vote out Republican office holders en masse, but that is pretty much fanciful). And a permanent Republican House can therefore act as a one-way ratchet in terms of preventing a repeal of any laws that they previously passed, as well as completely prevent a potential future Democratic Senate and President from enacting new laws (in the unlikely event those seats of power change hands).","title":"Trump would need congressional approval to dissolve Education Department, experts say"},{"text":"That music.. couldnt finish the video because of it.","title":"Reddit is compromised"},{"text":"In this case, I hope they get more than they deserve.

If you go back to nearly forever, at least the 1960s, the more relatable candidate always won. Al Gore and John Kerry were not more relatable than George Bush. They called Bill Clinton Bubba for a reason. Obama was the coolest guy ever. I think in other countries, dry personalities like Angela Merkel can win elections. You can be the most boring and dry person ever, but they'll just look to policy. In America, we're different. We elect Hollywood Stars and Celebrities. We want people with charisma and personalities. Kamala and Hillary came off as inauthentic and it might be an issue female candidates struggle with slightly more than male candidates. Working class people are not detailed policy analysts. They have a vibe for if someone feels like they can sit down at a table with Steel Workers in Pittsburgh and hold a conversation with them. If they can relate to their struggles, concerns, and aspirations. Add Joe Rogan to this. Add Theo Von to this. Hillary and Kamala struggled with this. I think there's a carefulness with female candidates that's similar to women in society and it kind of makes sense. Women are more fearful of going into \\"unsafe environments\\" and places where there could be more confrontation and opposing viewpoints. I remember Hillary would not let herself be filmed eating. In politics, having everything look so rehearsed and carefully put together gives off bad vibes to some voters. Men will go on FOX News, into opposition territory, have unflitered conversations that make them seem more relatable. With AOC, she might or she might not have that, but I think she's way way more authentic than Hillary, Kamala, and most male politicians. She has an aura about her that makes her captivating. It felt like we were forced to like Kamala and Hillary. It doesn't feel that way with AOC. I am concerned with if she can go on places like Rogan or not, but I think she's in a better place than Kamala or Hillary if we specifically talk about some of the things that women struggle with in elections. AOC can go on twitch and be herself. She can go on social media and be herself. That's why I think she's a generational political talent.","title":"Detailed Analysis of Progressive Options for 2028"},{"text":"I seriously cant believe that so many Hispanic/Latinos actually support him.

Im hoping for positive, rally round neighbours tales, and ignore the buffoon looming large.  Personally I felt like the past four years was Biden putting all the previous admin global mistakes right.  Biden is admired in the west as a safe pair of hands.  If Harris had won I feel it would have continued to be governing just getting on with it and no drama.","title":"Another Fiasco for Trump as His Pick to Run Pentagon Suddenly Implodes"},{"text":"They'll have a lot of time to ponder that concern on that long plane ride back to the country their ancestors came from.

Chang all received Western education for large portions of their life. All three of them went to Western universities. Malik, in particular, was educated under Western education throughout his whole life. I broadly agree with your overall assessment, but using a Western liberal, humanist document to argue a universal is proven the commentators point: that you're making argument based on a presupposition of the correctness/superiority of liberalism. Saudi Arabia abstained from voting for it on the grounds that it violated Islamic law. No country voted against it, so the abstentions should be seen as disapproval of at least parts of the documents. The post-WWII era was an era where 3rd world countries tried to adopt Western views (be it liberal or socialist) because the majority of them were in the nascent and required aid from America or the USSR. Your argument would only hold water if you could demonstrate that principles like freedom, equality, and autonomy are exclusively Western. You cant. These principles exist in religious and philosophical traditions worldwide.These are literally modern Western concepts that did not exist for most of human history, and I'm many parts of the world still do not exist. Christianity was revolutionary because it espoused human equality and dignity regardless of class and sex. You don't even have to leave the \\"West\\"; go read platonic and Aristotelian views on women, and you'll see that equality and autonomy are not universal.Ethical systems and philosophical traditions across the globe have long emphasized justice, mutual respect, shared humanity, and the intrinsic worth of individuals, championing dignity and harmony as universal values transcending societal hierarchies. These principles have existed in numerous cultural and philosophical traditions worldwideThis has to be a joke. Your rejection of universality implies that no society has the right to improve or evolve. If traditions are sacrosanct, why did Saudi Arabia allow women to drive in 2018? Why abolish slavery?  If morality is not universal, and cultural traditions justify all actions, where do you draw the line? What exactly is morality? Who defines it? Why have different cultures had vastly different laws regarding morality? Morality is universal; what constitutes morality is not. Would you accept genocide, slavery, or systemic rape if they were deemed culturally appropriate? No, but I've grown up in a culture that has strong negative views on these acts. If I grew up in 200 AD Rome, would I accept all those things? Most likely, unless I was a Christian or Christian adjacent in that time. If not, how do you justify rejecting some atrocities while excusing others?The same way many societies have done it in the past and are doing it even today. Here's an example, the overwhelming majority of people in America do not think male circumcision is barbaric, but find FGM to be barbaric. In fact, it is recommended as a medical positive here. In Europe male circumcision is looked down upon and seen as barbaric.If you would accept them, what moral framework do you have that distinguishes you from pure nihilism?I don't accept those things, but the question isn't about whether I accept them. The question is about whether they are universals, and they're not. Society justified rape, slavery, etc, throughout history and in parts of the world they still do.","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"You can look at the unemployment rate from the 2008 recession until 2020, and it's just a smooth line lol.

It sucks that some lost their lives during the withdrawal, but staying would have cost lives too.

By consistently saying the economy has rebounded, which it did by metrics, wasnt enough for people who were not positively impacted by rising stocks or GDP. even the success of inflation coming back down didnt mean prices were suddenly low, so I thought it would have been important to explain why prices were still high beyond just saying we would have price gouging laws for the future.

(I couldn't find a source with more recent numbers)Department of Labor estimates that about 49% of the farm workers in California are documented: Half of California farmworkers in 2015C2019 were authorized to work in the United States (49%): 19 percent were U.S. citizens, 29 percent were lawful permanent residents, and 2 percent had work authorization through some other visa program.https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/naws/pdfs/NAWS%20Research%20Report%2015.pdfI'm sad to see that the H-2A temporary agricultural workers program is highly underutilized.I searched some more to see why H-2A might not be used as much:https://www.choicesmagazine.org/choices-magazine/theme-articles/the-role-of-guest-workers-in-us-agriculture/the-role-of-the-h-2a-program-in-california-agriculture After these threshold tests are satisfied, farmers who want to employ H-2A workers must satisfy three other tests to be certified: First, they must try to recruit U.S. workers and provide reasons why any U.S. workers who applied for jobs were not hired. Farmers must begin the recruitment process 45 days before they expect work to begin. Many farmers are convinced that U.S. workers will not show up when needed or remain for the entire season, so some employers discourage U.S. workers from applying. Second, farmers must provide free housing to H-2A guest workers and out-of-area U.S. workers. Most labor-intensive agriculture is in metro countries with relatively high housing prices. For example, the 40th-percentile, fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the U.S. salad bowl of Monterey County, CA, in 2018 was $1,433/month, meaning that 60% of two-bedroom units rent for more than $1,433. A farmworker employed 160 hours at the states minimum wage of $11/hour would earn $1,760/month, which means that a one-earner family would, after taxes, spend almost all earnings on rent. High rents relative to earnings help explain why the employment of H-2A guest workers has risen rapidly in Monterey County, where guest workers are often housed in motels that are converted into bunk houses, with four workers to a room.Maybe ag companies in California will start pushing for it for the next 4 years.---The last time they banned immigrants from working, California crops rotted in the fields, as recently as 2017, and again in the 70s, and again in the 60s...https://fortune.com/2017/08/08/immigration-worker-shortage-rotting-crops/Every time they do this, history repeats itself and they don't learn anything.","title":"Trump confirms plans to declare national emergency to implement mass deportation program"},{"text":"Well, someone needs to be fired (at the very least) for that covfefe of a withdrawal and the death of the US soldiers.","title":"REPORT: Trump Team Targeting Military Officers Involved in Afghanistan Withdrawal"},{"text":"Damn, it's almost like there is some other factor at play here, as if there is something that makes Joe and Mika and Trump actually very similar and have aligned interests despite all their professed political differences.Wonder what that could be.","title":"Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago to 'restart communications'"},{"text":"He thinks he learned from his first tour of duty.

The very clear intent of this is to get rid of disloyal generals, and to cause a chilling effect against opposing Trumps orders within our military.Trump 4 years ago attempted to coup our Government.You do not placate authoritarians by sucking up to them, or calling for both sides to come together, or by taking a lets wait and see approach as they continue to escalate. You embolden them by doing that.Listen to Abraham Lincoln:At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant, to step the Ocean, and crush us at a blow? Never!All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Buonaparte for a commander, could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years.At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected?

Again, don't take this as an endorsement of Reagan or his policies. I'm specifically addressing some common very incorrect misinformation or outright conspiracy theories that broke into the wider liberal/progressive sphere as just \\"facts\\" that are repeated like parrots and never really challenged.* **Reagans CIA deliberately put drugs into the inner cities** the news story that broke this was retracted and [basically ended the journalists career. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb#Dark_Alliance_series)Not because of the government but because of other journalists. The story was such a bombshell obviously every news agency went to fact check it. Like supposed government stooges like(checks notes) Tim Golden, Doyle McManus, Jon Mitchell and Walter Pincus? One of those guys broke Abu Graib, the other broke stories about Agent Orange contamination and the other one was on Watergate in the 70s? Yeah the retraction of the story was led by a **bunch** of heavy hitters in journalism at the time. It turns out the reporter who broke the story (Gary Webb) was basically talking to mid level drug mooks and took their story of guys in the business having CIA protection at face value without checking up on it throughout enough. Webb himself is the subject of a bunch of conspiracy theories I could also debunk but that stretches beyond Reagan. It should be noted large portions of this story just don't make sense at their face either. Webb's entire premise was that there was one major (CIA protected) drug supply into LA in the 80s that started the entire crack epidemic through Freeway Rick Ross and Oscar Blandon. Anybody who is tangentially aware of the drug trade would tell you there was about a dozen supply lines fiercely competing with each other. And in fact that fighting over supply and territory was specifically why drug violence in the 80s was so bad.\\n* **Regan was only for gun control when disarming black people (specifically the black panthers).**[Well for one the Black Panthers were not always the plucky rebels fighting the man people have been trying to make them out to be.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rackley). Reagan also only signed the bill, California democrats wrote it. The banning on open carry in CA sits on the crux of very significantly changing attitudes in the 60s about what was acceptable about guns. From literal old west attitudes to our modern sense of whats acceptable with open carry vs concealed carry and self defense (which is probably a whole other essay). And the law predates gun control being a partisan issue. At this point in history its suburban Republicans allied with city democrats against rural Dems and Republicans. Gun control didn't firmly come into the Republican camp until the late 80s. More to the point, Reagan was extremely pro guncontrol. Consistently. This is a quirk of California suburban republicans that died out in the 1990s. His press secretary founded the Brady Campaign. He wholeheartedly endorsed the California assault weapons ban in the 1980s and as ex-president endorsed and pushed for the 1994 federal assault weapons ban. He was for and signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act which included the Hughs amendment (banning any new registration and sale of automatic weapons)\\n* **Nancy Reagan the throat GOAT** \\\\- Not really about Reagan or his policies but its so needlessly mean, cheap and prolifically repeated. Apparently Nancy was a prolific slut around Hollywood giving blowjobs for acting roles as some sort of gotcha hypocrisy for the Reagans being the face of the \\"moral majority\\". The entire source for this is a tabloid author known for making \\"tell all\\" type books where she just made shit up I don't know why she's considered a hack fraud when it comes to her other books on Sinatra, the Kennedy's or Princess Diana but this one about Nancy Reagan stuck. The book came out in the 1990s pre \\"Me Too\\" era....so its even worse the actual story *in the book* is essentially Nancy getting Casting Couched by a Weinstein producer type.\\n* **Reagan killed the California state mental hospital system and ended mental healthcare programs that Carter put in place.** Another bipartisan led bill written by Democrats that Reagan only signed as governor. At this point the state mental health systems country wide were batshit backwards places of insane abuse and zero oversight where committed patients basically had no rights. People could and would be thrown in without actual mental health problems with no recourse to challenge the diagnosis or be released. The bipartisan solution was to just rip them out whole cloth and abolish the system. It by no means was just Reagan. The mental health care programs Reagan ended of Carter's was in a line item veto on the budget which should tell you how inconsequential they were. The program was essentially studying possible outcomes on federal funding for neighborhood clinics. It was a study leading to maybe someday in the possible future we put some money to open some clinics. It was not a panacea for the mental health crisis.\\n* **Reagan was \\"just some actor\\"** usually to parallel him to Trump. Trump didn't do shit in politics before running for President. But Ronnie really wasn't much of an actor. He had moderate success prior to WWII in Hollywood but was by no means a leading man. WWII is what got him into politics. Reagan had actually joined the Army in 1939 but by Pearl Harbor was labeled undeployable due to nearsightedness (which was true). As a young charismatic actor with connections already in the industry, the Army Public Relations unit in LA snatched him up and he spent the war negotiating with studios and helping the Army coordinate films, propaganda reels, newsreels and training films. After the war he used all these connections he now had with studio exes, directors and producers to run for SAG president. Which you might know as \\"one of the biggest trade groups in all of Hollywood representing all actors in actor contract rules and legislation.\\" He then parlayed his connections as SAG president to getting into politics (selling out fellow actors to the Hollywood blacklist committees), running for Governor, challenging Gerald Ford in a primary and then later running for President.","title":"The End of Denial - How Trumps rising popularity in New York (and everywhere else) exposed the Democratic Partys break with reality"},{"text":"Not Fun Fact: Agent 45 started the ball rolling towards WWIII by treating national secrets like trading cards.

Here are the key points:\\\\ Pete Hegseth Controversy\\\\- Hegseth allegedly paid a woman who claimed he sexually assaulted her as part of a non-disclosure agreement\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\- He's under fire for lack of managerial experience and controversial statements about women in combat\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\- There's internal debate in Trump's circle about what to do with Hegseth's nomination\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\ Other Controversial Picks\\\\- Matt Gaetz is being considered for attorney general, which is seen as problematic\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\- RFK Jr. is mentioned as a potential pick, raising concerns due to his anti-vaccine stance\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\ Trump's Approach to Appointments\\\\- The podcast suggests Trump is intentionally choosing candidates to harm institutions\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\- There's a discussion about Trump's disregard for institutional norms and guardrails\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\ Republican Party Response\\\\- The hosts speculate on how Republicans might react to these controversial picks\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\- There's a suggestion that some nominations might be made through recess appointments to bypass Senate confirmation\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\ Media and Information Environment\\\\- Rick Wilson discusses his past experience in manipulating media coverage as a Republican operative\\\\[1\\\\].\\\\- He talks about his new project, the Two Plus Two Coalition, aimed at countering right-wing disinformation\\\\[1\\\\].The overall tone of the podcast is critical of Trump's choices, expressing concern about the potential impact on government institutions and national security.

The UDHR is the product of extensive collaboration involving representatives from a diverse range of cultures, philosophies, and religious traditions. Eleanor Roosevelt may have chaired the drafting committee, but it included figures like Charles Malik of Lebanon (a Christian Arab philosopher), Hansa Mehta of India (a prominent Gandhian and advocate for womens rights), and Peng Chun Chang of China (a Confucian scholar). The final text reflects a *consensus* on fundamental human dignity that transcends any one region or ideology.The UDHR was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 with 48 countries voting in favor, including nations from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. This was not a unilateral Western imposition but a collective agreement.The drafting process incorporated input from Islamic, Confucian, Hindu, and other non-Western philosophical traditions. The core principleslike freedom from torture, equality under the law, and freedom of thoughtare not Western; they are universal.Even Saudi Arabia, a member of the UN at the time, participated in the drafting process. If the UDHR is Western, why did Saudi Arabia refrain from voting against it? More importantly, why does Saudi Arabia still invoke the language of human rights in its own governmental rhetoric?Your reductionist framing ignores the historical and philosophical complexity of the UDHR. To dismiss it as Western liberalism reveals more about your intellectual laziness than it does about the declaration itself.If a document forged by representatives from every corner of the globe isnt universal, what criteria would you use to define universal? Or is your dismissal just a convenient way to avoid confronting its truths?--- **\\"By using it as a basis for your argument, you are in actuality conceding the point.\\"**This is a textbook example of circular reasoning: you assume the UDHR is invalid because youve pre-decided its rooted in Western values, then declare that referencing it proves your point.The UDHRs universality doesnt hinge on your arbitrary dismissal of it as Western. It is based on principles that all humansregardless of geography or culturerecognize as fundamental to human dignity.Your argument would only hold water if you could demonstrate that principles like freedom, equality, and autonomy are *exclusively Western.* You cant. These principles exist in religious and philosophical traditions worldwide.Your argument would only hold water if you could demonstrate that principles like freedom, equality, and autonomy are *exclusively Western.* You cant.Ethical systems and philosophical traditions across the globe have long emphasized justice, mutual respect, shared humanity, and the intrinsic worth of individuals, championing dignity and harmony as universal values transcending societal hierarchies. These principles have existed in numerous cultural and philosophical traditions worldwide.Your conflation of universality with Western liberalism is a strawman argument that disrespects the contributions of non-Western intellectual traditions and erases the depth and diversity of these global contributions to the human rights discourse.If universal principles like equality and freedom are Western, why do they appear across diverse cultural traditions and philosophies worldwide and in the sacred texts and philosophical traditions of countless non-Western cultures?---By attacking the UDHR, youre not making a compelling case for cultural relativismyoure providing cover for oppression.If human rights arent universal, then by your logic, no atrocity can be condemned if its cloaked in the guise of tradition. Do you defend foot-binding, honor killings, or caste-based discrimination as morally valid because theyre rooted in culture? If not, why single out Saudi Arabias systemic oppression for special exemption?  Your rejection of universality implies that no society has the right to improve or evolve. If traditions are sacrosanct, why did Saudi Arabia allow women to drive in 2018? Why abolish slavery? Why do any societies adapt their laws in response to moral progress? The reality is that morality evolves, and rejecting universal principles stifles that growth.  Most insidiously, your argument erases the voices of Saudi women who have risked their lives to fight for equality. Women like Loujain al-Hathloul werent protesting Western liberalism; they were fighting for their right to live with dignity in their own society. By dismissing their struggles as culturally inauthentic, you side with their oppressors.If you believe human rights arent universal, on what grounds would you oppose apartheid, genocide, or slavery? If none, does that not make you complicit in enabling oppression?---By claiming that human rights are relative, you eliminate any basis for condemning even the most egregious abuses. This moral vacuum undermines not just your argument but any coherent framework for justice.  The UDHR is not a Western invention; its a global consensus. Your dismissal disrespects the contributions of non-Western nations and thinkers who helped shape it.  The desire for dignity and autonomy is not a Western construct. From Irans women-led protests to the ongoing struggles of Saudi activists, the demand for equality is universal.  Your argument collapses under the weight of its contradictions. Cultural relativism is not a moral high ground; its a cowards refugea way to dodge accountability and excuse oppression. The UDHR, far from being a Western liberal artifact, represents humanitys collective conscience. Rejecting it doesnt make you principled; it makes you complicit.If morality is not universal, and cultural traditions justify all actions, where do you draw the line? Would you accept genocide, slavery, or systemic rape if they were deemed culturally appropriate? If not, how do you justify rejecting some atrocities while excusing others? If you would accept them, what moral framework do you have that distinguishes you from pure nihilism?","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"Lol shaking hands with subordinates for a photo op = literally Hitler","title":"Your daily dose of r pics digging up old photos of Hitler to compare with Trump."},{"text":"\\"tRuMp dOeSn'T HavE AnYthIng tO Do wITh p2025\\"","title":"Brendan Carr wrote the FCC chapter in Project 2025.

Almost always people are working hard to help, but often the numbers are just insane.Couple that with the governments good worker policies (the leave amounts you get each year are set, overtime and comp time policies are established by law, employment information is public, employees generally know their rights, etc.), and it means that despite doing lots of work government employees have a work-life balance.So people see government workers getting hours off and having legal working protections, and equate that to not getting anything done, despite not understanding that they're often significantly outperforming private entities in terms of time and money dedicated to an issue. They're just often undersupplied so that the efficiency doesn't translate to immediate success.The real \\"grift\\" that you see involving government work is in regards to government contractors, those hired by the government to cover work. While many are fantastic people at the worker level, their management is all about profit for the company. There's no public service mindset. (I will note that it varies - I can say that of my experience with government contractors Microsoft was very public service minded, to a shocking degree compared to some of the more storied beltway contractors).If people cared about efficiency they'd push for more government employees and less third party contracting, as those employees are focused on public service and not enrichment of an entity.

You respect them enough to let them have their own journey.Much like people, have you, and I mean you, as an actual person, ever actually solved anyone's serious problem. Have you personally ever fixed a drug addict? If you have, you would know how damn hard it is to even fix one person. It's darn near impossible to 'fix' an entire society. Much less one that may not even want to be fixed. So what is getting yourself in a big tussle going to do? You can't actually fix it. So the best thing to do is repsect them as a separate society and let them have their journey.Again, as it relates to them interacting with you/others, maybe you step in. You also have to have some humility with respect to life. Everyone you think is wrong may not be as clear as you think it is. For example, most of your post is about women. It's not like we in the West have 'fixed' our gender relations where everyone is happy. Maybe they have it more wrong than right. Maybe we have it more right than wrong. But what is clear is that we are not perfect. It is also clear the current Saudi leadership under MBS has made many changes to move the situation in the liberal direction. It may not be at the pace you want. It may not end up as pro-women as you want. But he is moving it that way.","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"Yeeah.

For me its in my backyard. I live in an immigrant heavy neighborhood in a large blue metro unfortunately in a purple state that went red. Our goober governor will do nothing to stand in Trumps way. Im surrounded by dozens of low income apartment blocks that are chock full of THOUSANDS of migrants, most of whom are here undocumented. It is a well known thing, and I dont see how if this happens that: a.) A significant number of my neighbors just dont flee. Ive been watching people work like crazy in the last two weeks, no doubt to save up cash in case they need to bug out or already plan to go before Inauguration Day. \\nB.) A significant portion of people have convinced themselves this is all talk and will not change a thingwhich means occupation. I do not see that being peaceful and only restricted to the undocumented. C.) Im married to a naturalized citizen, and they are easy to find because of the amount of information you must give USCIS. Who was the very first group Stephen Miller made sure to focus on: Naturalized citizens. For those of you that say this isnt America or they cant do that, Ill remind you that for 100 years Black Americans were second class citizens even though the Constitution said they were not. To really drive the point home, I dont even need to go back to the Jim Crow era.  I need only go to the 1980s and what life was like in low income urban areas during the early days of the War on Drugs during the crack cocaine era. Police were trained in paramilitary tactics, used military grade weaponry, and invaded neighborhoods nightly with no or sketchy warrants that ignored due process. All they had to say is there is crack in that house, all must be arrested or killed no questions asked. While it has been greatly reduced, the tactics are still used today and they are only eschewed when they get caught. I wish I could end on something hopeful, but my PTSD from growing up in SE Queens and Atlanta during that era is firing at 2000 degrees.

Trump has told advisers he is standing by his nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, after the transition team was jolted by an allegation he had sexually assaulted a woman in an interaction he insists was consensual.Mr. Trump made his view plain to aides after a conversation with Mr. Hegseth days ago, after the team learned that a woman had accused him of assault in 2017, according to two people briefed on the discussion. They also learned that Mr. Hegseth had entered into a financial settlement with the woman that had a confidentiality clause.This means Hegseth will be confirmed. I think Congress would much rather undermine the military than go against Trump.That said, it is really irksome how these issues about Hegseth's and Gaetz's histories of being sex pests has overshadowed the fact that neither is qualified for these positions.The Department of Defense is one of the largest, most intricate and mission-critical organizations on Earth. And Hegseth has never managed anything.Even if he wasn't a sex pest or a white supremacist, it would still be unfathomably dangerous to put him in this position","title":"Trump Stands by Defense Pick Who Says Encounter With Woman Was Not Sexual Assault"},{"text":"It's hard to say.

Should we have 'respected' the cultural norms of apartheid or foot-binding?\\"I get where youre coming from, but this kind of comparison feels like it oversimplifies things. Practices like apartheid and foot-binding were rigid systems with little internal momentum for reform. In contrast, Saudi Arabia has been undergoing pretty significant changes in the past decadelike granting women the right to drive, loosening male guardianship rules, and opening up the workforce to women.Isnt it worth recognizing these steps as signs of cultural evolution? Progress might be slow, but if its coming from within the system, doesnt that make it more sustainable than forcing change from the outside?\\n--- \\"Happiness under oppression reflects psychological adaptation, not systemic justice.\\"True, people adapt to bad situations, but does that mean their happiness is fake? Surveys like the Arab Barometer show that women in Saudi Arabia report higher satisfaction with their lives than women in some Western democracies, even with fewer formal freedoms.Could it be that their happiness comes from cultural values like family cohesion, shared religious identity, or safety? Does autonomy look different depending on cultural context?\\n--- \\"Women can drive now! Shall we throw a parade for granting a basic human right?\\"I get the frustration, but dismissing progress like this also kind of undermines the work of Saudi activists who fought for these changes. The right to drive isnt just about driving; its symbolic of broader shifts in how women participate in society.For example, loosening guardianship rules now means women can travel, work, and even live independently in ways they couldnt before. Isnt incremental change better than no change at all?\\n--- \\"Gender segregation protects women and upholds morality.\\"Gender segregation is definitely controversial, but its worth noting that some Saudi women themselves support gender-specific spaces. They argue these spaces provide comfort and safety in line with their cultural values.Rather than condemning segregation outright, wouldnt it be more constructive to advocate for women to choose whether they want segregated or integrated environments? Isnt agency what were really after here?\\n--- \\"Safety isnt just about physical harm; its about freedom from fear.\\"This is a valid point, but freedom and safety arent always mutually exclusive. Some Saudi women prioritize physical safety over freedoms they might not see as essential. For example, some feel that Saudi society protects them better than Western countries where harassment or assault might be more common.Could this preference reflect cultural differences in how safety and freedom are valued, rather than a blanket acceptance of oppression?\\n---TL;DR: Saudi Arabia isnt perfect, and theres still a long way to go, but framing it as a static, entirely oppressive society ignores the progress thats happening. Reform is slow, but its happening, and a lot of it is being driven by Saudi women themselves. Wouldnt a more balanced viewacknowledging both problems and progressactually support meaningful change better than outright condemnation?","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"remember if the text doesn't mention his name at least once per paragraph he loses interest","title":"Project what now?

Both use some form of parliamentary procedures, the House uses *Jefferson's Manual*, and the Senate uses the Standing Rules of the Senate. Generally this is accomplished with a motion to adjourn, which may pass with a majority vote or unanimous consent, or with a concurrent resolution between both chambers.With respect to recess appointments as established in [US Const Art 2 S2 C3](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S2-C3-1/ALDE_00001144/), the supreme Court case [NLRB v. Canning](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/12-1281) comes up:The majority determined that the recess appointments clause applies for any inter or intra session recesses, as long as they are longer than 3 days. They also determined that *pro forma* sessions of the Senate technically count as \\"sessions\\", even if no business is performed and that, since recess appointments in recesses under 10 days are rare, 10 days would be a good minimum recess length to trigger the recess appointments clause.A concurrent opinion argued that the recess appointments clause only applies to inter session recesses. In that case, either the House and Senate would have to formally adjourn for more than 10 days, or disagree on adjournment in such a way that allows the President to use Art 3 S2.So, this is how it would likely go:\\n1. A motion to adjourn for 10 days is made in the House.2. *Assuming there are enough votes*, the motion passes. The motion to adjourn is referred to the Senate because it is longer than 3 days.3. The motion to adjourn is brought up in the Senate. Here's where it may get a bit dicey and I'm not sure how this part works.Option A:4. The Senate passes the motion.5. The president is allowed to make recess appointments after 10 days pass.Option B:4. The Senate fails to pass the motion. Now I think we might get to \\"this has never happened before\\" territory.5. Either the House and Senate get to negotiate on the motion to adjourn, or the President may immediately force a recess. Whatever happens, it would probably be go to court.Option C:4. The Senate just ignores the House's motion and things get really ambiguous. Does that mean there is a \\"disagreement\\"? Is the House forced to remain in session after 3 days? Is the Senate *allowed* to ignore the House's motion to adjourn? Whatever happens here would also probably go to court.","title":"Speaker Mike Johnson leaves the door open to recess appointments"},{"text":"Cause of the McDonalds stunt Trump did a week before the election?","title":"Im loving it"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|4L82Munclp6MJFJCeZ|downsized)","title":"What programs do republicans fund that can be considered wasteful or controversial?

And yet none of their viewers even questioned the contradiction.Another thing we forget is that while things are stable in some aspects of the US, most people that live here, can barely afford to live.

Oklahoma.... Which some places would be cool,  if it wasn't stuck in a state that has literally no means to pay for it's own services or to upgrade infrastructure.  All our highways were built in like the 70s, the roads, those will be repaired in 2100.   There's literally legislation that says that in order to raise taxes, you would need 75% of both chambers of congress to get it approved.  Which essentially means it would be impossible.  They've lowered the corporate tax rate to 4% to try and spur companies to come here, but all that's happened is that Tulsa gets used as a bargaining tool for other cities to sweeten their deals.Oh but the one thing they do really really well here is build private prisons.  Because of course private prisons get tax subsidies here.  It's a racist thing.

If none of those arguments succeed, national guard units can still be used for law enforcement if activated by their state governor. A guard unit from one state can be used in any state with the permission of that state's governor. So worst case scenario, red states use their own national guards for immigration enforcement, with states with relatively little need sending their guards to states like Texas that are slammed.

Those people are less sympathetic to the masses.The Japanese internment imprisoned about 120,000 people. I think that scale is unlikely, but possible, during Trump's administration.

My small town was home to a big IBM plant back in the 1960s-2000s. It employed a solid 10% of the town directly, with many good, high paying engineering and admin jobs.?The knock on effects of the plant and its employees spending made my town a little bubble of considerable upper middle class prosperity in a sea of where the rust belt met Appalachia. In the early 2000s IBM moved to close down the plant, which would have cost our town everything.?Hillary Clinton, our senator at the time, intervened, lobbying heavily to have the plant taken over by Lockheed Martin, with the deal lubricated by federal military contracts. ?Many people at the plant got to keep their exact same jobs and titles, and only their employer changed (like my Grandfather).?Hillary Clinton effectively saved our town.??Then in 2008 as part of the sequestration debates, the Republicans forced Obama to cut the military program that our Lockheed Martin plant built for by about 90%. ?The Lockheed Martin plant lost about 90% of its staff, throwing out town into a decade-long economic crisis. ?The educated population mostly moved out, looking for work else where, leading to a collapse in real estate values, taxes, and general spending that sent our town into a massive tail spin.??So when 2016 rolled along my town definitely got its retribution against the Republicans by voting for Hillary Clinton, the savior of our town, by Assad level margins, right? ?AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA??No.??They voted 2:1 for Donald Trump and against Hilary Clinton, a significantly better performance by the Republicans than in any prior recent election. ?The amount of visceral hatred I heard from people in my town about Clinton, including my grandfather whose job she saved, was insane. My town had about as clear a case as any to vote for Hillary Clinton and against Trump. ?Clinton had saved our town for a whole decade, while the Congressional Republicans burned it to the ground, and despite that my town voted by overwhelming numbers against Hillary and for the Republican. ?Take from that what you will, but my takeaway is that many Americans are incapable of making rational voting choices even when their noses are rubbed in it.","title":"Haitian immigrants flee Springfield, Ohio, in droves after Trump election win"},{"text":"Musk owns Trump.

The GOP is already there, claiming that undocumented immigrants are all criminals, and you don't want to be defending criminals, do you? Next it will expand to other categories of people who will be (and already are) framed as detrimental to society. Most likely trans people will be an early target after immigrants.
