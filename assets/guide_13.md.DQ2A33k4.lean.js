Especially because, if I'm assassinating a health insurance CEO, then I presumably don't support the current system. Again, the system as it currently exists causes large quantities of harm and death. You suggest the example of a stalker boyfriend who is threatening to kill you, and a pretty big difference between that and the healthcare system is that the boyfriend is only making threats, and ones that the cops don't even take seriously enough to justify action. The healthcare system doesn't threaten to kill people. It just does, and does so often.The big difference between the boyfriend and health insurance, one you imply but do not seem to forward as the central issue at hand, is not the extremity of the outcome or even the failure of the state. Our healthcare system has worse outcomes than any stalker boyfriend and is at least comparably an oversight of our state. Greater, even. Our healthcare system has been harming people since forever, with the state's full knowledge and consent. No, the difference is that the awfulness of healthcare is more spread out. Systemic.Killing the boyfriend will definitely do the job. It's a bit less clear that killing the CEO will do so. And, similarly, the harm of the boyfriend is centered exclusively on the person doing the killing. Healthcare has diffuse harm. Some people are hurt a ton, many people are just hurt a little. And yeah, this makes the problem harder to address, including through violence. The people in charge of our system get to insulate themselves from its consequences by embedding themselves in gigantic structures of evil. But that seems bad to me. I think it's good when the most powerful people in our society have their protections removed. I think it's bad when we buy into the lie that this insulation is acceptable. That they're not truly guilty because they are simply massive cogs in a far more massive machine.","title":"CMV: Luigi Mangione should not be celebrated"},{"text":"Or Reddit's favorite catchphrase: FAFO","title":"Trump's pro-Israel Cabinet Picks Upset Muslims Who Voted for Him"},{"text":"Rapists make good kindling.","title":"Donald Trump Comes to Matt Gaetz's Defense, Says Ethics Report 'Very Unfair'"},{"text":"Not all of us; I'd like to see the US regain the Panama Canal ASAP.","title":"Trump is threatening to take over the Panama Canal, which Panama owns outright"},{"text":"It was planned well before Trump said anything.

The colonists were themselves British subjects; they were rebelling against the legal state apparatus. We only call them foreign now because of the result of that conflict. That aside, you should recognize that holding violence as unjustified unless it meets some very specific definition of self-defense is not a moral high ground opinion separate from the conflict at hand -- it's a declaration of solidarity with the forces of the State, or at the very least an endorsement of the status quo. When people feel that there is no chance for reform, that there is no non-violent recourse, they will inevitably turn to violence. There is little evidence that the United States is capable of or interested in reforming the extremely broken healthcare system, and so eventually violent outbursts are to be expected, and are in *some sense* justified, even if you find their acts abhorrent. To be clear, I think the Luigi Mangione will, and frankly should, go to prison. What he did was criminal, and as a society I think we continue to have an interest in punishing murder in the streets. But when we talk about \\"justified\\" violence, you can and should recognize that just because something is criminal doesn't make it unjustified.

Over taxes, not healthcare, mind you. The Boston tea party wasn't as cheerful as it sounds. Tarring and feathering wasn't just a prank. That people will commit violence for causes they believe strongly in doesn't just define terrorism, but wars and conflicts we consider \\"justified\\" as well. Perspective alone doesn't make for an effective argument against celebration, since one side is likely to find reasons for sympathy anyways.Take a long standing issue in the US regarding the Civil War - there remain people who believe in the lost cause of the Confederate government, and claim the battle flag as a flag of heritage. The vast majority of us know that the Civil War was a lost cause of slavery and oppression that was successfully fought off, but that doesn't change the fact that people still group around it. If something so thoroughly abhorrent as the final legacy of legitimized slavery can still attract a crowd, why can't a single person who just killed a deeply unpopular healthcare CEO, whose governing of UnitedHealth denied and killed an unprecedented number of policyholders? Why aren't we first concerned about people glorifying decidedly murderous and dangerous regimes like the Confederacy, rather than fretting about the possible fallout over a single man with a gun? Mangione is not half a country that split away and treasonously fired the first cannons onto federal property. And he killed only the person he intended, which cannot be said for Brian Thompson, whose policies left many patients as \\"collateral damage\\" from ever egregious denials.Mangione wouldn't even be the first American folk hero who was known for murder. Wild Bill Hickock, Davy Crockett, Paul Bunyan, and everyone in Skidmore, Missouri who \\"didn't\\" see who killed Ken McElroy weren't known for being peace loving pacifists: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_McElroyYou may find it distasteful, but violence is already a common language in American discourse. We have accepted the subclinical violence of dying via market pressure for such a long time, until now at least. Is it really so surprising that many lionize Mangione when the public has come to violence for causes that we'd judge as even less tasteful? I don't condone killing anyone you disagree with any more than you do. I just don't find it surprising that Americans also shed few tears over it.","title":"CMV: Luigi Mangione should not be celebrated"},{"text":"The IRS investigation of Hunter and the Weiss assignment was all done pre-Garland, under Barr, and yes that ballooned to multiple prongs - the gun issue, the tax issue, FARA, bribery, sex trafficking accusations etc etc thanks to right wing operatives (Giuliani etc) and the \\"laptop\\" saga. Immediately after Biden was elected he asked mostly all [Trump era DOJ prosecutors](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/08/politics/leftover-trump-us-attorneys/index.html) to resign except for Weiss (and Durham btw). Again, this was done pre-Garland that was Joe's choice. Fast forward to 2022, Weiss negotiated a plea deal with Hunter and gave assurances that there was no further investigation. That deal collapsed partially because of a fabrication from an FBI informant (Smirnov) and the GOP House pressuring Weiss and the Trump appointed Judge to make Hunter go to trial. Weiss, after admitting in congressional testimony he and his family were getting death threats for the plea deal and the plea deal ultimately collapsing, requested Special Counsel status and Garland foolishly granted it giving Weiss ultimate prosecutorial discretion on the matter. After that, Weiss charged Hunter with the gun charge as a Felony (Garland had no say) and Hunter went to trial and was found guilty.The Gaetz investigation was precipitated through Greenberg. Greenberg would be basically unusable as a witness because he [previously framed someone else on precisely the same allegations he was saying about Gaetz](https://ethics.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Appendix-A.pdf#page=130) and furthermore Greenberg pushed the Gaetz cooperation very hard to limit his own jail time. A defense attorney would have an easy time impeaching him. As for the testimony of the women, that has some pretty big weaknesses as well. And Gaetz also has witnesses that have gone to the mat on claims that discredit the witnesses. Overall, in my opinion, getting him convicted on federal sex trafficking charges would be a tough road but I don't know every detail since some of the files on Greenbergs docket are sealed.  Blindly overlooking Gaetz admittance to drug use and being a gun owner himself?The DOJ doesnt really take that charge seriously, at least not without aggravating circumstances. So they might use a drug/gun charge on Gaetz IF they had other larger charges they would indict him on, but I don't think the Northern District of Florida prosecutors were willing to take Gaetz to trial based on testimonial evidence from Greenberg and the women. Also note, DOJ didn't charge Hunter for a lot of conduct that people are saying Gaetz should have been charged for! prostiution, sex trafficking etc. but rather what would most benefit the Federalist Society agendaThat's some Qanon level BS. Garland is an institutionalist with priorities to protect the DOJ as an institution. He made some mistakes, he also made some progress.

Do you think that his actions, not considered in some vague and general sense but understood with their full purpose and context, were good? If so, then that's all there is to it. If not, then that's also all there is to it. I see no reason to bring broadly similar actions into the conversation.Once we start condoning such cold blooded killing on streets where will it stop and where will we draw the line?This is essence of moral reasoning. It's all about line drawing. Is it okay to steal bread to feed your starving family? Is it okay to steal a fancy watch so that your cousin can tell the time in luxury? We're talking about stealing in both cases, but I would say that most people have a line somewhere between those two points. The bread is good, the watch is bad, and there's a loose gradient between them. And, given all moral reasoning entails line drawing, I do not see the presence of such a thing within this moral reasoning to be a problem.Is murdering United HealthCare workers also justified because they are complicit in the act or its just the CEO ? Its a very very slippery slope we have here.This argument seems kinda silly to me. Do you think murdering the CEO was justified? Do you think murdering the workers is justified? If you think the former is justified but not the latter, then explain why, and that reasoning is exactly why the slope is not slippery. If both are unjustified, then the slope seems irrelevant. And I guess we should, for completeness, consider the third case where both are justified and the slope is bonus irrelevant. Not all that valuable in this situation, but it comes up on occasion in arguments like this.","title":"CMV: Luigi Mangione should not be celebrated"},{"text":"Plus a huge tax cut for the wealthy and corporations.

Once in office they are of course indebted to the people who fund their advertisements. So in practice, policy decisions are plutocratic, even if the method of choosing who in are the policy decisions is democratic. But if the population wasnt so easily manipulated by advertisements this wouldnt be a problem.

Some executives are considering whether to take up the controversial work of detaining families or unaccompanied children. Others are preparing to hire new staff and snapping up well-connected lobbyists. This is, to us, an unprecedented opportunity, George Zoley, executive chairman of the GEO Group, a private prison company, told investors on an earnings call days after the election. Pulling off a deportation on the scale Trump has promised would constitute an unprecedented logistical feat for the U.S. government, involving identifying, locating, arresting, detaining, adjudicating and transporting potentially millions of men, women, and children.","title":"Americas Private Prison Complex Gears Up for Trump Deportation Bonanza"},{"text":"The two biggest internet trolls on the planet will be running the White House in 3 weeks.","title":"Eric Trump posts image of Donald Trump \\"ordering\\" Canada on Amazon"},{"text":"Well one is objectively worse because he holds public office and was about to be AG.

He controls the budget, the scope, the everything. To make it an official government branch would put DOGE (and therefore Musk) on the government leash. He would be accountable to Congress and laws governing government agency, which are WAY more strict than NGOs. Plus, seeing as Musk is a government contractor, I'm pretty sure there are conflict of interest laws that restrict the ability for him to continue his government contacts while also working for a branch of government designed to do that. Plus, there's nothing he can do in the government anyway. The budget is set by Congress and signed by the president. He can't really cut anything as the president doesn't even really have that authority. Oh, and since DOGE would be a branch of government, he could be easily fired should a Democratic president assume office. Youre only making this argument because its Elon, if it was some boring politician doing DOGE, you would turn a blind eye.Yes I am. Elon Musk is not a politician. He is not an economist.

That's really just about all you need.I outright refuse to believe you need 1,000 pages just to keep the lights on. 100 is plausible if there are many different government departments you need to fund. And the fact that they were able to cut it down to 10% of its original size just shows how much bloat was in the bill that didn't need to be there.What Elon was saying is that all this bloat has to be cut out. What are we funding bioweapons for? What is congress getting a pay rise for when their net worth is in the millions?But by putting everything in a massive 1,000 page bill, you then can't oppose funding for bioweapons without also blocking pay rises for ordinary workers and everything just becomes a mess. Then the argument becomes \\"Elon hates funding government workers\\" because he doesn't like half of some massive bill.It's not that the government is an oligarchy. We agree with Elon. We want to fund government workers, and yet we don't need 1,000 pages to do that, and we don't need to throw in bio-weapons funding to be able to fund government workers.

Who needs crude propaganda when you can have sophisticated \\"expert analysis\\" delivered by think tanks that coincidentally receive funding from the very industries they're analyzing?And social media! Oh, what a brilliant innovation - giving everyone a voice while algorithmic filters ensure you only hear the echoes that advertising revenues prefer. It's like having a public square where every corner is conveniently sponsored by someone trying to sell you something, including political opinions.The lobbyists, bless their hardworking souls, have even convinced us that their influence is just another form of \\"democratic expression.\\" After all, what's more democratic than allowing those with the most money to have the loudest voice? It's simply the free market of ideas, where some ideas can afford better marketing than others.But perhaps the most elegant aspect is how we've normalized it all. We accept that our political debates are sandwiched between pharmaceutical ads, that our understanding of complex issues comes pre-filtered through corporate-owned news channels, and that our elected officials spend more time in fundraising meetings than reading legislation.

Theres a good book I read years ago Strangers in Their Own Land that gives chilling realizations about this:  Hochschilds book was written after speaking to focus groups and interviewing Tea Party supporters. She focuses her efforts in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in Calcasieu Parish. The bayou area has a high concentration of petrochemical plants as well as a high level of pollution in its waterways. Hochschild wanted to understand why there was little support for environmental regulation in this area, despite what would seem to be the self-interest of its residents. Hochschilds research led her to focus on the cultural values that led people to oppose government regulation. Prominent among these were their attitudes about taxes, their religious convictions, and challenges to their honor.\\nThe core of the book is Hochschilds attempt to distill the worldview of Tea Party supporters, who formed part of the same constituency that heavily backed Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. According to Hochschild, Tea Party supporters have reacted against the changing face of America in the last few decades. They perceive a situation where women, immigrants, and racial minorities have been cutting in line to achieve the American Dream. They also feel as though some government officials (such as President Barack Obama) have been waving these same groups to the front of the line through affirmative action programs and other kinds of support. As a result of these perceptions, the older, largely white, and disproportionately male supporters of the Tea Party increasingly feel, as Hochschilds title indicates, like strangers in their own land.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangers_in_Their_Own_Land","title":"How Trumps presidency could hurt Alabama: Federal program cuts hit us harder than most"},{"text":"Same DoD that cannot pass an audit","title":"DNC: Trump is Turning the Department of Defense Over to His Special Interest Billionaire Backers"},{"text":" I think that shes got a lot of Marla, Trump said of Tiffany, referring to her mother, Marla Maples.

Some people, like the guy who burned that woman to death on a NYC subway this week, need to be removed from society permanently. Yet, our system is too flawed to trust it when it comes to whether or not someone is truly guilty beyond an actual reasonable doubt. Some states, most notoriously Texas, routinely *refuse* to re-examine the cases of death row inmates when it's discovered there's possible DNA that can be tested. They usually do it because it either would take away a big win from the prosecutors or would now be embarrassing to them (particularly if they have since become judges).","title":"Trump Rages at Biden for Wrecking His Plans for Executions: Makes No Sense - Biden changes sentences of 37 men currently on Death Row to Life Imprisonment"},{"text":"Pedos stick together.","title":"Donald Trump Comes to Matt Gaetz's Defense, Says Ethics Report 'Very Unfair'"},{"text":"This has gotta be related to the bullshit at the Olympics when Trump/Maga/Fox decided that one boxer was trans because she fucked up her opponent.","title":"Donald Trump tells rightwing group that hell end womens boxing very quickly"},{"text":"Birds of a feather","title":"Donald Trump Comes to Matt Gaetz's Defense, Says Ethics Report 'Very Unfair'"},{"text":"I am not your Wikipedia","title":"Trump is teasing US expansion into Panama, Greenland and Canada"},{"text":"I love this song for my Christmas playlist","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 24, 2024"},{"text":"Truly a brother in need....","title":"Donald Trump Comes to Matt Gaetz's Defense, Says Ethics Report 'Very Unfair'"},{"text":"Garland let every elite walkHis Masters are well pleased","title":"\\"They let him walk\\": Merrick Garland's DOJ under fire after damning Matt Gaetz report released"},{"text":"It just occurred to me that two of the three he left off would anger trump's base if he executed them.

Imagine how having China and India as just one state each would affect the electoral college. Trump would have to have Modi as his running mate.Also polls would close like the new year sweeps across the planet. Kiribati would be the first to close its polls because it has the earliest time zone on the planet. And I love the weird comedy that would come from random small states being like my home state in 2020 taking forever to count. Like Rwanda or Qatar taking days to count and everyone holding their breath for them to be called.Also for the sake of the pure comedy of it all, in this global US imagine people of all kinds of weird ideologies trying to fit themselves into the two party system. I think that some would be more obvious than others, like Modi and Putin would be Republicans even though theyd be annoyed that they couldnt be as authoritarian as governors. But then there are many far left leaders who I couldnt see as Democrats. Like would Lula in Brazil be a Democrat or a Dem-caucusing independent like Sanders?I obviously dont support expansion irl and think that it is a terrible and ghoulish idea, but the idea of a global US and the political weirdness that would ensue is such an interesting idea for me.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 24, 2024"},{"text":"It's hard to play defense before the ball is in play.

Hunter then was charged for tax evasion and lying on his gun application about his drug use which was completely unrelated to the original accusations in the investigation. Those charges were presented to Garland at some point, and with his high trust in his prosecutors, he made the decision to proceed just based on that trust?  That scenario is per your comment above. But Gaetz case was triggered by accusations of sex and drug trafficking as well as accepting bribes. Testimony was provided by victims corroborating said accusations, but because Greenberg wasnt exactly forthright or because prosecutors werent exactly trusting his cooperation they decided not to indict him even considering other testimony? And even ignoring other evidence in the case? Blindly overlooking Gaetz admittance to drug use and being a gun owner himself? Meanwhile, no oversight in a high profile case such as this was provided by Garland? Just blind trust that his prosecutors were doing the right thing? I guess youre right in a sense. Garland did trust his prosecutors to do something. I dont believe it was to do the right thing, but rather what would most benefit the Federalist Society agenda which Garland is a well known meme we of. I find it completely ignorant to overlook these circumstances and say the complete hypocrisy between these cases is due to simply over trusting employees. This is what weaponization of the Justice system looks like, and it happened on Garlands watch. And if these prosecutors that he so blindly trusted were wrong in there pursuit of Justice, have they been reprimanded? Are they still currently employees after misleading their boss or bending the scales of Justice to pursue their own political motives? Nah man, Garland knew exactly what was happening.

You're already acknowledging that what it means to be left or right isn't fixed.  When we look in the past - even just 10 or 20 years ago - we can already see times in which issues of those days that were left/right are no longer the case.  In fact, when considering vaccines hesitancy and foreign involvement in conflicts, the left and right have completely swapped. Yet, those on the left and right maintain that they have not changed on anything in that time.  Instead, they've just adopted a new position, then rationalized it after the fact. Again, as another example, during Clinton's presidency, the political left took the position that the personal character defects of the President could be entirely independent of that person's ability to execute the office.   How progressive, right?  Obviously, the political right voiced opposition to it through a \\"traditional\\" rationalization.With Trump, the exact opposite is now true.  And from then to now, there hasn't been some radical socio-political/philosophical change in the last 30 years on this front.No, what happened is the same as what always happens.  Team Left rationalized the actions of their team through their political lens and Team Right did the same.  And when the actions are in total opposition of those today, they don't update their core philosophical positions, they just rationalize once again. These contradictions are not just one-off curiosities.  These are what demonstrate that the belief there is some kind of underlying philosophical reality that causes people to be on the political left or right, simply isn't true at all.I mean, haven't you been unsatisfied with every hand-waving rationalization that attempts to explain how the political parties \\"changed sides\\" from the 1940's to today?There is no center.  There is no left.  There is no right.  There is only the superficial facade of these dichotomies, echoed and reinforced through the political conversation apparatuses.  *Any* position can be adopted by either side and rationalized accordingly.  That there are positions today that are on one side or the other is merely happenstance.  Given more time, they could shift to the other side.","title":"CMV: The most meaningful way to assess the amount 'left' or 'right' a political party is, is to place the 'center' at the present status quo"},{"text":"  but I think he'll have issues killing his own.He absolutely would not.

But in a corrupted city this institution grew to be most mischievous. For it was no longer those of greatest worth, but those who had most influence, who sought the magistracies; while all who were without influence, however deserving, refrained through fear. This untoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar results, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and reducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became perfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer to have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and the weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the consulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting for the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those who knew best how to vanquish their enemies. And afterwards, instead of selecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had most influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their institutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.\\"- Machiavelli, Niccol.

Excerpt: These are challenging days for Democrats ahead of Donald Trumps return to the White House. Their party has yet to land on a clear message or a leading messenger, leaving the president-elect mostly unchallenged, even as Republicans exposed their own vulnerabilities and divisions when Trump nearly derailed a stopgap funding deal with last-minute demands. The GOP-triggered crisis, resolved just in time to avert a government shutdown Saturday, created an opportunity for Democrats, with some in the party closely watching House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), an emerging voice who isnt yet well known nationally. House Democrats are prepared to stop far-right Republicans in their tracks and deliver for the people, Jeffries wrote in a Saturday fundraising email. A largely muddled response to Trump stands in contrast with eight years ago when his surprise victory mobilized Democrats to march and fueled massive fundraising, as lawmakers and governors jockeyed to be his most vocal critic. Many in the party now are taking a more cautious approach, acknowledging they will have to work with Trump in some areas.","title":"Democrats Are Adrift as Donald Trump Prepares to Take Power"},{"text":"I used to call it the smokescreen before I heard the definition Steve\\"build the wall convicted fraudster pardoned Bannon said.Flood the zone Culture wars are the magic beans of our time it's where all of our money is going only the beanstalk is the ladders they are pulling up.","title":"Donald Trump Comes to Matt Gaetz's Defense, Says Ethics Report 'Very Unfair'"},{"text":"Look at that picture.Im telling you, despite everything that wasnt perfect and there are things that bother me for sure, Biden and his administration have played excellent politics during his administration.?There he is, doing the calm measured appropriate happy warrior thing the president is supposed to do, is required to do to effectively be President, and then he plunges the knife in deeper on the way out.I think that we will feel positive the affects of the Biden administration for decades to come.

Those with removal orders but who are not going to Mexico or the EU they require consent of the country to return them, days-months which means they need detention capacity (there is almost no available immigration detention capacity) unless its Venezuela who are not accepting deportations.Next are those who are removable without court intervention, those who have been in the US &lt;2y and didn't come through an official border post (IE haven't been admitted under any status) or later make an application to USCIS (asylum etc), they have to find them though. Same deal with the Mexico/EU special case and need to detain everyone else.Anyone with a pending asylum application (the bulk of them) the average wait for an asylum case to be resolved and a removal order to be granted (assuming they are not successful) is nearly 10 years. Immigration courts currently receive nearly double the number of cases a year that they can clear.I don't think most of the staff for CBP and ICE are willing to go to prison for Trump's deportations.

Left or right, traditional or progressive - anybody can take either side of these positions and argue that their camp justifies that position.  Consider, if you will, the public forgiveness of an individual.  Each side valorizes the need for forgiveness, *when it comes to protecting public figures on their socio-political team.*  And that same rationalization, that wants to pardon Assange, or Luigi, or the Jan 6  rioters, or Hunter Biden, can be marshalled into arguments both in favor of, or in opposition to, either side of the \\"rehabilitation or containment\\" ethos.

Johnson might even be so stupid as to try and get CPD and the NG involved, and create a massive crisis where there doesn't need to be one, which might appease the base, but certainly alienate others who have to deal with the fallout (protests, riots, etc.).That's ultimately going to be the biggest win for the GOP.

Campaigning and voter outreach cost a ton of money, so politicians always need access to wealth or the wealthy to get any power in a representative democracy, meaning that the wealthy will get access to politics or politicians. Military, corporate, and political interests are so fundamentally intertwined that there's no way for the government to b immune to corporate interests. These pressures apply to political parties just as much as politicians, meaning even the rare populist or grassroots candidate will become ensnared in the web of influence. Even if we dissolved the Presidency, Senate, and Congress and became a direct democracy, we'd still be an oligarchy. The wealthy would have power over what people see and hear, and therefore how they think and vote.Saying that a country is an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy is like saying a doctor is masquerading as a dentist.

No 17 year old belongs in this business, voluntary or not.If the general public wants to actually help trafficking victims, look at the smaller organizations that are not getting tons of funding.  There is an organization called The Cupcake girls that works tirelessly in the PNW to help people who have been trafficked.  There is another organization called \\"Sex workers and survivors united\\" that was founded(and is still ran by) a trafficking survivor who was trafficked by her own father when she was 8. She is now a NYT published journalist, and has also spoken at UN hearings.(Good luck getting any publication to allow her to write about her experiences, though.)  Many of the huge anti-trafficking orgs have direct ties to the NCOSE and The heritage foundation.

Representative democracy was never intended to be government of the people for the people. Representative democracy has always been a capitulation to the common folk, but it's aim was still to concentrate power among the powerful. There are multiple studies that show how Congress passes legislation based on corporate interest and the rich, and public opinion is barely a concern (can link to sources if you want but should be easy to find). From the start, the founders worried about mob rule and tried to organize government in a way that there were strong checks to keep public opinion from dominating government. Direct democracy and lottocracy are governments for and of the people. Representative democracy is designed to allow for rich and powerful people to have a disproportionate control over politics. Insider trading is essentially legal for government workers, bribery is legal if not done explicitly, so many politicians get extremely lucrative executive board seats after leaving office. This isn't new, it isn't a bug, it was always the goal. Recently it has gotten more explicit with Elon bs, but this is the system working as intended. If you're interested in a government that actually aims to keep wide power distribution, look up lottocracy/sortion, and the various conceptions of hybrid lottocratic systems that aim to reduce capture and corrption","title":"CMV: The United States is an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy"},{"text":"It worked for Russia.","title":"U.S. is becoming a kleptocracy, oligarchy: Sen.

However, following its publication others have scrutinized it and found that a lot of its findings don't hold up. Here's an article that provides a good review of the critiques of the study if you want to give it a read: [https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study)But to summarize the main points from this article:Researchers critiquing the paper found that middle-income Americans and rich Americans actually agree on an overwhelming majority of topics. Out of the 1,779 bills in the Gilens/Page data set, majorities of the rich and middle class agree on 1,594; there are 616 bills both groups oppose and 978 bills both groups favor. **That means the groups agree on 89.6 percent of bills.**Bashir and Branham/Soroka/Wlezien find that on these 185 bills, the rich got their preferred outcome **53 percent** of the time and the middle class got what they wanted **47 percent** of the time. **The difference between the two is not statistically significant.** ?And there are some funny examples in the list of middle-class victories. For instance, **the middle class got what they wanted on public financing of elections: in all three 1990s surveys included in the Gilens data, they opposed it, while the rich favor it. That matches up with more recent research showing that**?[**wealthy people are more supportive of public election funding**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379411000291)**.**The bolded sentence in the last blurb is my emphasis, since private funding of elections is a pretty central component of most \\"America is an oligarchy\\" discourse - but ironically, middle-class voters support the status quo on campaign finance more so than the wealthy on average.","title":"CMV: The United States is an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy"},{"text":" our system is not democratic.

It's the last thing Congress should be allowed to regulate.Finally, I'd call out that money in politics isn't everything.

We have to bring Christianity back into our lives and back into what will be again a great nation, he continued. There you have it. Lets make America pray again.On Monday, the day before Christmas eve, Trump posted a link for supporters to buy a Les Paul-style six-string from Trump Guitars, weeks after legendary guitar manufacturer Gibson hit the website with a cease-and-desist order.The stretch run of the 2024 election saw Trump launch Trump coins and a truly special line of Trump-branded watches, including a gold, diamond-encrusted tourbillon hes selling for $100,000, around the same time that he was accusing Democrats of wanting to kill babies after birth and his wife, Melania, was noting Americans difficulties buying household necessities.The Trump familys merchandising spree isnt over and may just be getting started.

I am not saying that on its own it changed the US from Democracy to Oligarchy but it was a big milestones on the trends that way. Having transparancy about where money comes from an limits on how much money you can spend on politicians should not be controversial in a democracy.To me Trump's first administration is a strong indication that what we have is democracy and?*not*?oligarchy.

Contrary to popular sentiment, oligarchy is impossible in a system like the US has, unless it is subverted (in progress).

You need an ~~authoritative~~ authoritarian government that extends government powers to non-governmental individuals so that they can act with the authority of the government.Notice that the word \\"rich\\" didn't appear there? Oligarchs are almost always rich, but being rich doesn't make you an oligarch, it's the other way around. In Russia, for example, an oligarch is typically rich by virtue of the state resources that they control. It is their extra-governmental authority that conveys wealth, not the other way around.Here's a test: if you take away a person's wealth and assets, do they continue to be powerful? If the answer is yes, then they might be an oligarch. If the answer is no, then they were just a rich person throwing their economic weight around. If you take away an oligarch's wealth and assets, they can just get more by virtue of their authority.edit: fixed typo authoritative vs. authoritarian.","title":"U.S. is becoming a kleptocracy, oligarchy: Sen.

Reading the 37-page report, its understandable that Gaetz was trying to prevent it from going public, even as his former colleagues on Capitol Hill decided to release the devastating results of their years long investigation.It is now clear that when Gaetz was nominated by president-elect Donald Trump for the post of Attorney General, many of his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill already knew the scale of his alleged misconduct. Among the reports lurid revelations, Gaetz is accused of spending tens of thousands of dollars on sex and drugs, of engaging in sexual activity with a 17-year old underage girl at a 2017 party and paying her $400, a sum that she understood to be payment for sex.The report claims that between 2017 and 2020 Gaetz made payments in excess of $90,000 to a dozen different women, and used illegal drugs including cocaine and ecstasy on multiple occasions.It also alleges that he used his position to claim falsely that one of his sexual partners was a Florida constituent in need of assistance to obtain a new passport. Gaetz denies any laws were broken, claiming that during his 30s he was working very hard, and playing hard too.He insists his conduct was not criminal, but on social media last week, he wrote that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have. It will now fall to the Department of Justice C ironically, the very government department that Trump wanted him to lead C to determine whether a fresh federal investigation of his conduct is warranted.In February 2023, prosecutors decided not to bring charges against him, reportedly concluding that any case was not sufficiently strong to stand up in court. Whether the House report changes anything in that regard is unclear. But what rings clear as a bell is that Gaetz should never, ever have been chosen by Trump as a possible future Attorney General.Read more here: [https://inews.co.uk/news/matt-gaetz-why-donald-trump-pick-republicans-3449663](https://inews.co.uk/news/matt-gaetz-why-donald-trump-pick-republicans-3449663)","title":"Republicans knew about Matt Gaetz allegations - so why did Trump still pick him?"},{"text":"All of conservativism is just making excuses and conspiracy theories to stay in their alternate reality. - Climate change will cause me some kind of inconvenience?

These include the NATO summit in The Hague, a meeting of the Bucharest Nine in Vilnius, and the World Economic Forum in Davos.Looking ahead, Duda will host a Three Seas Initiative summit on April 28-29, 2025, in Warsaw. In addition to leaders from the 12 member states of the forum, Pawlak said heads of state from partner countriesamong them the United Stateswill also be invited. A formal invitation will be dispatched after Trumps inauguration.Trumps previous participation in 2017, at President Dudas invitation, will provide a sense of continuity if he chooses to attend next year, Pawlak noted. His presence would serve as a symbolic link, especially as the upcoming summit is the tenth anniversary meeting of the Three Seas Initiative.The Three Seas Initiative comprises EU countries between the Baltic, Adriatic, and Black Seas, focusing on infrastructure, energy, and regional security. Pawlak underscored that strong ties with strategic partners like the United States remain central to the forums objectives.(jh)Source: IAR, Polskie Radio 24","title":"Poland to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to 2025 Three Seas Initiative summit in Warsaw"},{"text":"Sometimes I wonder I wonder if he's just putting stuff out there as white noise.","title":"Trump says he's going to change the name of America's tallest mountain back to Mount McKinley"},{"text":"Well guess you are going to be in for a surprise in a couple years when the exact same thing happens the last time Trump was elected, and that is he will lose control of congress in the midterms and Republicans will lose the presidency because they can't govern.

State, transitioned to a career in politics after his athletic pursuits. He made his political debut in January 2021 by announcing a campaign to challenge GOP veteran Rep. Virginia Foxx. However, when U.S. Rep. Ted Budd announced he would not seek reelection in the 13th Congressional District, Hines redirected his efforts to that race, ultimately losing to Rep. Wiley Nickel.On Sunday, Trump announced a slate of technology appointments, including that of Bo Hines, who will work alongside White House A.I. &amp; Crypto Czar David O. Sacks. The announcement was made via a news release and Trumps Truth Social platform.Sacks, a?Silicon Valley investor close to Elon Musk,?has supported Trump, including by hosting a fundraiser in June that drew several cryptocurrency executives and tech investors in San Francisco.Hines, 29, will serve as the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, which Trump referred to as the Crypto Council. The council will be chaired by Sacks.We will unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure Americas technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation, Trump wrote.I'm still waiting for a concept of the most amazing universal bestest health care plan promised during the 2015 campaign.

In the UK, for instance, no right wing government has dared to dismantle the tax funded NHS system that provides care free at the point of service and medicine at a nominal price to everyone. Here I'm talking about the UK Conservative party that was in power for 14 years. Yes, you can criticise them for under investment to NHS, but at no point did they dare to challenge the ideological base of the system. And that's the right wing party in the UK. The left wing Labour is of course even more in favour of NHS and now that it's in power, it's pumping more money into it. But the crucial thing is that there is a consensus view among all parties that a universal healthcare system is a good thing. In the US, even the supposedly left wing Democratic party can't push itself to write that in their manifesto.Then the maternity leave. Yes, in the manifesto, there is a mention of 12 week paid leave for the mother. That's of course great but it's far less than in most European countries. In Nordic countries, the mothers get a year. In addition, many countries offer on top of that the mother a possibility to stay home even longer and not lose her job. And the thing completely missing in the Democrat manifesto is the paternity leave.
