It's hard to accurately put into words just how encompassing the Right Wing Pipeline and media community is, unless you've experienced it first hand I don't really expect you to understand just how bad it is. For most men they've been drip fed propaganda to some degree for most of their lives.\\n     \\nFrom the moment I started using the internet socially as a kid in middle school to now as I'm an adult in my mid to late 20's I've been exposed to it to some degree. Growing up it was Milo Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro compilations of them arguing with first year college students recommended to myself and others by Google, of course I was too young to really recognize that their arguments didn't work and that they only \\"won\\" by talking over the other person. As I grew older men like Jordan Peterson became more commonly recommended to me by Google, for a 15 year old going through puberty and the stupid stuff of being a kid, they offered solutions that at least on the surface made sense of what we were going through, the problem is it required selfishness and disregard for the people around you's problems. This is thankfully around the time I escaped, I realized that the weird people who are different that I had almost been trained to not like are actually not that different and just living life like me. As I've gotten older the more professional participants of this media pipeline started being recommended to me, PragerU would try and drum up that good ole American exceptionalism while shoving anything problematic out of view. Content creators for the hobbies I grew up to like and are traditionally associated with men (Carpentry, Computers, Gaming, that sort of stuff) often are themselves a piece of the pipeline whether they know it or not, they're seen as reputable so when they sprinkle some controversial opinions it's more likely to be seen as correct.\\n       \\nLike an earlier commenter said the Democrats haven't done a single thing to try and connect with this demographic, no shit that after decades of being courted by conservatives they're choosing them, all they've been exposed to is the right saying that the left hates men and when they do interact with the left they're called idiots for having grown up into a propaganda filled space.","title":"Mitch McConnell falls during Senate Republican lunch"},{"text":"Lyndon LaRouche ran for president from prison in 1976.","title":"Bragg says Trump's crimes and 'history of malicious conduct' are too serious for his hush-money case to be dismissed"},{"text":"She's bringing lip-plumping services to help the Greeks in their beauty regimens.","title":"Trump chooses Kimberly Guilfoyle as his pick for Greece ambassador"},{"text":"Honest question.

The guy literally grew up self-identifying as an anti-establishment hippie. Yet now that he is in his 30s, he has gone full far-right extremism. Guy absolutely loves Trump, and DID NOT vote for him in 2016. His reasoning? His broke ass got a stimulus check that said Donald Trump on it, so he was immediately convinced that it was all him. Of course, we know that the payments were the result of 3 bills that were passed by Congress after a large push by Democratic leaders - that were given to Trump for his approval. But that really doesn't matter when the average voter is unwilling to actually do logical research and compare sources.For the most part, Trump wasn't even a part of the negotiations. He only started to chirp after it was put on his desk, and he realized it would do wonders for the PR of his now ending messy presidency. So, of course he SAID, \\"We want bigger checks! More money for the people! This is all CHINA'S fault!\\" before he signed the bills into law. The painfully sad reality is that many of these people actually believe that Trump is gonna give out another stimmy. They think the economy is currently so bad that it calls for that course of action. When the truth is that Republicans hated Trump's decision to issue the first checks, DURING A NATIONAL CRISIS THAT FROZE OUR ECONOMY! Trump was against the bill, calling it wasteful spending before he realized he could be remembered for it. The only thing that he actually advocated for was that his name had to be on all the checks, which actually delayed the crisis relief payments by 2 weeks. And it fucking worked.

Favorite sons, such as Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, were groomed, financed, and supported.In 2016, the CNP put its partners money, data, and ground game behind Donald Trump, as the ultimate transactional candidate. Trump promised it retrograde social policies, a favorable tax regime, regulatory retreats, and its choice of federal judges. He delivered in spades. By 2020, the leaders of the CNP were ready to go to extreme lengths to keep himand themselvesin power.Over the final year of the Trump presidency, the CNP took center stage. By January 2020, its leading figures had become sought-after guests on talk shows and frequent visitors to the White House. Many of its stated goals had been advanced. By March, the Republican Senate had confirmed more than 185 of Trumps conservative nominees for the federal bench. All but eight of the judges had ties to the Federalist Society, headed by longtime CNP members Eugene Meyer and Leonard Leo. Two of the CNPs favored Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, had been confirmed.Donald Trump remained a dependable ally, asking only for an audience for his megalomania and a free pass for the business interests of the Trump brand. In return, he delivered his dynamism and his unshakeable base.Ultimate realization of the CNPs agenda depended on winning a second term for Trump in November.

Diplomats and a foreign military arent completely subject to the laws and jurisdiction of the US (diplomatic immunity), they dont have to pay taxes to the US, and even their embassies, while on US soil, are considered to be part of their native country. Hence their kids dont get birthright citizenship. It made sense to have this exception for those kids because there was the assumption that the diplomatic/military parents would return back to their home countries after their time in the US and that the kids would grow up and be a citizen of that other country. Plus it would reduce any potential conflicts of interest between the countries and avoid the situation where part of a diplomatic family (adults) are citizens of their home country and the other part that was born in the country where the parent was posted (child) was a citizen of that other country. However, all other people, including foreigners, are completely subject to the jurisdiction of the US (they can get arrested,  they have to pay taxes to the US, even if here illegally, they are not obliged to another government, etc.).  As such, according to the 14th Amendment, their children, if born on US soil, can be US citizens.","title":"CNN Commentator Blows a Gasket Over Trump's Proposal for Birthright Citizenship ??"},{"text":"I have to applaud trump for this, as much as I dislike him.

I was one a victim of a start up company that hid a non-compete in my employment forms and when I left the company because they misrepresented the job they tried to ban me from making a living within 200 miles of my home.   Literally tried to force me to be unemployed at my profession which was not dealing with any IP or company secrets.  It was literally the skills I brought to them from my prior employments and they were learning from me.I had my attorney friend drop them a letter threatening to sue (which I could afford) and they tore up the non-compete. It was intimidation.  They also threatened to sue for my sign on bonus, but they balked there too.  Meanwhile I needed a lawyer - no cost to me thankfully.So yes a non-compete clause is mostly misused by employers and to your point even in the EU the rules vary.  Unreasonable non-compete clauses can be partly or entirely nullified by the court, but this requires litigation by employees.   I think the court in the US made the right choice.  Why should your employer prevent you from getting a better job for more money?  In fact, some of these companies have fired employees and then tried to enforce the non-compete as punishment.  Non-complete should be a voluntary agreement based on the role and transparent prior agreement and not as a HR policy meant to strangle employees.","title":"Trump names Andrew Ferguson as head of Federal Trade Commission to replace Lina Khan"},{"text":"Im sure someone will write a sternly worded letter","title":"Report: Top Ethics Committee Democrat Leaked Matt Gaetz Report Details, Violating Sworn Oath"},{"text":"The way this made me cackle - thank you for the laugh!

He also has a habit of threatening to sue anyone who hurts his precious feelings.Trump has threatened, on several occasions, to abuse his power as president through executive actions and unitary executive privileges to seek swift retribution against his political adversaries. And this is while Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that it's his opponents who are \\"weaponizing the justice system\\" against him In January 2023, a federal judge fined Trump and his attorney nearly $1 million, characterizing him as \\"a prolific and sophisticated litigant who is repeatedly using the courts to seek revenge on political adversaries\\"Trump's M.O. has always been to seek legal vengeance against his perceived enemies. He has even threatened to jail or \\"go after\\" his political opponents, his naysayers in the media, journalists, congressmen, civil servants, judges, \\"radical leftists,\\" anyone who he believes participated in stealing the 2020 election from him, and the list goes on. Then there's this nugget: In 2016, the American Bar Association (ABA) commissioned a report to highlight Trump's excess litigation, entitled \\"Donald J. Trump is a Libel Bully but also a Libel Loser\\", but initially declined to publish it fearing being sued by TrumpMore on Trump's legal history:Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which included financial crimes, multi-million dollar real estate and tax disputes, state law violations, corrupt business practices and defamation suits.Trump has lied about his wealth for decades, and he threatens to sue anyone who dares to speculate about his actual net worth.He is a serial fraud, con artist, adulterer and cheater. He cheats on his wives, on his taxes, he cheats at golf.Donald Trump has literally been indicted for \\"defrauding The United States\\"He's been indicted for conspiring to overturn the last election, for trying to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, to help *him* steal the election, but him and his supporters still claim that *Democrats* stole the election in 2020He's been indicted for attempting to intimidate state election officials into manipulating the vote for him, he's repeatedly refused to acknowledge how Russian election meddling helped him win his first election, but Trump and his supporters claim that it's his opponents who are interfering in elections.What's more, he's abused his power and wealth to obstruct and delay legal efforts to hold him accountable for these crimes.He also used his power as president to enrich himself. Trump has not only ruined or bankrupted practically every business he's been involved in, but he's consistently profited off of screwing over anyone who has had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties his entire life, he even lied to get on the Forbes list.Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money, particularly from his father and from banks, avoided paying income tax for many years, amassed unsustainable debts, then dumped them onto others.As president, Trump directed taxpayer money towards his businesses. The secret service and other government parties spent exorbitant amounts of money at Trump properties and on accommodations.Trump often made foreign and domestic business deals while president. Booking events for foreign governments at Trump owned locations in order to curry favor with his admin.Trump promoted his properties while President, and hosted taxpayer funded events.He's been indicted for obstructing the governments efforts to retrieve classified documents scattered all over his Mar-A-Lago residence, and on multiple occasions that we know of, showed those classified materials to people not authorized to view them, all while lying to the DOJ and National Archives for over a year in order to impede their efforts to retrieve those materials.And yes, Donald Trump has been convicted of 34 felonies involving his efforts to falsify business records in order to conceal a crime.On more than one occasion, Trump has evaded justice by power of executive privilege and through broad immunities granted to him by a Supreme Court he helped pack with kowtowing loyalists.Evidence shows that Trump has obstructed justice on dozens of occasions. But proponents of the Unitary executive theory argue that you can't indict a sitting president. Which is exactly what Bill Barr did after Mueller found that Trump had obstructed justice ten times during the investigation.And again, despite all of this, Trump and his supporters claim that it's Democrats who have \\"weaponized the justice system\\" against Trump. The gall...Don't forget the time Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposesAs part of the settlement, Trump was required to acknowledge his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation and it was forced to shutter its doors and dissolve under court supervision.Then there's Trump University...In 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University. New York regulators forced Trump to stop using the term \\"university\\" to describe his grifting scheme, calling Trump's use of the word, \\"misleading and even illegal.\\"Former students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.There was also a separate class action lawsuit against Trump U, Trump's counterclaims were dismissed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against one of the students who made her experiences at the \\"university\\" public. Trump was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and extra costs and he was eventually found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.He conflates accountability with persecution because he's spent his entire life exploiting his own wealth and privilege to avoid being incriminated.Mr. Law and Order everybody!He's been held liable in civil court for sexual assault, and accused of sexual abuse, harassment or rape by dozens of women, including one of his own ex wives.He's also indicated, on a number of occasions, that he will disregard the constitution to achieve his goals.Mr. Law and Order has decided that he's entitled to broad immunities and unitary executive powers that he will use dismantle our system of checks and balances.Don't forget how him, his father, and Trump management were sued by the Justice Department for violating the fair housing act and discriminating against black renters. And after he was forced to settle, he still declared a victory.The party of \\"personal responsibility\\" can't seem to take responsibility for a goddamn thing.","title":"Bragg says Trump's crimes and 'history of malicious conduct' are too serious for his hush-money case to be dismissed"},{"text":"That might have been the case in 2012","title":"GOP Floats Social Security Cuts After Musk Capitol Hill Visit - Alaska Native News"},{"text":"She was probably #1 on the list in creating the inflationary environment.","title":"Janet Yellen warns Donald Trumps sweeping tariffs could derail inflation progress | US Treasury secretary says broad trade penalties might significantly raise costs to households"},{"text":"As if everyone thought he couldnt be more of an asshole,  he breaks the POS mold yet again. \\nWhat a miserable, awful, individual.","title":"Why Trump is suddenly calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau governor | \\nWhy would Donald Trump call the Canadian leader \\"governor\\"?

Polls generally showed people liked Harris the more they got to know her, and her campaign staff says their internal polling reflected that. The problem was that it was hard to know who Harris was because she called herself a pragmatist who had been a progressive moving to the center to be more business-friendly her whole career while also trying to blame corporate greed for economic concerns. Her tax policies were to the right of Biden and she went from pro-M4A to just expanding the ACA. This lack of clarity on what she believed was the same problem she had in the 2020 primaries. Union leaders and her own campaign workers had complained that their message wasnt resonating in direct conversations with voters who should have been in the base. Bernie and super PACs both complained Harris had unclear economic messaging.  So people struggled to learn who she was and what she wanted because she comes across as just endorsing the status quo, but they liked her when they learned more about her. Being unable to articulate what she could do differently than Biden really hurt her given how much people want to hear clear answers about change.","title":"Biden Says He Regrets Not Signing Name to Covid Checks Like Trump Did"},{"text":"Before the RNC","title":"Trump chooses Kimberly Guilfoyle as his pick for Greece ambassador"},{"text":"Oof","title":"Manhattan DA and state AG say Trumps criminal and civil cases in New York should not be dismissed because hes president"},{"text":"That is not what Im saying.

Now, I will lay out what I mean. I'm talking about defunding the police. I'm talking about raising taxes on wealthy corporations and businesses, and finally, immigration.  I'm going to cite these three specific examples because they're the most egregious. Defunding the police overwhelmingly negatively impacts your PoC voters. You say to defund them because of the killing of some black men while completely ignoring the circumstances of those instances.  I get the reaction when it is dealing with unarmed individuals, and that is justified. However, there's much room for case by case basis here. That being said,  by defunding the police, you reduce the amount of money going to them that could be used for better training, restructuring community support and outreach, at a time when those things are exactly whats needed, and you limit the ability to effectively engage in communities that most need police. Gang violence is at all-time highs. Violence, in general, is at all-time highs. Police are the first line of defense.  Can they do better? Obviously,  but not of you take away funding.   Rather than that, why not push for better oversight, including independent oversight and more accountability of officers who engage in poor behavior. Defunding the police was a stupid, poorly thought-out idea, and that it gained so much traction was equally stupid. Logical thinking people were never going to support this. All the support was from irrational, emotional people.  In the end, what you got was even more crime, more victims, and people fleeing your cause because it was negatively impacting them on personal levels. To my second point. The government is 36 trillion dollars in debt. This despite taking in more money than they've ever taken in previously. We also watched in real time what happened in Lahaina as well as North Carolina, Tennessee, and other hurricane impacted communities.  Simultaneously, as our own people struggled (and continue to struggle), hundreds of billions of dollars flowed out to proxy wars that we have no business funding. Hell, the fall of Assad in Syria was quite literally the pentagon fighting the CIA, considering we were funding both sides of that conflict. Just as we continue to do in Israel. Raising the taxes on corporations and wealthy elites because the government says doing so will enable it to do all these things like Healthcare and whatever else was literally the stupidest thing I'd ever heard. But people bought it. Taxing people to give that money to a government whose most effective policy is wasting it makes zero sense. But to top that off,  Raising those taxes to give that money to what is at best a dysfunctional government and at worst, an antagonistic government bordering on tyrannical means thousands of people get laid off, companies leave taking what taxes they do pay with them,  and you end up further in the hole with nothing to show for it.Finally, unchecked immigration. The biggest problem here is you're giving people streaming across the border free housing, free access to debit cards preloaded with thousands of dollars, and free Healthcare while at the same time, you're ignoring your constituents whom have been begging for the same sort of help. Put yourselves in the shoes of PoC from crime-ridden inner cities where they see no economic opportunities and no investment in those same communities. Now, imagine being them, watching as these people fresh into the country are handed the same things you've been promised for 50+ years. And it's handed to them day 1.  Would you vote for the people doing that? Yeah, me neither.Democrats biggest problem is an inability to think long-term and control their emotional knee-jerk reactions. The secondary biggest problem is the perception that they simply don't care about Americans. You can say they do all you want and point to whatever policy you want, but the reality is people are not feeling that. We watched billions get poured into a plan to connect rural households to high-speed internet. Then we watched as none of that money went out because DEI policies put up so much red tape that no companies could get funds from it. We watched as billions was set aside to build ev charging stations, and then the government built 8 of them. This circles back to the levels of wasteful spending happening daily and why you will never get people who think to sign onto increasing taxes on anyone. They see it as nothing more than a waste of money because government will just spend it recklessly.But you are right. Unless dems figure that out, they're done in elections. Worse, if Trumps 4 years end up being successful, and people come out better off, it's going to be even harder to ignore this time. And you've only got your party to blame. Best advice: stop with knee jersey reactions. Stop with emotional tirades. You just look foolish and petty.  Do better with your messaging. The Harris campaign trotting up celebrity after celebrity doesn't speak anything to rural or underprivileged voters. If anything, it shows them that conservatives are right, democrats ARE the party of wealthy elites.  You can learn from your mistakes and fund your way back to some form of more moderate common ground, or, you can continue on this oath and be cooked for the foreseeable future.  Choice is yours.I'll be fine either way ","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"If pictures were used to describe words in the dictionary, the pic of Mel flirting with Justin and looking straight into his eyes would describe what lust means.","title":"Why Trump is suddenly calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau governor | \\nWhy would Donald Trump call the Canadian leader \\"governor\\"?

Although I would argue that most people aren't necessarily becoming more right wing (some definitely are, but not all). They just want an alternative to what we have now, and the Conservatives are the only real opposition. In most aspects we're still fairly liberal, I don't think many people would be willing to give up our healthcare for example. Immigration is the one issue that has had a real shift to the right, because years of irresponsible immigration policy is doing very real damage to this country. Unfortunately, many people are beginning to take out their frustration over that on immigrants instead of the policy makers, and I can understand how someone looking in from the outside could think that there's a huge wave of racism taking us over. But there are genuinely serious problems with our immigration that can't be understated.  \\n  \\nIt's a real shame, because I think that the majority of people here still would be, and *were*, happy to live in a multicultural society.

Such a constitutional limitation on the range of available sentences would further diminish any impact on defendants presidential decision- making without going so far as to discard the indictment and jury verdict altogether.In another scenario, prosecutors suggested the judge could take a similar approach to how courts handle a convicted felon who dies before being sentenced or appealing their conviction.This Court could similarly terminate the criminal proceeding by placing a notation in the record that the jury verdict removed the presumption of innocence; that defendant was never sentenced; and that his conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed on appeal because of presidential immunity, prosecutors wrote.Prosecutors also say if Merchan delays the sentencing until after Trumps term, the judge could agree to limit his presentencing considerations to exclude any of Trumps behavior while in office.Trumps attorneys have argued that the pending criminal proceedings could interfere with his presidential functions. They argued the district attorneys ridiculous suggestion that they could simply resume proceedings after President Trump leaves Office, more than a decade after they commenced their investigation in 2018, is not an option.Regardless of what Merchan does, his ruling is likely to be appealed by the losing side.The idea of sentencing Trump to no prison time is so silly, because what kind of sentence is that?! A sentence is supposed to be a punishment. He should at least be made to pay a fine. I know that wouldn't hurt him in reality, but still, it should happen.And the part about treating him similar to how a dead convicted felon would be treated is the part that really made me mad. Trump is still alive!! He shouldn't be treated as if he's died. That's ridiculous and unfair. He is alive and he committed 34 felonies and he should get punished for them. I don't want to see any kind of silly nonsense language that lets him slip away without punishment.And yes, it's totally fine and okay to sentence Trump when (if?) he's out of office in four years. Since there has to be a four-year delay, it's fair for the case to resume when time is up. I don't care if Trump's attorney's complain about it.","title":"Manhattan DA and state AG say Trumps criminal and civil cases in New York should not be dismissed because hes president"},{"text":"I thought as an Ole Miss fan I'd be safe here.","title":"Nancy Mace caught on video locking lips with another woman.

You dont pay into anything, your taxes are directly paying for those using the program. Its not like the IRS is setting aside the money you pay into an account. That would just be a traditional retirement account. Its money in, money out. The benefits you get paid out are based on something average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), which is calculated from your highest earning 35 years of work. To simplify, the more you contributed to the program over your career, the better the benefits at the end. But its also a progressive system, meaning the lower you earn, the more of a percentage of your AIME you get back. Which is fine, because low income people will only be using Social Security to live during retirement. But as for these chucklefucks, if they somehow manage to reduce benefits, you will just be screwed.

They should absolutely seize this opportunity to feign a new platform confirming that Democrats are against popular vote elections for president and want to stick to the electoral college. Trump would fall for it and command his party to eliminate the EC. However, Todays Democratic Party is spineless and consumed by fear. Most of Biden and his partys actions are reactions made out of fear such as considering preemptive pardons, which would do nothing more than confirm the false allegations of corruption that Republicans have been making for years and give them decades of platform messaging that will resonate with voters of all stripes. But Think about the idiocy of it. If the justice system becomes so fucked that courts are allowing prosecutions of J6 commission members, then why would those same courts honor any pardons from Joe Biden? At that point, SCOTUS could just deem Bidens entire presidency illegitimate and reverse everything he did.The only way to reverse the DNCs path to ruin is to start thinking like the GOP, which understood a long time ago that American voters are largely ignorant and lazy and need to be told how to think. Democrats need to cut through the noise by doing strategically unique things that send certain messages.For example: Biden could issue preemptive pardons for bribery, malfeasance or treason for SCOTUS justices Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito. Democrats would initially be like, Why let them off the hook? Because there is no hook and never will be! Imbeciles need to accept that there is and never will be legal accountability for these people unless they aggressively change their modus operandi. For now, American politics is only and 100% about strategic messaging (theater) and actions make no difference unless they are paired with effective messaging. Issuing a pardon for bribery and treason sends the message that someone committed bribery and treason.It would automatically put them on the defensive and the press would be clamoring for their responses. The two justices would say they refuse the pardons because they did nothing wrong, opening up the situation to a court challenge to force them to accept and recognize the pardons, only theyd be pressured to recuse themselves once the case makes it to the SCOTUS  All the while establishing a court record of all the unethical and corrupt shit theyve done.","title":"On the Electoral Colleges future, maybe Democrats should call Trumps bluff"},{"text":"Its sad that everything is reduced to money.

Triumphing against oppression is a form where - say for example, Harris talking about her background - is a type of identity politics. She used an inclusive framework, sort of a, \\"if i can make it, so can you.\\" Still, it's part and parcel.\\n   * The idea that the Dems, as a big coalition, should protect all vulnerable people is another form of \\"identity politics\\" that is setting policy based on group memberships.\\n   * Thinking of \\"Hispanic\\" as a singular voting bloc is a form of identity politics - it's trying to use the white/black race relations and coalition building as the blue print for all.* Why did Dems Lose? All the focus on \\"why do dems lose\\" focus around narratives involving how do they communicate policy issues and what policy issues did they prioritize? That is 100% wrong. \\n   * Voters aren't mobilized on policy issues. They're mobilized on valence issues - broad themes like \\"are you fighting for people like me\\" or \\"good vs. evil.\\" This is why Dems continue to lose broadly because they think they need to calibrate policy issues when voters are moved by valence issues.\\n   * Dems lose because they've nationalized and urbanized their party. That goes along with their party leaders. It's why as Axelrod said, Dems talking to \\"working class people\\" sounds like a missionary talking to contactless tribes. \\n   * They lose because they spend too much money on \\"positive ads\\" instead of negative partisanship. When you look at who won down ballot, especially in 2022, the Dems that do better are the ones that run \\"GOP are fucking crazy\\" campaigns. Not \\"uplift us all\\" \\n   * The idea of a switch voter - someone who goes from one campaign to another, also implies there's persuadable voters. What if the electorate isn't static and a county going for Obama and them Trump then Biden isn't people changing their minds, but it's *mobilization*. Running campaigns based on persuasion will lose if your winning is about mobilization. GOP runs campaigns about mobilization and they win.\\n   * What people don't report on enough - is that while Obama did well above the ticket, during his presidency, the Dems lost over 1000 seats along legislatures, governorships, the congress; why? The subnational gains the GOP have are durable and essential to their winning valence issues. This puts way too much pressure up ballot by having little to no down ballot base of support. \\n   * They didn't connect Trump to many of the Trump era failures.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"Yes Leon, he fcuked your sister!","title":"Elon Musk warns Republicans against standing in Trump's way  or his"},{"text":"Reminds me of \\"Old McDonald had a farm\\".

I mean you can see that they had massive gains among minority groups. However, I think you're sort of on the right track.Republicans won by making it seem like Dems were doing a lot of identity politics stuff when they really weren't. For example, there was that campaign about how \\"Kamala is for they/them while Trump is for you.\\" Another example was the Haitian eating pets thing, where Republicans were able to spin the narrative so that it seemed like Dems were highly concerned about Haitians, rather than the average American. Quite a few of my friends, and a bunch of things I saw on Reddit, indicated that Dems were the ones pushing DEI in everything.This was a bizarre tactic that managed to work really well. People kind of came to this assumption that Dems are largely focused on issues that only affect certain minority groups, rather than more major, general issues that affect a lot of people. So for example, I know plenty of people that just assumed Kamala had put forth no economic plans, had no idea how to handle foreign policy, had no tax proposals, etc. Typically, what candidates do, is point to their opponents policies, and point out the faults in them. The problem with that tactic is that it will introduce listeners to the opponents' policies. Trump just avoided doing that. Rather than saying, \\"Kamala's economic plans won't work,\\" he just said she had no economic policies and was pushing DEI. So people thought Dems were going all in on identity politics, when they weren't doing that. Now, I know what you're thinking: \\"That's just Republican pushing identity politics though.\\" No, it's not. If Republicans essentially (even if not so blatantly) said things like, \\"Straight people should vote for me,\\" that'd be identity politics. Republicans just made up ineffective electoral policies for Dems and then rallied against them.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"Ok - but that has nothing to do with your argument.

The Trump campaign made the election about identity politics and people voted against the democrats.I don't disagree with your view as you posted it but I disagree with your rationale. I think you are just rephrasing the same thing you are rejecting. If Trump won based on identity politics, why is it not also the case that the Democrats lost because of identity politics? I think both can be true.EDIT: My point here relies on the idea that Trump retained his voters and Harris lost millions of voters compared to Biden. The 40% of people who didn't vote are people who didn't vote for Harris or TrumpA large segment of the country just votes for a party and the democratic party in the past 10 years is the party of  identity politics. I personally see value in some of that stuff but it seems very clear to me that it is a substitute for a more substantive platform to use the government to help people who are struggling and solve problems in our society. If it comes down to identity politics, it's entirely possible that the side that vets white voters is going to win in a country where 60% of the country is white and a larger percent has white family members.One other thing to point out is that while Kamala Harris' campaign didn't emphasize identity politics, it was a continuation of campaigns and a political agenda does. There is an obvious subtext and it's insulting to people's intelligence on both sides politically when people deny this. Kamala Harris made it clear that she wants to do everything the same as Biden. The Biden, Obama, Clinton wing of the Democratic party very much engages in identity politics.Also, there are still very obvious ways that Harris did engage in identity politics that hurt her campaign. Her stance on Gaza hurt her campaign and any stance on Gaza/Israel is inherently identity politics which is why it is so intensely decisive. The campaign also went out of it's way to prop up neo cons like Liz Cheney over Bernie Sanders, who the Democratic party has consistently screwed over and demonized and who's supporter base is largely white males and latinos. Two groups that Kamala Harris failed to appeal to.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"he tried to with Witcher then they fucked it up.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 10, 2024"},{"text":"It's time to test the legality of the OLC \\"letter\\" that's at the root of all this.","title":"DA suggests judge could permanently halt Trumps hush money case while upholding his conviction"},{"text":"What a stupid fucking regret.

The democratic messaging on the economy was very weak - instead of pointing the blame at corporations and making the Democratic Party heavily based around making corporations pay for inflation (is it true that they are to blame for inflation? Pretty much irrelevant) they gave these hard to understand economic messaging that went over the heads of many people. The issue was that the republicans had a very strong and simple economic messaging Biden caused inflation and Im going to fix it. Nothing more needed to be said, inflation happened during Bidens presidency and no matter how much dems pointed out the economy is doing well it was impossible to overcome the fact that three years ago I could leave the grocery store and pay less and today I pay more. It doesnt even matter if I got raises - Im still upset my costs went up significantly. So if you think it was identity politics that won the election I disagree. If trump didnt have his far simpler to understand economic messaging and JUST played into identity politics purely he would be a lot worse off.

Dunno enough about Maine politics to know who could run there, but it will probably be Cooper in NC and that will be a big boost even in a neutral environment.

If Cornyn is the nominee, realistically I don't think it's a target short of a blue tsunami. If he either retires or gets primaried, it's a target gettable in a wave. How gettable would depend on both our candidate and theirs.As usual, it's too far out to know for sure, anyone (including me) making predictions is to be taken with a grain of salt until way closer to the midterms, etc etc. But 2026 is likely to be a blue wave from a combination of midterms generally going the opposite direction of the president's party and Trump's policies being unpopular once people actually see the impacts. So, at a minimum, I don't think we net lose seats, even factoring in Ossoff being our most vulnerable incumbent.I think the most likely scenario if things don't change drastically is we hold our current seats, pick up ME and NC, then maybe get an upset in one of the other seats that ties the chamber. That would make Vance the tie breaker and still keep the Senate red, but it would drastically limit what the Senate Rs can do, too. Even without the potential upset, that's a 51-49 R Senate ripe for the flipping in 2028 that also drastically limits what they can do. Outright flipping the chamber is unlikely.

By now, I hope we all agree it's a major problem.  So in our final two episodes, it's time to talk solutions.Recently, there's been a big push surrounding the [Equal Rights Amendment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment)  The short version is: The ERA is a Constitutional amendment that would require equal rights for men and women.  There is a lot of controversy as to whether it's met the requirements for ratification - it passed Congress in the 1970s, and the required 38 states have ratified it, but some revoked their ratifications, but it's not clear if states *can* revoke ratifications...anyway, long story short, the current push is for Joe Biden to declare the ERA as part of the Constitution and just add it.I'm not enough of a legal scholar to have an informed opinion on whether this would work or not.  But I can offer two important points:1. One way or another, the ERA should be in the Constitution.  Gender equality should be a given under the law.2. The ERA, or any other law or amendment, would not be a solution to the issue of sexism.I don't think point #1 is controversial, but point #2 absolutely is.  Lots of folks think that if you have a law, equality just happens.  But that's untrue, and even worse, it prevents the actual conditions you need to end sexism.**It turns out people are sneaky, and kind of suck**We've tried to solve bigotry through laws before.  Every one of these laws has been a positive, and we should keep improving our laws.  But none of them solved the root issue.Let's start with our most shameful form of discrimination: Slavery.  Treating Black people as property and taking their freedom was perfectly legal for ages.  Then in 1865, the 13th Amendment was ratified, which said it outright:Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. So that was the end of slavery and racism!  OK, no, you're smarter than that.  Racist lawmakers grabbed that \\"except as punishment for a crime...\\" part and started coming up with every excuse they could to imprison Black Americans and make them slaves again.  And when legal reforms required prisoners to be paid for their labor, they also allowed those prisoners to be paid far below minimum wage, which continues today.  Even when Black Americans weren't thrown in prison, the legal framework of segregation emerged.  While 'separate but equal' was the official line, conditions were almost never equal.  Not for housing, employment, education, or anything else that would've led to an equal society.But why talk about segregation?  Didn't we fix that?  Legally, sure - the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended legal segregation by race.  But they didn't fix racial bias.  If you don't believe me, [check out the history and numbers from much smarter analysts than me.](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/systematic-inequality/)  Or just look at your average conservative social media page.This whole saga shows that **legal reforms aren't enough to change widespread, ingrained biases.** Every one of those legal reforms was good, and helped things.  But the fundamental problem is unchanged, which is widespread racism in people.  And people are very good at finding new, creative ways to be racist when laws change what they're allowed to do.**A similar story**This series is focused more on gender rather than racial bias, but the story I just told can be repeated for women's rights as well.* Women earned the right to fair, non-abusive treatment in their marriages.  But abuse is still widespread because their partners learned to hide their abuse more carefully, and in ways that make it very hard to prove in court.* Women earned the right to work outside the home.  But they still frequently get paid less than men for the same work, and face a ton of additional bias in the workplace (basically every form of sexism I pointed out in Episodes 1-8), plus the unspoken assumption that they should do the bulk of childcare and homemaking.* Women earned the right to run for office, but they get subjected to absurd expectations and unfair stereotypes that makes it hard for them to be taken seriously.* Women earned legal protections from sexual violence, but not freedom from the assumption that they must be lying, or that it's acceptable when it happens.  It also remains extremely difficult to charge and convict perpetrators, for both legal and relational reasons.To be clear, every reform that advanced women's rights was necessary.  So is the Equal Rights Amendment.  But the problem is that every time you pass a law to address inequality, people don't decide to treat others fairly.  They find new, more creative ways to maintain the pecking order.And frankly, sometimes you can't solve inequality through laws.  How are you supposed to have a law against thinking women are too emotional and not competent, for example?  That's a vicious lie that holds women back, particularly in politics, but you can't legislate lies out of existence.  It takes another solution.**So what do we do about that?**You can't legally force people to stop being sexist.  But you can teach them not to be sexist.I've made this point before, but it needs to be made again: People can reflect on the things they say and do that perpetuate bias against women, and stop doing them.  It takes honesty and careful thought, but I know people who've really changed their attitudes this way.   I certainly have.But there's one additional key: **It requires a teacher.**Sexism isn't just catcalling and violence; it's reinforced constantly by what people say, show, and value.  This makes it hard to notice until someone points it out to you.  And that's where the role of 'teacher' comes in.  And for people who are especially resistant to this stuff, they won't care about even the best-written, most personal account from someone they don't know.  Personal relationships are what makes them more likely to listen.Oh, and there's one more thing.  [Take a look at this article and see if you can guess what it is.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a35457093/why-ive-given-up-on-talking-to-men-about-sexism/)Women have been saying this stuff for a *long* time.  I suspect a lot of them are getting tired - not just of being argued with and ignored, but facing violence for trying to speak out.Yep, that's right, boys.  It's our turn.  We've got to help share this message.  The kind of guys who need to understand this stuff often take mens' words more seriously, so it's time to use that to our advantage.  Might as well make the patriarchy do some good for once.  It doesn't mean you have to jump up on the table and scream at the other guys about their privilege.  (Actually, don't do that).  But you can disagree when a guy is going on about how men have it harder and sexism isn't real.  You can point out that it's messed up when guys are denigrating women in private.  You can even start by pointing out that Andrew Tate is full of shit, if you're unfortunate enough to know a guy who's into him.Start by thinking through what sexism in and around you looks like.  Show, even in small ways, that you're not OK with this.  And see if it leads to a conversation.  Because women are already doing lots of hard work on this.  If we join them, we'll do a lot to help their efforts.  It won't always work, but sometimes it will.  Maybe we won't pass the Equal Rights Amendment together, but we can take a few steps to create a truly equal world.  Multiply that by a few million, and maybe we come to an agreement on equal rights together.**Questions to consider**1. Have you ever tried pointing out sexism in others around you?  How did it go?  Any ideas as to why it helped, or didn't help?2. What are some specific ways we can notice and challenge sexist attitudes?3. Any other thoughts?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 10, 2024"},{"text":"Just the beginning.","title":"House GOP Uses Retreat as Opportunity to Funnel Money to Trump: Report"},{"text":"Im working in the UK and Im taxed at 45%.

B. This is a great example of how not thinking of the effects of the internet as a form of informational breakthrough. The Gutenberg Press did exactly that, hence the term \\"Free Press\\", it allowed for information to spread overnight throughout multiple communities. A subscription to NYT doesn't spread overnight to multiple communities, it only spreads to it's *subscription community*, while Podcasts/YouTube can be shared with any community.

This stems from the first set of Civil Wars in Japan, the [Genpei War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genpei_War), which gave rise to the shogunates as we know them.[One particular work stuck out to me during the exhibit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Hojyoki_codex_Daifukukohji.jpg), a piece of literature called the [Hjki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dj%C5%8Dki) (An Account of the Hut) by monk [Kamo no Chomei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamo_no_Ch%C5%8Dmei). I got to see the original scroll in person, now an Important Cultural Property.This was for a few reasons:1. [I bought the English translation years ago in 2016](https://www.amazon.com/Essays-Idleness-Hojoki-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141192100/ref=sr_1_3?crid=33J26LU90SS90&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1N-HYbkGNwtr53zSQ3xXdBGenApynyS7D1lT0qHP6Bwe6mR77hbeiwgzdMRHTUYSwyzbSDhCH4nGRswp9ix5-9iNhH8EpkjB5PxHpKAmihRCTu5FmmqmXOHT9kKDoIKON1i6Ao3ZNWcqDSXBbxRv8RU3tFzIuI2M7i3Qe5cbz_svXqIYc_9cdgh-YrePg649Dwoi22LWX_ePBTwHV9wAOodZCmy6x5jbUEXOyHfPPoc.dw7N2G3469PktHWKZtM_BeYMo4Gp-jd1EY5bX35M7jY&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=hojoki&amp;qid=1733862855&amp;sprefix=hojoki%2Caps%2C254&amp;sr=8-3), a brief phase when I was collecting classic literature for my personal bookshelf. It's a pretty short story, 15 pages in English.2. In English literature in High School, we had that phase where we were focused on American Transcendentalism. Your Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau. The *Hjki* is basically Walden but six centuries older, but Chmei was more committed to the isolation than Thoreau.3. Chmei describes the chaos of the end of the Heian period, the transitioning of the capitol at Kyoto to another place, fire tornadoes hitting the city, droughts, floods, typhoons, etc. lots of people dying and starving and this was leading up to the Gempei War.He proceeds to be overwhelmed by the social turmoil and decides to focus on himself and his study of the sutras. Just like the Walden Pond cabin, he creates a personal space, focused on self-care and meditation, reflecting on change and impermanence, or [*muj*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence).I can't help but think of our talks on our approach to processing how the next four years will be here. So I figured I share my direct encounter with a work where the very person who wrote this was expressing the same thing, with varying degrees of trauma.

That doesn't necessarily need to be resolved through UBI / minimum wage, it's just the simplest solution. Ultimately the issue lies with many people not being able to earn a living wage, so you can also adjust the cost of living (through different programs like rent controls) to help alleviate this issue.

By rejecting most things, they reduce the noise.
