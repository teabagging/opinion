You might be thinking of the Reichstag fire, which happened February 27th, 1933. It allowed for him for some extent to consolidate power which led to the whole dismantling of democracy a few months later, but it was not the entire timeframe for dismantling it. Dismantling democracy takes time. It doesnt happen immediately. Thing is though, is that unlike the GOP, the Nazis didnt immediately do mass deportations during their first few years in officein fact, after they came to power in 1933, it took them nearly 10 years to do mass deportations (some happened before then, but nowhere near on the scale as it was nearly 10 years later), probably because they knew that it would be a terrible idea first off and they had to rebuild Germany first before anything happened. They also didnt immediately pursue open imperialistic goals until they had enough resources and money to do soit wasnt until 1938 (5 years later) that they began to openly pursue it, mainly because when they first came to power in 1933, they knew that they couldnt do anything imperialistic right away because a.) The Treaty of Versailles severely fucked over the German economy and military BIG TIME, and it would take them years to rebuild from that before they could pursue aggressive foreign expansion, b.) they wouldve risked shooting themselves in the foot if they pursued open aggressive expansion earlier on because opposition would have united the German people who were against the regime and the international community, who would have caught on quite quickly to something happening, which was why they did it mainly in secret, c.) consolidating power was first and foremost something that was more important to them before they could do anything, and d.) again, as noted before, the German economy was severely fucked over twice by both the Treaty of Versailles AND the gut punch of The Great Depression and they needed to stabilize the economy first and foremost before they did anything. They unlike the GOP also were very smart people, who actually seemed to understand that it was unsustainable to pursue things all at once, really.","title":"GOP senator promises shock and awe from Trump executive orders"},{"text":"Sorry, u/Tonberry2k C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1: **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.

Their main formula is falling over mountable procedural hurdles + blame bombing rotating villains. They will always find their Lieberman. And, in saying that democrats and republicans will always act like democrats and republicans, you are again simply stating that liberalism is a dead ideology that enables fascism. And acting like voters don't vote based off propaganda is just silly. If that were true, there would be no need for billion dollar campaigns. Democrats are paid to pump out liberal propaganda.

January 6- nobody was armed because ofcourse they have security at such events, but people did sneak in pepper spray, etc. and the Cheif of police in DC was arrested for leaking n information to the domestic terrorist groups recently.

Religions are based on old scriptures, to heal and help people in need. But forcing his Christian nationalist investorss whims on everyone, very Taliban like. Nd Hitler too had evangelicals like Christian group, the opposite church spoke up and was suppressed then too. And its not just inflammatory words, its happening in many red states already for many years. 5. Took about 9-10 years for Hitler to be popular enough to win his election after multiple loses, he gained popularity because newspapers back then published his nationalist ideas he vocalized in courts during his hearings.

Obviously the more centrist the politician, the less left-wing the legislation they support. So it's relatively easy to pass centrist legislation, but the more leftist the legislation the more difficult to pass. As OP lays out, Biden passed a 1% tax on stock buybacks, passed massive investment in climate change, and tried to expand the welfare state with an expanded CTC (incredibly ambitious considering narrow margins). Contrast that with a Republican Presidency, which at minimum would have seen an attempt to make the Trump tax cuts permanent. Those are all laws that that helped voters.My problem with so-called \\"leftists\\" is not their (ostensible) goals, which I mostly support. It's that they prioritize being angry and purity politics over pragmatism and concrete actions that improve people's lives.   \\nIf Bernie Sanders had become President in 2017, he would still have been limited by the which bill's Joe Manchin (and other Senate moderates) would be willing to vote for.

The logic is \\"You're releasing a report that covers a case I once held jurisdiction over but later dismissed, so now I have jurisdiction over the report even though the law doesn't say that and even though I already dismissed my own jurisdiction over the case and even though half of the report has nothing to do with the case, but none of that matters because I Said So.\\"She's deliberately testing the limits of what she can get away with. She's been doing that the whole time. Maybe someday she'll issue an order that says \\"All persons on planet Earth are hereby permanently enjoined from doing anything that inconveniences Donald Trump in any way.\\"The thing is, the judicial system is really not well set up to deal with rogue judges like this. Her rulings can be appealed, but appeals take a long time, and even then appeals courts typically overturn specific rulings only; they're very reluctant to just kick a judge off the case entirely or prevent her from doing anything Trump-related in the future. Doing all *that* would highlight the problem too much, and I think judges feel awkward about that. (I'm reminded of the Catholic priests who were more concerned about protecting the image of the priesthood than they were with actually doing the right thing.)The only other remedy is impeachment. There was once a time where you could expect 2/3rds of the Senate to agree on removing a judge if they were bad enough, but now every judge (or at least every conservative judge) is effectively immune to impeachment, because the Senate is too polarized.So in that sense, it's almost impressive that Cannon is even letting us see *half* of the report.

Where the comparison is valid is in how both got to power. Both put forward a populist agenda that claimed all of their countrys ills are the fault of the outsider. Both claimed to be the only person who could fix the problems of their countrys. Both sought to find prosperity by subtracting from their countrys diversity instead of adding to it. Both discredited the media and told their followers to not believe what the media says but instead put all of their faith in what they say. Both demanded blind loyalty from those around them. Both struck an isolated view of their country on the world stage with Hitler saying Germany for Germany first and Trump.well, you know.

Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, homelessness is up, full-time jobs are becoming a thing of the pastEven after accounting for taxes, healthcare, education, and housing costs Americans have the most take-home pay of any people on earth. We earn 2-3x as much for the same jobs compared to Euros and East Asians. We have more high paying jobs/industries than any other country. Our necessities and luxuries are cheaper than other countries.An American under the poverty line still makes 4x as much as the average human, and is in the top 15% of wealthiest people on earth **after adjusting for cost of living**. Unemployment is reaching historic lows in the US. 60%+ of US adults are invested in the stock market -more than at any point in history.

The Kafr Qasim, Khan Yunis, and Rafah massacres in 1956. The Six-Day War and Ras Sedr massacre in 1967. The War of Attrition and Bahr El-Baqar elementary school bombing in 1970. The Lebanon War and Shabra and Shatila massacres in 1982. Numerous massacres during the occupation of Lebanon from 1984 to 1996. The First Intifada in 1990. The Second Intifada in 2002. Multiple mass civilian deaths from 2006-2009 in the Gaza and Lebanon wars. Bombing children again from 2012-2014 in Gaza.70 years of Israel being Israel while the US supported them. (All the way back in the progressive civil rights era!)The dems failed to get through a minimum wage raise and won't even campaign on universal healthcare.The last time neoliberals had legislative control was for 20 working days during the Obama administration and they used it to rush through the ACA. The last time before that was in 1967 when LBJ and northern neoliberals from both parties pushed through a bunch of needle-moving civil rights legislation. History has shown that when you deliver full control of the government to neoliberals, progressive work gets done. All other time periods have been subject to Republican obstruction.They're doing nothing to actually help people, and when you offer people nothing you get nothing in return.You don't vote to protect women, racial minorities, and trans people to help the Democrats.

But then, in the same breath, they go on to accuse Democrats, at every level of government, of being solely responsible for these natural disasters. Some even go on to say that these fires are an act of God, a \\"cleansing\\" so to speak, implying that it's some kind of feat of holy vengeance against their perceived enemies. And while it shouldn't have to be said, these fires don't discriminate based on political ideology, in the same way the COVID virus never discerned between liberal vs. conservative, but this very simple fact hasn't kept these right wing fanatics from antagonizing and dividing their fellow Americans during a time of crisis.Make no mistake, Republicans have basically been conditioned to exploit and politicize every tragedy, every natural disaster, every \\"act of God,\\" every shooting, every crisis, every extremist act (especially if the far right variety) for the sake of their feelings, their irrational beliefs and their culture wars.The hypocrisy and the projection here is baffling considering that these people choose to ignore the lengths they go to in order to turn these crises into another political debate, another controversy, another conspiracy theory.I shouldn't also have to point out that denying natural disaster aid and funding to certain areas of the country, (which Republicans have a tendency to do) only makes matters worse. The disturbing sort of irony here is that it's Republicans who end up being more responsible for things like limited preparedness, or for legitimizing misinformation that lead Americans to believe in conspiracy theories that downplay the threat of these natural disasters... It's Republicans who are responsible for promoting divisive narratives that distract Americans from the danger they're in, instead directing their attention towards culture wars and partisan blame games. It's Republicans who choose to politicize these events and divide Americans during times of emergency.It's Republicans who choose to exploit the suffering of Americans to escalate their culture wars.And while Republicans are pointing fingers and focusing their messaging on who's to blame, they can continue to deny disaster funding to these stricken or future stricken areas, jeopardizing the lives of Americans in the process, because no matter what actions they take, or refuse to take, it's not *their* fault. Hell, they can even justify denying aid because they've convinced a portion of their base that the people *really* responsible are undeserving of it.What's more, by denying funding and/or participation, by politicizing these events, by distracting Americans with their divisive rhetoric and political games, by emboldening the conspiracy theorists, by attacking climate change, Republicans are more likely to contribute to the potential level of destruction of these disasters, and the more destructive they are, the more Republicans can take advantage of the situation for political gain, it's a vicious cycle.","title":"Mike Johnson Vows to Hold Aid to California Hostage After Deadly Fires"},{"text":"And it's reasonable for me to call these persons xenophobic bigots.","title":"Why the MAGA Fight Over H-1B Visas Is Crossing Party Lines: Critics from the left and the right say Big Tech companies are exploiting the visa system for high-skilled workers to reduce labor costs and boost profits"},{"text":"Solution: release them like they released those pagers.","title":"Vance: Trump Will Enable Israel To Knock Out Hamas Unless Hostages Released"},{"text":"America will burn under Trump??This is just the beginning of the ineptitude","title":"Could Donald Trump withhold wildfire aid from California?"},{"text":"Is it selfish to wish everyone a chance at economic prosperity, regardless of their skin colour and birth?Is it short sighted to believe improving the purchasing power of the global south will be a boon for us all in the long run?","title":"Why the MAGA Fight Over H-1B Visas Is Crossing Party Lines: Critics from the left and the right say Big Tech companies are exploiting the visa system for high-skilled workers to reduce labor costs and boost profits"},{"text":"Literally, nothing has happened yet.","title":"Ron DeSantis and Bernie Sanders Both Speaking out Again President Elon's H1B Plans"},{"text":"I just deleted all her music from my iPhone!

My local police chief is college-educated, put up Black Lives Matter signs, talks a lot about \\"community policing,\\" etc. He visits my childhood elementary school every year and gives a little speech to the kids. He's never shot anyone in his life (I don't think). Are you suggesting that this guy is harboring a secret desire to just start murdering civilians and ruling the city with an iron fist? These people are his neighbors!\\n   * Just compare the scenario you describe to things that happened in America in the past. E.g., the [Kent State shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings). In this country, we have a very long tradition in which when lethal force is used against civilians, there's a massive outcry against it. You describe a long, slow descent into totalitarian rule, but the very first time police shot even a single protester, there'd be an insanely massive outcry.\\n   * Keep in mind that many officers and generals in the military take American ideals very seriously. (That's why Trump's former chief of staff, former general John Kelly, spoke out against him.)Now, for any one of these, you could say, \\"no, you're wrong - I think you're misunderstanding the situation.\\" But in order for you to be right, Trump has to do *all* of these things: deploy troops (somewhat likely to happen); deploy militias (no reason to see why he'd do this, plus it's illegal); and have police to start killing people all over the country (might happen in a few places, but there'd be a massive outcry - see, e.g., Kent State!; plus, police aren't all secretly hoping to kill their neighbors and rule their towns). And then people have to be chill about it (despite the fact that that hasn't happened in the past 100 years, see Kent State and the civil rights movement).","title":"CMV: Trump is going to topple the US."},{"text":"Good opportunity to make your voice heard.","title":"Mike Johnson Vows to Hold Aid to California Hostage After Deadly Fires"},{"text":"* *People will protest even more.* This would definitely happen if Trump deployed troops against protesters.\\n* *Trump will activate militias.* What does it mean to \\"activate militias\\"? Are you suggesting he'd just tell the militias, \\"go ahead and take over the towns where you live\\"? Two issues here:\\n   * There's no law allowing the president to do this. The president can ([probably](https://constitution.findlaw.com/article2/annotation09.html)) impose \\"martial law\\", but the Posse Comitatus Act forbids the military from engaging in civilian law enforcement (except to put down rebellions, per the Insurrection Act). So if protests turned into an actual rebellion, Trump could put down the rebellion with the military, but that doesn't work if the protests aren't rebellion or if we're talking about random militias, not the military.\\n   * There'd likely be a hugely negative reaction to this. Remember, Trump only barely won the election (by just 2 million votes in a country of 350 million people). By what mechanism would Trump become *more* popular by telling militias to violently take over cities? Surely he'd become much *less* popular, at which point a majority of the country would oppose him. As much as we constantly hear about all the times that the Supreme Court rules in Trump's favor, they [*have* ruled against him](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-allows-sanctions-trump-allied-lawyers-2020-election-laws-rcna139256) \\\\- they're not \\"in his pocket\\".

It's really hard to predict what any individual will do, especially a president. \\"Trump will overthrow the US\\" really means:* *Trump will stir up controversy.* This goes without saying. Trump does this constantly. Barring a freak accident (like Trump dying of a heart attack), this will occur.\\n* *People will protest.* Again, this happened plenty during his last term.\\n* *Trump will deploy US troops in response*. This seems likely - Trump has wanted to do so in the past, and he's now surrounded by fewer people who would say no to him. But *it's not certain*. Keep in mind that Trump still has plenty of people around him with their own agendas who often change his mind on things - they could convince him not to . During his campaign, folks like [Susie Wiles](https://www.reuters.com/default/susie-wiles-trump-picks-quiet-competence-chief-staff-2024-11-11/) often (though by no means always) kept him in check in certain wa[https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/trump-fascist-john-kelly/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/02/politics/john-kelly-donald-trump-us-service-members-veterans/index.html)ys.

Regardless of how much damage it would actually do.He fought tooth and nail, like his life depended on it to block his tax returns being released. We all knew what would be in there, and it was eventually released, it had all the things people expected in it, and the IRS made it clear that Trump had been lying about audits blocking him from releasing them. And then... nothing happened. It was not even a tiny blip on the radar for his supporters. He has done everything in his power to bury so many different things, I think it is just a blanket strategy so that he can defend the thing that might actually take him out without people knowing its his weak-spot.Like all of of his health checks in office. He is an obese, elderly man who loves McDonalds, we know how fit he is. But he fights like hell to keep it secret, even has his doctor release a comically exaggerated clean bill of health. Or that he was escorted to a safe spot by the Secret Service when there was an active incident outside the White House. It was an obvious thing to have happened, he lied about it, and threw a fit when contradicted.Like I said, I do think it is a strategy to conceal what secrets actually matter (although, would anything short of video of him brutally murdering a child actually hurt him? Even that feels like something he could push through). But I also think it just helps build the narrative of \\"the system is out to get me\\". Everything they focus on is them persecuting him. And if it comes out and is not a career-ending bombshell, then he says \\"look at that, they had nothing on me but still put up all that fight to hurt me\\" (they only had to fight because he fought).I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but I don't think there is anything in that report that will even slightly move the needle. Best case scenario is that Trump is \\"desperate\\" because he cares about his legacy, and the more official all of his crimes become, the worse he'll look in the history books. Worst case scenario is that he is doing what I described above. No desperation, just playing the victim and keeping everyone distracted.","title":"Trump appears desperate to keep Jack Smiths findings under wraps"},{"text":"what you have here sounds like the concepts of a plan","title":"Judge Cannon OKs release of special counsels report into Trump and election subversion"},{"text":"What?

After Bezos killed the Kamala endorsement, it was her columns that kept me from cancelling my subscription--because it was important to keep independent journalism going--and it's always a fear that, losing money, Bezos would sell (even sell to someone like Musk). Rubin, like Dana Milbank, assured readers that --other than that time-- there had been no interference from him with the content of the paper. Recent weeks show that is no longer the case.With Rubin gone--and making such a powerful stand against the current corruption of corporate journalism--what reason remains to stay with the Washington Post? Bezos' capitulation to Trump has been a disgrace. I hope Rubin's new media--The Contrarian--founded together with Norm Eisen--will be successful. It is courageous. After covering Trump for 8 years, she knows what a target she's going to be for doing this. Not just from him, but others because we know he's going to mobilize government against his \\"enemies\\" (critics).Anyone who feels Trump is a threat--a real threat--to democracy and to journalism--should support and encourage her work.[https://contrarian.substack.com/](https://contrarian.substack.com/)","title":"Bezos enables Trump's threat to democracy, WashPo columnist says as she quits"},{"text":"Hitler never released power once gaining it.

How can you have a currency that could lose 41% of its value in three weeks (as Bitcoin did in May 2021), or gain in value 45% in less than three weeks (as Bitcoin did this past November)? You cant. Yes, currencies can and do fluctuate, but not that drastically. Economies cannot function if businesses and consumers do not know if their money could double in value, or lose half of its value, in a few weeks.1. How can you have a currency that is designed to be hoarded and not spent, due to its scarcity? You cant. If your currency is not spent, the economy will collapse. Dollars are meant to be spent, due to their inflationary nature.

The Snopes fact-check you cite quotes an Atlantic article that purports to have been confirmed by \\"four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day\\":In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, \\"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.\\" In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as \\"suckers\\" for getting killed.The Snopes fact-check goes on to explain that another news organization confirmed the Atlantic's reporting:Shortly after the publication of The Atlantic report, one unnamed senior official with the U.S. Department of Defense and one senior U.S. Marine Corps officer?[confirmed](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-ap-top-news-politics-b823f2c285641a4a09a96a0b195636ed)?the 2018 cemetery remarks from the above report in interviews with The Associated Press (AP). According to the AP, the official had firsthand knowledge of Trump's remarks, and the officer had been told about them.Later, the fact-check quotes John Kelly, Trump's former chief of staff, implicitly confirming these claims (though it notes Kelly never stated whether he was there at the time - the only implication is that Kelly believes these statements to have been made): A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all 'suckers' because 'there is nothing in it for them.'The fact-check cites a Trump aide as denying the claim, of course, but surely we're not considering that as proof that these claims are a hoax.Of course, it's impossible to 100% prove or disprove that something is a hoax. But to me, this story seems pretty likely to be true!I can see how, if you think (based on other experiences or evidence) the entire media is out to get Trump with hoaxes and lies, your priors would lead you to conclude that this is likely to be a hoax as well.

He's not taking in money from under-the-table criminal enterprises. But it certainly seems his habit of helping others launder money is old and well-engrained. He's done it with properties as well, helping criminals move money around buying and selling his properties at crazy-inflated prices. There are few, if any, organizations Trump has touched that come out uncorrupted. How much money is he going to make this term bilking the taxpayers for room-and-board for the Secret Service every time he stays at one of his tacky resorts? Says he wants Greenland, but I'm unconvinced he won't impulsively try to sell Alaska back to Russia or California to Mexico. He doesn't care about sovereignty, he's an increasingly senile career criminal whose brain works exclusively via zero-sum transaction. Sorry for the rant, just didn't want to seem like I'm defending the guy.","title":"Team Trump Suddenly Backtracks on Key Campaign Promise - Donald Trumps Ukraine envoy made a damning confession on the likelihood of the war ending."},{"text":"The Democrats resisting him will appear to be out of touch with reality and sent into the dustbin of history and the brainwash will be complete.I dont have many family left who arent MAGA or who have just stopped talking politics or world events all together.

One of the goals of the spending here was to reduce financial risk and spur private investment.

The but-for case is pretty tricky to evaluate because we don't have the counterfactual scenario but if a law uses 10 billion dollars of federal money to bring in an additional 40 billion dollars of private investment, should we say that the law was responsible for 10 billion? for 50 billion? somewhere in the middle?","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"Benito and Vladimir would both be proud.","title":"Trump team is questioning civil servants at National Security Council about commitment to his agenda"},{"text":"Nah.

She instructed them to not release the report pending the outcome of the 11th Circuit's ruling on the motion. If she had allowed them to release the report prior to the 11th Circuit's ruling, then what would happen if the 11th Circuit later ruled for the defendants and blocked the release? It would already be public at that point. Irreversible damage would be done to the defendants' case. That's why it made sense to order the report to be held until the 11th Circuit had decided. Thats because Cannon no longer holds jurisdiction over this case; she has relinquished it to the 11th Circuit, which has thus far declined to issue the very relief that she granted.As already noted, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure require this motion to be filed with her first, so she did have jurisdiction to consider this motion and rule on it.","title":"Judge Cannon OKs release of special counsels report into Trump and election subversion"},{"text":"Our only chance is that these money grubbing fuckwits consumer each other","title":"Trump Gets Insane Show of Support From Washington Post Editorial Board | The newspapers editorial board has fully caved to Donald Trump."},{"text":"None of them are from the areas impacted by the fires, so their constituents probably dont give a crap.","title":"Mike Johnson Vows to Hold Aid to California Hostage After Deadly Fires"},{"text":"Republicans want the government run like a business they say.

They believe in the basic reactionary idea, rejecting equality and democracy for hierarchy and autocracy. What they rationalize this belief with is not important, as it is just a facade for a selfish desire for status and power over others. This goes from the top all the way down to the followers and supporters.The result is that reactionary movements are always a chaotic mess of petty tyrants and bullies feuding with one another for supremacy or for the favour of the people above them. There is no difference in how they treat other people in society and how they treat people within their own movement. Even movements that ostensibly are all about unity, order, efficiency, futurism, ... (e.g. fascism) are in reality always chaotic and wasteful because everyone hates each other and constantly fights or conspires against one another in an environment without any guiding principles or legitimacy, so government gets split into fiefdoms (often duplicating each other) as the focus shifts from actual governance to building up competing power bases and extracting wealth. All the talk about honour, loyalty, god, the country or the people is all meaningless, as the ideology is a hollow shell around selfishness, rage and hate. It's very similar to organized crime, and the constant feuds and fights are part of that.And it goes all the way down to the street level. You see the same petty vendettas, the same bullying, the same grasping corruption and the same blatant abuse of power there as you see higher up. That's what happens when the common factor between everyone involved in it is that they think that they themselves and their feelings are more important than anything or anyone else. They may pretend to do it in the name of the country, or god, but ultimately that is bad faith, as both those concepts are merely proxies for their own desires.","title":"Steve Bannon derides Elon Musk, vowing to limit influence over Trump"},{"text":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/01/aileen-cannon-jack-smith-report-obstruction-bananas.htmlHis former co-defendants, who still face criminal charges, made the same request to Cannon, and to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where their case is now pending. (More on that in a moment.) But Trump and his co-defendants asked Cannon to jump ahead of the 11th Circuit and muzzle the Justice Department herself. She obliged on Tuesday, issuing a sweeping injunction that attempts to prohibit Garland, Smith, and the whole agency from publishing the final report or any drafts of it.Heres the problem: Cannon cannot do this. The startling breadth of her order is extremely dubious, but the legal flaw runs even deeper; she is purporting to exercise authority that she just does not have. Thats because Cannon no longer holds jurisdiction over this case; she has relinquished it to the 11th Circuit, which has thus far declined to issue the very relief that she granted. She therefore lacks any power to interfere with the Justice Departments release of Smiths report.","title":"Judge Cannon OKs release of special counsels report into Trump and election subversion"},{"text":"This is 100% for show.

All base numbers (income, tax rates, etc.) are basically made up for ease of calculation, as I'm on my phoneBillionaire X has income of $100 million.  Tax that at 40%, that's $40 million. Tax that at 90%, that's $90 million.  The discrepancy ($50 million) could go a long way towards lowering taxes for a chunk of the middle and lower classes.  Repeat that for all the billionaires in the country.  The middle and lower classes suddenly have a bit more disposable income which they will spend on stuff they couldn't afford before. Meanwhile, billionaire X has a measley $10 million to spend instead of $60 million.  Oh no, I feel so bad for him. But we all know that he's not paying 40% on his income, he has all sorts of loopholes to make it more like 5-10%.  Or even 0%.  So it helps even more people to raise taxes on high wealth individuals.  As someone who considers themselves progressive, I don't care that much about actual percentages. I care that Elon is the richest person in the world and is using that leverage to influence elections in a way that is actively harmful to middle and lower class people, in addition to marginalizing populations that are already treated like shit.

Trump, during his first term, was scarred when two career military officers detailed to the NSC became whistleblowers, raising their concerns about Trumps 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which the president sought an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter. That episode led to Trumps first impeachment. Alexander Vindman was listening to the call in his role as an NSC official when he became alarmed at what he heard. He approached his twin brother, Eugene, who at the time was serving as an ethics lawyer at the NSC. Both Vindmans reported their concerns to superiors. Alexander Vindman said in a statement Friday that the Trump teams approach to staffing the NSC will have a chilling effect on senior policy staff across the government. He added, Talented professionals, wary of being dismissed for principled stances or offering objective advice, will either self-censor or forgo service altogether. The two men were heralded by Democrats as patriots for speaking out and derided by Trump as insubordinate. Eugene Vindman in November was elected as a Democrat to represent Virginias 7th Congressional District.Then the beginning and meaning of these actions start making more sense. From the top, Incoming senior Trump administration officials have begun questioning career civil servants who work on the White House National Security Council about who they voted for in the 2024 election, their political contributions and whether they have made social media posts that could be considered incriminating by President-elect Donald Trumps team, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter.[...]","title":"Trump team is questioning civil servants at National Security Council about commitment to his agenda"},{"text":"How about the west coast stop sending money to prop up the poor ass red states who hate socialism.","title":"We're walking a dark path.

He applied to get the judge removed by saying the judge must be biased as he was nominated by Bill Clinton. The judge refused (dismissing the lawsuit and imposing sanctions against Trump's lawyers), pointing out that \\"this guy nominated me\\" isn't really a conflict of interest - judges generally don't have much to do with the people who nominate them, and don't usually have much direct involvement.Trump and Cannon broke this.

Oil and gas is owned by the provinces, principally Alberta, and we wont stand for that, Smith told reporters in a virtual news conference. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, meanwhile, said Monday he wants to see Canada block exports to the United States of critical minerals like aluminum, lithium and potash in response to the tariff threat. So if (Trump) wants to pick a fight with Canada, we have to make sure its clear that its going to hurt Americans as well, Singh told a news conference in Ottawa. Ford said that while an embargo on energy and critical mineral exports to the U.S. is the last thing he wants to see, Canada shouldnt rule out any means to inflict economic pain on the U.S. if the tariff dispute escalates. Canadas critical minerals exports to the United States were valued at nearly $30 billion in 2023. Thats nearly 60 per cent of the value of all Canadian critical mineral exports. I want to ship them more critical minerals. I want to ship them more energy, Ford said.  \\"But make no mistake about it. If theyre coming full-tilt at us, I wont hesitate to pull out every single tool we have until they can feel the pain. But thats the last thing I want to do. Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly hasnt ruled out an energy embargo in response to Trumps promise to impose punishing 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian products. Smith said the federal government shouldnt be making empty threats, and its not Jolys call to make. She said cutting off pipeline supplies through Michigan would choke key supplies to Ontario and Quebec as well. If Ottawa moves to cut off energy exports, Smith said, they will have a national unity crisis on their hands at the same time as having a crisis with our U.S. trade partners. Albertas premier said Canada needs to be prepared for the tariffs to come into effect on Jan. 20, Trumps first day in office. I havent seen any indication in any of the presidents public commentary, or even in the comments that he had with me, that hes inclined to change his approach, she said. Singh argued that the fact Trump still intends to implement broad-based tariffs after he and members of his administration met with Joly, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc shows he cant be reasoned with.  \\"Donald Trump is not rational. You cant discuss a plan over a meal with him. He is a bully. And bullies understand one thing  that is strength. They also understand pain, Singh said. Canada is a primary exporter to the U.S. for several critical minerals, including graphite, potash and zinc. The U.S. imports all of its graphite, which is used in manufacturing a wide range of products, from pencils to nuclear reactors. China, Mexico and Madagascar are the other major suppliers of graphite to the U.S. market. Over the weekend, Joly said Canadians need to be ready for economic threats, adding all leaders need to put Canada first and show a united front. We have to be very realistic, very pragmatic, and we have to be ready, because something we cant do is not to take president-elect Trump at his word. Because when he says something, he usually does it, Joly said Sunday on CBCs Rosemary Barton Live. She said Ottawa is pursuing a strategy to engage the incoming U.S. administration through measures that include a new border plan, developing military alliances and co-operating on energy issues. And at the same time, were working on a retaliation plan, said Joly.  I cant go into the details of that retaliation plan, because I think it would be a bad strategy. But what I can tell you is everything is on the table. Smith visited Trump at his Florida home over the weekend as a guest of Canadian businessman and television personality Kevin OLeary. OLeary has suggested that it would benefit Canada to combine its economy with that of the U.S. and erase the border separating the two countries. ~~traitor~~ Smith will be attending Trumps inauguration next week. She has been on a diplomatic offensive of late, meeting with American elected officials and appearing on news broadcasts south of the border. She has argued the tariffs would harm both Canadian and American consumers, particularly through higher gas prices. Smith said Monday the incoming presidents biggest source of irritation is the trade imbalance with Canada. She said she expects Trumps promised tariffs to remain in effect until the imbalance is resolved. I think the solution is that we find ways to buy more American goods and that seems to me to be the very logical step that we should take. So Ill put that on the table, she said. She and other premiers are expected to meet with Trudeau to discuss the issue on Wednesday. Theres a lot of rumors going around. But when we get there Wednesday, well expect a list and we need them to be 100 per cent ready, Ford said of potential retaliatory tariffs. When asked if excluding energy from those retaliatory tariffs might undermine the negotiating position of other premiers, or of Canada as a whole, Smith said she feels talking about energy is the way we make the case to avoid tariffs on every Canadian product. If Albertas energy exports were taken out of the trade equation, the Americans would have a trade surplus with Canada, she said. Prince Edward Island Premier Dennis King is on his own economic mission to the northeastern United States, including Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. King is leading a 22-person delegation meeting with industry leaders, business associations and stakeholders to promote P.E.I.s contributions to the potato and seafood sectors.!ping CAN&amp;FOREIGN-POLICY&amp;MARKETS","title":"Trump tariffs: Smith opposes blocking energy exports to U.S. but Ford wants to keep option open | Globalnews.ca"},{"text":"Bingo","title":"Trump Gets Insane Show of Support From Washington Post Editorial Board | The newspapers editorial board has fully caved to Donald Trump."},{"text":"Is it because Bibi called Elon the unofficial president ?","title":"Trump Shares Video Revealing Netanyahu Got America Into War with Iraq and is Trying to Get US to War with Iran"},{"text":"There's more to life than making money.","title":"Bezos enables Trump's threat to democracy, WashPo columnist says as she quits"},{"text":"Gregg doesnt stands for anything, both literally and figuratively","title":"Gov.

Basically, when no ethnic group forms a clear majority, they each start to view democracy as a zero sum game.  If they lose an election, they lose their way of life especially if the political parties clearly appeal to a specific ethnicity because then some of those groups cannot ever form a democratic majority numerically speaking. If an ethnicity feels that it can never win under a democratic system, then they will reject democracy. Hence, a lot of those countries have authoritarian governments typically from one of the smallest ethnicities as we saw in Syria into quite recently. The only way to end this cycle is to prevent ethnic-based political coalitions.","title":"There are a lot of bitter people here, Im one of them: rust belt voters on why they backed Trump again despite his broken promises"},{"text":"Trumps grave better have a protective shell around it because I will piss on it at least 5 times in my life.","title":"Texas Gov.

Kenniff is a high-ranking person, he showed that the rule of law is not lost on New Yorkers and Trump admires that.Its understood that the Trump administration could not reach Mr Kenniff, an Iraq war veteran, in the aftermath of the high-profile trial to discuss the nomination.In turn, the president-elect nominated former US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to serve as Manhattans top federal prosecutor.Meanwhile, Joseph Nocella, Jr, who most recently served as a judge in a New York state court, was nominated as US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.But sources last night suggested the soon-to-be 47th President could change his mind and appoint Mr Kenniff instead.**More here:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/01/13/lawyer-veteran-choked-homeless-man-running-trump-attorney/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/01/13/lawyer-veteran-choked-homeless-man-running-trump-attorney/)","title":"Lawyer for veteran who choked homeless man is in running for Trump's US attorney"},{"text":"Even liberals don't like Ellen.","title":"Ellen DeGeneres is seen back in Montecito weeks after moving to England and 'leaving US for good' post-Trump win"},{"text":"MAGA will never beat the allegations after they were all scared stiff once a single gunshot was fired on J6.They'll happily return to hiding behind their officials obstructing the government, gumming up the legal system with nonsensical bureaucracy, and dismantling democracy using the levers of democracy itself.Basically, they'll go back to being cowards while the government runs roughshod on citizens rights and their chosen scapegoats.","title":"Trump admins question civil servants who they voted for"},{"text":"Sounds like blue states need to stick together.

Most people didn't actually qualify for PSLF under Trump as direct loans (the ones that qualified for PSLF) didn't really proliferate until 2010 when the FFEL program was terminated. Biden had to enact a massive waiver process during his Administration which allowed many people who didn't really qualify under the actual program eligible for forgiveness under it. I'm sure Trump could have done something similar if he was so inclined (which he wasn't); however, its misleading to say they outright refused to process it. They generally just held people to the actual rules of the program whereas Biden waived many of those same rules (including allowing some payments that were clearly said to be ineligible according to the legislation as qualifying payments). PSLF recipients are pretty fortunate Biden started the waiver process back in 2021 before student loans became a hot button issue in 2022 with the large forgiveness program.

I'll be the first to admit he says some stupid things (talks about adding Greenland, Panama Canal, Canada to the US constantly), but he isn't the first to mention a lot of that, and I've seen no compelling evidence that Trump is a Hitlerian fascist dictator. Fascist dictators don't leave office and then rely on elections to come back to power. If that's the case, I guess Grover Cleveland is a fascist dictator.2 - Skimmed the first half of a very long piece about this (I don't have time to read the whole thing right now), but the relevant parts seem to be about Jan 6 (I'm well aware there are crazy far-right people out there gathering in mountain hideouts preparing for the end of days or whatever). Firstly, let's make it clear that I hate what happened on Jan 6. That being said: If the whole thing was an elaborate conspiracy to overturn the election, Why was nobody armed? Why are there videos of Capitol  Police escorting rioters around? Why was there no desperate battle between the \\"\\\\[un\\\\]armed insurrectionists\\" and the military in an attempt to save America's way of life from the \\"fascists\\"? Probably because angry people rioting was not going to end almost 250 years of American democracy.3 - Haven't read the book, and I don't have time to now, so I won't comment.4 - I do know how to identify propaganda, thank you very much. Whenever I try to learn about a new issue or what have you, I seek out multiple unbiased sources and ignore the ones pushing a narrative. That aside, I get that a lot of international leaders are wary of Trump. He says a lot of alienating things and has a very...bold personality. He also comes from a different ideological background than a lot of current leaders, especially in Europe, but that doesn't warrant a comparison to Hitler. Important people buying into a stupid idea does not make the idea any less stupid.4 (5?) - Blaming half the country is just par for the course in American politics right now. Both sides do it, as much as I wish they wouldn't. I'm not aware of any political prisoners Trump has taken. If anything, Dems tried to make him one with all of the lawsuits and whatnot.

I personally think he was a very productive president, and surprisingly progressive for how divided the country has been and how MAGA-poisoned the well has become.  \\nBut I want to propose a different angle: The left is not really in a state where it can acknowledge victories, even when they are happening.I am not sure why this happens necessarily, but the right does not have this issue. They are lockstep behind their figurehead, and there is little to none dissent. No republican commentator, pundit, media personality, or politician can meaningfully stand up to Trump or criticize him in any real way without being instantly shunned by the whole movement. So when they vote, they all vote, and when decisions are made (however stupid or insane) they stand unquestioningly behind it.This is madness I believe. But the left is also mad in a way, because however imperfect Biden or Kamala are, they are qualified serious people with the capacity for leadership. I may not agree with EVERYTHING they do, but knowing that the alternative is Trump, the left should be unified in supporting them. Instead, we repeatedly see them held to an entirely different standard. Kamala was criticized mercilessly during the campaign, a lot of times from the left.A good example is her less-than-good take on Israel-Palestine. She may still be orders of magnitude better than Trump both in her take, and her ability to deal with such a complicated issue, and yet, somehow so many lefties decided to stay home and now we are stuck with this idiot for another for years. All of the other issues be dammed, even if they are existential like climate change.  \\nI guess stupidity pays when you get a cult of personality going.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"Bootlickers, all of em.","title":"Greg Abbott Breaks Federal Protocol to Raise Flags for Trump Inauguration"},{"text":"Good point.. the silver lining here may be that sane people are finally waking up to how full of shit most churches actually are.. hopefully it hastens an end to this archaic bullshit.","title":"Trump appears desperate to keep Jack Smiths findings under wraps"},{"text":"Ridiculous personal insult aside...are you saying Biden *doesn't* have cognitive decline?

But it occurred to me that the phrasing was rather pointedly political, and in fact I don't think Biden delivered any victories at all politically. He did what the Left has done since 1932, and better than most of his Democratic peers: he delivered competent governance and tried to use government to advance the needs of citizens. You'd think that would be enough. But when Republicans are in power they spend the time they're not enriching themselves in actively undermining the Left. And we see the results before us. Obama and Biden both had an opportunity to cast our collective gaze back across the devastation wrought by previous administrations and force us to observe the lesson: Conservative governance is a disaster. They didn't do that. That failure, the results of not understanding the nature of the threat, is the same thing that's doomed every democracy that's fallen to right-wing extremism across the 20th century, not only in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, but in Chile, Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Iran, and more. They all ended up with blood in the streets.  It's not enough that Biden, and Obama before him, simply governed well. They both failed to protect us from a growing domestic threat. If Trump gets his way, SEC DEF will be a white supremacist sexual predator. The National Security Council will be purged of anyone who knows their job. Social safety nets will be demolished because they're too expensive while he gives billionaires another trillion dollar tax cut, the economy will crater and, just as during the pandemic, those same billionaires will vastly increase their net worth yet again with assets of what's left of the middle class.Hard to find a victory there.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"It had gotten so bad that the governors office had created thus website:\\nCaliforniaFireFacts.com","title":"Republicans see the LA wildfires as an opportunity to punish California"},{"text":"Nah.

Biden was *real* gung-ho about what was happening. Enthusiastically supportive of Netanyahu. Netanyahu came to power by getting his pro-peace predecessor assassinated and then running explicitly on anti-peace rhetoric. He then became Hamas's primary political sponsor and, based on #s coming out of the West Bank alone even if you ignore everything else, established himself as possibly the most prolific terrorist warlord of the modern era. If conflict in the region ends, Netanyahu almost certainly goes to trial and potentially spends the rest of his life in jail (given his age). Giving this man more weapons was never going to end well, peace is directly against every incentive he has.So Biden's only plan for peace was to give infinite bombs to a man opposed to peace on personal, professional, and political reasons. And then when the bodies ramped up and up (I'm terrified of what's under that rubble and thoroughly believe we're in the hundreds of thousands of child casualties alone)...Biden's response was continued overt support for Netanyahu and more bombs.

They've been building manmade islands to enforce 'chinese territorial waters' and house anti air / anti ship weapons platforms to deter anyone from aiding Taiwan. They've been actively using their air force to poke and prode Taiwanese air defense, testing their reaction times and their radar coverage, as well as doing fake attack runs with multiple squadrons to see if the Taiwanese will shoot first (ie to provoke a more legal justification for war). They've deployed their carrier battle groups in blockade formations around Taiwan during some of their military exercises. There's a lot more to all of this that I'm not including but  let me tell you this, you should listen/believe what someone says when they say they are going to do something. China has been saying they will retake Taiwan, and they've said if they can't do it politically they will do it by force. They finally now basically have the capability to actually do so, and they've spent decades shapping the surrounding areas into a series of island forts to deter any allies of the Taiwanese people from helping.Assuming they invade and manage to take all of the chips manufacturing intact, I don't think you understand how important that is.

This is why Roe v Wade created a right to abortion out of thin air from the 'Right to Privacy\\" in the 9th amendment (huuuge stretch). The Liberal Justices back then thought that should be the policy and thus they searched for any constitutional justification for it. This has happened many times now. And thus the alternative explanation is simple. Originalist Justices will rule on the constitutionality of something while Liberal Justices will rule off of what they support, which leads to Biden's unconstitutional executive orders being ruled against by the former and ruled for by the latter.  So if that's the case, then you can reliably predict whether any given = Supreme Court will block an action before it is implemented. The current Supreme Court will not block clearly constitutional legislation but will block overreaching executive orders regardless of policy. And Biden's team knows this.

All news/info about J6 will disappear from SEO and other internet archives. History books will either omit the incident or downplay the whole thing as a protest. The media barely even mentioned it last week during the certification. At this point, the US is starting to become a lost cause. Trump's second presidency will have long lasting negative effects.

It also prohibits companies from expanding foreign investment. While companies are not completely restricted from using non-government funds for buybacks / dividends, as that would likely completely deter them from pursuing these government grants, they are required to submit 5-year buyback / dividend plans in their applications, which affects the funding and restrictions on the funding they receive. The CHIPS act also includes a bunch of other requirements regarding worker incentives and protections, profit-sharing, and has already resulted in semiconductor companies announcing a bunch of new domestic projects. So, I'm confused on what specifically you find problematic with the CHIPS Act that isn't completely unrealistic, or a non-starter.\\nSpeaking of stock buybacks, Biden's 1% tax on stock buybacks was welcome but in my opinion too modest to alter a practice that could potentially damage American competitiveness for the long term (as companies like IBM are spending more on buybacks than R&amp;D).\\nExpecting Biden to be able to pass a much larger tax on stock buybacks is just wishful thinking that ignores the incrementality of progressive legislation, and the reality of a partisan congress this legislation needs to go through.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"Are there no other pictures of her in existence?

Trump may indeed order US troops into illegal action on US soil, analogous to Caesar crossing the Rubicon.But what Trump doesn't have is an Octavian waiting in the wings.  Octavian, who became Augustus Caesar, was a brilliant administrator and consolidator, and was the first actual Emperor of Rome (a position Julius Caesar never held).  Without Octavian, Julius Caesar's hold on power would just have dissipated into squabbling between the various noble factions.So who in the Trump camp is positioned to consolidate power?  I don't see any candidates.  Of course, nobody saw Octavian coming, either - he was just some kid with no public image at all.  So who knows, maybe Barron Trump will turn out to be some kind of political genius.  But I doubt it.  I think it's much more likely that in a post-Trump world, the MAGA movement just fizzles.

It's best not to think of this as an economic item but instead a national security one. [ Taiwan makes 90% of the world most advance chips and 68% of all chips world wide](https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/#:~:text=One%20of%20them%2C%20the%20Taiwan,of%20all%20global%20chip%20production). Computational power is arguably the most important resource in the world right now. It's needed to run every aspect of the economy, as well as the military. China has long wanted to take over Taiwan for obvious historical reasons. If they did they would control the lion's share of all manufacturing for the planet. This would give them the ability to have their hardware in almost every house, every data center, and every military installation in the world. China would be dominant in any trade negotiation, and sanctions would be impossible because they would be too valuable. Obviously this is scary. This is why the US wants to onshore chip production so that they can ensure no foreign actor is able to leverage that against them. Even if we spend more then we get out (doubtful) it's still worth it for our national security. I think the biggest argument against the CHIP act is that it makes China invading Taiwan more likely. Because China is bigger and stronger than Taiwan, their strategy has been to be too valuable to the world so that if they are invading everyone will help. Having a near monopoly on chip production is part of Taiwan's national security, and by breaking that monopoly the world will find it more palatable if China does invade. Right now if China invades the US 100% would back them because they don't want the scenario I described to happen. However, if we have our own chip production and don't need Taiwan, that changes the calculus.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"That is unconstitutional and holy fuck.

The US remained an ally of Israel through all of it. Numerous presidential administrations helped Israel in various ways, even as they were accused of genocide multiple times. But the average Redditor couldn't name any of these events, or name which President they happened under, because history has shown over and over again that this is all virtue signaling and nobody actually cares. It's exhausting. Literally nobody in the US is going to remember/care about this a year from now (certainly Trump will not be held to the same standard -I'll asphyxiate if I hold my breath waiting for these accounts and media outlets to start punching Trump over Israel).When was the last time a Redditor thought about the Uyghur genocide in China? Can't remember the last time I saw a post about it. Without looking it up, can you honestly even remember which President was in office when we first learned about the Uyghur genocide? Genocides happen all over the world, all the time, and none of it sticks in Americans' minds, so it doesn't stick to our leaders.

I say this because many MAGA politicians today were literally saying that Trump had gone too far after Jan 6, calling for him to be removed from office, and then they deleted their tweets and now act as if hes a god that can do no wrong. Even people like Lindsey Graham called him a race baiting xenophobic bigot in 2016, and now LG acts like everyone on the left is crazy for thinking it at all. I mean, his literal Vice President elect called him Americas Hitler before walking everything back and acting like he never saw anything wrong. I say all that to say, Im not saying they guy is Hitler by any means, but I think because we are so polarized right now and tribal about our politics, Trump can do no wrong in a lot of MAGAs eyes, when he should be accountable to us as the citizenry. It keeps us, on all sides, from being able to get what we deserve from the gov if elected officials start doing the bidding of themselves or the wealthy elite who make things worse for the rest of us.

If she's not a spokesperson for progressive activists, I'm not sure who is.I'd think and hope that this spring into summer, we'll be seeing actions towards this administration on the streets that will eclipse anything that happened under the Biden Administration - whether it be related to Gaza, deportation, curtailing of human rights under this upcoming administration, or any other policy. I understand that it's frustrating hearing people whine about the Biden Administration, but the same \\"whining\\" will happen under Trump as it did in 2017-2021. The largest march for Women's Rights in human history took place under that administration - I don't see the next Trump Administration being different in that sense.","title":"Student loan relief: $183.6 billion cancelled by Joe Biden, Trump plans review"},{"text":"He tried to fuck a flag, once.","title":"Trump flies US flag at full height before end of 30-day mourning period following Carter's death"},{"text":"3.
