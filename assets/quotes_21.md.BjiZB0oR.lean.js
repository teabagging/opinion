Nor did they care to learn how Trumps economic plans would cause said economic issues to worsen exponentially.

Having some really close first-hand experience with how debilitating CFS can be, it is absolutely more than just (and I paraphrase) that people didnt work out or were stuck at home and therefore their lagging symptoms (if we want to call it that) are related to attention, focus energy, and motivation. I know a few who have been diagnosed with what we call long Covid and it really just is post-viral fatigue: the body and the brain are so exhausted from fighting the virus, as we tend to try and return to normal routine and normal energy use when we simply dont have it. We often dont recharge as we should after sickness, providing our bodies with the proper aftercare to return to pre-sickness energy usage. Ignore the depleted energy stores but continue burning energy anyway and you have a recipe for chronic fatigue that Covid itself or the prolonged fighting of Covid by your body can cause. You can get post-viral fatigue from anything ranging from Covid to Epstein-Barr or the like and CFS can develop from prolonged high stress to menopause. This is just an anecdote, but in my family, menopause is generally really brutal. Three generations of women basically have bled for two years straight going through menopause, resulting in extreme anemia, fatigue, low immunity, etc. for my grandmother, CFS didnt exist so it was ignored and she powered through before dying in her 60s of cancer. For my mother, she was diagnosed with CFS and it drained 5 years of her life and only now with a total 180 in diet, mindfulness, soft exercise, meditation, and lots of therapy has she started to recover (and she was extremely healthy before, no bad dietary habits or anything). All of this, from basically a 2 year period. It just absolutely sinks your body and your mind, and this is what Covid and other viruses do too to result in chronic fatigue. We just call it long covid because CFS doesnt have a marketable ring to it.","title":"cmv: many people online, especially on Reddit are unreasonable about COVID"},{"text":"Nah shits changing to conservative like its doing here in Americathe world knows the left ruin everything","title":"Trump needs to stop doing this"},{"text":"California welcomes you.U-Haul will practically pay you to drive a truck there, too!","title":"[SH] \\"Is North Carolina less democratic than South Sudan?\\""},{"text":"I know.

Since then, both the US and the entire Western World have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. This has been accomplished via diplomacy, trade, and a commitment to a multipolar world as well as by American military hegemony. It has evidently not been accomplished by American territorial expansionism.Your argument is actually, no, this system, which has worked - as you yourself describe - for the United States for 80 years if not longer, actually doesn't and the US would instead be better off adopting an imperial foreign policy similar to those of European empires in the 19th and 20th centuries. I want to point out that every single one of those expansionist European empires eventually failed or disintegrated. In fact, I would argue that the US is in its current position in part because it has historically opposed the sorts of expansionist policies that you are now essentially advocating for in this thread.It is one more incremental step in the right direction.What is the right direction lol?

Because these same \\"anarchists\\" have sought to deny that ancaps can be anarchists because they ONLY oppose the State, which is literally the meaning of the word.Rather than accept that more than one approach to positive anarchism is possible and legitimate, left anarch-ahierarchists seek to deny the label of 'anarchist' to people who oppose the State. And that is the most laughable idiotic thing about this entire argument. If your anarchism is actually about opposition to hierarchy and not opposition to the State, then your label of 'anarchist' is a lie and a self-deception. If left-anarchs were really anarchists they'd be happy to have libertarian anarchists join in their opposition to the State. Instead they're upset, why? Oh yes anarchy, but *not like that!*Because their 'anarchy' is actually ahierarchism, and ironically they gatekeep the label, setting up an intellectual hierarchy in which only they get to define what anarchy is and means. Oh the hypocrisy, and they don't even see it Despite the term having a concrete meaning established thousands of years ago which ancaps absolutely meet.I'm not sure how much more clear on this we can be. What they're doing is wrong even on the basis of their own reasoning, and proves that opposition to the State is not their primary concern. They do not even deserve the label anarchist when all they care about is opposition to hierarchy.We who actually oppose the State are indeed classical anarchists, and purists at that. We actually oppose the State. The most viable replacement for the State is voluntary organization, something these 'left anarchs' actually oppose.

We already have a pretty good idea now what happened with Trump. It has less to do with Trump being more popular than it does folks not buying the Democrats' message.  Trump is a skilled bullshit artist. Even if they don't like the guy, a lot of people just don't think he's an existential threat.  So the more the democrats said it, while acquiescing to the right's narrative on the so-called border crisis. Biden had taken too long pursuing the January 6th investigations, which allowed Trump to successfully downplay the severity of what happened.  The only thing they really did during the campaign to remind folks is tour with Liz Cheney of all ppl, which just made ppl think of Dick Cheney and depressed voter turnout in key areas. The Democrats had SO many blind spots and left themselves insanely vulnerable to Trump.The Flint/Dearborn area of Michigan is a great example of it. Harris basically ignored the concerns of Arab-American and antiwar voters over Gaza. Likely because she didn't have anything to say they wanted to hear, resulting in several awk exchanges on the campaign trail, and left them wide open to countermessaging from Trump.  PACs were running ads in this area praising Harris for being so good for Israel and other ads talking about what a peace-loving president Trump will be. He actively flirted with these voters, promising to end the war.  While I do agree it's pretty stupid to believe him, this is all stuff the Democrats should have seen coming.","title":"Mark my words, Joe Biden will go down in history as America's worst president | Letters"},{"text":"Or Trump cheated.","title":"Mark my words, Joe Biden will go down in history as America's worst president | Letters"},{"text":"Any word on over/underperformance?","title":"Virginia Democrats keep control of Statehouse in first elections after Trump win"},{"text":"To clarify, is that support by Americans who voted or Americans in general?","title":"Mark my words, Joe Biden will go down in history as America's worst president | Letters"},{"text":"all this destroys the main stream world view.

So even if you made both Somaliland and Puntland independent and found a way to not have them fight. Then Ogaden would want to join the new Puntland state.

They wanted Levis because they didnt have any type of jeans. They wanted foreign movies because they only had tv 2 hours a day, and that was mostly nationalistic propaganda. They wanted foreign music because.well Im not enterely sure since the local underground music was pretty good (lol) but I would say diversity. And more than anything, they wanted these things because they represented *freedom*. I know freedom may seem like not such an important factor for someone who already has it. Trust me, when you lose it, its the one most desirable thing. Besides, the fact that it was *banned* plays a very big role. People will always want things that are banned.Part of it too is Ive just been talking to friends in other countries lately and had to explain some of the dystopian shit that we have here. Its been eye opening to explain some of what Ive done lately just to survive.I completely believe you, because I know how dystopian the US is with the lack of healthcare, education, with the school shootings, disregard for women autonomy and all these atrocious things.

Just as having acces to housing doesnt make their suffering less valid. Housing was probably **the only good thing** that communist regimes did. And even that is questionable. How do you think they built all those huge blocks of flats? They stripped peasants of their ancestral homes and lands and offered them an apartament instead. The argument Im really making here, is that I dont really know that much about Soviet Communism, Okay. But that doesnt mean you should believe Russian propaganda that tells you Stalin good or USSR good.but I know about American fascism and it sounds pretty much the same, not really any worse. Id wonder if theres really anything Stalin did that we dont have an American/Western equivalent of.Yes. You have something they did not have. You have freedom to criticize the US gouvernment. That wouldve got you thrown into a basement, beat to a pulp, tortured and killed, while your family wondered where youve gone.

China has been doing stuff off the coast of Greenland and Trump is signaling that the danes need to step up their security in the area, which they've started to do. With Panama, the rates for ships going in and out has massively increased, many ships have found it cheaper to go all the way around South America. The reasons for the rates increases are multifaceted but the bottom line is that it has hurt US trade both internally and internationally. The USA built the Panama canal, and it probably was better managed when the US had control of it, and now it's got infrastructure issues and China is trying to build a competitor canal in Nicaragua. I think it's a strong arm tactic to get the Panamians to reduce the rates and probably work out some sort of infrastructure deal to fix the issues with the canal currently.

Despite Republican attempts to pressure the NCSBE to fix its mistake and procure the information, the board has refused, and a court decided against Republicans in a lawsuit regarding the questionable voters in October.North Carolina also allows overseas voters to bypass the states voter identification law and grants persons who have never resided in the state or country the right to vote in local elections. Allowing never resided voters to cast ballots in local elections appears to be patently unconstitutional, as the states founding document stipulates that only individuals who reside in the state may cast ballots.

His analysis essentially showed that Indias lack of welfare investment under capitalism lead to huge amounts of excess deaths compared to China which invested in healthcare, so many excess deaths in India's case that it not only overshadowed all the deaths of the Great Leap Forward but *all deaths from all communist countries combined ever*.Communism can, overall, lead to less deaths- and that's factoring in things like the Great Leap Forward which are certainly not part of communist ideology.

Or they at least call and try to make arrangements. I have family who are in debt in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even if they weren't retired, it would take them about 80 years to pay off their debt. So they have an agreement with the hospital, and as long as the hospital gets \\"a check\\" every month, nobody contacts collections. They pay *something*.If the hospital wanted to play hardball, there's nothing to take. They have no assets that can be seized, and what they have isn't worth half their debt. They'd have to declare bankruptcy if sued, and the hospital would at *best* get a few thousand dollars worth of junk to try and sell.And, honestly, tanking their credit's not going to hurt them. They're broke. They paid off their house 10 years ago and have no other debts. They aren't going to take on new debts, and didn't exactly have a choice about this hospital visit. That's why a lot of people don't even call. They have a bill they know they can never afford to pay, so they figure whatever happens is going to happen. If I told you that you owed me three million dollars, you'd probably laugh at me and say, \\"Good luck collecting THAT\\". If I had to do that math for me, I think in the end I'd come out ahead financially if I let my bill go to collections, dare them to sue me, then declare bankruptcy. The hospital will get a few thousand dollars then they *can't touch me* again. My credit will be trashed... for a limited time. Far less time than it'd take me to pay off 6-digit medical debt. So yeah, I'd be praying for a lawsuit. So *there never was an incentive to pay* in the first place. Anyone with financial sense would understand they don't have a move unless there's a way to declare bankruptcy. People without financial sense already have trashed credit. There's really just a small set of young, employable people who have crippling medical debt this is going to help out. Trashing their credit affects their ability to get apartments or cars, which makes it harder for them to get jobs, which makes them *less likely* to pay the hospital back. And if they had the opportunity, it'd make the most sense to declare bankruptcy. So if you spend more time than a knee-jerk thinking about it, this makes the hospitals MORE likely to REACH OUT to people like my family members and say, \\"Hey, we need you to pay us ANYTHING.\\" Some people are going to fight. They've learned from Donald Trump and Elon Musk that smart people don't pay bills if they don't have to. But an awful lot of people are more honest than that.

How so?To understand the answer you'd need to know some geography and either \\"Great Game Theory\\" or Mackinder's World Island/Geographic Pivot of History concept.If that sounds too boring... off you go. For anyone who's *still* interested, here's the brief rundown.You can think of planet Earth as being made up of one Big Island and a bunch of smaller ones. The Big Island is Eurasia and it has more people, more resources and more \\"geographic advantages\\" than the other islands.According Mackinder, any power that can unify/integrate or dominate this \\"world island\\" will inevitably become the unchallenged world superpower. The formal term for this is \\"Global Hegemon\\".The US is located in North America. So it has a nice secure location on one of the \\"smaller islands\\". This secure location (plus an abundance of resources) has allowed the US to become an unchallenged *regional* hegemon. The only potential threat to the regional hegemon would be the emergence of an unchallenged global one. The US therefore seeks to do everything it can to **prevent the rise of a Hegemon anywhere in Eurasia**. Once you understand this, a lot of history suddenly makes a lot more sense.* The \\"late to the party\\" US intervention in WWI.* The \\"late to the party\\" US intervention in WWII.* US military actions in Korea and Vietnam and the Middle East. The next part is more speculative, but it is based on reasoning from first principles. If you want to deal with a potential competing hegemon, you can play defense or offence. So preventative actions could be seen as being defensive in nature. But the other approach is to be pre-emptive (e.g. \\"the best defense is a good offence\\").So a rational actor might seek to create a beachhead.Definition: a defended position on a beach taken from the enemy by landing forces, from which an attack can be launched.At the geopolitical/strategic level, do we see anything that looks like an American beachhead on the world island? Sure we do.* Hundreds of overseas military bases* South Korea* Israel* All of NATO extending deep into Eastern Europe (imo the biggest beachhead).* Probably Syria (since a couple of weeks ago).* Afghanistan was imo another attempt at creating a \\"world island beachhead\\" by the US... probably mostly aimed at China.If you're still with me, you can now see how the 20 year long US involvement in Afghanistan makes strategic sense. Afghanistan is located just to the West of China. And China is a rapidly rising power in Eurasia.If I think about World Island Theory, China's seizure of Tibet makes a lot more sense. China's crackdown on Xinjiang and the Uyghurs makes a lot more sense. The way the US was willing to spend 20 years in Afghanistan makes a lot more sense.I think they wanted a location from which they could stir up trouble for China in the western Xinjiang region. If China had been slower to react, they would have faced a significant internal challenge. A nation with a huge internal problem is more distracted and less capable of projecting power externally.And since a picture is worth a thousand words...[Afghanistan-Xinjiang Map](https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FFe0adjXEAUG1l5.jpeg)For anyone who read this far and understood everything, congratulations... you now understand the situation at a higher level than 99.975% of everyone else.","title":"Was the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan primarily aimed at significantly increasing heroin exports to generate trillions of dollars and profiting billions for U.S. military contractors, rather than fighting the Taliban and creating a stable country?"},{"text":"Ah Crap, you're right.

Depends on the state but its very difficult to impossible. Medical debt is becoming more and more frowned upon by the law especially in blue states.In almost every state (and maybe every state, Im just leaving the option open because Im not 100% sure off hand) your domicile is exempt from liens or seizures except via foreclosure.You can put a lien on someones vacation home but not their primary residence. You cant lose your home unless you dont pay the mortgage.\\nWage garnishment is less universal. In some states, like NY, its illegal to garnish wages as well for medical debt. So all they can go after is your other non essential assets, which, if you had any youd use to pay.Even if its legal under state law, its still hard to get a garnishment in practice. Its more likely to happen if just ignore them entirely and get a default judgement. But, in most states, if they sue and you actually show up to court the judge is going to work something out short of a wage garnishment. Actually contesting the debt scares most debt collectors off, because its highly unlikely they are going to recover enough of the debt to make it worth the legal costs. You cant get blood from a stone. But if you live in a blue state and dont have liquid assets to pay the medical debt you didnt agree to and is entirely unreasonable? Id just tell them that.

(1) the facility charge which is typically the largest; (2) the ER physician bill for the doctor that popped in to speak with you for 8 minutes (second largest); and (3) the radiology bill if you had any scans for the radiologist that reviewed the scans (typically the smallest component).The other thing no one is aware of is a great tidbit from the ACA that requires non profit and not for profit hospitals (a really large share of them) to offer indigent care programs for people within certain income thresholds.  If they don't they lose their preferential tax status. These programs *can* get the entirety of the debt written off, partially written off, or they may enroll you in your state's medicaid program if you're eligible.

But to achieve that, they had a very burtal training regime that abused little girls since they were toddlers in order to turn them into the perfect gymnasts.

This is how they both had gymnastics hegemony (equivalent of \\"super technologically advanced\\" while also had abused girls (equivalent of \\"people that were starving\\").You can also say that US under capitalism is super technologically advanced (because it is, it is arguably the most technologically advanced country in the world) while people are still dying on the streets because they have diabetes and can't afford insuline.I hope that clears it up.?It was all bleak and depressing, but then you hear about older people missing it, or you hear that they had assumed homelessness as a lie from their propaganda machine.I am from an ex-communist country (Romania) and I can explain it. They are not nostalgic of the regime, they are nostalgic of their youth.

The other option is to get in a small rowboat and row to the other island.One day, someone proposes a bridge between the islands. The other islanders like this idea and decide to vote on a leader for the bridge project.We pay the ferryman every day and he's a nice enough guy. He also is successful and runs two separate ferries with the help of his sons. He wins the vote and is hired to plan out and build the bridge. He starts collecting taxes in addition to the fees we are already paying, as we continue to take the ferry to work. Over the next few years, the ferryman builds out the dock longer and longer from each island. He has also placed a restriction on row boats, so now the ferry is the only way across. He has also raised the price on the ferry fee. Over time, it becomes apparent that the ferry man has no intention of finishing the bridge. However, people are referring to the docks as \\"the bridge\\". We are worse off.The ferryman knows that if the bridge is ever completed, then he will be worse off since no one will take his ferry.\\nIn this metaphor, bridges are Communism.

Your argument takes it for granted that \\"this guy used to be a communist, then he was a fascist, therefore fascism = communism\\" explains how this is supposed to work, when in actual practice, as philosophies of economic governance, they diverged wildly in a lot of key respects, specifically in regards to class politics - fascists wanted to preserve capitalist class relations, communists wanted to abolish it (they failed to, but that's a can of worms by itself). Gender issues are another example - fascists had a very conservative view of gender, communists tended to be more sympathetic towards feminism. A philosophy isn't necessarily defined by what a person used to believe before they arrived to it, it's defined by what it itself says and does.Like, just as an example - some famous neoconservatives used to be Trotskyists in their youth. Does that make Neoconservatism a development of Trotskyism?EDIT: TL;DR - it's more accurate to say that fascism was a response to communism and to the same class conflicts that informed communism rather than an outgrowth.

While fascists may be more \\"honest\\" about their aims, that actually makes them more dangerous - they can rally support more effectively and implement their agenda faster.Look at what happened in Romania under the Iron Guard - they were extremely open about their aims and managed to quickly organize pogroms and massacres. The fact that they were straightforward about their hatred actually helped them recruit and radicalize people more effectively.The Soviets, despite their many crimes, at least operated under constraints and had to maintain some pretense of serving the people. This actually limited how far they could go - they couldn't openly call for genocide or ethnic cleansing like fascists did. Even during the worst of Stalinist repression, they had to justify their actions through some twisted logic of \\"protecting the revolution\\" rather than openly celebrating violence like fascists.I've studied extensively how both ideologies played out in Eastern Europe specifically. While both were horrific, fascist movements were able to implement their genocidal aims much more rapidly and thoroughly precisely because they didn't hide their intentions. The \\"honesty\\" of fascists isn't a mitigating factor - it's what made them more effective at mass murder.The hypocrisy of Stalinist apologists is despicable, but I'd argue it's still marginally better than proudly advocating for genocide from the start. At least their need to maintain ideological pretenses somewhat constrained their actions, while fascists faced no such limitations.","title":"CMV: Communism (the faction that are USSR/Stalin apologists) are worse tha Fascism"},{"text":"Iraq failed because the US did not intend to liberate its people. Its primary goals were to open Iraqi oil to the free market, secure control over that oil, further weaken the Iraqi state and military, use Iraq as a strategic base against Russia and Iran and prevent Iraq from supporting or doing any anti-Israel activities. Freedom and democracy for the Iraqi people were merely a facade to justify an otherwise unjustifiable invasion, supported by false claims about WMDs. Fun Fact: \\"*Operation Iraqi Freedom\\"* was originally named \\"*Operation Iraqi Liberation\\"* but it was changed because the acronym spelled \\"OIL\\"Now, 20 years later, Iraq's oil industry is the only functioning sector of the economy, largely controlled by American corporations. Other industries, such as mining, agriculture, and even natural gas, have been neglected, with gas often flared by American companies. The only exception to this economic centralization around Oil, is the tourism sector. The Iraqi economy only started diversification after the Chinese entered Iraq and signed contracts to reconstruct the country which they have done a great job in the past 7 years despite pro-US militias targeting of Chinese citizens and companies.And Germany, Italy and Japan were liberalized and economically developed after World War II not solely for selfless reasons, but to prevent the resurgence of fascism and to demonstrate to the world that capitalism was superior to the Soviet model. And the US decided to write the new constitution itself (Or just copying the 1925 constitution and modernizing it), force sectarianism/Confessionalist politics as means to equalize all sections of the population and give more power to the Kurds. And the US administration in 2003 released all political prisoners and pardoned most Ba'athist ideologs following the war without any proper background checks and fully dismantled all state and military institutions and tried to rebuild them, so that was a really stupid and mostly intended decision.","title":"CMV: Democracy is not always a better system than dictatorship in any given country"},{"text":"I'm not sure how \\"tankies being in denial\\" makes them worse than fascists killing people today and also being in denial.","title":"CMV: Communism (the faction that are USSR/Stalin apologists) are worse tha Fascism"},{"text":"He can't talk about what he plans to do because it would make him look like the absolute piece of shit human being he is.","title":"Trump rants about Bidens offshore 625 million acre drilling ban, Thats like the whole ocean!

Maybe as opposed to Biden, but only because Obama was competent and didn't make the US look ridiculous by constantly wandering off, losing focus midway through a sentence, or generally just saying things that didn't make any sense. I'll give Obama this much, he was a well educated man. He spoke very elegantly, which made people want to listen to him.

PRICEUnpaid medical bills will no longer appear on credit reports, where they can block people from mortgages, car loans or small business loans, according to a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule will remove $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, according to the bureau, which means lenders will no longer be able to take that into consideration when deciding to issue a loan.The change is estimated to raise the credit scores by an average of 20 points and could lead to 22,000 additional mortgages being approved every year, according to the bureau. Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement announcing the rule that it would be lifechanging for millions of families.No one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or experienced a medical emergency, she said.Harris also announced that states and local governments have used a sweeping 2021 pandemic-era aid package to eliminate more than $1 billion in medical debt for more than 700,000 Americans.The administration announced plans for the rule in fall 2023.The CFPB said that medical debt is a poor predictor of an individuals ability to repay a loan. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said last year that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.\\nThe new rule from the Biden administration is set to take on the outstanding bills appearing on credit reports.","title":"Biden administration bans unpaid medical bills from appearing on credit reports"},{"text":"*Nor.

The issue has to do with voters who registered  many years and election cycles ago  using a form that predated the federal Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, of 2002. The pre-HAVA registration form did not clearly mandate registrants provide the last four digits of their Social Security number or their driver's license number.Griffin has also protested the counting of ballots submitted by some absentee military and overseas voters who did not provide photo identification, even though [state administrative code](http://reports.oah.state.nc.us/ncac/title%2008%20-%20elections/chapter%2017%20-%20photo%20identification/08%20ncac%2017%20.0109.pdf), in accordance with federal law, explicitly excuses such overseas voters from that requirement.Additionally, Griffin has alleged some ballots should be discarded because they were cast by ineligible voters who live overseas. These protests claim children of overseas voters  for example, missionaries and military personnel  who had never resided in North Carolina, should not have been allowed to vote, though such voters [are eligible under state law](https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/reside), again, in line with federal laws protecting the voting rights of overseas citizens.Credit to North Carolina Public Radio - [https://www.wunc.org/politics/2025-01-06/griffin-riggs-north-carolina-supreme-court-election-states-rights](https://www.wunc.org/politics/2025-01-06/griffin-riggs-north-carolina-supreme-court-election-states-rights)","title":"Republicans on the NC Supreme Court block certification of the Democratic incumbents election"},{"text":"Now for student loans.","title":"Biden administration bans unpaid medical bills from appearing on credit reports"},{"text":"This is getting ridiculous  its a joke right?","title":"Trump nominates lesbian Fox host who believes Dems are making \\"human-animal chimera\\" from Hell - Tammy Bruce has a long history of extreme statements.

I was born in the 1970s. So:* Was Biden better than Nixon? Uhm, yeah.\\n* Was Biden better than Ford?  Yes.\\n* Was Biden better than Carter? Carter was pretty decent but he did set in motion certain things that we actually blame Reagan for. For example, the deregulation of everything and the monetarist economy both started with Carter, and while changes to regulation were arguably necessary, the reforms made were over the top. Monetarism is awful, I'll get to that later. Basically he was responsible for the consensus-until-Biden that fighting inflation should take priority over jobs, and if you need to throw people out of work to lower inflation, you should do it.\\n* Was Biden better than Reagan? Given Reagan is about 99% responsible for this shit, yes.\\n* Was Biden better than Bush? Yes.\\n* Was Biden better than Clinton? Given Clinton killed the concept of the Democrats governing from the left and achieved nothing useful, even gutting Welfare in the process, I'd say yes.\\n* Was Biden better than Bush Jr? Do you have to ask? Not that Bush was the worst President on this list...\\n* Was Biden better than Obama? Obama's legacy is mixed. He did preside over a recovery, and did some reforms to healthcare, and yes, he got Bin Laden. OTOH if you're going to claim Biden is responsible for fascism, then the same argument needs to be made against Obama. Realistically there was no good reason to vote for Trump in 2016. The economy was Obama's. The fruits of the ACA were coming into force and people could easily see what they were. But Her Emails. \\n* Was Biden better than Trump? Do you even need to ask that.What did Biden achieve?* He got the post-pandemic/post-Trump economy under control, just not soon enough to be disassociated by the public with inflation that was clearly a result of Trump-COVID.\\n* He did this without intentionally starting a recession. That's a HUGE deal, because since (and including) Carter every single President has seen \\"starting a recession and throwing millions out of work\\" as the way to deal with inflation.\\n* He ensured huge numbers of people drowning in debt from student loans, a government scheme to encourage predatory lending, had their debts written off. He did that despite attempts by SCOTUS to invent new meanings to words to block it.\\n* There's all kinds of other \\"Cleaning up the mess\\" stuff Biden deserves credit for.Of course, it could be argued he did all this by delegating everything to the experts. Arguably this was the first administration in decades that actually listened to experts instead of James Carville types when deciding what to do.And maybe that's ultimately what sunk it. Because the Carvilles knows jack shit about the economy, but they know how to win an election.","title":"Give Biden his due, he has been one of the best presidents of our time"},{"text":"Shes the only one who wore red","title":"Hillary Clinton recieves Medal of Freedom"},{"text":"Can I call you Dad?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 7, 2025"},{"text":"Joshua Tree is an amazing place to go star gazing!

(said shock being the double whammy of showa financial crisis + great depression in Japan, and loans + great depression in Germany)I agree -- but my point is that the factors being in place to sustain a democracy are not limited to the West, and the West is not immune to shocks destroying democracy. e.g., outside agitation and Western media certainly contributed to Iran's first democratic revolution -- and its current, seemingly-inevitable theocratic totalitarianism was a direct result of the shock of western *anti-democratic* intervention.And I have faith that as long as a nation's population is sufficiently liberalised and educated and they are given the right boost, they will independently create a democracy if no one stops them over time.My central point is that it is then in the population's best interests for outside influences to help create liberalism and education, to convey values that promote human rights and humanism generally, and to participate in a global economy that incentivizes peace, prosperity and individual freedom ... in other words, to participate in the 'western world'. This influence stops far short of marching an army in and saying, \\"Democracy now, or else.\\"Not saying we shouldn't press our influence and give them a boost if the population is actively fighting for democracy, because we aren't imposing it on them are we?Of course -- but I'd take it a step further and say that in many cases, Western cultural, social and economic influence facilitated those positions in the first place.

The bill expands the definition of domestic violence in a way that could affect victims of domestic violence negatively. This is the key issue as domestic violence is often complicated and this bill lacks exceptions or conviction requirements that the current law provides.Democrats have suggested changes to the bill to address these concerns but they weren't added.The only alternative is that they are lying and they secretly love immigrants sexually assaulting people which is something only the dumbest person on earth could believe.","title":"How TF are the Democrats even a legitimate political party?

The Dems could have changed the Filibuster to make it harder to use (which only requires a simple majority vote to change the Senate rules), for example changing it so that it requires 3 Senators to start one in the future and make them physically stand there like in the old times. Harry Reid even got rid of the filibuster when confirming Federal judges because the GOP was abusing it so much and was blocking Obama's picks so much. If Dems continue to stick to the rules that screws them over then it's about time people start to realize the Dems were never serious about their campaign promises. there was no way Obama was using his political capital on passing an abortion rights measure when there was little chance (at the time) of Roe v. Wade being overturned.If there were such little chance, then why did he (and other Dems) campaign on it? Why would he make such grand promises to sign a national abortion law? The fact of the matter is Dems always use abortion rights to scare voters into the voting booth. It's just this time the Dems underestimated the GOP (once again). They probably don't really care it got repealed because they can still fundraise off of it in near perpetuity now that it really is under serious threat.

I told you to think of one. I never said they don't. After all this time, you couldn't name one.  The whole purpose of that experiment was to simply see, if you could come up with one example of large scale architecture that isn't derived from a western school. After what 3 hours, you still couldn't. Now how do you expect any architect to get a developer to let them build a whole skyscraper in a style like that, when they can't even imagine it.   That just demonstrates the absolute cultural dominance of a few western schools in large scale architecture. Simply that aside from apparently one nation around the world, no one even thinks of making their own traditional architecture anymore outside of religious purposes. And that proves my goddamn point doesn't it. If it wasn't for the absolute dominance of western architecture, we could see a hundred different new styles.  Plus, if you haven't realised, they're all from China, which is currently undergoing one of the rare cultural renaissances that aren't being instantly crushed by overwhelming western influence. Japan and Korea also had or are undergoing their own thingy, but China's is on a larger scale. And the only reason China is undergoing this revival of their traditional architecture is because they have reached a level where at least at home they are starting to be able counter western influence or shut it off entirely. Also because they have a whole great firewall going on. (that's the bad part) But that has yielded wonders because surprise surprise, without the flooding of western influences, the chinese aren't just making fancy new reconstruction chinese architecture, they're reimagining chinese traditional clothing but modern and all other elements of their culture. And imo, that is fantastic news.  (ignoring again the great firewall stuff).If our companies stopped flooding markets  with cultural propaganda at the moment of resistance, maybe India could do the same once it starts building skyscrapers. Even so, its kind of a shame that the skylines are all still dotted with western style skyscrapers, but at least they're trying? I'm not saying stuff like the Petronas towers is bad, or in the wrong direction. I'm just saying, there's a lot of potential to do more and it isn't happening right now. Instead of being a vague reference like the Burj Khalifa is, or the Burj Al-Arab, something that is actually islamic in style and built by islamic architects would be better.","title":"CMV: The western world, in particular America and Western Europe should attempt to curb or limit its influence on developing nations"},{"text":"The common clay of the new West.","title":"Give Biden his due, he has been one of the best presidents of our time"},{"text":"This was abundantly clear two years in.

Full disclosure, Im a pretty consistent blue voter who did vote for KH this year.People are affording less than they used to despite making more.

Imagine sitting at home, having moved companies after 10 years at the same place because of the bigger paycheck so you, your spouse, and kids could have a better life. Then you see that 25% bump in pay, which was supposed to be vacations you couldnt afford, a bigger home, and eating out more, being doled out to keep you at the same level. All this while you watch CEOs and C-Suites getting massive pay bumps and lavish bonuses.Now its a month until election time and, after putting the kids to bed, you turn on the TV to decide who you want as the next president. Then you hear Harris giving non-answers and word salad to question after question. Border security, which was a problem? Mean Trump blocked our bill. Rising food prices? Were going to ask manufacturers to stop making food cost so much. Inflation? We have a bill, no please dont ask how it works.Trump stares directly at you and rapid fires ideas. Tariffs to create jobs in the US that are better paid. A strong border so American citizens get those jobs. Encourage food manufacturer competition to bring down prices at the grocery store.As Ive stated, Im not saying those ideas will work. Im saying having ideas and being able to articulate them clearly speaks a hell of a lot more to the average working family than waffling and word salads that essentially give no concrete plans. Reddit masturbated themselves profusely on the concepts of a plan motif but the reality is Trump had them. She didnt.Not only did she lose both the EC and popular vote, she didnt flip a singular county across the US. Do you know how many there are? Trump flipped 4 *key* counties and I dont even know how many non battleground counties. And in the battleground counties Harris did maintain, in almost all of them she lost margin versus Biden.I dont know how you can watch her campaign, interviews, see the results, and conclude anything but this was a poorly ran campaign.Ive finally included a link to a prior discussion I had.

But continuing with the hypothetical, why couldn't you put office space or whatever the fuck you need in a skyscraper in something that vaguely resembles a minaret? Sure the current form might not be practical in any respect for that purpose, but you can change it to do so. How do you think western architects got their ideas from for the first tall towers?

Skyscrapers are a natural consequence of technological advance, and the country that reached the fastest technological advance just happend to be USA due to  reasons. And theyre all built by western firms, every single one of the examples you mentioned. That is simply incorrect, and you couldve check that yourself. The developer of Petronas Towers is KLCC Property Holdings Berhad (KLCCP) which is a Malaysian firm with a Malaysian CEO. The engineers firms were from Japan, Korea and only one of them was from US. The architect is an Argentinian man. That just proves my point. In relation to skyscraper architecture, our understanding of what is possible is so grounded in European/American schools, that we cant even imagine what a skyscraper could look like otherwise. That doesnt mean skyscrapers are a western concept. Humanity has been dreaming of reaching the sky since we could build. The Ziggurat of Babel is based on the myth of reaching for the sky, and so are the pyramids. As I said, it just so happened that USA was the first nation with enough technology to *actually build one*.Western influence has so thoroughly suppressed other schools, that there is not one example that comes to mind that goes against the vein.

Poilievre was pro-immigration and even refrained from the talk of reducing immigration until it became popular and the Liberals adopted the talk themselves. Poilievre reminds me more than a little of Jason Kenney - an experienced politician lacking in personal charismaI prefer Kenney more but Poilievre is far more charismatic.

China, Japan and South Korea are all cultural behemoths, producing games, tv, music, social media etc. The European states, although not nearing the east asian countries in population, each have substantial cultural soft power in their own way that might not be influencing other places, but does keep them from being too influenced by the US. Former English colonies in Africa are the most vulnerable to US influence walking all over them. For instance, Kenya and Nigeria are still struggling with a unified cultural identity because they are intrinsically products of colonialism. Also, they speak English.

People have been building giant dick shaped obelisks in the middle of the desert for centuries.[See the Manhattan of the Desert](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/shibam-mud-skyscraper-yemen)You dont seem to understand what architectural style is. A skyscraper is not a styles. It is a type of structure. For example Egypt, Maya, Aztecs, Nubians all had pyramids and all were, frankly, made of stone. They were very different from each other in shape and mythological concept, but they used the same basic shape- the pyramid, and materials- stone And some dick shaped obelisks are based on local culture and mythology, such as the Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia which evoce the shape of Islamic Minarets on a huge scale, which prove they can a do experience with their own architectural styles. There are other massive structures that drawn inspiration from local culture such as Evergrande Statium in China, thats literally planned in the shape of a lotus or the Kengo Kumas new Folk Art Museum that draws inspiration from Hangzou vernacular architecture.The Marina Bay Sand in Singapore is built in the shape of a boat used by natives, evoking the local maritime history of Singapore and its connection to the sea. And most importantly, the biggest dick shaped obelisk there is, the Burj Khalifa draws inspiration from the local desert flower, the spider Lilly on a very profound level. The structure itself (aka the heart of the building) is based on this flower, it literally utilizes this flowers geometric properties for structural strength and wind resistance - hence the tripod base. Drawing inspiration from local wildlife is **the only reason** they could build it so high in such a climate. It also uses traditional Islamic patterns such as the mashrabiya.These are just a few examples. I agree with your opinion in general but I think it comes from a very narrow and frankly ignorant point of view.","title":"CMV: The western world, in particular America and Western Europe should attempt to curb or limit its influence on developing nations"},{"text":"I think if you take a step back and take a wider view, the Sudanese conflict was not especially remarkable or unusual.

Is it even plausible that this mechanism would *not* exist? Economic development is usually accompanied by increasing cultural influence; as a market becomes bigger and wealthier, it becomes a much more significant entertainment, social and cultural market in its own right. Look at South Korean culture's influence in southeast Asia today.The reason that Dubai is covered in glass and steel architecture is because those in power in Dubai *aspire to have glass and steel architecture there --* and it isn't displacing some indigenous style of high-rise, they'll need a history of building skyscrapers before they invent their own unique style of skyscraper. It's unreasonable to expect a developing country to develop an indigenous form of foreign innovation *before benefiting from that innovation.*Pivoting to social and political norms...Countries like Indonesia which are complex and multifaceted need the room to figure out a legal code and political system that works for them, even if it might not agree with our sensibilities.I'm not sure that imposing \\"our sensibilities\\" on other nations, within reason, is a bad thing -- we didn't arrive at the idea of human rights (like the right to self determination, or the right to life, or the right to expression) out of a vacuum; most people want those rights, at least *for themselves*. When you contrast the Swiss or French or UK or Spanish political systems, you are contrasting fundamentally democratic and humanist political systems; the differences are in mechanics, not fundamental values.When the individual people in a place don't hold those values, it's hard to get a political system based on those values to stick -- but that doesn't mean that *getting the people to hold those values* isn't a good idea, or a useful effort... and it does tend to ultimately pay off. 93% of the world's democracies are less than a century old. 80% are less than 60 years old.
