But most progressives do not view public disorder as crime, particularly if it comes from  so-called *vulnerable populations:* homeless, drug addicts, and mentally ill.  In many cities, especially west coast cities, progressives have shut down most public order enforcement. A common progressive perspective:Just view public disorder like a spell of unpleasant weather. You'll get used to it.2) Crime is not that bad because of increased self-protection steps that significant segments of the populace are been taking:\\nNew fences, gated driveways, security systems; people avoiding bad neighborhoods; people selective about where they park and \\"never leave anything in your car\\" (the most recent advice in S.F.); more guns, dogs, neighborhood watches and gated communities, bicyclists buying $300 locks because of *theft paranoia;*\\nOn a business/gov. level, more security guards and cameras all over cities (costs on citizens), retailers locking up a big % of their products (costs on consumers), some businesses ending late night hours, hostile architecture like walking easements removed, restrooms hard to find, parks closing earlier.People do these things when they perceive government backing off on pursuing criminals, often at the behest of criminal justice reformers. Self protection is very effective in reducing crime. It was the primary method of suppressing crime before the rise of policing 600 years ago.  Unfortunately self protection imposes big costs and inconvenience on the law abiding. Progressive CJ reformers downplay the role of self-protection. Progressive criminologists (that's most criminologists) omit the factor of self-protection in their analysis.

It is not violent crime that concerns most people; it is property crime and chronic public disorder. Notable: The rising problem of homeless addicts commandeering public spaces. Public disorder is higher than 30 years ago.\\nProgressives and other people are at odds on this for the simple reason that progressive don't view most public disorder offenses as crimes. This also affects how crime levels are analyzed by criminologists.  Most social scientists are progressives.  Progressives often don't want arrests and sanctions or imposed treatment for low-level nonviolent crime.  A common progressive perspective:Just view public disorder like a spell of unpleasant weather. You'll get used to it.= = =How do you explain the steady decrease of arrests in california over the last two decades? A big part  is prosecutors and courts engaging in *Catch and Release* with no or minimal penalties for habitual non-violent offenders.  If it were up to cops, law enforcement would be much harsher.  Cops, generalizing, are the most hard-ass entity in the justice system.  They are also are lesser agents in the law enforcement.  Prosecutors and courts signal to police what type of arrests they want.  These two entities, now  enamored by the criminal justice reform trend in Calif.,  have downsized enforcement against a lot of non-violent crime.  That's especially the case if the offenders are in a so-called *vulnerable population:*   homeless, drug addicts, mentally ill and sometimes POC youth who have experienced racism in the justice system.  Upshot:  Cops annoyed at all this Catch and Release, seeing the same habitual offenders back on the street time and again,  respond with fewer arrests.

He hated that, and I wouldn't necessarily expect that to happen again, but they were correct in their analysis. After that, the rest of the time was just waiting for the votes to be reported on. Often, we were just waiting for a tipping point on key states where the blue flip happened, and by then it was clear Trump could not catch up.I truly do not think it will take that long for us to know this time.

I'm South Bay born and raised. Growing up when I was more adventurous I'd get an extra 40 from the liquor store and head under the pier to trade some booze and company for some fascinating life stories. Lawyers who lost their families to schizophrenia, or a guy's wife drove off a cliff one night and he couldn't take it and stopped working. There has been a paradigm shift ever since meth started truly infecting Los Angeles. Venice beach used to be chill as fuck, you could always find a friendly surf bum to score some weed or shrooms from. Nowadays Venice is hood as fuck, and absolutely terrifying at night.We all know its been here for decades, but I think we've gotten a lot of homeless from other states (even other countries) where they come from a red state where meth use is just rampant, or are road homeless, the kind that sleep with one eye open and carry a box cutter. I'd chance a guess that when your homeless, and you don't need to sleep, it doesn't matter if you have a bed or not. Then I'd guess the paranoia sets in after a few days and you can meet some truly troubled looking dudes just walking your dog.I will say I'm lucky I live in the beach cities, it's kinda sad that the cops just pick up the homeless and make them someone elses problem, but tweekers gon' tweek.

You are correct about Title 42 in that it blocked all asylum claims and deported everyone, but what you leave out is that Title 42 was invoked strictly because of the pandemic, so you know it would end once the fear of COVID calmed down. Which is why Title 42 ended early last year. If Biden had not removed Remain in Mexico, it would still be in effect to this day.Democrats hated Remain in Mexico. Remain in Mexico was a republican policy. You cannot keep policy, as a democrat, that the democratic base did not want. So it needed to be removed. [29% of democrats thought the border was a big problem](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/05/PP_2021.05.03_immigration_00-05.png) in 2021.

The democrats needed to agree that there was a problem before the democratic president and democratic senate could take action. Title 42 going into his presidency, because border crossing and still sky rocketed in '21, '22, and '23.

The problem went on hold, both because of season migration patterns and because of COVID 19. The next problem is the mechanism of Title 42. It immediately deports migrants, but does not take them farther than outside of the US-Mexico border. This means people are left just outside of the border, to immediately try to get in the US again. As COVID 19 became less of a problem, it began to spike again, and this mechanism made things worse which you can see the beginning of, [starting in the Trump administration before Biden took over](https://i.imgur.com/g2l88Tt.jpeg).The border patrol released a statement on it in. January 2021:Since early 2020, CBP has faced a growing number of individuals attempting to cross the southwest border, averaging about 3,000 arrests per day in January 2021.[]\\"CBP believes this increase is caused by several factors, including underlying crime and instability in migrants home countries, which have been exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and inaccurate perceptions of shifts in immigration and border security policies.\\"[...]The vast majority of these encounters occur between official ports of entry. Further, the Border Patrol estimates that between March 20, 2020 and February 4, 2021, 38 percent of all encounters involved recidivism, or individuals who have been apprehended more than once.https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-announces-january-2021-operational-updateHe was using it, as Ive outlined, it increased due to both recidivism and instability in SA.\\n I honestly don't remember Ted Cruz introducing it to the senate,U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today introduced the Secure the Border Act of 2023 in the Senate. This bill passed the House of Representatives as H.R. 2, and it is the most comprehensive border security legislation in decades. The Secure the Border Act will resume construction on the wall, tighten asylum standards, criminalize visa overstays, increase the number of Border Patrol Agents, defund NGOs receiving tax dollars to help traffic illegal aliens throughout the heartland, prohibit DHS from using its app to assist illegal aliens, and more.https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-senate-companion-to-house-passed-secure-the-border-act but why would he introduce it to the senate then vote against it?Donald Trump.Your bit about republican strategy doesnt make sense  at the end of the day, foreign aid for Ukraine got passed, and no money went to the border. Great strategy. What's more, not counted in that 5,000 daily limit are unaccompanied children, parolees, those who claim a fear of persecution, have already been in the U.S. for 14 days, or already traveled beyond 100 miles from the southwest border. . You said \\"Further, every single one of those 5000 people would have been detained.\\" The issue there is the bill redefines detention to noncustodial detention which is just another fancy word for RELEASED. Plus, that only applies to individual adults.After digging through the bill, I found no evidence for either of these claims. Where did you get this? Your first claim contains some of the cases where someone might be put on the path towards and asylum interview (fear of persecution)  perhaps you read a blog that seriously misunderstood the text? Also, the part that was not a lie, was the immediate work permits. This bill codifies Sen. Mayorkas asylum processing rule, which gives aliens work authorization immediately upon release. Just give a fake asylum claim to get in, remain and work in the US.The bill outlines a very strict asylum process. I would suggest reading it before continuing to rail against it: https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2Edit: here are some bits of the bill:(16) This title ends the disparate policies of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 by ensuring the swift return of all unaccompanied alien children to their country of origin if they are not victims of trafficking and do not have a fear of return..(1) IN GENERAL.Notwithstanding any other provision of law, judicial determination, consent decree, or settlement agreement, the detention of any alien child who is not an unaccompanied alien child shall be governed by sections 217, 235, 236, and 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187, 1225, 1226, and 1231). **There is no presumption that an alien child who is not an unaccompanied alien child should not be detained.**.TITLE VII--IMMIGRATION PAROLE REFORM [...] This section **restricts DHS from granting parole to non-U.S. nationals who are already in the United States, with specified exceptions, such as for certain individuals who already have an approved petition for a family-sponsored visa and are the spouse or child of an active duty member of the Armed Forces.**.This section also bars an individual from applying for asylum if the individual traveled through at least one third country before arriving in the United States, with certain exceptions (e.g., the individual applied for and was denied asylum in that third country).\\n.(Sec. 102) This section modifies the standard for establishing an asylum applicant's credible fear of persecution. Specifically, to find credible fear, an asylum officer must find that the applicant could more likely than not establish eligibility for asylum. Currently, an asylum officer must conclude that there is a significant possibility that the applicant could establish eligibility for asylum..This section imposes additional requirements on DHS related to the construction of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. For example, the bill requires DHS to construct a border wall (including related infrastructure and technology) along at least 900 miles of that border, whereas currently DHS is required to have at least 700 miles of reinforced fencing along that border.","title":"CMV: Trump doesn't actually care about the border"},{"text":"Why is this a story?

No, it's not.Go back to Locke. Liberalism assumes the rule of law. In a liberal society we grant our government the right to make certain life-and-death choices that are not available to us, and are not limited to war.It matters not, from a liberal/illiberal standpoint, if you can be 100% sure of the guilt of the condemned. The standard of proof is determined by our laws and the courts, and it is not 100% for pretty much any law you care to name. For our most serious crimes and punishments, we use the \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\" standard. So long as the conviction meets that standard, and punishment is enacted in accordance with the law, it is compatible with liberalism.Now having said all that, a liberal society can certainly decide it wants nothing to do with capital punishment (or require some sort of \\"100%\\" standard, which is just a less-clear way of saying the same thing), and pass laws to that effect. Illiberal societies can do the same (though I note they seem to be more supportive of state-sponsored violence, not less). It's an orthogonal concern.EDIT: The deleted comment below also correctly pointed out that rule of law _alone_ is not sufficient, in the liberal tradition, to justify capital punishment C rights and ethics play an important role in whether it ought to be permitted in any particular case. They further pointed out that Voltaire, my flair, had severe misgivings about governmental overreach. I don't think it invalidates the point, though, that capital punishment is compatible with liberalism.","title":"Is the Death Penalty illiberal by default?"},{"text":"People voted for it, they fucking voted for it, own it","title":"CMV: Police haven't been defunded by and large they have just stopped enforcing laws and that's why crime has got so our of control in California."},{"text":"Yup, not shocked.","title":"A short ?? on the Zionist operatives who maligned/defamed/slandered Rashida Tlaib and are now trying to pretend they didn't."},{"text":"extremely likely is not beyond a reasonable doubt, execution can not be valid.","title":"Supreme Court allows Missouri to execute Marcellus Williams"},{"text":"That makes his statement even worse.","title":"Harris donors are younger and less partisan than Bidens"},{"text":"Also everyone's morals are screwed up, no one cares about anything but themselves anymore, the list goes on.

After reviewing and refreshing on the details of case and trial much more closely, a lot of the stuff being brought into question seem noticeably hyped up more than they should be, while the evidence that was used in trial seems downplayed a bit. DNA wasn't a factor due to 2001 technology, and the new DNA was found to be from an investigator and assistant attorney handling it, which doesn't really mean much outside the idea it might have spoiled any even older DNA. The reliability of two testimonies are another question, like the possibility of reward money and other incentives, but that doesnt seem so clear, with some reports apparently saying the girlfriend never accepted any money.Notwithstanding other issues, whether it stands up to scrutiny in retrospect, and the dementedness of pushing it through so hard, I think it just comes back to questioning if this was fundamentally anywhere near the level of justifying the death penalty, if not reasonable doubt, along with questions of how disproportionate or excessive many sentences are, both for this and to a lesser extent other sentences the man was already serving for earlier crimes. And that just the specter of the death penalty and the whole process around it just generally makes things worse for almost everyone around it.","title":"Supreme Court allows Missouri to execute Marcellus Williams"},{"text":"Its one helluva drug ??","title":"While Democrats are autographing missiles for war, Donald Trump is buying peoples groceries.

You are correct about Title 42 in that it blocked all asylum claims and deported everyone, but what you leave out is that Title 42 was invoked strictly because of the pandemic, so you know it would end once the fear of COVID calmed down. Which is why Title 42 ended early last year. If Biden had not removed Remain in Mexico, it would still be in effect to this day. What I would say is irrelevant is the fact that Biden kept Title 42 going into his presidency, because border crossing and still sky rocketed in '21, '22, and '23. It's like what's the point keeping the comprehensive act that allows you to deport everyone if you're not going to use it? Strictly optics?I honestly don't remember Ted Cruz introducing it to the senate, but why would he introduce it to the senate then vote against it?In my opinion, it's disingenuous to say that the Republicans happily passed the foreign aid part but not the border part. It's a negotiation. Of course the Republicans love giving money to Israel, but not Ukraine. They were negotiating giving money to Ukraine in exchange for stricter border policies. When they didn't receive the stronger border policies they were pushing for, they shot down the deal. The Democrats could have \\"happily\\" offered the stricter border policies that the name \\"border bill\\" implies are there, but they refused. When that happened, the Republicans used what leverage they had and refused to give those billions of dollars to Ukraine and Gaza. But this is simple senate politics that were weaponized against Republicans and Trump.I'm sorry, but that part is not a lie. You need to look deeper. It does allow that daily amount, and you are also correct in that it is up to DHS discretion on who they allow in, however, this is only for people apprehended BETWEEN ports of entry. What's more, not counted in that 5,000 daily limit are unaccompanied children, parolees, those who claim a fear of persecution, have already been in the U.S. for 14 days, or already traveled beyond 100 miles from the southwest border. What's with all the stipulations!? Just keep the illegal migrants out! Plus, the Secretary would not be able to activate the authority for more than 270 days, 225 days, and 180 days in calendar years one, two, and three. The bill then adds confusing calendar calculation requirements for the Secretarys use of the \\"emergency\\" authority. But wait, there's more! On top of that, both the Secretary and/or the President could suspend the authority essentially whenever they feel like it.You said \\"Further, every single one of those 5000 people would have been detained.\\" The issue there is the bill redefines detention to noncustodial detention which is just another fancy word for RELEASED. Plus, that only applies to individual adults. Families and children would be released without supervision, which will just lead to the cartels putting people together to pose as families to avoid the supervised release. Good luck deporting them either way. Also, the part that was not a lie, was the immediate work permits. This bill codifies Sen. Mayorkas asylum processing rule, which gives aliens work authorization immediately upon release. Just give a fake asylum claim to get in, remain and work in the US. THE FACT IS, IF YOUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO SECURE THE BORDER, THEN THIS IS A BAD BILL.","title":"CMV: Trump doesn't actually care about the border"},{"text":"This sub is indistinguishable from r/politics when major media events occur at this point; utterly *zero* critical review given to this case in here.

Im not going to make an effort post in here to lay out all the evidence regarding why its extremely likely MW was the murderer (AKA why all his appeals were rejected *despite* the inflammatory claims about evidence mishandling in this article), why the IP is morally bankrupt for putting messaging out in the manner that they did regarding MW (claiming outright innocence), etc.Ill just direct folks inclined to *actually* see why multiple courts of appeal refused to overturn the conviction to the [Justia article](https://law.justia.com/cases/missouri/supreme-court/2003/sc-83934-1.html) of the original appeal, alongside the [judgement](https://www.courts.mo.gov/fv/c/JUDGMENT.PDF?courtCode=21&amp;di=27347010) on the motion to vacate 9/12 due to DNA mishandling and note the following:- The mishandling of DNA evidence made in the initial appeal occurred prior to the trial, and solely involved the knife used in the killing. The investigator and prosecutor both handled the knife numerous times without gloves. - DNA evidence pertaining to the knife was never used in MW conviction; the state alleges it was not standard operating procedure for the municipal PD nor county prosecutors office to handle items that may contain trace DNA evidence with gloves due to the newness of trace DNA testing at that timeno DNA was identifiable after the initial tests, so the PD and CP handled it thereafter without gloves. - The judgement from 9/12 declined to vacate the sentence, as no other identifiable DNA besides the investigator and prosecutors was found (note: the expert *did not* rule out that MW DNA could be on it; only that, due to contamination and age, only the investigator and prosecutors was identifiable).- MW was found in possession of the victims work items in the trunk of his car during the investigation. Additionally, he was identified by a pawn shop owner as having sold the victims laptop.- Two witnesses reported that MW gave them details of the crime (how the victim was stabbed, etc.), which were consistent with the victims wounds, despite none of said details having been publicly released at that point in the investigation. One of said witnesses (his girlfriend) reported him coming home in bloody clothes, which he ditched, and is the one that notified police about MW still being in possession of the victims work paraphernalia, which is what led them to the trunk of the car.- MW had a history of burglary before the incident, and he refused to testify and offer an alternative explanation for who couldve killed the victim, and how he came to acquire the victims items.","title":"Supreme Court allows Missouri to execute Marcellus Williams"},{"text":"Im surprised more people didnt talk about the Republicans in Arizona voting for Biden in the 2020 election- its really part of what turned the state blue- that Arizona McCain Republicans hate Trump.","title":"'We are not alone': List grows to 120 Arizona Republicans supporting Kamala Harris"},{"text":"the last left-wing independent for senate I supported flamed out terribly so Im scared to send money his way but maybe its time to do that","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 24, 2024 - 42 days until election day!"},{"text":"Yeah but the problem with that thinking is that there are a lot of undecided voters that think hes stronger on the economy and migration, 2 of the 3 issues that ultimately could decide this election and theyre not the ones watching Fox.","title":"Top Democrats rage at Mike Johnson's big \\"if\\" on certifying 2024 election"},{"text":"These have been my feelings as well.","title":"Ruben Gallego leading Kari Lake in Arizona's US Senate race, polls show"},{"text":"I also think 33 is a NIMBY Trojan Horse, sadly.

I feel like his running would destabilize us if he was to run and win, solely based on his age being a divisive factor among American voters.Other than that major downside of him running, he has more combined foreign policy experience than probably any presidential candidate in US history. The guy is so deeply knowledgeable because of him literally living, learning, and breathing all of modern US history as a Senator during the Cold War, through the Post-Cold War era and War on Terror. Name it, he has somehow been involved either behind the scenes, or directly. He literally dealt with most of the Obama administrations Russia-Ukraine policy decision making. He would relay his thoughts and advice to Obama on what he would recommend for policy, then Obama would consider it. Biden wanted stronger support for Ukraine against the Russian quasi-war in the Donbas, but for some reason Obama didnt want to risk damaging relations and energy supplies worldwide, especially in Europe after the Great Recession. The global economy was still too close.So yeah, I love Harris, but we will never know the future we could have had with a second Biden term, given how much immense collective knowledge of the world and lived US history he has.

And a positive vision for the future is a nice pivot.  Focusing on the present and past economy is also not consistent with the tickets not going back narrative.  So many reasons - it wont play well and even if it did, it would be disjointed from the entire campaign theme.

Too risky to give air time on an issue that might not improve from the vote with the pocket book mentality \\n2.  Not consistent with the overarching theme of the ticket and may mean other planned, salient points dont land as well due to disjointed delivery of the overarching message of a focus on the future \\n3.

Many Republicans and Conservatives absolutely hate Trump. More than even a lot of Democrats do. But they want some semblance of day to day functioning normalcy at the grocery store, gas pump, trying to find housing, safe streets, reduction in non stop identity politics and not allowing 15 million plus illegal immigrants to flood this country like a pure invasion. Trump, right now, is a historically bad candidate. He didn't win 2016 outright as much as Clinton ran a horrible campaign and was, not shockingly, an even more horrible candidate. If Trump wins 2024, it's going to be more because Biden and Harris are absolutely horrible choices for nominees to run against him. Someone like Josh Shapiro or Andy Beshear, one of which would have won the nomination easily with real debates and a real primary, would beat Trump without a second thought. IMHO, the election will come down to many voters hating Trump just a little bit less than hating the small group of esablishment Democrats, and their coporate donor \\"elites\\" pulling the strings,  who kept trying to find a way to crush the average working class American. There's A LOT I don't like about the GOP. But right now, they aren't trying to Defund The Police, then no bail out career criminals, then empty out prisons for \\"equity\\", then try to take everyone's guns at the exact same time. In 2022, Lee Zeldin only lost to Kathy Hochul for New York Governor by 5 points. In New York, considered a legacy \\"Blue stronghold\\", how was that possible? Zeldin ran on law and order. Progressives are NOT a monolith. There are IMHO simply more quiet Progressives or those with Progressive leanings that align more like Ana Kasparian of The Young Turks ( left of center, but not activist left of center) compared to Krystal Ball of Breaking Points ( talks down to everyone, gaslights everyone, refuses to acknowledge any other perspective, only deploys bad faith arguments, can't hide her contempt for actual working class people, etc, etc) The current DNC strategy IMHO is a total failure. It's tripling down on \\"Trump Evil\\" because they have no real policy wins for actual working class Americans. Nearly everything touched in the past four years has been punitive, to a brutal fashion, for working class people. While screaming Trump Evil is fresh meat for the \\"base\\" Blue voter, those aren't the voters that matter. The ones that matter are independents, moderates and uncommitted in the key battleground states. And in those places, the economy and immigration are two issues that will simply anchor around Harris and drag her campaign into the ground. Right now, the majority of the MSM has been caught so many times with lies, hypocrisy and gaslighting, that even when Trump actually does something truly \\"bad\\", a lot of Americans are now desensitized or just won't believe it. That's not some \\"cult\\" at work, that's making someone Public Enemy No#1 for basically a full decade straight and most people are just tired of it. In effect, the DNC and MSM have \\"Flooded The Zone\\" so much, that they've normalized Trump by accident. I believe Trump will win the 2024 general election. Not because he's a good candidate. He's a horrible candidate. But because \\"Team Blue\\" wanted to test how far they could push just outright pummeling the working class and still engage \\"Vote Blue No Matter Who\\" Well, it's pretty obvious at this point that the DNC just went way too far. You cannot keep openly attacking the working class like this and expect to win a general election.

Except it isn't. People didn't vote to defund the police. If they had, the police would have lost their money. They didn't.

And that was a few years ago, it died out pretty quickly.So what that boils down to is some people said things a few years ago that offended you so you decided it's fine if the cops stop protecting all the people that had nothing to do with all that defunding talk.  Some people said things that hurt their feelings so they should let people be robbed and raped with impunity.  Sulking seems like the most accurate word for it.I have nothing but respect and appreciation for officers who deal with the most difficult and dangerous people in society without taking their frustration out on those who are vulnerable and powerless to defend themselves. That is a difficult and highly necessary balance to strike in order for society to function. I'm also not convinced that the cops are actually sulking in the way you describe. The cops I've seen are above that. They aren't going to let a loud minority compromise the safely and well-being of the general population.It sounds like there are people you have personally encountered who pissed you off with unreasonable perspectives and demands.

God loves you so very much. He created and knows each one of us, and loves us more than we can ever love another human being. He knows that we are fallible humans. He knows that despite our very best efforts and intentions, we are not perfect and sinless. Each one of us knows that we arent perfect and that we have sinned. We have all gotten angry, lied, lusted, or worse. Theres the problem. We have broken Gods law and are guilty. Sin separates us from God and He loves us and wants to save us. Because of His unfailing and undying love for us, Jesus Christ came to save us.  He came into this world and lived a sinless life. He died a horrible, torturous death on the cross to pay for our sins because of His incomprehensible love for you. Three days later, He rose up from the dead so that we could be saved. He spent some more time with His disciples and followers and went back to Heaven where He is now, alive and well and seated at the right hand of the Father, readying to return for His people.We have to believe on Jesus, put our faith and trust in Him, repent, and give our lives to Him. There is nothing that anyone can do to save themselves, and Jesus is the only way. Jesus alone could pay the price, and He did willingly because He loves us. We are saved by grace through faith in Christ Jesus.","title":"Message to the Left Behind (The Rapture is Upon Us)"},{"text":"What are the chances AZ elects a Democratic Senator but goes for Trump?","title":"Ruben Gallego leading Kari Lake in Arizona's US Senate race, polls show"},{"text":"That was mainly due to California and Arizona taking forever to count house races.

If 4000 immigrants are encountered, the border patrol would also be empowered to close the border of their own volition, without input from the president. Further, every single one of those 5000 people would have been detained. This bill ended catch and release.. Only people who pass strict interviews, and who could not have stopped in another country, and whose government was the thing oppressing them (not gangs or abuse), and who passed these interviews in 15 days, could have stayed in the country. The number of people who would be able to pass this strict interview process is &lt;&lt;&lt; 5000, and when 5000 people were regularly encountered, the border would have to close -- it was not a sustainable average number of admitted people. It would also likely be closed well before then, when the weekly average reached 4000, and the border patrol was allowed to choose to close the border.Dems are just using it as ammo to cover for the fact that they removed the executive orders that worked from the Trump administrationThis isn't true either.

One thing about \\"Defund the Police\\" - while it didn't take in a lot of places, it did in some.However, ACAB, BLM, Defund the Police and the slew of allegations pinned against all officers, the vast majority of whom had, well, not done anything of the sort and were similarly outraged at the actions of the officers who did stuff like the George Floyd ended up eroding a ton of officer morale. Pair that with DAs who don't charge anybody for minor crimes and you end up doing a job to try to help only for the person you arrested to get away without punishment and the public hating you because of what some jerk on the other side of the country that you'd never even heard of before did. It'd demoralise *anybody*.Long before any of the protests finally died down police were leaving in droves. They retired, they figured if they weren't wanted they'd just leave. This was also during a time where, due to public sentiment, police *hiring* was way down. Turns out nobody is volunteering to sign up to a job where the public believes you're a monster.This resulted in some pretty severe staffing issues for a fairly long time.This got so bad that several towns ended up shuttering the police departments altogether because they weren't willing/able to pay them enough to keep them and the officers just quit to find another job. At least 12 in 2021-2023 alone.In some cases it doesn't matter what sort of pay or benefits you offer, either, since they just don't want to work a job where they're hated for trying to help their communities. Most police departments aren't the LAPD, NYPD, or other major city police departments that have been mismanaged and riddled with corruption. Most are pretty modest with budgets that rarely allow for stuff like tasers, let alone pricier stuff like body cameras, because their city can't/won't afford it.This results in a lot of circumstances where you have one officer to cover a ridiculous number of people - like 20,000-60,000 - which results in them being incapable of addressing the crimes that occur, let alone the 'minor' ones. It also means investigations are gutted. Hard to dedicate time to investigating when you need people to respond to calls, after all.Police in America are just in a pretty awkward position right now. Whether you think they deserve it or not, it's not really a tenable situation. If nobody wants to be a police officer then you're never going to have police officers.   \\nNow, this isn't to say that I think you're wrong - I fully suspect some precincts might be engaging in that sort of stuff, depending on the locale - but I thought I would just offer another possibility that seems equally likely, at least to me, based on the information I have.  The important thing to remember, though, is that police precincts are municipal. Every municipality has its own police, its own history, its own style of law enforcement.

If 4000 immigrants are encountered, the border patrol would also be empowered to close the border of their own volition, without input from the president. Further, every single one of those 5000 people would have been detained. This bill ended catch and release.. Only people who pass strict interviews, and who could not have stopped in another country, and whose government was the thing oppressing them (not gangs or abuse), and who passed these interviews in 15 days, could have stayed in the country. The number of people who would be able to pass this strict interview process is &lt;&lt;&lt; 5000, and when 5000 people were regularly encountered, the border would have to close -- it was not a sustainable average number of admitted people. It would also likely be closed well before then, when the weekly average reached 4000, and the border patrol was allowed to choose to close the border. All migrant families must be released from custodyNot true: \\"(Sec. 401) This section statutorily establishes that there is no presumption that an alien child (other than an unaccompanied child) should not be detained for immigration purposes...If an adult enters the United States unlawfully with their child, DHS must detain the adult and child together if the only criminal charge against the adult is for unlawful entry\\"Only single individuals can be deportedThis is not true, the bill deports even migrant families: \\"Furthermore, before DHS places an unaccompanied alien child with an individual, the Department of Health and Human Services must provide DHS with certain information about the individual, including the individual's social security number and immigration status. DHS must initiate removal proceedings if the individual is unlawfully present.\\"Emergency powers don't effect \\"ports of entry\\"This is partly true. The bill requires the federal government to maintain capacity to process at least 1,400 individuals each day across all southwest land border ports of entry. This means it must maintain capacity to begin interviewing/reviewing asylum claims at these ports of entry, but not admitting everyone who applies -- meaning the number of people admitted is likely &lt;&lt;&lt; 1400 a day. Further, different ports of entry have different amounts of traffic -- it is extremely unlikely 1400 people could apply at every port of entry every day.I didn't keep watching after that, but I encourage you to see how you are being deceived by reading the bill here:https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr2/summary","title":"CMV: Trump doesn't actually care about the border"},{"text":"Because younger people tend not to answer unsolicited phone calls and texts in the same proportion as older people.

WHY is the AG pro-Israel? I don't know, why is Marco Rubio pro-Israel? He is not Jewish. One does not have to be Jewish to be pro-Israel, not everyone who is pro-Israel is so because they are Jewish, and there was no implication in her statement that the reason why the AG supports Israel is because she's Jewish. She could have made this same statement about any AG who shows a bias against pro-Palestinian protestors, Jewish or not.One way to determine whether this was done out of antisemitism would be to see if she only ever calls out people for being anti-Palestinian when they are Jewish. Of course, this is not the case. She has criticized Marco Rubio and Jim Risch for anti-BDS bills. Neither of them are Jewish, but would it surprise you to know that she was called antisemitic for that as well? She has criticized the Israeli government on many occasions for their treatment of Palestinians and was even called antisemitic for that.It is pretty clear that the common denominator of all her criticisms has to do with the government of Israel specifically, not Jewish people. On the other hand, it is also pretty clear that people will accuse her of antisemitism for criticizing politicians who are pro-Israel, even when no Jewish people are involved whatsoever.Given this history, why all of a sudden should we believe that she was only motivated to call out this particular AG because she is Jewish?","title":"Rashida Tlaib Targeted Over Made-Up Quote"},{"text":"If its New York Times, Post, or Fox News I downvote.","title":"Trump Gets a Lift From Arizona Ticket-Splitters Backing a Democrat for Senate"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|xTg8B9aULho7shlPmU)","title":"While Democrats are autographing missiles for war, Donald Trump is buying peoples groceries.

However, I'd still argue it's within his power to do more than he has.

But, again, such an event will likely target state-level certification efforts rather than the federal certification.  For point #2, radicals and extremists willing to die to save America do not worry too much about the potential for jail.

Then neither candidate may get 270 votes. Reminder that the 2000 Gore vs Bush election was decided on only one state of Florida. That's it. Roger Stone was involved in that too (as well as several lawyers who would later be our Trump scotus judges).Check out [this link](https://hartmannreport.com/p/the-new-over-the-top-secret-plan-518) for more.","title":"Top Dem says Speaker Johnson cant be trusted to certify election results"},{"text":"It's a fascist dog whistle","title":"State Republican party chairs endorse Kamala Harris for president: Be a patriot"},{"text":"Ellos se estn comiendo los perros, ellos se estn comiendo los gatos.","title":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Agree to Participate in Dueling TelevisaUnivision Town Halls"},{"text":"Jesus guys, anything huh?","title":"Trumps Act of Kindness at Grocery Store Sends Liberals Into a Frenzy C Banning Grocery Bags"},{"text":"I see what you mean.

Information immigrants provided during interviews was fact checked based on what intel the USG had on the country and on the person applying for asylum. If they did not pass interviews in 15 days, they would be deported.Further, the bill empowered the border patrol to close the border if they ran into 4000 immigrants a day, and mandated they close the border upon encountering 5000 immigrants (in a weekly average, or 8500 encounters in 1 day)  regardless of who the president was.

Also since its a large tent of ideas ranging from mild pullbacks to pull force abolishment/replacement, it failed to make any meaningful change and the beneficial theories died in the noise.\\nJust a quick wikipedia glance;\\nCritics argue that police officers and police departments provide too many services. According to this argument, the United States has an over-reliance on law enforcement, which is expected to handle an unrealistically wide range of social issues, such as homelessness, mental health, and substance abuse.[9][51][2]?For these reasons, some activists have called for an unbundling of services. Under this model, many services that were previously provided by law enforcement would be provided by specialized response teams. These teams could include?social workers,?emergency medical technicians,?conflict resolution?specialists,?restorative justice?teams, and other community-based professionals.[52][53][54][55]Police officers may be particularly badly suited for some community issues, such as mental health crises.[53]?One in four people who are killed by the police have severe mental illness. Some activists argue that, if someone is experiencing a mental health crisis, and if there is no emergent threat to themselves or other people, mental health professionals may be more adept and capable responders. Some activists also believe that if more funds were diverted to help treat and support those with mental health issues, there could be better outcomes.[56][57]A 2020 paper by researchers at the?RAND Corporation?argues that the police are often given too many roles in society and asked to solve issues that they are not properly trained for and that would be better suited for professionals such as?mental health, homelessness,?drug abuse, and school related violence.[58]?A September 2020 paper by Taleed El-Sabawi of?Elon University School of Law?and Jennifer J. Carroll of North Carolina State University outlines the considerations in setting up such programs and includes model legislation.[59]","title":"CMV: Police haven't been defunded by and large they have just stopped enforcing laws and that's why crime has got so our of control in California."},{"text":"Then give them $377 million  in weapons paid for by us!How many hungry and struggling people in this country could have been helped by the money the Democrats and the Biden - Harris administration just gave away!","title":"Democrats Invite Foreign Leader To Meddle In U.S. Elections"},{"text":"new york city!?!?!?","title":"Polls for Texas' US Senate race show virtual tie between Colin Allred and Ted Cruz"},{"text":"Well, to be fair.

Only congress can pass legislation that will fund changes to the border (increase border patrol, build a wall, provide funding for additional detainment centers and asylum courts, provide funding for states with many immigrants, machines to detect fentanyl, etc). [These were all things the border bill did.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/29/fact-sheet-impact-of-bipartisan-border-agreement-funding-on-border-operations/). That is in addition to changing and raising the requirements to get asylum ([limited to people being tortured or oppressed by their government, must stop at first country that would accept you for asylum, stricter interview process, no catch and release).](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2/summary/00)Congress has the [power of the purse](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Power-of-the-Purse/), only it can pass legislation to do this. Trump had to [take money from the national emergency fund and the pentagon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergency_Concerning_the_Southern_Border_of_the_United_States) \\nto get a fraction of what this bill could have funded. Trump has no ability to put more border patrol agents on the border without congress (as they need to be paid), and his national guard deployments cant do anything either, due to the [Posse Comitatus act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act), which prohibits them from carrying out law enforcement activities (like questioning or stopping migrants). They like the House's version of the bill better. And they think it can pass in 2025 when they win.This is a bad bet. [The house is very likely to go blue. ](https://www.racetothewh.com/house) Democrats are unlikely to vote for legislation they think Trump will benefit from, after he shut down this bill. They might vote for something equivalent to this bill, but then it was delayed unnecessarily for a year. Further, if republicans win the house and senate, they could have built upon this bill further, even if it had passed in June.

Let me get this straight. You think the same people that are so good at social engineering that simply saying they exist will get you labelled as crazy by most people are incompetent?No.  The people that did that did it back in the 1960's when it was a whole lot easier.  And those people were competent, but they all retired long ago or are dead.  They are not the people running things now.The same people that have slowly put in the grid for a full blown authoritarian state under everyone's noses while keeping at least 90% of the population unaware?I disagree with your framing here.  All it takes for a democratic state to turn authoritarian is for authoritarians to get elected do things that increase their own power.  It doesn't even take any planning, although I'm not say things aren't planned, but authoritarians will always try to increase their own power.  They don't need to be told to do it.  It is their nature.The same people that have toppled entire countries and disenfranchised entire cultures?Plenty of countries they've failed to topple too.  Syria's one.  And that was because of Trump.  Obama got us involved there to overthrow Assad.  Trump said defeat ISIS and leave.  His SoS and SecDef resigned because of it, we defeated ISIS, but the military refused to leave.  We're still their now, and the civil war that had died down is heating back up, and what a coincidence, ISIS is back.  And Iraq.  Nothing to do with Trump, but we won the war part of that war easily.  Our military did it's job.  And people don't like it when you say we were greeted as liberators, but you can be damn sure no Iraqis were lining up to fight us to put Saddam back in power.  We had that war won.  Then the Bush admin decided to disband the Baath party and the Iraqi army, and all these now jobless men joined militias and started fighting each other, then turned on us.  Was that part of the plan, or was it incompetence?You think those people would be so incompetent as to send an untrained guy with a rifle to kill the president and then when that failed they just sent another one?Who's going to sign up to get their brains splattered across a hot tin roof?

Picking and elevating people like Gaetz, MTG, Lake, OZ, Walker, and now Robinson does not help the Republican Party. In a post Trump world I wonder how many Trump supporters will feel compelled to support Trump like figures, regardless of their qualities as a candidate.

Furthermore, to say that *none* of them believed in the Christian god is untrue. Copernicus was a devout Catholic and a member of Catholic hierarchy. Kepler was Christian, and his religion impacted his science. Faraday was Christian and believed that the laws of nature came from God. I hate to cite Wikipedia, but [this ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology)is a good list of Christian scientists.No school schould be religious, they don't promote learning. We have learned from our past end should do everything to not regress to a time like that.How does religion not promote learning? Saying \\"I believe in a higher power\\" really doesn't impact how good a school is at teaching. I went to a Christian high school (I myself am not Christian), and the school was far more challenging and had more advanced curriculums with the public high school. This is of course in part due to federal funding challenges and problems with standardized curriculums in general, but regardless, a religious school is capable of being a good school. Again, I don't think federal schools should be religious because I believe in separation of Church and State, but I don't see a problem with religion existing in private religious schools.The phone you are using, all the advanced from the last 50-80 years.True. However, I would argue that having a phone is not necessarily a sign of an advanced society, it is merely a sign of advanced technology. Those are two different things. You touch on that when you say \\"social and technological advanced\\", but I don't understand how religion is antithetical to a technologically advanced society.It's such a great system that it even includes all the religious ones and let them (for the most part) say and think what they want.I agree.

The choice is between a party who will continue to put pressure on Israel for a ceasefire, even if it's not 100% of the pressure they could (which I recognize upsets you and many others) and the other choice being a party that will agree to wipe out whoever Israel wants no questions asked, all so Trump can make a few bucks on whatever land deal they promise him in Gaza, while he also betrays Ukraine.

Black Lives Matter and other anti-police rhetoric have been hurting morale in law enforcement since the killing of Michael Brown in 2014 (The Ferguson Effect). Police officers are tasked with enforcing the law, and an inherent aspect of that duty is the use of force when suspects do not comply. Throughout the BLM movement, police officers were vilified for justified uses of force. People rioted in outrage, and some progressive district attorneys weaponized the legal system to attack police to capitulate to angry mobs and garner political favor. These political prosecutions and the vilification of police had a profound chilling effect on law enforcement throughout the country because officers can no longer expect to be supported by the very laws they are tasked with enforcing or rely on the training they have received on how to do their jobs properly.Examples:Michael Brown  \\nAlton Sterling  \\nTamir Rice  \\nFreddie Gray  \\nPhilando Castille  \\nSandra Bland  \\nRayshard Brooks  \\nBreonna Taylor  The result of that is a police force that is understaffed due to officers quitting, retiring, and unable to replenish those numbers. Making arrests is a discretionary function of a police officer's job. If presented with the choice of taking action and possibly being fired, vilified in the media, and going to prison, or just showing up and taking a report later, many officers are choosing the latter instead of risking their freedom and financial welfare. To address that, trust will have to be rebuilt between police and political leadership so officers know they will be supported, not prosecuted and vilified, when they do their job in accordance with the law. I imagine most people would not be happy to stay in or join a profession where you can do everything according to the way your employer trained you, according to the law, and still be fired and face prison time because of political expediancy.As far as police in California not arresting for petty offenses, it is true that DAs offices refuse to prosecute for certain offenses. For a while, my city's police department, at the order of the DA and the chief, would not respond to calls or make any arrests regarding shoplifting (any amount) or criminal trespass.

I've never been registered Republican either. Democrat when I was 18, No Party Preference not long after that. But for the same reasons I don't have the right to vote I've devoted an obscene amount of time into studying law and published appellate opinions, and I think I can shed some light, because I've read a number of federal appeals on this issue through time, and some quite recent where a Biden administration Secretary was a party.The biggest reason is because the Biden administration cannot be trusted to actually do anything to secure the border with the appropriations that bill would have provided, and the United States is broke, the most indebted entity that has ever managed to exist, and it doesn't make sense to waste that money so a President can pretend he's doing something he's demonstrated over and over he will not do.Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty pro-immigrant, because I'm pretty pro-Constitution, and every Constitutional claim regarding the immigration debate I've heard from Republicans in recent years has been laughable bullshit. The author of the Constitution did write other things, I have read many of them, and in his opinion it was unconstitutional to deport anyone except citizens of a nation the United States was formally at war with, and he was very outspoken about the fact that one did not need to be a citizen to be within the Constitution's protection. Also all 4 of my wife's grandparents speak very little English and I speak better Spanish than my wife does and at least one of my grandparents-in-law came to the US illegally and only got her papers because it wasn't possible to deport to Cuba. There's also the fact we kinda forced the Geneva Conventions on the entire world and our immigration problems have us violating them six ways to Sunday. I was also a drug counselor for a long time, right up until the fentanyl epidemic and death got too depressing to stay in that profession. So I certainly understand the current circumstances at the border call for increased security. I also go to the Dentist in Mexico and to do so I have to stay in a real shitty part of Arizona and cross the border to get to a way nicer town in Mexico, so I have seen first hand it's not quite the third world hellhole it's made out to be, and the only country I've visited that I'd ever consider leaving the US to live in is even further south.Anyways, if you look at Biden's disputes with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and former AZ governor Doug Ducey, and consider that he auctioned off materials that could have added to the wall at a massive loss at the outset of his administration, to random local contractors for pennies in the dollar, there's no reason to trust he'd spend the money in prudent fashion. There are a number of Democrat Supermajority areas that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, and if they were given full ballots instead of local only, there's a good chance no one would figure it out. In California there's a Chinese national with a government job that's involved in running and securing the election. Even if they don't vote, which I don't think will happen in any big numbers enough to influence this election, still, having more undocumented immigrants will effect the next census and the next redistricting because the Constitution doesn't call for counting citizens only, and by actively shielding undocumented people from federal immigration enforcement in Democrat stronghold cities and States, those cities and States will pull seats in Congress away from Republican States and districts, which probably has something to do with why they're passing abortion restrictions that go a lot further than any law in history in the US, it's their only option to try and keep their population up in the face of immigration to blue areas. It empowers the Republican party beyond the not small portion of Republicans that think abortion is always murder.In Texas, Greg Abbott is using the State Guard to enforce criminal laws, ones that aren't even very serious. It's not even a crime to cross illegally the first time, it's usually a civil violation, by the law as it's written. The penalties for first time no criminal record no deportations is a small fine and short enough period of incarceration it's either civil or petty in nature. What Abbott is doing is dangerously close to martial law, so it makes sense that Biden might oppose it, but he's being a pussy about it. He could easily either federalize or unilaterally draft the entire State Guard at the border and stop them if that's what he wanted to do, there's several SCOTUS cases that confirm his authority to do that, tell them all you're in the army now and ship them off to Jordan or Israel, but he didn't. He litigated Texas and Louisiana's lawsuit trying to force him to devote more resources to the border all the way to SCOTUS and won, they told Abbott he didn't even have standing to sue and they and every other court lacked jurisdiction to consider the case at all. Then the booby traps and barbed wire came out. Biden might win because Greg is putting death traps into the navigable waters of the US, and he needs Army Corps of Engineers permission to do that legally, and to the extent they are also the navigable waters of the State of Texas, the public has a right to navigate and traverse the navigable waters of the State of Texas by the State Constitution. Biden can't get relief in the nature of State Mandamus or prohibition in a federal court, so to force Abbott to stop leaving traps and barbed wire, he'd be in Texas State courts, which are notoriously biased against Democrats at the moment. No chance the Texas Supreme Court is going to allow him to force the governor to stop leaving the shit in the river and along the border with a writ of mandamus or prohibition. So all he can do is defend Abbott's suit to try and stop him from removing the traps and the wire. So CBP is out there, cleaning up barbed wire, as the Texas guard is out there, replacing and adding to it, instead of using CBP staff to actually do customs work, patrolling the border. Biden is also extremely dishonest about seeking appropriations and reporting what federal agencies are spending money on. Once the money is appropriated, it's his to spend, but he has no money that isn't appropriated to spend pursuing whatever they want. $42 billion went to rural broadband expansion, some say the reports almost 3 years later that not one single home has actually got faster internet out of that money are dishonest, but Arizona spent $22 million to run fiber in front of my house and I'm still on T-Mobile wireless two years after a construction trade group gave the State an award for finishing the project. There's no ISP providing service on the thing, it's just wire in the ground for all the good it does, so I doubt it's the one outlier project that got fucked up, I'd tend to trust those reports.","title":"CMV: Trump doesn't actually care about the border"},{"text":"My guess is biased questioning.

One of three Congressional terms in the last 50 years a party gained a supermajority.  All of them Democratic. In the dozen Congresses this century Dems have controlled the upper chamber 7 times versus 5 for the GOP.  The whole narrative has been a very recent invention in political discourse, and it comes almost entirely from the portion of the Party that grasps to views like: electoral maps are static, the Electoral College advantage/disadvantage is permanent, and looks to discard voters rather than try and win them over.  Yes, Republicans have some small States that currently give outsized representation in the Senate.  Dems do too! VT, DE, RI, ME, and NH are all among the 10 smallest States and lean left in Presidential elections.  Hawaii is next on the list.  The \\"structural disadvantage\\" isn't real.  It's a convenient boogeyman for people that don't want to cooperate with others and grow political coalitions.  There's a straightforward path to a significant *advantage* for Dems in the Senate.  It simply requires embracing coalition politics and abandoning rigid demand for ideological conformity.  If we insist on representing a smaller and smaller portion of the electorate we shouldn't be blaming anyone but ourselves if it becomes harder to hold power.","title":"Kamala Harris tells WPR she supports eliminating the filibuster to restore abortion rights"},{"text":"Save me, save me.

Habermas even goes so far as to imagine the possibility of a convergence of the great universalist religions around a core of moral intuitions consisting of equal respect for the integrity of each person to be protected and for the fragile intersubjectivity of all forms of life. This suggests the possible existence of a minimal common consensus on the normative content of the metaphysical interpretations and prophetic doctrines affirmed throughout universal history, on which the community of religions could base the norms of peaceful coexistence among nations, especially - I would add - in the age of globalisation, where interdependence is constantly increasing. If we want to take unity in diversity seriously, we must be courageous!It is also true that secularisation has often been seen as the other side of the coin of modernisation. Three assertions support this hypothesis: First, the progress of science and technology should have promoted an anthropocentric and disenchanted view of the world, making it explicable in terms of simple cause-and-effect relationships; second, the functional differentiation of social subsystems should have caused the various churches to lose the control they had previously exercised over law, social welfare, politics, education, culture and science, making religious belief a private matter; finally, the transition from agrarian to industrial societies should have allowed greater prosperity and social security, which in turn reduced the need to control contingencies through communication with cosmic powers. However, this thesis has recently been questioned, as it seems to be at best a narrative of the Western elite between 1870 and 1910, and I personally wonder if it does not risk becoming a new form of Western imperialism.As for my argument, I recall what Rawls had to say about the relationship between religion and politics. In Rawls's conception, every citizen has the possibility at any time of bringing his ultimate convictions into the public sphere, provided that, in the event of their formalisation, they are accompanied by reasons that non-believers would be able to share: in such a view, public reason is equidistant from any form of reasoning that starts from controversial inclusive positions and is characterised by reasonableness, i.e. the ability to recognise the pluralism and partiality of one's own position and the readiness to enter into a relationship of fair cooperation with others. Habermas - who, like Rawls before him, divides the public sphere into two spheres: one in which normativity must be rigorously free of any connection with religion, and another, equally public, in which citizens of faith see their full right to articulate their ideas on the basis of their religious beliefs recognised - is more concerned than Rawls about the asymmetrical mental and psychological burden borne by believers: If the only currency that can be spent in the forum of public reason is that of secular reason, then believers bear an additional burden of translation, which would negate the principle of equality. Habermas therefore proposes that this task be shared between believers and non-believers, so that the former are not deprived of the possibility of influencing politics. I am much closer to Habermas' position.As for religion being anti-revolutionary, I strongly disagree: the first modern Europeans to cut off the head of a king they believed to be divinely entitled to rule and to proclaim a republic were not atheists but puritans. Oliver Cromwell was a fervent Christian who, while prostrating himself in the dust before his God, put his foot on the king's neck. And if Cromwell cut through the charade of divine right from a literal point of view, John Milton did so from a philosophical point of view, writing treatises (read at home and in the rest of Europe) in which he challenged Charles Stuart's divine right using arguments based on the Bible. Two centuries later, John Brown believed that he was God's chosen instrument to end slavery in America, and that he could give his life for the freedom of others (he personally had little to gain from the abolition of slavery). As for peaceful revolutions, both Gandhi and Martin Luther King were religious, weren't they?","title":"CMV: Religions should be allowed into public discourse (but not into the institutional sphere) because of their inherent revolutionary potential."},{"text":"It is not written with ChatGPT, only translated with Deepl.No, I am a European citizen, but I can understand why you thought I was American. Until now, the United States may have seemed an exception to the rule of secularisation, but this can be explained by the fact that while European secularisation can ideally be traced back to the French Revolution (where religious traditionalism presented itself as counter-revolutionary), in the United States the idea of religious freedom had made its way through the early settlers who had left Europe to have their positive freedom to practise their beliefs unhindered recognised: the religious freedom of the United States had emerged not so much as a freedom from religions, but rather as a freedom of religions. Moreover, some sociologists have attributed the greater religiosity of the United States compared to other Western countries to the weakness of the social protection systems designed to protect the most vulnerable groups of the American population from capitalism.However, looking at the European case, we have to admit that although many of the former functions of the religious sphere have disappeared, it has by no means lost its importance in the political, cultural and lifestyle spheres: in this sense, Europe, which is forced to accept that religious communities of different kinds continue to live in a secularised context, can be defined as a post-secular society. The change of mentality within a post-secular society can be explained by three factors: Firstly, citizens are informed by the media about world conflicts, usually labelled as religious, and can easily become aware of the fact that the idea of a future disappearance of religion is not so well founded; secondly, religion also acquires a new meaning within national public spheres, since religious communities represent real communities of interpretation that are able to influence the formation of public opinion on various issues; finally, migratory flows, especially from countries with a traditionalist culture, are forcing citizens to change their mentality, forcing citizens belonging to the country's religious majority to confront alternative religious practices and, almost as a consequence, leading to a reawakening of indigenous denominations themselves. In the latter case, the problem of epistemic equality (of which we will speak later) is aggravated by the problem of social integration of immigrant cultures.At the European level, moreover, this could be a good way of taking seriously unity in diversity, one of the values on which the European Union is founded and so important that it has been chosen as its motto. As we have already seen, according to Machiavelli, conflict is not in itself a cause of weakness, but it gives dynamism to the political complex, it keeps it alive; this vitality produces progress in so far as it leaves open spaces of freedom, which consists in the prerogative of each party to intervene in political decisions by clashing with the other parties. For this to happen, however, there must be a public political space in which virtue, understood as a passion for what is public, can develop (this is why the model of ancient republican Rome was a winner). In this sense, such a model could help to channel the religiously motivated conflict in the right direction, with surprising results.--","title":"CMV: Religions should be allowed into public discourse (but not into the institutional sphere) because of their inherent revolutionary potential."},{"text":"I'm more concerned by dirty tricks to steal Nebraskas bonus electoral point [Trump's push to snag Nebraska electoral vote halted by state lawmaker (usatoday.com)](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/23/trump-nebraska-electoral-vote-halted/75351814007/) Expect more from MAGA in next 50 days.

Ukraine already has weapons capable of striking at Moscow and has done so several times, including last week. They struck the friggin Kremlin last year. Last week, they also launched a massive strike on Toropets with dozens of a new kind of jet-powered drone (really cruise missiles). Toropets is farther from Ukraine than Moscow is (300 mi vs 270 mi)4. With the Kursk invasion, Ukraine has taught us that when the situation gets desperate enough they will ask for forgiveness rather than permission. This is related to #3. Ukraine didn't have permission to use Storm Shadow on Russian targets (until very recently), so they rolled their own and we now have much less leverage over which targets they hit with cruise missiles. The same will happen with ballistic missiles, and it's not a matter of if, but when.

Three things support this hypothesis: First, the progress of science and technology should have promoted an anthropocentric and disenchanted view of the world, making it explicable only through cause-and-effect relationships; second, the functional differentiation of social subsystems should have led the various churches to lose the control they had previously exercised over law, social welfare, politics, education, culture and science, making religious belief a private matter; finally, the transition from agrarian to industrial societies should have allowed greater prosperity and social security, which in turn reduced the need to control contingencies through communication with cosmic powers. However, this thesis has recently been challenged, as it seems to be at best a narrative of the Western elite between 1870 and 1910, and I personally wonder if it does not risk becoming a new form of Western imperialism.\\nAs for the rest, the problem is that today, in most cases, a political discourse based on, or even referring to, religion is not considered valid in principle for this reason alone: believers based on religious arguments are often forced - if they want to participate in the political life of a secularised country and be seriously listened to - to translate their arguments into secular language, which is not required of non-believers: in this sense, an epistemic imbalance is created in favour of non-believers, which is contrary to the principle of political equality.\\nFinally, should very different historical figures such as John Brown and Gandhi (whom I discuss in the post) have avoided listening to the voice of religion?","title":"CMV: Religions should be allowed into public discourse (but not into the institutional sphere) because of their inherent revolutionary potential."},{"text":"Lmao that cheered me up ty xD","title":"Trump is helping people, that the Biden and Harris regime had thoroughly shat upon to heap housing, healthcare, and what seems to be bottomless foodstamps upon everybody but citizens.

Additionally, if you dont accept that logic just go look up articles about how Sinema and Manchin have betrayed their party and see how many you get for Cruz and Cotton.

They know that there are bad apples, but those bad apples are also often so good at important aspects of law enforcement that their weaknesses are overlooked. In addition, even the bad apple is still another law enforcement officer in a small pool that is often overworked, doing mandatory overtime, and is basically complete unable to fully cover territory.I do not personally agree with overlooking those bad apples, but given that its law enforcements job to perpetually deal with the worst of humanity, it doesnt surprise me that theyre willing to tolerate some of that darkness in their own ranks if it helps get the overall job done.Those bad apples and general public sentiment have led to an overall negative perception of police, and the good ones are the ones that suffer from this the most. The bad ones dont care. The good ones care a lot. But theyre still not willing to betray their kin who help enforce the law imperfectly or sometimes outright badly.So theyre already dejected by that public sentiment. At least, the vast majority are. And then you have what boils down to a tag-and-release system where arrests for crimes that are not immediately violent are essentially pointless for them. Threaten to kill somebody? Youll be out in two hours. From law enforcements perspective, theyre understaffed and need to triage their work, so arrests that dont achieve much to help the community are pointless.Anyways, none of that is to justify or agree and I dont think it will change anybodys mind. Just thought Id offer that context since I deal with this a lot.If youre interested in improving law enforcement, my local counties in California are constantly recruiting. Theyre perpetually short staffed and on mandatory overtime. In my view, they certainly dont get paid enough for what they deal with.

You are asserting that police think the prosecutors won't prosecute. Do you have any evidence for that? Either the police thinking that prosectors won't prosecute or that prosecutors aren't prosecuting?I do believe you're correct about defunding police have largely not been defunded, and in many cases their funding has gone up significantly.But criticism of police has gone WAY up. In the US, relatively wealthy white people, who hold most of the political power didn't criticize police much prior to Rodney King's death in 1991. But that was 33 years ago! That is an entire generation of cops from newest rookie in 1991 retiring now or earlier. During that time, criticism has only gone up as personal cameras/video devices have increased.But laws and precedent protecting cops have strengthened, precedents keep being established in their favor and funding has gone UP in general.But a notable thing that happened in the last 10 (not 5) years was the BLM movement (starting in 2014!) and calls for defunding, individual insurance, diversion programs etc including those calls coming from wealthy white people! I think you could easily say that calls for accountability, went up exponentially. So what is happening? I think that cops are not yet actually facing any additional MATERIAL accountability - minimal sanctions, no defunding, only a few diversion programs in the whole US etc. But they're still facing the news they see, the people they talk to both in and out of uniform. At one time the suburban middle class dinner party interaction was \\"oh you're a policeman, thank you for your service, thank you for keeping us safe.\\" Now.. I imagine some of those interactions are less friend. Maybe there are even fewer dinner party invites all together.And how are they responding? I strongly believe we're seeing a \\\\_tools down\\\\_ strike. That is - they show up, they collect their paychecks, but they don't DO much of anything and don't care to. Is it organized by their union? Perhaps not.

This is not even close to being analogous to the broad immigration reform bill that had bipartisan support before Trump, not a mere Congressman but a presidential candidate, shut it down.Regarding the \\"remain in Mexico\\" policy, I actually agree that Biden shouldn't have ended it.  I understand the arguments for ending it, because Mexico is extremely dangerous for these immigrants and it hurt their ability to retain counsel and advocate for their claims.  I also understand that the Mexican government hated the policy and was pushing hard to have it rescinded.  But still, I would rather have it than not have it as it was at least net-positive band-aid for the problem.  That said, we are again only talking about band-aids and not the full legislative solution that we desperately need, and that Trump is solely responsible for shutting down.

His position has always been hardline and has killed other attempts at \\"bipartisan\\" attempts in the 2016-2020 rounds of immigration talks.  People forget how much Trump was lobbying the hard right in 2018 to pass a bill but they weren't budging. This is the same hardline wing that has argued that Trump could do more with executive actions (you can read it in Project 2025) and has said HR 2, not the senate version, should be the starting point.This is not even the first time the Senate thought it solved problems. Remember when the 2013 comprehensive reform passed the Senate 68 to 32 but died in the House?Why not pass both bills?I would also suggest that you read at least a bill summary because that helps. The \\"a bill passed or not pass\\" at the title level doesn't really mean anything.Why would a bill that passed the House that makes it all but impossible to see asylum and kicks out asylum seekers pass, and a bill that would grandfather asylum seekers and make it easier for their cases to be adjudicated also pass - actually solve anything?The reason the \\"bill died\\" is because these mutually exclusive ideas would have to be reconciled to make one bill.

I think that, in general, Trump is not ideological.  Trump only really cares about Trump.  He's definitely not pro-life.  He's definitely not anti-gun-control.  But he's pro-Trump, and the pro-Trump people want him to pretend to care about those things.There is one (sort of) exception.  Trump is profoundly racist.  This makes sense, given that his father was very, very likely a member of the KKK.  Nothing was every proven, but Trump senior was arrested at a KKK rally, and he was famously racist in his real estate business towards black tenants.  If you look at his early political record, before he became the grifter power broker that he is now, Trump's political activism was most animated in two occasions -- trying to get five black young men executed for a crime that they were innocent of, and getting a black president disqualified on a technicality that was not even true.  There have been many, many reports of Trump using the n-word during the apprentice.  He's like Donald Sterling -- same age, same social class.  He doesn't like uppity minorities.So, no, Donald Trump doesn't care about national security, he doesn't care about crime, and he doesn't care about a strain on resources for middle America.  He doesn't care about people who aren't related to him.  But he does care about the border in this sense -- he is a white nationalist who truly hates immigrants.  As with anything with Trump, self-interest is more important.

There's nothing in Article I, Section 8 which can reasonably be construed as giving Congress the authority to bar states from regulating abortion.*Roe v Wade* was premised on a (sadly) fictional Constitutional right to abortion that supposedly gave the Supreme Court the authority to bar enforcement of state laws against abortion.

Even before Trump stopped it, the republican voices I listen to constantly said that Joe Biden needs to undo his executive actions and reinstate Trump policy.

In other words, he failed to fall in line and lost his job. - 8 Senate Republicans had a better party line score than Kristin Sinema. She also had to leave the party for being too different. She was more loyal to her partys president than over 85% of republicans and she got kicked out. -Lankford has a 86.8% Trump score and a 24.2% Biden score. Joe Manchin has the lowest Biden score at 87.9%. However, the 24.2% Biden score is actually better low. Thats roughly Feinsteins Trump score. If Ted Cruz* and Joe Manchin supported a Green Energy bill, would you argue its Bipartisan and any democrat who votes against it is shooting down their own bill? *Ted Cruz was actually less loyal to Trump than Sinema was to Biden.Look at these numbers yourself and ask again which party demands more falling in line. The idea that republicans are loyal to Trump or their party always bothers because its clearly biased. Republicans are a big tent struggling to hang on evangelicals, small government conservatives, and right wing populists, thats why republican policy seems to be all over the place, and why it took so long to get a speaker. Democrats, on the other hand, are a reasonably well managed machine with consistent views (except on Israel). American politics consists of the Democrats stance and not the Democrats stance.

It's a bill that is asking for a total of $118.3 billion dollars, but how does that funding break down? - $60 billion in military aid for Ukraine- $14.1 billion in aid for Israel- $4.83 billion in aid for the Indo-Pacific region- $10 billion in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, among other places- $2.3 billion in refugee assistance inside the U.S.- $20.2 billion for improvements to U.S. border security- $2.72 billion for domestic uranium enrichmentSo this \\"border bill\\" is only using 18% of the money it's asking for to improve border security? This isn't a border bill. This is a funding international wars bill with a little border security sprinkled in on top. On top of that, it allows up to 5,000 illegals into the country PER DAY who would be given immediate work permits. Also, the bill would grant the far left DC district court exclusive authority over future immigration disputes. There's so much more, and worse, but what I've stated above should be enough to help you understand why this was shot down.  \\n  \\nThe media gave the a misleading nickname and pinned the full blame on Trump. This bill made no sense and that's why it was shot down. And I'm not even the biggest Trump supporter. I would've voted for RFK Jr. if he would've been given the chance to run.","title":"CMV: Trump doesn't actually care about the border"},{"text":"Link?","title":"The real reason Janet Jackson refused to lie and take back what she said about to Kamala Harris"},{"text":"not just SCOTUS, even House and Senate.

On the philosophical side, I am reminded of what Rawls had to say about the relationship between religion and politics. In Rawls's conception, every citizen has the possibility at any time of bringing his ultimate convictions into the public sphere, provided that, in the event of their formalisation, they are accompanied by reasons that non-believers would be able to share: in such a view, public reason is equidistant from any form of reasoning that starts from controversial inclusive positions and is characterised by reasonableness, i.e. the ability to recognise the pluralism and partiality of one's own position and the readiness to enter into a relationship of fair cooperation with others. Habermas - who, like Rawls before him, divides the public sphere into two spheres: one in which normativity must be rigorously free of any connection with religion, and another, equally public, in which citizens of faith see their full right to articulate their ideas on the basis of their religious beliefs recognised - is more concerned than Rawls about the asymmetrical mental and psychological burden borne by believers: If the only currency that can be spent in the forum of public reason is that of secular reason, then believers bear an additional burden of translation, which would negate the principle of equality. Habermas therefore proposes that this task be shared between believers and non-believers, so that the former are not deprived of the possibility of influencing politics. I am much closer to Habermas' position.","title":"CMV: Religions should be allowed into public discourse (but not into the institutional sphere) because of their inherent revolutionary potential."},{"text":"Lambs for slaughter.
