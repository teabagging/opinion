I NEVER go into it with the goal of immediately changing someones mind. Theres two goals.First is outside observers. I want people to come to my side. If someone isnt super educated on an issue and is just reading, the hope is that my argument is more convincing and encourages that third person to be more open to my positions, and less open to the opposing persons.The second goal is planting seeds of doubt. Nobody is completely hard set in an opinion. People may have opinions that ultimately will never change over the course of their life, but that doesnt mean they CANT be changed. When Im debating someone, I know that theres a .0001% chance that theyll say shit youre right. They may however realize that I was able to tackle their points and that maybe their opinion isnt as correct as they once thought it was. They may be more open to contrary evidence in the future, or even seek out contrary voices. Its kinda psychology thing. When youre arguing, it activates the fight or flight response, which tends to shut people down from rational thinking. If you see a bear running towards you, you arent thinking well maybe its just gonna run past me. Youre thinking holy fuck this is bad and whatever follows that. Your mind isnt thinking about the why because it has no reason to think about the why. Same principle. Arguments, even non political ones, arent immediately productive because peoples brains arent in a place where theyre going to change their mind. They do however plant an idea in someones mind, they they (hopefully) will reflect on later when they decompress. So tldr, no debate isnt productive if youre only considering someone just immediately 180ing their opinion. The thing is that almost never happens anywhere with anything. People tend to gradually change viewpoints, and that often times comes from others gradually chipping away at the foundations of their opinions. It also can push outside observers who arent super educated on a topic towards one or the other direction.","title":"CMV: political conversations on reddit do more harm than good, and what may seem like an opportunity for more viewpoints is strongly overridden by elements that further compartmentalize our views."},{"text":"David Hogg heard gunshots from his classroom.

Now for gang related violence it's all economic. After WW2 many Americans were left out of the \\"ghetto\\" by the various veterans benefits programs giving college degrees and cute cookie cutter suburban homes. The African American veterans were largely left out creating a disparity where impoverished white  Americans returning from war were lifted up and black Americans were sent right back to where they were. Hell my own grandfather was a Michigan mud farmer whose family was dirt poor and had a snowballs chance in hell at a college education or upwards economic mobility. But thanks to the war he ended up in a large 3 story home with a bachelor's degree when he retired. In my opinion that was one of the greatest disservices to black community since the failure of reconstruction. Now how do we actually fix this? Easy we just have to start WW3 and be less racist when it comes time to hand out the benefits! Jokes aside there not really an easy \\"just tax land\\" style solution for it except for increasing economic opportunities in impoverished neighborhoods while making the risk/reward for illegal forms of revenue less enticing. You could also try reducing occupational licensing. But that's just a couple factors in a huge issue.

They pat themselves on the back after doing the bare minimum and refuse to get their hands dirty so that they can uphold decorum and maintain work relationships with people who continuously conspire against them and the american people. Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming them for the dumpster fire, thats on the GOP. I just wish that after years of being walked all over, my party would realize that decorum means fucking nothing anymore, not when competing with the likes of MTG. They might as well be throwing almond milk at a California wild-fire. Biden has done a decent job as president, and I am probably applying more anger towards him than necessary. I do not, however, think that my anger towards the party as a whole is un-called for, and I know I'm not alone in that feeling. A lot of us feel betrayed.","title":"Biden to deliver a farewell address to the nation on Wednesday"},{"text":"Not *the* vice chair, but rather *a* vice-chair.","title":"Tim Walz backs David Hogg for DNC vice chair"},{"text":"I hope he realizes how hard he fumbled.

I apologize for that mistake. However, her case still underscores the need for **sex-based protections** in sports.

While some cultures have recognized **nonconforming roles** like hijra in South Asia or two-spirit identities, these were often tied to **spiritual roles**, not a belief that **gender identity** could override **biological sex** in civil rights law.The **modern concept** of gender identity as legally distinct from biological sex emerged in the **late 20th century**, driven by **queer theory** and **identity politics**. **Title IX** was created specifically to protect **biological women** from exclusion due to physical differencesnot self-declared identity. Expanding it to **gender identity** undermines the original purpose by replacing **objective legal standards** with **subjective claims**.This debate isn't about denying dignityit's about whether **gender identity**, which is **fluid** and **self-declared**, should legally override **biological sex**, which is **objective** and **immutable**. **Title IX** protects fairness for **biological women** because physical differenceseven when rarecan create unfair advantages.I was born with **autism, ADHD, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia**.

Terms like **breastfeeding** become **chestfeeding**, and **mothers** become **birthing people**, erasing the sex-based language central to **female identity**.

In fact, exit polls show Republicans made gains with groups who were motivated to vote for Dems in 2022 due to the overturning of Roe.Reproductive rights was really the only \\"social\\" issue Harris campaigned heavily on, so it was front and center during the race. Dems didn't let voters forget that Trump was the one who appointed the judges who overturned Roe and that his stance on signing a national abortion ban seemingly changed by the hour. Even though at its core nothing fundamentally changed from 2022, reproductive rights took a backseat to the economy and immigration reform. Even hearing stories about families who lost loved ones because of Roe being repealed or women who nearly died because they were forced to carry non-viable pregnancies to term, voters couldn't be convinced to not reelect the man who made that all possible.","title":"Supreme Court to review Obamacares no-cost coverage of cancer screenings, heart statins and HIV drugs"},{"text":"Real uncle Rico energy right here.

Like him or hate him, Morgan Wallens wave of country has really great lyricism for example.Beyond this, there is tons and tons of great country music always being made. And even what is featured on the radio or as singles are usually beside great B side tracks from the same artists on their albums. Nearly every country artist that gets radio airplay has cuts that would check your boxes as you describe them here.Easy recommendations are Jade Midland and Bailey Zimmerman. And these are all easily without leaving the mainstream. Jade Eagleson is another great one that leans into the tropes more heavily but might help you learn to see a bit of the self aware bits when youre writing around the trope.

Most people, Democrat or Republican, don't develop an understanding beyond the superficial / what they hear on the news / what they read about in the voter's guide. None of us really make an informed vote- there's just no way to acquire any meaningful knowledge to accurately predict whether or not the outcome of your vote will result in what you want. This is not talking about information which is classified - this is talking about publicly available raw information (like a bill, for example) that gets deep fried by layers of different interpreting bodies until it telephones its way into disinformation. Really good example of this is Californians taking 10 years to recognize that Prop 47 was a bad idea, and then amending it with Prop 36. It's a slow-moving, stupid process, specifically because nobody knows what the hell they are voting into place. A vote is really more of a way people hope or demand things go their way more than anything else.The reason why people are happy with such a system is because of the other aspect - people use politics as a way to feel morally powerful at the expense of making others feel evil / stupid / etc. We've basically developed a culture of doing this. So even if we acknowledge that our vote is poorly informed (maybe we pay attention to 1 or 2 issues that we emote about, but have no way to predict how existing stakeholders within government will influence a winning candidate into actual decision-making), most of the satisfaction is just being heard as an individual who belongs to a community of like-minded people.","title":" Conservatives are idiots &amp; Liberals are losers .

Because I work in a school :)  \\nIn fact even if my job specifically does not lose all funding, as we may exist in a grey area funding wise and im not CERTAIN our funding is linked directly to federal education funding to states, we may lose access to classrooms if local schools are forced to shut down due to lack of funding. And if even one school shuts down, all non-essential programs (ie, not directly tied to the school district even if they're essential to the families they serve) will be kicked to the curb so that any and all spare classrooms can hold students from other districts.The only POSSIBLE silver lining to a doomsday scenario like that for local education would be our program being able to buy an entire school for the express purpose of our special needs program, but while it would be beneficial to have a concentration of specialists all in one school that can operate as a cohesive whole, that DESTROYS the purpose of having a classroom in many different schools, which is to make sure in-district bussing is always availible.

But I think they just believe that the Pros outweigh the Cons.People *defend* themselves with guns, you know. Even the *lowest* estimates of Defensive Gun Uses puts them at *more* than gun deaths. More people save themselves with a gun each year than die from a gun each year.  If guns disappeared, it would reverse those numbers- saving those that would have died to guns, but turning the larger number who would have saved themselves into victims.  And that's not to mention defense from wild animals. How many people do you want mauled by bears or bitten by rabid racoons or harassed by coyotes?Or hunting. Hunting is often used to reduce the number of a species (for example, deer) before they out-strip what the environment can support and massive numbers cruelly starve to death.I mean, sure, if we were to magically make every gun in the USA disappear overnight, tomorrow there would be no gun deaths. But we can't stop millions of *people* pouring over the southern border illegally, so how could we stop guns from entering? And guns aren't that hard to make, given a reasonable workshop. Tomorrow might have no gun deaths, but the day after....SO, reducing the issue to 'well, if we get rid of all guns, no one will get shot' is oversimplifying it to a *ridiculous* degree. I wouldn't bother to engage with a person who seriously brought that up as an argument- to be blunt, they don't show the necessary intelligence to understand nuance.Oh, and I havent even touched on things like 'the definition of \\"mass shooting\\"'.  Both sides like to define it in a way that helps their side.Finally, if you ask me, the problem isn't the guns, it's the fact that some people want to harm others. We need better mental healthcare in this country, in order to find and treat these people before they hurt anyone.  Simply taking away *one* tool they can use to harm doesn't solve the problem.ask the left how they plan on paying for most of what they propose, and they will often respond by telling you you're asking the wrong question, \\"why not ask the rich dude why he's keeping his money\\", etc. But in the end we don't get any answers from them eitherThat WAS the answer- tax the rich.The vast, overwhelming majority of comments I ever read here just do not cite sources.I see plenty that do.  The problem is (as I alluded to above) that each side can do it's own studies that support their cause. By using different definitions of terms, and different methodologies.  So, even if they cite their (own, custom-made) sources, it's useless.","title":"CMV: political conversations on reddit do more harm than good, and what may seem like an opportunity for more viewpoints is strongly overridden by elements that further compartmentalize our views."},{"text":"Americans voted for a dude who tried to steal an election, lol.","title":"U.S. Increases Reward For Venezuela's Maduro to $25 Million As It Condemns 'Repression and Illegitimate Claim to Power'"},{"text":"It really is all so tiresome lmao","title":"Tim Walz supports David Hogg for DNC Vice Chair"},{"text":"You cant buck against the system when you are a major part of the system.

This incentives the state and local governments to get to work ASAP and get the debris out of the way so rebuilding and restoration can begin ASAP.

First, the Obsidian Order and Tal'Shiar came up with the plan to attack the Founders' homeworld on their own - the Founders were just happy to encourage it once they learned of it so they could set a trap and cripple the two spy agencies.Second, the civilian revolution on Cardassia happened before the Klingon invasion, and was in fact central to the Klingon justification for the invasion.  The Klingons claimed civilians couldn't have overthrown the Cardassian Central Command on their own, they must have had Dominion help, so the Klingon invasion was framed as protecting the Alpha Quadrant from the Dominion (this was very quickly shown to just be an excuse, the Klingons really just wanted to invade *someone* and this gave them a seemingly legitimate casus belli - and you're quite right that again the Founders were happy to encourage this thinking as a means of destabilizing the AQ, though again they weren't the sole originators of it).  And while the civilian revolution was undoubtedly aided by the strain the Maquis were causing, the dissident movement at its core had been growing for years due to discontent with military rule before the Maquis came onto the scene - Maquis attacks and the Obsidian Order's destruction served as accelerants for the revolution, but they weren't the ultimate cause of it.Otherwise that's a pretty decent synopsis.","title":"CMV: The Federation-Cardassisn peace treaty of 2367 was a serious diplomatic misstep by the UFP (Star Trek)."},{"text":"NPR is wrong - the Denver Gazette posted the full timeline [https://denvergazette.com/news/crime/venezuelan-gang-tda-timeline/article\\\\_e0866290-7215-11ef-aa34-53af1764f2a2.html](https://denvergazette.com/news/crime/venezuelan-gang-tda-timeline/article_e0866290-7215-11ef-aa34-53af1764f2a2.html) **May 24 **?CBZ Management, through its attorney, sends a letter to Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman attributing poor living conditions at two of the companys apartment complexes to high crime areas and homelessness.

Italy was separated from the steppe by two mountain ranges for example. South East Asia is frankly quite similar in its competitive state development and it's not exactly the most peninsula like regions, it's more separated by mountains, and you have the very distinct Thai-Burmese rivalry of the early modern era defined by the Thai and Burmese empires waging a similar amount of wars against each other as the English and French or Swedes and Danes, whether it was the great early Taungoo empire conquering the largest land based empire of South East Asia for a few years or some petty squabble ove border territory.Furthermore the Phoenecians who set up the most extensive trading network in the mediterranean at the time based out of literally a straight coastline of mountainous terrain while the Greeks took after them also being based out of mountianous coastal areas. The Portuguese conquered a much more comprehensive naval empire despite not being a peninsula, but because it was a mountainous coastal area. Rome emerged in Italy which was mountainous coastline besides the Po valley and the Taranto area. The Koreans had a peninsula, they had mountainous coastline, but their problem was that they had nomads to their north, and China literally next door and it was the mountains that made conquering Korea basically a night impossible task for the Chinese. Vietnam was spared from Chinese domination in part thanks to the mountainous coastal strip in spite of not being a peninsula. Algeria, Tunis and Morocco all were not peninsulas, but still with their mountainous coastal terrain they became a distinct competitor to the far away Muslim and Ottoman powers on several occasions, as well as a menace to the Europeans. Yemen, Oman, the Ethiopian predecessors like Axum on the Red Sea coast, all originated in mountainous coastal terrain and not peninsulas. The chola empire emerged out of a coastal strip of India hemmed in by mountains. In all cases of maritime powers or competitive political regions, there is most often mountains involved. There's also water as Denmark in part was so strong because Copenhagen is on an Island, Crimean Tatars were based out of the Crimean peninsula that's basically almost its own island, Britain is an island, Netherlands was a swampy moat etc.","title":"r/neoliberal reading recommendations?"},{"text":"Idk its lots of wealthy people losing their homes so i could totally see that.","title":"Biden says federal government to cover 100% of costs for initial LA fire recovery"},{"text":"Tax the fucking rich.CA has a disproportionate population of tech moguls, Hollywood stars, and assorted billionaires.

Extremely underread outside academia, starts from the assumption of absolute amorality and develops a very complex contractarian argument in favor of liberal institutions like equality under the law, property rights, competitive markets, etc., showing moral constraints to be actually a more sophisticated form of mean-ends reasoning. Most convincing argument for the existence of objective morality I've read.*The Libertarian Idea*, by Jan Narveson. Sometimes seen as a continuation/complement to the previous one. Takes the contractarian argument further to argue in favor of free-market libertarianism. Far more convincing than Nozick, imo.[*Can the Maximin Principle Serve as a Basis for Morality? A Critique of John Rawls Theory*](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Harsanyi1975.pdf), by John C. Harsanyi. A short review of *A Theory of Justice* which succintly critiques Rawls's use of the maximin principle in his theory. The author argues that instead, regular utility maximization should be used, which would lead to utilitarianism.*Karl Marx and the Close of his System*, by Eugen von B?hm-Bawerk. The best argument against the Labor Theory of Value and the Marxist theory of exploitation derived from it.**Sociology/anthropology/social psychologyAdapt: Why Success Always Starts with Failure*, by Tim Harford. You haven't quite grasped everything Hayek wanted to say until you read this book.*The Evolution of Cooperation*, by Robert Axelrod. Heavily related to the first two books. Game-theoretical analysis of how morality, specifically what is now called The Golden Rule, is an optimal strategy.*The Dictator's Handbook*, by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith. Politics without the romance.*Ultrasociety: How 10,000 Years of War Made Humans the Greatest Cooperators on Earth*, by Peter Turchin.*Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are*, by Robert Plomin.*The Genome Factor*, by Dalton Conley and Jason Fletcher.*Choice or Chance: Understanding Your Locus of Control and Why It Matters*, by Stephen Nowicki.**HistoryThe Aristocracy of Talent*, by Adrian Woolridge. A history of the idea of meritocracy, how the idea has manifested in several cultures, and how it has shaped the modern world. The book has interesting theories on the political polarization of the Trump era.**FunA Mencken Chrestomathy*, by H.L. Mencken.*The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake*, by William Blake.*The Complete Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley*, by Percy Bysshe Shelley.*Martn Fierro*, by Jos Hernndez.\\n*Snow Crash*, *The Diamond Age*, and *Cryptonomicon*, by Neal Stephenson.","title":"r/neoliberal reading recommendations?"},{"text":"Oh my gosh its Joever.

However I think it's safe to assume Canada's economic situation is going to be worse in 5 years time, and people's appetite for a boring banker then might be very different. I expect there's going to be a decent amount of conversation in the leadership race about what might happen to the prospective leader if they lose the forthcoming election.

Every ship is primarily for exploration and the logistics of space travel. Consider that the Borg threat became known only a few years before the treaty, they likely had the idea of a prolonged war with a local empire like the Cardassians a poor use of those resources.Add to that the constant threat along the Romulan neutral zone, another constant resource drain. Frankly, if the Federation didn't keep a constant show of power on their side of the neutral zone, the Romulans would surely take advantage.I wouldn't argue that it was executed well. They likely could have put a lot more pressure on holding Federation worlds and had the teeth to back their position as it's fairly well established that the Cardassian Empire was pretty over-extended at the time and likely strained for resources.

Foot traffic data proximity locations of individuals to other individuals would all be wonderful pieces of data if you were planning such a horrific idea. More specifically let's say you were planning to attack teas key member of a government agency and wanted to make it look like an accident, maybe having someone hit the car just the right way. But how to know where they drive everyday, well it just so happens that their young child has a location tracking app on their phone, a thing which most apps do. If you had access to the information from that you would know where he drops his kid off for school the exact route he takes and the travel time.Let's say that a person who is working on creating classified technology type stuff for the United States government. Spy drones, surveillance Tech or something like that. That person has a personal assistant who gets cc'd on a lot of their emails. That assistant has an app like tiktok on their phone and granted it permission to all of their files. Conceivably the phone might see documents that are in their texts or emails or perhaps simply a calendar with the names of people that are being met. These are completely normal things for personal assistant to have linked to their phone. But the app can also see that and be requisitioned by a foreign government. They now have the names of very important people, potential discussions of highly sensitive materials related to National Defense, not necessarily classified documents but any info is more than intelligence agencies want them to have.The point is the average person probably doesn't have anything the Chinese government or any other foreign government wants access to. It's the people who aren't the average person that is the concern. The concern comes from the senior level Civic engineer who just got forwarded the new plans for the city electrical grid for Manhattan in an email. The city council member who just received the updated plans for fire fighting measures in a wildfire prone City like Los Angeles. The low ranking government official who was tasked with coordinating all of the mail in ballots and polling locations in an election We just had an election where both of the candidates were running campaign materials on tiktok. I don't think either of the candidates had tiktok on their phone, but I bet they were in the room with an aide who did a lot of the time. These are all people who probably aren't your typical high-value Target but they each have little bits of information that can be pieced together. And if you have enough little pieces of information like I don't know 200 million americans, there's bound to be some stuff in there that paints a much larger picture. And now suddenly you have a foreign government able to do serious damage if they ever decide to do so.All apps could provide this information, but the ones that are owned by Americans we at least kind of have the ability to say, well at least those are owned by Americans so if we ever discover something Shady we can arrest them. When your shit is owned by a foreign government, the threat of getting arrested by the state department really doesn't have any teeth.","title":"Discussion Thread: Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in Case on TikTok Ban"},{"text":"And.

Most progressives I know literally don't have a single conservative friend anymore. The polarization is insane.Reddit lets you engage with views you'd never encounter in your daily life. Yeah, some conversations suck, but I've had genuinely mind-changing exchanges here. Last month someone completely transformed my view on nuclear energy with detailed policy analysis and current stats. Try having that conversation at a dinner party.The \\"winning arguments\\" problem exists everywhere - I've seen plenty of in-person political discussions devolve into shouting matches. At least on Reddit you can take time to fact-check and think before responding. And many subreddits now have strict source requirements and active moderation.Your point about demographics is outdated. Reddit's user base has dramatically diversified since the \\"tech bro\\" days.

The 2024 election discussions brought in huge waves of new users from all backgrounds.Instead of abandoning political discussions here, why not help improve them?

Nobody wants kids to get shot in school or public shootings, but lots of people think gun control is pointless or stupid.","title":"Tim Walz endorses David Hogg for DNC vice chair, continues endorsement trend"},{"text":"Yeah nah, this ain't it.","title":"The left \\"Evil rich white old men are the problem\\" Also the left: Supports the ultimate boss of evil rich white old men"},{"text":"Is it possible to recommend some books for the reading list?","title":"r/neoliberal reading recommendations?"},{"text":"Wait what, what year do you think this happened?","title":"Secret Phone Surveillance Tech Was Likely Deployed at 2024 DNC"},{"text":"Whats the conspiracy?","title":"Since the war started, the Biden admin and the Congress have sent more than $106 billion in assistance to Ukraine ($70bn in military aid and $33bn in financial assistance). \\nThe photo is Los Angeles, not Kyiv"},{"text":"Hey, Im here for it!","title":"Ireland condemns NATO budget despite relying on its support"},{"text":"Every day I tell myself I am done with Reddit.

Will men eagerly share the movie as being not only a good movie, but as a personal inspiration?  And will it translate to less obvious sexism?  I don't expect one movie to reverse the place we're in, to be clear, but the popularity of a character doesn't necessarily translate to how people will act.Some media figures get seen as 'good examples', while others get seen as 'role models'.  The good examples are very aspirational; people look at them as how the world should be, but don't actually work to make them happen.  The role models are the one people actually try to emulate.

It's been a bit since I've read it, but the book's main thesis is the absence of a successor empire to Rome, partly due to Europe's unique geographic qualities, permitted multiple polities to form and compete with one other, encouraging technological and institutional innovation. This in turn led to Europe's diverging fate from other civilizations.The thesis is supported and elaborated upon in the following book sections:1. The unique conditions which allowed for Rome to conquer Europe, including the timing of its formation and its idiosyncratic militarized culture.\\n2. Why no successor empire formed, part 1: examined are the seven junctures where a given contender polity (e.g., the Byzantine empire in the sixth century) could have succeeded, but failed.\\n3. Why no successor empire formed, part 2: the systemic conditions preventing empire formation in Europe, examined by comparing Europe to other major civilizations (namely China).\\n4. The absence of a hegemonic European empire permitted numerous factors, including institutional developments, mercantilist colonialism, and constant miliary conflict, to occur and contribute to Europe's divergence from other civilizations.Each of these sections heavily leverage statistics, counterfactuals, and A-B comparisons that at times obfuscated the overall narrative for me.

Inheriting a highly appreciated property before prop 19 passed in 2021 means that you are paying property tax similar to what it was before it was inherited. If you buy a new property it is reassessed and property taxes recalculated on new value. If you inherit after Feb 2021, you get a $1M exclusion on transfer and pay the old rate + adjustment for the amount over exclusion.For example, lets look at how this impacts inherited home vs purchased home of equal values. Lets say it is a $2M home in CA today.Scenario 1 - it is inherited from parents in 2020, and the parents bought it for 75k back in the 60s. The house is now worth $2M, but property tax cannot increase more than 2% from the previous year so after 60 years the property tax is calculated on original price plus an additional 120% of purchase price or 165k. At 1.5% thats a property tax of $2.5k/yr. The person inhering the property can keep that rate.Scenario 2 - you just bought the house from Scenario 1 for $2M. Taxes are assessed at $2M. You pay 30k/yr for tax on the same home from scenario 1.Scenario 3 - Same house from Scenario 1, but inherited from parents after Feb 2021. You get an exclusion of $1M + current assessment value (165k on scenario 1). This is a $1.165M exclusion meaning there is an 835k excess in value that is added to the 165k current assessment value. Property tax is now based on a value of $1M so you pay about 15k/yr on the reassessed value.Keep in mind these samples are simplified and there are other nuances I am not including, like compounding rates on reassessment, regulations to qualify for Scenaro 3 exlusion, and the numbers are just arbitray. The idea is the same. Inherited properties can have huge tax advantages.","title":"Biden says federal government to cover 100% of costs for initial LA fire recovery"},{"text":"Do you have a link to the bbc recording and a guess as to a time stamp?

Title IX was established in **1972** to ensure fairness and safety based on **biological differences**, not political agendas or subjective identities.# 1. Title IX and Sex-Based Protections Are Long-StandingTitle IX was created to address systemic discrimination against women based on **biological realities**. It aimed to ensure fairness in education, sports, and privacy. Labeling concerns over its proper application as \\"panic\\" ignores the law's foundational intent.# 2. Rare Cases Don't Justify Rewriting StandardsIntersex conditions and the small population size of transgender individuals don't justify dismantling protections for the vast majority. **Laws must be based on consistent, objective principles.**The confusion between Caster Semenya and the boxer mentioned earlier doesnt alter the fact that **competitive fairness** is determined by measurable physical differences, not identity.# 3. False Accusations Are Not a Result of Clear ProtectionsThe idea that enforcing sex-based categories will lead to \\"false accusations\\" confuses the issue. Protections based on **biological sex** have existed for decades without widespread misuse. **Due process** should handle rare exceptions, not the removal of objective standards.# 4. Sex-Based Protections Are About Fairness, Not ControlTitle IX exists to ensure **equal opportunity** for biological women, particularly in competitive spaces where physical differences matter. Protection for one group should not come at the **expense of fairness and safety** for another.# 5. Legal Standards Must Be ObjectiveCourts prioritize **consistent, enforceable frameworks** over emotional arguments because laws must apply equally and predictably. Title IX protections are rooted in **biological sex** for fairness and safety reasons, not subjective identity claims.# Conclusion:Your argument relies more on **emotional rhetoric** than the **rule of law, legal principles, and established theory**which ultimately carry more weight in rulings like this. **Emotional reasoning** has its place in **tort law**, where personal harm and emotional impact are central, but **civil rights law** is grounded in **objective, immutable characteristics** like biological sex for clarity, fairness, and consistent enforcement.Rare cases can be addressed individually without dismantling foundational protections designed to ensure fairness for biological women. **Objective, measurable categoriesnot subjective identitiesare essential for maintaining clarity and fairness in the law.**","title":"Judge strikes down Biden's Title IX expansion to LGBTQ+ students"},{"text":"The thing is that I love all people no matter who they are, where theyre from, or what they believe.

The members who joined knew this, they also knew that EU law is above national law for certain things.But I agree with you, the Green policies are absolutely absurd. However, its not primarily the EU at fault, it are Green and Left Movements in many European countries that demanded this. And since their voice got louder and they got more votes everywhere, the EU also starting to push into that direction. Remember, the EU parliament has a representative system and most member states aswell. Since more green and left parties were in the different governments, its only logical that this happened.And yes it sucks. It absolutely sucks and luckily it starting to backfire. Especially for germany, they are in a recession because of it.\\nHere in Luxembourg we used to pay less than 1 per Liter for gaz. Lowest in all of western europe. Now its at 1,6!And for France.. Yeah well, thats not entirely true. The EU actually classified nuclear energy as *green* energy. But France neglected their infrastructure for far too long. They built their second biggest nuclear power plant next to our border, and its poorly maintained. And thats why france has this problems. Its a result of national politics.And for germany I agree, eventough they dont get the gaz from Russia anymore. I support the idea on getting energy independence from all other non eu countries, because thats the endgoal. I hate being dependent on other countries. But what they did is a shitshow.

You can also look at historical rain data and notice that areas like California are starting to see much longer droughts and rainy seasons which will tend to aggravate forest fires and floods.As to what we can do? In the short term, not much really, things will just get progressively worse for these area until insurance companies nope out like we're seeing in some parts of Florida and people stop building/buying real estates in these areas because the financial risk is much too high.Long term, taking care of our planet and reducing the impact we have on climate for one would be a good place to start, but our corporate overlords have long ago decided it was a threat to their profit margins. We will also probably see a progressive migration away from these areas, as the planet changes, area where humans can live comfortably will change and people will follow.At the end of the day we can't really fight nature, not for our lack of trying.","title":"Biden says federal government to cover 100% of costs for initial LA fire recovery"},{"text":"I'd swap selfish gene with Evolution in four dimensions by Eva Jablonka, it's a better book.","title":"r/neoliberal reading recommendations?"},{"text":"We ll , th ey ar e ex pe ri en ci ng a bi t mo re de ve st at io n , th an ks to Cz ar Pe do .","title":"BIDEN just approved 8 BILLION dollars aid to Californians devastated by wildfires!!!"},{"text":"Maybe the Jewish Space Laser? misfired when a DEI hire spilled their rose vanilla latte","title":"Cruel and Craven"},{"text":"Please do put this lunatic into a position of power in your party.

First, the Federation-Cardassian peace treaty involved an exchange of planets in the disputed territories - some Fed became Cardassian, some Cardassian became Fed, and both sets of planets became part of the newly established Demilitarized Zone that would serve as a buffer between the powers.  It was not the Federation giving up multiple planets for nothing, it was an exchange.  Bajor was not a part of this treaty, Cardassia chose to withdraw from it on its own due to Resistance successes and diminishing resources to exploit making continuing the Occupation no longer politically favorable within the Cardassian government.Second, calling the Federation colonies in question uncontested is untrue - the Federation explicitly warned the colonists who wanted to settle those worlds that the worlds were in dispute.  The colonists chose to settle them despite that warning.  They *knew* they were settling in contested locations, and did it anyways.  Third, the Cardassians did NOT declare that theyd kill or enslave Federation citizens left on those planets.  Quite the opposite, in Journeys End Picard negotiates an agreement with Cardassia in which those Fed citizens are allowed to remain, but theyd have to give up their Federation citizenship and become Cardassian citizens.  While Cardassia had an unofficial policy of allowing and aiding Cardassians on those colonies to harass and attack the ex-Feds, this was not a declared policy, and material support from the Cardassian govt. of those abuses stopped after the events of The Maquis exposed them.Now, did the Federation intervene in the Maquis matter on Cardassias behalf?  Yes.  This was the Federation doing something it excels at even as it pretends it doesnt do it: playing realpolitik.  Cardassia was blaming the Federation for Maquis activities (and members of Starfleet *were* arming the Maquis with advanced weaponry), so the Federation agreed to intervene in the interest of maintaining a peace treaty that it valued so that it could continue to improve relations with Cardassia.  And it was working.  Within a year and a half of the Maquis forming, Cardassia underwent a civilian revolution that toppled the military government.  After the Klingon invasion Cardassia was on a very clear path toward becoming more politically aligned with the Federation, as well as economically and even defensively dependent on it.  Without the wildcard of Dukat secretly negotiating with the Dominion, the Cardassian Union was on a path toward becoming a Federation ally - if not an eventual member state. The Federation plays the long game, and its treaty with Cardassia did exactly what the Federation wanted it to do: stop serious power-power combat and bring the two powers closer together.  Sure, they failed to foresee how the colonists would react to their change in circumstance, but in the grand scheme the Maquis were always small potatoes.  Cardassia was the prize, and the Federation had plenty of reason to expect to win it eventually.","title":"CMV: The Federation-Cardassisn peace treaty of 2367 was a serious diplomatic misstep by the UFP (Star Trek)."},{"text":"Yes but thats $500 million in weapons and gear not disaster relief stuff","title":"Biden just authorized $500 million in aid to Californians who lost everything in the fires.

The dominant entity in this region, the \\"Dominion\\", is a Hegemony led by a species of shapeshifters. About 180 episodes worth of hijinks ensue, but here are the key points:- Shapeshifters decide they wanna fuck up the various powers there including the UFP - Hatch elaborate plot to get Cardassia to attack Dominion world in a trap that takes out their intelligence agency and big part of their fleet- Infiltrate various governments, including the Klingons where they replace key members of leadership and get them to invade Cardassia.- A combination of the Klingons and Maquis brings Cardassia to its knees, the junta is replaced with a civilian government and then another junta.- Desperate (and having pissed off all their neighbors already) the Cardassians become vassals to the Dominion which gives the Dominion a staging ground on the other side of the wormhole, so they begin their invasion of our corner of the galaxy.- Maquis mostly get their ass kicked by this new \\"ally\\" of the Cardassians and kinda gets forgotten.- Klingons, Federation, some other minor powers, and eventually the Romulans team up, about 3 seasons worth of content is created, and the war concludes with the Dominion realizing that the Cardassians *are* lame as shit, and deciding to just glass all their worlds.- Cardassia pulls an Italy after a few hundred million of their civilians are killed by the Dominion. Eventually, a combination of most of the major powers in the galaxy working together, and the shapeshifters being infected with Totally-Not-Federation-Developed Space AIDS? leads to them winning.- The aftermath hasn't been super well explored in the official canon (although I think some non-canon but licensed works have them eventually join the Federation), but presumably a civilian government is set up.The reason I didn't mention this all is because it kinda centers around a mysterious interstellar portal popping up in the middle of the Federation-Cardassian border which I don't think from a Watsonian perspective, is fair to blame the Federation for not forseeing.","title":"CMV: The Federation-Cardassisn peace treaty of 2367 was a serious diplomatic misstep by the UFP (Star Trek)."},{"text":"The fact is we do not have a complete history of the facts of the treaty. We dont know what the federation gained because the shows were not interested in exploring that. Far more exciting to explore the friction of the Maquis. From my memory it seems fair to assume that negotiations were tense and this treaty was the most amicable and least bloody outcome. Does it mean displacement? Yes. Does that mean there was an alternative that was less violent than displacement? How could we know??The only real pushback we get about the treaty is from the people getting the shortest end of the stick. They are not reliable as they may not care about the facts as theyre emotionally invested. For instance we see people who are willing to risk being ethnically cleansed by Cardassians rather than evacuate. If youre willing to accept that horrible outcome just to stay put, Im not sure the bloodshed youre willing to inflict on the rest of the federation was likely to be worthwhile.?I also wanna push back on this idea that the prime directive should protect them from federation interference. These were federation citizens and I dont recall any of the planets being natively populated. They were all colonies. The federation is a democracy. Just because some citizens didnt win the electoral prize doesnt mean theyre not subject to those laws. Presumably those colonies were under federation rule. Once the federation agreed by treaty to evacuate them, I dont think the citizens can then claim it without being squatters. It belongs to a neutral zone or cardassia now, not the federation and not the people living there. Its basically eminent domain.?Im not speaking to the morality of the situation and Im not lawyer but I think theres a reasonable legal case possible to explain why the maquis had no legal claim and why the federation would have a rightful vested interest in policing their actions.?","title":"CMV: The Federation-Cardassisn peace treaty of 2367 was a serious diplomatic misstep by the UFP (Star Trek)."},{"text":"Same as they did with Puerto Rico.","title":"Biden says federal government to cover 100% of costs for initial LA fire recovery"},{"text":"Trump seems like hed be fun to talk to.","title":"\\"Just another day at the office.\\" Apparently, racism is SO BAD in the US that president Obama has to use a fake persona in order to get along with with people/Trump specifically.
