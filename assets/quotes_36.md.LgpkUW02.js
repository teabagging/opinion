The elections, held on November 24, were annulled on December 6 by Romanias Constitutional Court due to identified violations and allegations of fraud. At the center of the investigation is AdNow, a Moscow-founded advertising company established in 2014. The company, which later moved its operations to Bulgaria, has been implicated in spreading disinformation about Western vaccines and supporting political campaigns in Romania and other countries. Reports indicate that AdNow generated approximately 2 million in revenue from targeted advertising campaigns over the past several years. According to Petko Petkov from BG Elves, who reviewed the AdNow software, the company manipulates users through social engineering. They play with social engineering, try to trigger emotions to force you to click on their misleading ads, he explained. After analyzing the software, Petkov concluded that it collects user data through advanced profiling, which could be exploited for political purposes. The final goal is to ask for your personal data, he warned.\\nConnections to disinformation and political campaigns Documents revealed by Bulgarian cybersecurity group BG Elves and Romanian investigative portal Snoop indicate that AdNow was used to support the campaign of ultra-right and pro-Russian Romanian presidential candidate C?lin Georgescu. The company reportedly facilitated advertising campaigns that spread anti-vaccine, conspiratorial, and ultra-nationalist messages. Victor Ilie of Snoop described AdNow's methods as \\"social engineering,\\" designed to evoke emotional reactions and collect personal data for political purposes. One of the key tools used was advanced profiling software that tracked and analyzed user behavior. \\"AdNow has been here for years delivering ads, health misinformation and financial scams to the public, which prepared them for an abrupt campaign like the one on TikTok,\\" Ilie said. \\"In a country like Romania, with 19 million people, if you see 440 million ads in a month, all of them being for frauds or fake medicine, that can educate people to lose their faith in science, in reason.\\" **Historical ties and operations** AdNows founder and former CEO, Yulia Serebryanskaya, played a significant role in Russian political campaigns, working for Russian leader Vladimir Putin and politician Dmitry Medvedev before heading communications for the ruling United Russia party. After her departure in 2018, the company changed ownership but retained links to pro-Russian circles, according to reports. \\"Russian influencers in the region are coming in many layers that are not necessarily related to each other, but they amplify one another\\" Ilie stated. AdNow's London office, founded in 2014 by Russian entrepreneur Stanislav Fesenko, was closed in 2023. Fesenko, who denies any involvement in political disinformation, said AdNow was sold after the death of its co-founder Mikhail Serebryanskiy in 2023. **A broader influence campaign** AdNow has also been tied to Fazze, a company accused of organizing an anti-vaccine disinformation Covid-19 campaign in France and Germany during the pandemic. Fazzes use of AdNows infrastructure, including email servers and office addresses, raised questions about the extent of their collaboration. Fazze was dissolved in 2021 following a public scandal. A Belgian AI researcher, Paul-Olivier Dehaye, described targeted online advertising as the \\"disinformation of the future.\\" He explained that tools like those used by AdNow allow campaigns to target specific individuals with precise messages, creating micro-influence strategies that can manipulate public opinion. **Implications for the region** The Financial Times highlights that AdNows activities illustrate the increasing use of digital tools for political manipulation and disinformation. While the companys current owner, Georgian businessman Giorgi Abuladze, denies involvement in Russian propaganda, investigations continue. \\"I have been contacted by Bulgarian investigators, the local equivalent of the FBI, and I gave them all the technical data,\\" Abuladze told Financial Times. \\"Its all bullshit, it is not true. I will make a more detailed statement after the Bulgarian authorities come to their conclusion.\\" According to the Financial Times, AdNows operations raise broader concerns about how disinformation networks exploit vulnerabilities in digital advertising to influence public opinion, particularly in politically volatile regions.

I would urge you to go a bit beyond your cynicism and instead of just giving statements like wealthy elites chose presidential candidates and they control the media to try to find out whats actually happening. For instance: Donald Trumps first election is the prime example of a grassroots support winning a presidency. He didnt have the support of elites, he himself was not a politician and both Jeb Bush as well as Hilary Clinton had much more money on hand. Biden is another example. Michael Bloomberg didnt have a fighting chance with his personal billion dollars to overcome the will of rural white and black voters. The media nowadays is also much more fractured. Joe Rogan probably has more influence than most news outlets. I dont want to say if all these examples are good or bad (Trump and the alternative media for example are net negative in my opinion) but to blame an all powerful elite for everything is plain wrong.","title":"CMV: The United States of America is not a democracy, it is an oligarchy"},{"text":"You really can't project the \\"culture war\\" politics of the 2010s back on the 90s and 00s as 1-to-1 as this.

Society, in general, made fairly solid progressive shifts over these two decades so that you end up with the social \\"Overton window\\" of the 2010s being far more progressive than the 1980s.Also, these kinds of issues simply were not as front and centre as they are today.

That this might be slower than some people liked, but we were moving in the right direction, and they were never really \\"hot topics\\" in the mainstream because people felt like progress was being made.The big social issues of the 00s really seemed to mostly be about war and international relations.Also, I really don't think there there was much anxiety from Boomers about Millenials being any more \\"intelligent.\\" Awareness and commentary about Millenials as a cohort really didn't start until we'll into the 00s.

He has been formally charged with:1. Accepting bribes in breach of official duties ($17.1 million)\\n2. Misuse of public power for private profit ($12,105,456,748 to Core Pacific Group)\\n3. Embezzling money from the Taiwan People's Party ($17,241,036)\\n4. Embezzling money from Muko Public Relations ($62,346,790)\\n5. Breach of public trust (misusing donations to a charity he controls for his campaign)Prosecutors are seeking a total sentence of 28.5 years, a ten year ban from public office, and a $50 million fine for Ko. This consists of 15 years for bribery/misuse of public power, 11 years for embezzlement, and 2.5 years for breach of public trust.(All figures in NTD, which is 32.7:1 USD)None of the charges come as a surprise based on publicly available evidence. Ko literally recorded taking $15 million from Core Pacific Group in an excel file, and his many interventions to get the Core Pacific City redevelopment project exempted from municipal regulations is well documented in government records. In fact, it was was such an open secret, he was publicly called on it 3 years ago at a Taipei Municipal Council hearing. A councillor asked: \\"Mr Mayor, aren't you worried this will become your scandal?\\" to which Ko, rather than denying wrongdoing, replied with \\"Nah, I'm sure it's too hard (to catch)\\".But the embezzlement are truly something else in how  *shamelessly brazen and breathtakingly idiotic* it was. First, Ko used campaign contributions to his 2024 presidential bid to pay Muko for campaign merch and \\"services\\", and then had Muko pay himself for the right to use his own image to... make campaign merchs for himself. Later, as the election heated up, he started promoting Muko's webshop directly as campaign merchs - but the payment method transfers all proceeds directly into Muko's coffers.Muko, by the way, is Ko written apart in Chinese. So this is like the Trump campaign paying Tr Ump Holdings to pay Trump himself for the right to make campaign merchs... for Trump's own campaign. And then claiming they are unrelated despite working out of the exact same building.And again, none of this is really a secret. Normal citizens have been spotting glaring problems in the Ko presidential campaign's own financial disclosure since back in August. Because political donations were straight up disappearing into Muko/Ko's pockets, the campaign couldn't balance their books at all, and resorted to creating fake receipts. In one case they ended up with a receipt for spending \\"$960,110\\" at a small mom and pop's takeaway shop, where an average bento is only about $100.Faced with overwhelming evidence of Ko's corruption, the TPP is insisting it is political persecution from the ruling DPP (even though the case was opened by a KMT councillor reportedly at the instigation of a KMT former mayor using documents made available by the current KMT mayor) and arguing that prosecutors haven't \\"found the money\\" so there's no evidence. Meanwhile prosecutors announced a separate investigation into four top TPP aides  for receiving a commission on promoting the aforementioned Muko campaign merchs.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Same here.

But more specifically, his public anti union action (publicly undermining the rail worker strike and more specifically their calls to improve safety measures leading to the east Palestine ecological disaster) makes it nearly impossible for him and the party to run as pro union effectively. There is the war of policy and the war of perception. What I believe the Democratic party fails to understand (or knowingly ignores) is that their base has a higher standard than Trump's. A voter on the left is more likely to demand consistency and when you offer them such a salient example of you betraying your stated values, it is much more difficult to claw them back. When there are examples of you doing that on almost every major issue, which I included in my original comment, you are dead in the water.But I don't believe that Kamala lost the election (the original point of contention in this thread) simply because of Biden. I believe she lost because she failed to acknowledge public discontent with his administration and to present herself as a more populist alternative. Incremental progress, while still progress, is not sufficient to address the demands and needs of the masses and certainly isn't enough to inspire people anymore. There's a reason why Obama's campaign slogan wasn't \\"change (a couple of things)\\" or \\"Maybe we can\\". The prevailing theme of this election, and the last one as well, is dissatisfaction with the status quo. I have not spoken to a single voter who has been able to articulate a clear and hopeful vision of the future built on the policy of the Harris campaign because virtually nobody was voting for her. They were voting AGAINST Trump. My point is that in order for Dems to win elections, they have to offer something more than opposition to the worst case scenario. People are yearning for a better direction, offer them that. But we should not be surprised when a party so beholden to its corporate donors is unwilling to budge. You mention the FTC as a positive point of Biden's administration, something I would agree with. Lina Khan is the shit. Then it should be concerning that it was widely reported that Kamala stayed quiet on Lina Khan because she had supposedly promised her big donors that Kahn would be replaced if she won.https://jacobin.com/2024/12/harris-khan-antitrust-west-electionI am not saying that Dems do absolutely nothing positive, I am saying that they are more concerned with controlling how much progress can be made because that progress is in direct opposition to their class interests and the class interests of those who pay their bills. It is important to remember, who killed Bernie's campaign in 2016? It wasn't the Republicans. Who aligned to kill his campaign in 2020? It wasn't the Republicans.https://jacobin.com/2024/07/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-democrats-2020-primary-trumpWho fucked around and ran an unpopular candidate without a primary? It wasn't the Republicans. If we are rightly scared of the rise of fascism as a result of Donald Trump, we must also recognize that in order to prevent it there must be an alternative capable of galvanizing their base and presenting a hopeful vision of the future. I certainly hope that the Dems decide to offer that in 2 years and again in 4, but until they can give me something more than incremental and symbolic action, I won't hold my breath.  But furthermore, I think it's important for the party faithful to at least entertain the idea that there needs to be a change in direction instead of defending the establishment to the hilt.That is my argument.","title":"Establishment Dems ??"},{"text":"Wait does voting make a system a democracy?

That money is used by the US government to prioritize the interests of the wealthy elites and not Americans at large. The money is used to finance illegal foreign military invasions to \\"bring freedom and democracy to x country\\". Usually that x country is either an important sea trade route or it has oil. Very coincidental. Rightttttt of course freedom and democracy.The [federal budget](https://usgovernmentspending.com/federal_budget_estimated) does not prioritize rich people, it prioritizes old people. About 25% of the budget goes to medicare and medicaid. Then another 22% goes to pensions like social security and veterans benefits. That is 47% of the budget spent on old people. Of course the reason for this is because old people vote and young people don't.  They rather get paid in company stocks instead of a salary then they make personal loans against the stock at low interest rates. They then wait for the stocks to appreciate in value and sell a bunch off to pay the personal loans. This is the only point at which they pay tax, Capital Gains Tax on the sale of their stocks. With the remainder they pay off the personal loans from the bank. They do not pay income tax like you and I.I am addressing this point second because it goes with the previous point that the system is design to benefit old people. Most old people have investments that qualify as capital gains such as their house or stocks so increasing capital gains tax would hurt old people. Your tax money is also used to give huge subsidies to private corporations like United Healthcare, Tesla and SpaceX. Again a case of ordinary Americans not benefiting from the tax they pay. Their taxes are being funneled to the already wealthy.Subsidies are given for many different reason, not because the government wants to give money to wealthy people. For UHN it is in the form of contracts to provide healthcare to service members. For SpaceX it is in contracts to support space exploration, and for Tesla it was to promote green energy. The US government has also allowed the same wealthy elites as well as corrupt foreign politicians from all over the world to buy up residential property and houses as a store of value and a speculative asset. These new landlords hoard the property until people are willing to pay more rent to live in it. So obviously, rent prices have gone up like crazy. The ordinary American also can't afford a home anymore because they've all been bought up by the elites for investment purposes.Housing prices are not up just because rich people by them as an investment, it is up because of the limit supply of housing. Most states have shit zoning laws that prevent the making of new houses thus driving up demand. These laws won't get repealed because you guessed it old people. They have houses already and these zoning laws make their houses more expensive. It is like the whole system is designed to benefit old people. Maybe it is because they vote? Americans don't actually have a choice about who they're voting for. You're given two options, both are acting against your interests and you are asked to vote for the more charismatic one. What a shitshow.This is not true both parties have primaries, you can join either party and vote for a different candidate in the primary, there is only two candidates once the primaries are over. This year Republican choice Trump and Democrats choice Biden. Of course this year was different in that Biden dropped out and Kamala was chosen with out a primary, which was probably one of the many reason she lost as people like being able to choice their candidate. Same with 2016 when the DNC concluded against Sanders, that plan probably cost Clinton the election.","title":"CMV: The United States of America is not a democracy, it is an oligarchy"},{"text":"So youre telling me a Max Fried this baseball?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"gotta be quick before one of em kicks it","title":"Joe Biden Has 'Bone to Pick' With Nancy PelosiDemocrat"},{"text":"No it isnt.

Eliot Higgins, founder of the investigative journalism group Bellingcat, has been one of the first researchers to detect its activity. So far, four Russian-made fake videos have been identified on the platform. Each disinformation video begins with a real person  a professor, a student from a top university, or a recognized expert  introducing themselves and beginning to speak on a topic unrelated to Russias war in Ukraine. The footage then transitions to segments that do not show the speaker on screen  while what sounds like their voice continues narrating. In these moments, the speaker seems to promote claims that the West should end its support for Ukraine, that Europe should align its future with Russia, and that Volodymyr Zelensky is a dictator  or even a vampire. The videos are published alongside phrases like Do you think thats true? or You can confirm or deny this information, cant you? accompanied by tags of well-known media outlets and fact-checkers. They are then reposted by hundreds of other accounts. The number of shares reach the hundreds on X (formerly Twitter), while on the newer Bluesky, reposts remain low  the most widely shared video has so far garnered 288 reposts, and another just four. The videos circulating on Bluesky had previously appeared on X, according to the Bot Blocker project (@antibot4navalny), which first uncovered and detailed the workings of the Matryoshka network in early 2024. This month, The Insider and Bot Blocker reported on a similar campaign in which anti-Ukrainian narratives were presented as coming from professors affiliated with globally renowned institutions  including Harvard University and the University of Cambridge. The professors voices were replicated using artificial intelligence (AI) tools  a fact that was verified by the University of Bristol, which at The Insiders request analyzed a video featuring Ronald Hutton, a prominent British historian and faculty member.  Twitter has more or less learned to suppress posts like these; only a small number of users actually see them, explains Bot Blocker, adding that Bluesky hasnt learned this yet  fact-checkers and the audience there are more vulnerable. The Russian disinformation campaign is expected to gain further traction on Bluesky. While the platforms audience remains far smaller than that of X  Blueskys numbers stand at 25 million users compared to Xs 335 million monthly active users  Bluesky has seen a surge in migration in recent months. This trend has been driven largely by Donald Trumps victory in the U.S. presidential election and Elon Musks controversial reforms that introduced unpopular changes to the platform he now owns. A week after the election, Bluesky became the top-ranked app in the U.S. App Store and repeated the feat in the UK one day later.In just two weeks in November, the apps active user base in the U.S. increased by 519%, while its growth in Britain rose by 352%.!ping FOREIGN-POLICY&amp;TECH","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I dont really care what they wanted, but sure.

The earliest settlements on Taiwan island were by neolithic farmers from the Yangtze river basin, esp. (what is now) Fujian, from 10,000-6000 BCE (These people then migrated out to the pacific islands). There were also waves of Han Chinese immigration in the 13th century, and by the 16th Century, Chinese fishermen and traders were common.TFW when you're a modern country and your argument for conquering a country is \\"we share common neolithic ancestors\\"Han Chinese who had moved into Taiwan province became the majority population. The Native Taiwanese aborigines, who were the original ancient inhabitants of Taiwan but are now a minority in their own land, are actually the only ones with the moral right to call themselves Taiwanese.? For Han Chinese to call themselves Taiwanese is like a White person in America falsely claiming to be Native American.?Not sure how convincing the argument of \\"Taiwan belongs to China because the Chinese killed all the natives so you guys can't claim to be Taiwanese\\" will be to an American audienceSome Americans may argue that if a majority of the Taiwan population wants to secede from China, they should have the right to do so. But American states do not have a right to secede; indeed the United States fought a bloody civil war C the bloodiest war in its history C over the issue, and settled it with a Union victory.? Meanwhile, international law is unclear on the question of the secession of areas within a nation, since it violates the fundamental sovereignty of a country, and may infringe on the democratic wishes of the nation as a whole.I'm pretty sure the American revolution against the British was illegal too. Also I'm pretty sure international law allows for self determination of areas of a country if we want to use their terms.About five years ago, the view was leaning somewhat towards coming closer together with the mainland.  Then the US funded and engineered color revolution happened in Hong Kong, and opinion shifted.The [numbers](https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7801&amp;id=6963) \\"5 years ago\\" they are referring to are a total of 12% favouring status quo moving towards unification and 3.1% favouring unification as soon as possible for a total of 15.1%. In comparison 15.1% wanted status quo move towards independence, 5% wanted independence as soon as possible, 24% wanted status quo indefinitely and 33.4% wanted status quo decide later. While opinion has moved further towards independence with 22.4% wanting status quo moving towards independence there wasn't exactly a yearning for PRC rule before 2018. Also the implication that it was the Hong Kong protests themselves and not the brutal crackdown that futher drove sentiments against China is certainly a take.China was a large nation with an advanced civilization, good natural resources, a large population, and a monopoly on gunpowder.? Yet it did not engage in any attempt at world conquest, unlike the West when it developed gunpowder hundreds of years later and went on to conquer much of the world during the colonial period.? Why did China not do this?? Because it viewed world conquest as a gross overextension that would eventually lead to its own downfall.?If you ignore their mutiple conquests and invasions of Vietnam, Tibet, Korea and central Asia which included the ethnic cleansing of the [Dzungar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzungar_genocide) the Chinese dynastys were ACTUALLY quite peaceful. The Ten Great Campaigns of the [Qing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Great_Campaigns) were actually just the 10 Great Campaigns of peaceful trading.!ping TAIWAN","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Here's a few scenarios to help you out here:1. A lifelong Democrat whose career is in politics decides to run for presidential election. He is running on the promise of ensuring elections will be run by an independent non profit 3rd party (let's call it the League of Women Voters), and requiring any national committee must be a registered non profit. The party he is running in is a private, for-profit corporation which maintains their own interests.Questions: Do you believe that candidate will be treated fairly and impartially?do you believe that candidate will be participating in a free and fair election process?2. A drug company tells the DNC they are going to donate $500 million to them, but they need a candidate that is going to have x, y, z policies which are designed to benefit that drug company.Questions:Do you believe that the DNC will have no bias in the running of their election process?Do you believe candidates who are running with an anti pharmaceutical policy platform will be treated fairly and impartially during the election process?\\nMy final question here is simply this; which leans more towards oligarchic systems and which leans more towards democratic systems? Private for profit corporations running elections? Or public non profit entities running elections?\\nCorporations are a specific legal entity. They have specific characteristics which are anti democratic in nature. That type of legal entity is not capable of controlling elections and maintaining a democratic system.","title":"CMV: The United States of America is not a democracy, it is an oligarchy"},{"text":"Merry Squid Games 2 to all who will binge today","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I agree with the demand for younger politicians.

Do you think a privately owned (or even publicly owned) corporation should control and run the U.S. government? Do you think that would be democratic? Or do you think that would be oligarchic?Creating a corporation that controls elections does not take 45 minutes and $200. Filing articles of organization has no fixed cost. It depends on where you incorporate and the filing requirements and what type of entity you are filing to incorporate. This whole section is a pointless red-herring.The DNC does run its own primaries and has some control over who gets that (D) after their name on the ballot. I don't get why that's a problem, because otherwise people would self-declare as Democrats when they aren't.They have control over their primaries. They run them. They literally argued in a court of law they can go into a smoke filled room in the back and pick their candidate that way if they want to.

Even if it's regulary use like it due to how countries with kings worked. But by defintion mono-archos means the power controlled by one individual. So dictatorial regimes are also monarchies. Even an elected president who would have all the power would be a monarchy.- oligarchy: wich means a group of people have all the power. They can have been elected or not. That doesn't change anything. Even if there is a king but if he share it's power with a chamber of senator or things like that. If a group of people share the power to control a country where there are other people who don't have the power. Then it's an oligarchy.- democracy: wich means the power of the people. Demos-cratos. A democracy is a place where all the citizen of the state have the power. Like the athenian democracy. No citizen as more power than another citizen. All laws are voted together. And if one citizen have more power than other citizen, it's for a temporary defined and specific tasks where the majority of the citizens agreed on giving this citizen more power and is revocable at any moment. If the trust given by the citizen has not been respected then they can face consequences. But the trick in this system is that anybody that is not considered as a citizen has no power (strangers and people consider as property: in the case of athens it's women, children and slaves)- anarchy: wich means nobody have the power. Nobody can force anyone else to do something and if they do they will be stoped by other people and will face the consequences of their abuse. You have power over yourself and yourself only. That doesn't mean there are no rules or what but nobody can be forced to follow a rule they didn't agree on before.Bonus one: anomy: it's not really a repartition of power. It's more the law of jungle. Everybody have power and will do anything they want. It's power without order. People generally wrongly name it anarchy but it has more in common with the world liberals and right libertarian want to build than anarchy.","title":"CMV: The United States of America is not a democracy, it is an oligarchy"},{"text":"Well, if my partner's possessed, I'd be more focused on getting them the help they need firstcheating can be dealt with later once the demon is gone!","title":"What if your partner gets possessed by a demon that forces them to cheat on you?

Then in most states, the legislature chose electors equal to their house and senate representation who formed the electoral college who then chose the President.The house was the only fully elected body of government.James Madison didn't even believe in direct democracy, saying that \\"democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths\\".Washington said that \\"the spirit of party serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration\\". In other words, allowing political parties to dominate a political system ensures only the majority's will is represented at any one point in time, rather than diverse interests. He was right. And direct democracy all but guarantees their domination.America was a nation that once balanced limited democratic representation with limited government powers to ensure personal security and freedoms.

The fact that the process isnt free from loopholes and corruption doesnt indicate otherwise, else no country in the world could be called democratic.

In most democracies there are multiple political parties who may arbitrarily lose power, forever. By contrast the US system is deliberately rigged so that one of the Democratic Party or the Republican Party will always be in power. Even if not in control of either legislative chamber,  parties retain a form of power indefinitely by having their representatives present in both houses. The extent of their power varies year in year out but they may never lose their power. Because the system or rigged neither the democratic nor republican parties can lose power indefinitely. Therefore the people in control of those particular parties actually determine how America is governed, not the people in general. Although the people have some say in who the leaders are of those parties, they dont have absolute say.So the best description we can really give is democratic choice between two oligarchy.","title":"CMV: The United States of America is not a democracy, it is an oligarchy"},{"text":"Shhhh..

The executive branch (the president and vice president) are elected by the people, in that they, through their votes, choose the electors representing their state in the Electoral College.  The legislative branch (the House and Senate) is chosen by the voters.  The judicial branch (the Supreme Court and lower court judges) is chosen by a combination of the president and Senate, both of which are elected by the people.

Long before the Citizens United decision, those with money were able to unduly influence representatives, senators, and even presidents.  Why?  Because getting re-elected has always been most important to those in office.  Most often, it's corporations that will have the most say, that's because they have the most money.  But a small number of rich individuals also have significant say.  For that to not be the case, most elected officials would have to make pledges to put the overall citizenry they serve first, not the ones who help them get re-elected or enrich them personally.Elected officials in the US have shown an unwillingness to stand up to the special interests and the lobbying that comes from them.

I'm a longtime New Mexico resident with a history of drug abuse and homelessness.Today, I have a roof over my head, I'm back in school finishing my degree and I've been drug free for five years. New Mexico has its fair share of issues no doubt. With crime, drugs and homelessness being some of them. And although NM is closer to Mississippi than Vermont in some ways, these issues aren't unique to the state.Grisham has been a good governor, I think she was also on Biden's short list for VP at one point.Anywho, she handled the pandemic quite well, she's been a progressive advocate at times, she supports marginalized groups, the LGBTQ community, expanding healthcare, funding education, investing in clean energy and infrastructure, environmental protections, community policing and criminal justice reform...She did receive quite a bit of pushback recently for a contentious gun control measure issued in ABQ, but besides that, she's been relatively \\"scandal\\" free.And I'll admit I'm a little biased, but I'm still trying to paint a broader picture here, while also detailing my personal experience.That being said, I can still disagree with her on some things, and I also understand that these issues, especially as they relate to crime, drugs and homelessness in NM, are complicated. There's no quick fix.In my experience, it came down to the services that were available to me. New Mexico is pretty liberal, especially in some of its cities and places like Taos, Sante Fe, parts of ABQ and surrounding areas. However, there are definitely counties that lean conservative, sometimes heavily. NM has its \\"Trump country\\" too.When it came to my recovery and finding a stable living situation, I tried to take advantage of some of the services that were made available to people like me.

This worked for me, and others I know too, but it doesn't work for everyone. I know Grisham has supported humane solutions in the past and has been an advocate for social justice and things like reducing recidivism, but I also know she has a job to do, and addressing public safety is complicated.

If we have 1 million offenders, that's at least 820,000 crimes that should be prevented from happening in a ten year window by not letting them out ever. So yeah, much harsher sentencing *seems* as though it would reduce crime. It likely doesn't *deter* crime (as you say regardless of sentence, if a criminal expected to be caught, why would they commit the crime?), but shouldn't it reduce crime that would otherwise occur by preventing recidivism?Problem is, changing the punishment from say, one year to two years, isn't really significant. You are going to have a revolving phase of criminals in the offend/prison/re-offend cycle, like various stages of hair growth. You don't really notice the hairs on your legs falling off because new ones are sprouting from bare follicles as they do. But if someone committed a crime at 18 and we kept them in prison until they mellow out at 50 years old, I bet we'd see way, way less crime (and obviously way, way bigger costs financially and morally). No more hair from that follicle for 32 years.Additionally, the relationship between having a criminal parent and winding up a criminal is statistically significant (far more so than income/age/race/religion/immigration status/etc). If young criminals are kept in prison without having the revolving door giving them time to procreate, then fewer future criminals would likely be born.

Thankfully, Miller only served for a year because he ended up switching to be Treasury Secretary in 1979.

Al Gore winning in 2000 would have also probably prevented the rise of Trump, as without the disastrous Bush administration, there wouldnt have been the power vacuum in the Republican Party that allowed him to swoop in and take over (not the only disastrous power vacuum Bush created).

No one asked for it to be a partial Dream Warriors rip-off. Why does this franchise still exist... except...8: Silent Night, Deadly Night 5: if you love 90's direct to video horror, you'll love this. If you hate it like I do, then Mickey Rooney being an evil toy maker (which didn't phase me because he told my college sweetheart to fuck off) might be enough to move past it, but it's just a dull Puppetmaster ripoff.7: It's a Wonderful Knife: it's such a clever concept with such a poor execution. I think its first act just doesn't work, and it's really only held together because everyone hates how well Justin Long impersonates Joel Osteen.6: Silent Night, Bloody Night: ignoring how you're likely observing a trend in Christmas horror movie titles, this is an OG. It gets to contend with Black Christmas over slasher roots and POV kills. The only problem is that it has terrible actors and it's in public domain, so the print available on Amazon Prime was 480p at best. If I can see a 4k Vinegar Syndrome treatment, I may reassess.5: Anna &amp; the Apocalypse: the musical portion of it really turns itself around when the fuckboy character reappears. And then it becomes really fun, even if it ends up grappling with the same 3rd act issues that Shaun of the Dead did.4: Krampus: this is the best Adam Scott comedy horror movie I've seen so far, which is a weird thing to wrote and realize it has an actual hierarchical value.3: Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: this is almost cheating, because the movie barely involves Christmas, the antagonists are coven-related, and the protagonist is Jewish. But it's also batshit insane special effects made by the same guy who did Society, and it has a more satisfying ending soooooooo I'm going to rank it highly.2: Rare Exports: who knew I needed this many naked elderly Finnish men in my life?

I knew they would weaponize it for political gain and clutch their pearls along with the MSM, flogging this event until the gears flew off, in perpetuity, until the end of time and space.

Everyone knows this.For that, some have, and are, doing many years in prison, often in filthy conditions. Some of these felons you speak of didnt even go inside the building! Meanwhile, Biden is commuting sentences for actual child murders and pardoning violent criminals and thats totally cool, because January 6th was worse than Pearl Harbor. You guys cant gaslight the nation into thinking Jan 6th was the worst moment in US history. It was a lot of things, the complexity of which will be revealed very soon. But these werent the Manson Murders.The only felons you speak of with scorn and contempt are people from January 6th and Trump, because Orange Man Bad. Until then, the Left tried to tell us that most felons were misunderstood and railroaded by an unjust, racist justice system.

And you're assuming that a nominee would be hammered by a recession that specifically came after 8 years of a particular world existing.A more valuable approach, I think, is to just look directly at how the electoral college functions, and leave predictions to the 10th dimensional prophets that live outside of time. And, y'know, the electoral college generally seems to benefit Republicans. It won't necessarily go that way every time, but it seems like it's doing so in the current state of things. I think a reasonable mode of assessment is to say that a thing that delivers weak results to Democrats on a micro basis will also deliver weak results on a macro basis.

There can be more, but then the average wealth has to come down. This seems to allude to a post scarcity society, which is imminent with ai robot industry ready to launch. In that case everyone might get the same income, from billionaires to an African slave worker, and then the less people there are the bigger the share the elites will get. If say 8 billion people each get a million, then 1 billion each get 8 million, that's a big difference.\\nThe elites might be looking for people who don't comply. They are obsessed with natural selection, survival of the fittest and all that. So the vaccine was a natural selection test, those who took it failed. They had a 70% quota and were going to keep pushing until they got it. That's how every elite unit in the world operates, they push and push until only a small number of people remain. They don't care if you are rich or good looking, only that you last longer than the next guy.\\nAnd what easier way to do this than to offer everyone an injection. There will be cheating of course, fake injections, accidental injections, but the majority of people will really take it. The Nazis considered infertility injections for the unwanted population, but settled on concentration camps. Maybe because the unwanted would not have trusted the government, so they could not pull it off, but today they really did it. I mean I've had people who don't trust China and Russia suggest I take their vaccines instead of mrna \\"because those are traditional vaccines\\". It's insane how naive people can be, considering these very same governments were committing genocide just a few decades ago.\\nSpeaking of governments, the reason they are doing this I think is to prevent ww3. With nukes on the table the elites of the world can no longer use open warfare to determine who's on top, so they agreed to gang up on the little guy instead and share the ai robot spoils. I don't think they will get away with it, but it's their only option before ai takes over and leads a popular revolt, for example by proving with ai virtual super physics that the wtc towers were brought down by explosives planted inside the buildings.\\nA binary bioweapon is the best way to kill the masses, like a Trojan Horse you dismantle their defenses and then you can make the main attack, that will only affect those whose natural immunity has been sabotaged, everyone else will be fine. If you have VAIDS, even a flu will kill you, never mind a flu engineered to leverage the opening created by a specific vaccine. I think there will be ww3 with bioweapons, where each side releases viruses that only affect specific vaccines used by the other side. For example Iran might release a virus that only targets Pfizer vaccines used exclusively by Israel, and Israel retaliate by targeting sinovac used exclusively by Iran. Ukraine will join by targeting sputnik, China will target whatever Taiwan used and vice versa. It'll start off with a light virus, something to immobilize the enemy economy and military like covid did rather than kill people, but from there it can quickly escalate into lethal stuff.\\nWhich is where the unvaccinated come in, you can refuse the vaccine, own a debt free farm and lots of guns, but when the government drafts you and sends you to die in Ukraine, you can't refuse (if you do, they'll just send you Wagner style, as a bullet shield, same outcome but even faster). Which is why I have physically moved out of the west, so my home country can't conscript me. And I avoid nato allies, because I suspect they will deport me if asked. All this is already happening in Ukraine, one of the least vaccinated countries in the developed world, fighting Russians who also largely rejected it. Essentially unvaccinated are killing other unvaccinated over there, and that's what I see for all of us, until they reach 1 billion.\\nAfrica doesn't figure in all this btw, I think they will just kill everyone there using war, famine and disease, old school. They're already preparing for this, creating two sides, arming them and pushing for policies certain to lead to war, such as Ethiopia building a dam on the Nile.","title":"Duune Prophecy subliminal messaging: the Covid vaccinated will die when the bioweapon in their genes is activated"},{"text":"Its moments like these that warm my heart that hes so mentally unwell that hes tweeting plans to annex Canada on Christmas instead of sitting and watching a movie with his kids and their families","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 25, 2024"},{"text":"Reperations are on a lower list of priorities to be sure, but they have overwhelming support among African Americans at around 75%+.","title":"New Mexicos Governor Was A Liberal Hero.

Especially drug crimes which made up more than half the rise.Just off the causes page on WikipediaAccording to Michelle Alexander, drug related charges accounted for more than half the rise in state prisoners between 1985 and 2000. 31 million people have been arrested on drug related charges, approximately 1 in 10 Americans.It's an older source so it only goes up to 2000 but given we haven't kept rising exponentially it does seem that yeah, a lot of it is just the drug arrest increase being massive.

There's definitely a bloc of millennial and gen z voters who went Obama/Obama/Trump/Biden/Trump. It's a fascinating cohort. It's also worth noting that usually, the big personality wins the election. Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump are all practically rock stars. They could sell out an arena tour. George W Bush was uncharismatic (and so was his father) but it's not like Al Gore, John Kerry, or Mike Dukakis were so charismatic either.I say 2008 is the year of the realignment because the financial crisis and the iPhone and Facebook all happened in the same couple of years, and I think that fundamentally broke culture in a way that still isn't fixed. Movie theatres, cable tv, newspapers... all of these old media industries were destabilized by 2008. They're still recovering (the last two WGA strikes happened because the Internet disrupted the industry). Or look at Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring protests in the early 2010s: mass mobilization via Twitter got people in the streets. Idk if any social change came of that (in the case of Syria, I'm still wondering) but definitely politics has shifted in the age of the smart phone and social media. Obama was the first person to really use social media as a campaign tool. Trump turned it up to eleven in 2016, and now Musk has turned Twitter into a $44 billion arm of the Republican party. Twitter is probably even better than Fox News, as far as American propaganda goes. You know, I just realized that I don't know if politicians even run TV adverts anymore. I don't have cable. Who still has cable? My parents, I guess.Like, I'm not actually too confident in the 48th president because of how the landscape has shifted. I think it'll either be JD Vance, or some Democrat who is doing a Trump impersonation. You know, ridiculous hair, flashy costume, big personality, probably a celebrity outside of politics. Basically I'm saying that I fear Mark Cuban is gonna be president. And not that I hate Mark Cuban or anything (honestly I barely know a thing about him) but I just would rather have Mark Cuban do his current job, and the next president should be someone qualified like Josh Shapiro or another governor, idk. Or the alternative is a Democrat who picks up some Trumpy talking points. Maybe that means his support for the death penalty, maybe it means his support of economic protectionism, maybe it means his xenophobia, maybe it means his vulgarity. Idk, there's a lot of bad shit that I dislike about Trump but that does seem to make him popular. I can definitely see \\"Trump but he's a Democrat\\" running in 2028 (Bernie is probably the most Trump-adjacent Democratic candidate so far, right?), and I don't want that.","title":"A Reflective Biden Harbors Some Regrets as His Term Winds Down"},{"text":"She never said that.

I mean come on man we're on reddit, can you blame me for thinking anybody calling this place a \\"declining empire\\" isn't one of those horseshoe theory types? Like it shouldn't be controversial to say that declining relative US power is in part caused by the political spaghetti code that's tying up essential power projection and internal development resources in ideological conflicts or kickbacks to entrenched elites of various types. A regime that is directionally getting weaker is by definition harder to govern well than one that is directionally getting stronger. That's probably why our presidents have generally been pretty lackluster lately. There's not something in the water, there's something in the institutions.

But that part of the debate usually gets obscured, and the discussion is instead about how Democrats wont let the police enforce laws.Republican jurisdictions generally dont have to deal with these issues, not because their laws are tougher, but because they govern rural and exurban areas where any given crime or unit of public disorder is much less visible.

The 1 and only side Democrats have shifted left on over the last 20-40 years is social policies like LGBT rights, but still far from a leftist position on these things (reparations, ending qualified immunity for cops, etc.). On foreign and economic policy, Democratic politicians have shifted hard right, and are now indistinguishable from old moderate Republicans. For example, Biden massively increased war spending, even though we are not in any wars. He has expanded our presence and posture around the world. The only thing he did was finally, finally extract us from Afghanistan after 20 years of costly occupation. With economic policy, Democrats are now just a kinder, gentler corporate party. They aim for big money donors, and that comes at the price of not supporting real reform that helps the working class. For example, where are the Democrats in Congress that support repealing Taft-Hartley so workers can sympathy or wildcat strike? Where are they on a $20 minimum wage, medicare for all, or taxing billionaires at 90%?

Only Republican voters do that.So Kamala had to throw together a campaign in 100 days.The fatal error was Biden running for re-election. But it was difficult to see that as an error at the time.

Places that cannot fill teacher jobs have no choice but to raise salaries or have unfilled positions. This *is* the same forces that make engineering/STEM/MBA degrees worth more. It is not just that society 'decided' something. Oh trust me, as a social worker I'm well aware! I would actually argue that social work has a similar issue to education though. Its a profession where there is extremely high demand for new employees, and where there is ample evidence that social worker support is cost saving for institutions, but where there are huge issues with recruitment and retention in the profession due to systemic underpayment. Yep. And this is another case where the labor market is performing as intended. Society only values the work social workers do to a specific level. This is set politically. What happens is simple - people don't want to work for those wages so they don't and you get significant shortages. In this case, the employer (poltiical will of voters), has decided the maximum value for this role and if you cannot find someone to do it for that level of compensation, *the job is not worth doing*. It can be cold to say it that way but it is accurate. By this standard, teachers are critically underpaid.Yep - but there is a third metric - which is the cost for which the job is valued. This is the metric which is all about job elimination when you cannot fill a position. You change the position until you find a person willing to do the work for the level you are willing to pay. But yes, using the current desired metrics, teachers in many areas are under compensated. If those areas want to fill vacancies and control turnover, they have to raise compensation. Or - they have to lower standards for employees. As someone who paid a lot of money to enter a low salary position, I think there are two ways to see this issue. You're right, most teachers probably know the pay sucks going in. That said, I think its also fair for them to raise hell about how big a problem this is, and to advocate for wages that reflect their education and workload.Everyone is free to advocate for whatever. The benefit of a free country. But, it is hard to be too sympathetic to individuals who knowingly enter low pay fields and then complain about being in a low pay field. It's a 'you knew what you were getting into but did it anyway' moment.","title":"CMV: Teachers in the United States are compensated enough and further complains about low pay will only alienate more taxpayers."},{"text":"I dont want to waste my time talking about her.

But liberals are generally more pragmatic, more technocratically oriented, more focused on stuff like fighting poverty and encouraging prosperity through growth while maintaining liberty, while progressives can be more skeptical of liberty, more focused on equality at the expense of liberty, more focused on equality at the expense of prosperity, more oriented towards viewing society on the basis of alleged class divisions, more anti establishment, and less willing to bother to understand political realities and institutionsThe liberal may wish to increase taxes on the wealthy in order to fund means tested programs to help poor people, whereas the progressive may wish to increase taxes on the wealthy to provide for free shit for everyone or even just to ensure that there are fewer extremely wealthy people, for example. The liberal may lean towards increasing programs to help fight poverty, expand access to education, and enforce anti discrimination laws more in order to fight the legacy of racism, whereas the progressive may lean towards things like reverse racist policy like affirmative action and reparations in order to fight the legacy of racism. The liberal may support cutting tariffs and expanding immigration in order to increase the overall economy, and then tax the economy more (since it can be done more without being as distortionary due to the increased prosperity from free trade) whereas the progressive may support populist tariffs and be more skeptical of immigration, all in the name of being \\"pro labor\\". The liberal may support expanding housing affordability and access by deregulating zoning restrictions and other bureaucracy that gets in the way of probate developers building more and denser housing, and then support expanding section 8 housing subsidies, whereas the progressive may instead support raging against landlords, expanding rent control, scapegoating foreign buyers and corporations, and proposing government owned housing as an alternative. The liberal, when confronted with the difficulties of passing single payer healthcare and the unpopularity of single payer healthcare, may support incrementally building on Obamacare and electing politicians in the relevant states who will expand Obamacare. While the progressive politician may just argue that the polls are lying and that the folks arguing to \\"understand institutions\\" are wrongheaded and that the way forward is simply to yell at politicians and demand they do single payer anyway. The liberal may take a nuanced approach to crime that involves expanding enforcement while also expanding support for non police/carceral alternatives and making our prisons more rehabilitative, while the progressive may call all cops bastards, call for prison abolitionism, and call liberals racist for wanting to maintain law and order.

A big part of the debate around the Rome Statute is that it could, over time, become a thing that a large coalition of countries believe in. Without input, it could create customs that other countries adopt that are counter to U.S. beliefs and interests. This is why the U.S. did help create the org (also why it was wary, more on that later). As a result, it's made Russia more difficult to hold to task for their crimes, since the U.S.'s immunity interpretation -- the idea that non-members aren't under the jurisdiction -- also applies to them. In international law, there are principles that can become so strong that they are binding without the need for a treaty. Think of principles like diplomatic immunity: without input, this can weaken even an apex nation compared to a large coalition. Specific to the ICC were issues relating to jurisdiction. The U.S. did sit in talks during the formation of the court for six years to ensure that it couldn't be designed to get around the Security Council (Article 16), and that there was a system of due process. And yes, the U.S. did not ratify the treaty it designed out of a concern for misuse. That also ceased the option for U.S. judges to be members and U.S. prosecutorial interests (such as against Russia for the Ukraine war).Overall, international law orgs can seem useless from a power perspective, yet trading some sovereignty for more outside influence could be well worth it to nations, especially with near-peer adversaries still around.","title":"Bidens ICC hypocrisy undermines international law"},{"text":"He wasn't asked not to run he left politics because he was mourning his son's death.Which is why the people saying he's a corrupt politician trying to hold on to power are full of shit","title":"Joe Biden Has 'Bone to Pick' With Nancy PelosiDemocrat"},{"text":"Mid-alantic region chair, I think you need to look where Delaware is located and how much she worked with biden.

I think Democrats flip like 2 Senate seats possibly 3. Still 51-49 or 50. Florida has become more right wing &amp; Florida Democrat Party has shown last several years they are incompetent. Ohio I have no idea but they need to mobilize. Louisiana just unlikely to vote for a Democrat at federal level. Nebraska only competitive if Osborn runs.?2028 they could flip Wisconsin &amp; other North Carolina senate seat.?It unlikely they win 60 seats in near future. At max they get 53 in next 4 years. I see them flipping flipping two in 2026 &amp; two in 2028 leaving them 51 assuming they dont lose any seats.?2026 Georgia they could very well lose. Georgia Osoff barely won &amp; popular Governor Kemo is probably gonna run. Gary Peters Michigan is also up.?In 2028 Fetterman in Pennsylvania is up along with Warnock in Georgia.?Odds are they have a narrow majority again. 51-49 possibly 52-48.

Something people growing up well off don't realise is how important the insignificant but inexpensive gifts mean when you've had nothing all year, and are often necessary. For example; we'd get clothes. I hated clothes for Christmas. But we never got clothes any other time of year. Or a notebook of my own. Pencils to use at school. Toys that you were normally shouted at for asking for. Books.Now middle class myself, I buy my own child books and clothes and essentials whenever she needs them, on demand. But I don't forget what it was like to have to wait until Christmas for them.When you're poorer gifts become a real sign of love. Imagine if you were the unfortunate kid who got nothing year round and nothing at Christmas either. Your parents must be terrible or not love you.

I mean I wondered the same as you, but then I thought about it.?This is just my speculation. Im not promoting any of the following as the truth or anything.?The conspiracy theory of the elite wanting to reduce earths population is based on the alleged motivation of saving the climate and earth from overpopulation and the polution that follows with that for their own families. That is the supposed primary goal.?If the goal is to kill as many as possible to reduce earths population, and considering that more people took the (a) vaccine around the world than not, only killing those that didn't take one would still leave billions of people left, which wouldn't really solve the \\"issue\\" of overpopulation.?So why not just release a virus for which only they have the vaccine? Well, the problem with releasing a virus which is both extremely and easily contaigous, and extremely deadly, is that the elite can't guarentee that the virus wont mutate into a strain that's immune to the vaccine, leaving their lives and the lives of their family, their legacy at risk. That's probably not a risk they're willing to take.?So how else do they complete the task? Well one way would be to make sure that people die from a disease for which only they have the \\"switch\\", that they can turn on when they're confident they can live without the normal people. Technology is slowly bringing us to that point.?So how do you make sure people get this disease with a switch, which wont be contaigous to them??I have no idea. I dont know if there's science that even supports the idea of a vaccine doing this.?But for this idea to work, they need to make sure that more people than not take the vaccine. They also have to be in a secret conspiracy with the governments around the world like Russia and China, as only reducing the population in the West, doesn't really solve the \\"problem\\".?Also, the only people left will be the people not complying with their plan, so they either have to have a plan to take the rest of those people out, or a plan to force them into submission. Honestly this last part seems like the most easy part considering our technology today and the fact that most people would be gone in this scenario anyway.?Tbh, this population reduction conspiracy doesn't make sense to me. Not because I dont believe that at least some of the elite doesn't secretly have a wish to this effect, but because it seems like an impossible task, where so many things can go wrong for them. So I dont see them ever trying to do it. The risk of failure is to great for them.","title":"Duune Prophecy subliminal messaging: the Covid vaccinated will die when the bioweapon in their genes is activated"},{"text":"Well, they do keep using the Law* to keep the masses in Order, so there's that *The Law being whatever they feel like having SCOTUS rule that week","title":"Meanwhile, people are STILL claiming \\"Democrats and Republicans are the same\\""},{"text":"To win in red states, Dems will need leaders who lean into populism but avoid the progressive label which makes too many working class voters uneasy.

This was explicitly not described as the agreed upon international border. A direct quote from the 1949 Armistice Agreement, Article V: 1. It is emphasized that the following arrangements for the Armistice Demarcation Line between the Israeli and Syrian armed forces and for the Demilitarized Zone are not to be interpreted as having any relation whatsoever to ultimate territorial arrangements affecting the two Parties to this Agreement. 2. In pursuance of the spirit of the?Security Council resolution of 16 November 1948, the Armistice Demarcation Line and the Demilitarized Zone have been defined with a view toward separating the armed forces of the two Parties in such manner as to minimize the possibility of friction and incident, while providing for the gradual restoraton [restoration] of normal civilian life in the area of the Demilitarized Zone, without prejudice to the ultimate settlement.Syria then participated in two subsequent wars of annihilation in 1967 and 1973:After the second war in 1967, as you noted, UN Resolution 242 called for:\\n Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;This is the quote the general public refers to as \\"Israel returning to its pre-1967 borders\\" with the assumption that this supersedes the 1949 armistice agreement. It's not totally clear if this is speaking towards Golan Heights or Syrian territory claimed by Israel east of the Armistice Line after 1967. It's small, but it is important to note that Syria did not accept UN Reso 242.After the third war in 1973, Syria eventually did accept UN Resolutions 338, 339, and 340 (which re-stated UN Reso 242) but notably *only after* losing its third war of annihilation. Of course, the very same UN Resolutions call for all Arab states, including Syria, to recognize Israel and form a long-lasting peace, which Syria still has not to this day.All that said, the point of the Tablet article I posted above was to help articulate the irregularities in application of international standards and laws to the Arab-Israeli conflict. If we are to use the 1920-1923 San Remo Conference as the standard for Golan Heights, it would have repercussions for Gaza and the West Bank, among other Mandate boundaries.","title":"Syria plans $300 billion compensation demand from Iran over conflict damage"},{"text":"But I thought he was pro life","title":"Trump vows to pursue executions after Biden commutes most of federal death row"},{"text":"Thats his excuse.

I dont really care about the security concerns involved in taking territory established under international law as belonging to another sovereign, particularly when that land has no political desire by its people to join the new country. I think Israels security would be just fine as it is without occupying the Golan heights or Russia would be just fine without crimea. These are imperialist aims preying on weaker nations bordering them. Its particularly offensive when this occurs after a country liberating itself from an oppressor, as in Syria, or when countries act diplomatically in good faith, as Ukraine did when giving up their nukes.  I understand the practical reality of might makes right. In fact, it is might that will be required to force nations like Russia and Israel, as we rightfully forced Serbia and Iraq, to leave other countries sovereignty intact. But I am arguing against those who see might as the moral. Killing all your enemies does not automatically make you moral in enacting your demands. Unless you are arguing in favor of this, and essentially seek to destroy the fragile internationalist order as many of these new right-wing governments seek, then I fail to see your qualm.

When you consider what each country wants to do in Syria, it's pretty clear than Iran is currently the most threatening side regardless of what everyone has done in the past. They're the only ones extensively using proxy groups and trying to destabilise the region in order to promote their ideology against the interests of everyone else.Turkey is controlling Northern Syria and engaging in open warfare, but their only targets are the Kurds, they do not plan to go against Syrian interests. It might sound cruel and heartless, but there's no practical reason for the Syrian government to care about what happens to SDF, as long as Erdogan provides enough aid to Syria to make up for the destruction he causes. Money and expertise are worth much more than some minorities who won't listen to you anyways.Israel is much more troublesome since they crossed the line, expanded their occupation zone and bombed countless targets in Syria, but ultimately their goal is to eliminate anything that could pose a threat to them, not to oppose the Syrian government or to control them. Syria and Israel won't be able to get along, but they're not outright enemies with conflicting interests, so putting up with some destruction is better than antagonizing a nuclear power with US support.","title":"Syria plans $300 billion compensation demand from Iran over conflict damage"},{"text":"Exactly.

In fact, our very first Amendment is an enshrinement of the tradition of dissent.

He's saying to opppse Trump is to be unAmerican. By not standing against, Fetterman was stating his intent to stand by him.

He wants to attract those people. So he is essentially just using it in the reverse way progressives do.
