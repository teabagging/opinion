He's not really a flight risk, when he has law enforcement officers near him 24/7.2.) He's not accused of a violent crime for which bail is sometimes not allowed.3.) As far as state charges, he's charged in Atlanta and New York, both of which have bail reform, which reduces the need for cash bail and reduces the likelihood he'd be remanded to jail to await trial. For the federal charges, he doesn't meet the criteria to not be given bail.4.) Trump has weaponized any attempt to investigate him or prosecute him for his actions, and thus the risk/reward of imprisoning him is very different.

It's the same reason why people crow about gas pricing; they were used to the sub $2 pricing under Trump (when demand was lower due to lockdowns) that when it finally normalized, people lost their minds.For Harris, women's issues. People are still seething after Dobbs, and we're seeing the consequences in various states that chose more draconian abortion stances as a result. Conservative lawmakers REALLY underestimated how much support it had; take Ohio, where the Constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights passed by the citizens of the state, only to have the Republican controlled state house go into a panick to try and stop its instillation.","title":"Donald Trump wins, contrary to all the bs this sub tried to pull.

In the case of voting for Trump, if someone that agrees with enough of his political views to vote for him, sees that many people around them are so politically polarized to the point they'll be angry if they know who that person is going to vote for; then that person will simply shy away from admitting their political position.

It's not that it wasn't always a close race but I don't get the wild margins Trump is winning by. Millions of votes in FL and TX and hundreds of thousands in other places, making up huge margin gains in New York. It's like Trump magically gained 10% of the population's vote despite the insurrection, the felonies, and everything else.I had more faith in our country but history is doomed to repeat itself. This is going to be an election with ripple effects for a generation.Edit: There was no magic 10%. Trump performed just as he did in 2020. It was the Democratic vote that didn't show up by the millions. That should be a wake up call that Democrats didn't have the pulse of the nation and Harris didn't have the support we were led to believe. Republicans were there in 2020 and they stayed there in 2024.

The media also allowed Trump to get away with things that wouldve tanked most politicians like the Epstein connection (but I dont think preying on children and teenagers is taken seriously when its a celebrity or politician unless its years in the making and he was found guilty when one of his victims took him to civil court), they went after Joe about his fumbles but said little to nothing about Trumps rather we had to hear republicans do a decode of what Trump means is, and they downplayed the fact that he got republicans to back off the bipartisan plan for the border. So people who use immigration as an excuse for Trump never answer why they think it was okay for republicans to do this. Americans just constantly get amnesia about republicans and then whine when things dont go their way. So if medicare, SS and other things get cut I dont feel sorry for the voters who voted for that and forgot they or their family members needed it. They do not care about other peoples health while expecting politicians to care about their health and family. Why should Trump care? He literally didnt care when he played doctor during covid and a lot of people died. Again the amnesia.

I literally called Trump was gonna win this next election again and I don't even support him. I knew it before Biden even dropped out. I don't support anyone, this isn't to be edgy or cool. Idk what the future holds for this country. Nor do I think people should be overreacting. You're gonna have to wake up and deal with this country the way it is the next day no matter what. Capitalism/corporate greed will still run rampant, that wasn't gonna change if Kamala got in, it's definitely not changing with Donald, idk what politician it changes with because hardly any of them are actually in touch with reality. I think a two party system is so past the point of being able to encompass the country's so many different views and this is the result of that.

By the time the horrible debate happened, it was too late to have a totally open contest. Saying \\"Ok, actually now the candidate can be anyone, figure it out in just one month\\" would've been chaos, not enough time for every state to organize a new primary, and would've sacrificed valuable time for the party and messaging to coalesce around one candidate. Centering the message around Kalama a month earlier was a better strategic choice than having a month of total chaos between Biden dropping out in July and the National Convention in August, *then* trying to figure out the strategy for the new nominee.","title":"US election: Donald Trump expected to win North Carolina"},{"text":"I guess we'll all see very soon.","title":"Early election takeaways: Trump weakens Democrats' coalition"},{"text":"She tried but it didnt work.

Harris, pointing to the warnings of Trump&amp;#039;s former aides, has labeled him a &amp;quot;Fascist&amp;quot; and blamed Trump for putting women&amp;#039;s lives in danger by nominating three of the justices who overturned Roe v.

Right now, Trump has a lead of \\\\~170k votes with 12% of votes left to come in (About 815k votes)4 years ago, Trump had a lead of \\\\~190k votes with 12% of votes left to come in, and he ended up losing PA by 80k votes.If anyone knew how that state was going to go, they'd have called the race by now. It's still a flip.Michigan is still only barely halfway reported, and Wisconsin has the majority of it's votes to come from Milwaukee county which is currently voting 2-1 in favor of Kamala. It's not remotely unfeasible to see Kamala taking these 3 states, at which point the race is over, that's 270.I can also very easily see Trump overperforming in these states and taking back the WH.But hey, if you wanna go throw some money down on the outcomes, go for it, since it's a sure thing, right?","title":"Trump wins North Carolina, narrowing Harris' path to victory"},{"text":"Truth hurts but Shes a female, Dems dont have foundational structure","title":"Trump wins Georgia, flipping back a key battleground state"},{"text":"We live in America: where we vote against our collective self interest and for the worst people in the world to represent and lead us.

A rapid and unanticipated rise in rhetoric and threats stemming from disinformation about the purpose of the event and its proximity to Election Day contributed to the decision to postpone.Out of an abundance of caution and because a number of government agencies are unable to participate, we made this difficult decision so that we can deliver a high-quality and meaningful event, with deep and rich engagement across industry, government and academia, and full participation by all stakeholders. We apologize for the inconvenience and are exploring options to reschedule the event. We will reach out directly to all participants with details, including information about transferring existing exhibits, registrations and sponsorships. Updates also will be shared on the AFCEA-Atlanta chapters event website, on FBCs website, via email and on social media.","title":"Right now Trump is ahead in all the swing states.
