The power to place restriction on entry or deportation of individuals associated with the designated group.

Could those in power just make a claim that someone or multiple someones are \\"associated with\\" this group and simply get rid of them without proof or due process? What power is given to the government and what rights are removed when a person is claimed to be associated with a terrorist group? Who is going to stop them from stating someone is associated with something because they want them out of the way? Where does the power end? So that- as well as the power it gives the government regarding Military and counterterrorism actions:\\nThat label allows the use of military force under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). Is this label going to be used to bypass any laws against invading mexico? Under the guise of \\"terrorism\\". \\nThe label also allows a much broader justification for preemptive strikes or interventions. Again invading Mexico- but under the guise of preemptive intervention. So they can place an official label on this group and suddenly are allowed to invade another country preemptively- claiming something about doing it before anything happens and for the safety of our country. \\nSo where does the power stop?

I can't understand how she can just not think about it and be angry at him when this can ruin our entire life.","title":"The GOP will ban same sex marriage"},{"text":"Well put, couldn't have summed it up better myself.","title":"Merrick Garland Tells Trump to Screw Off on Jack Smith Report"},{"text":"\\"Not my problem.\\" - The American people","title":"Trump Is Facing a Catastrophic Defeat in Ukraine | If Ukraine falls, it will be hard to spin as anything but a debacle for the United States, and for its president."},{"text":"Ew why am I in the same country as Florida","title":"This is a real post by the GOP House Foreign Affairs Committee"},{"text":" All I know is Trump always has a planHOW CAN YOU BE THAT DELUSIONAL?Legitimately when has he had a plan?

Dick Cheney and friends used faked, stovepipe intelligence as a scheme to get the world to go along with their plan.  They knew it was bullshit.   You should have learned that at some point since then.  If there had been no oil there, we would never have gone into Iraq. I think you might be a chicken-hawk with no skin in the game.  If preventing nuclear proliferation was so easy, why did we fail to do it with Israel, and South Africa, and North Korea, and Pakistan, and India, and China, and Russia, and so far, Iran?  They still have their uranium.  Israel has bombed them, but nobody anywhere thinks the threat is gone.  The only time we ever successfully blocked a nuclear program was in Libya when they tried to thaw relations and get out of sanctions, and then the West overthrew the regime within @ 5 years, so that was a siren call to the others to never cooperate with the West and surrender their nuclear program.  So Iran has withstood heavy sanctions, which have been difficult to enforce.  It hasn't stopped them from sending thousands of drones to Russia to use against Ukraine.  It hasn't shut down their programs.  The 'occupation forces' that the combined West could ever put together would be @ 200K troops.  So that's 1 occupier for every 450+ Iranians, with 0% of them being 'pro-American'.  How would we ever locate those scientists and technicians, and that thumb-drive?  It's unlikely to work, and we would take 50K+ casualties for the attempt.  George W. Bush showed that nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan was almost impossible.   You should learn that lesson, or put your kids into the army go get that job done.  Something tells me you haven't done that, so I'm skeptical of how well you have thought this through.","title":"Trump wont rule out using military to get Panama Canal"},{"text":"After the Manhatten project Canada stationed some number of nuclear warheads and assorted nuclear weapons, and at one point over 50 nuclear surface to air missiles.

The Montreal research lab is what led to the development of stable heavy water nuclear reactors, and why Canada has such a dominant position in nuclear technologies and nuclear power generation.This topic isn't well published so it's tricky to get good research.[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canada-and-the-manhattan-project](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canada-and-the-manhattan-project)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\\\\_and\\\\_weapons\\\\_of\\\\_mass\\\\_destruction#Inventory\\\\_of\\\\_Canada's\\\\_nuclear\\\\_armaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Inventory_of_Canada's_nuclear_armaments)","title":"Trump says he sympathizes with Russia's opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine"},{"text":"So you plan to take on the largest military on earth with a civilian militia at best?

It wasnt until August that the truth began to surface.The fallout within the Republican Party was immense. With Trump unable to carry out his duties effectively, a power struggle erupted behind the scenes. Factions within the GOP clashed over who should take the reins, ignoring the Constitution, exposing deep fractures within the party. Vice President J.D. Vance, who had largely operated in Trumps shadow, emerged as the compromise candidate amidst the turmoil. By late 2025, he was sworn in as President of the United States, inheriting a nation rife with division and uncertainty.Still, oral histories suggest that the transition of power marked a turning point, not just for the United States but for the global order. It is said that Vances presidency attempted to balance populist rhetoric with technocratic governancea delicate dance in an era teetering on the edge of economic and environmental collapse.

There Trump would find a lot of commonality with our next leader in their vision around regulation, free trade, promoting economic growth and lowering North Americans economic reliance on China, our lack of military capacity and confronting Russia in the Artic. They've even agreed on the issues around Mexico and seemed open to creating a US-Canada free trade agreement outside of Mexico. If he had approached these issues with some tact and through the standard diplomatic channels, they would have had a very willing partner to address them on both sides of the border. But instead, by attacking Canada's sovereignty with these childish insults, even the perception of agreeing with Trump on anything is so politically toxic in Canada now that our Conservative Party has taken a very strong line publicly against Trump. And once in power, they'll have to walk a very fine line as there was already a lingering perception that they'd roll over to Trump, that now if they are seen to be agreeing with him on anything it will only amplify that narrative. He's taken what would likely have been a very friendly, receptive and cooperative Canadian government and made it into one who's own political interests will be directly tied to how much they are perceived to be opposing Trump.","title":"Trump Presser: Why We Should Not be Subsidizing Canada to the Tune of $200 Billion"},{"text":"Under a 2009 agreement, Greenland can declare independence from Denmark after a territory-wide referendum.Just a matter of time.

While Id welcome more conservative provinces like Saskatchewan and Alberta joining the union, it means wed have to take in Quebec (10M pop) and Ontario (15M pop) as well, and theyre basically a colder, gayer, more French New Jersey and New York thats an insane amount of electoral college votes (12+28=40 EVs between the two) no thanks. If they both had a say in our election, Trump wouldve still won narrowly, as the new margin for victory wouldve been 290 (578/2=289+1). Adding the rest of the provinces would make for an even bigger disaster electorally for republicans. I threw this scenario into ChatGPT (Canada is being admitted to the United States and its provinces will each become a state, and thus awarded electoral college votes. How many electoral college votes would each province receive, and based on current partisan leans within the provinces, how would they likely vote in an election?) and got the following:\\n**Democratic-leaning provinces:**\\n1. British Columbia: 10 electoral votes\\n2. Newfoundland and Labrador: 3 electoral votes\\n3. Nova Scotia: 3 electoral votes\\n4. Ontario: 28 electoral votes\\n5. Prince Edward Island: 3 electoral votes\\n6. Quebec: 12 electoral votes**Total Democratic electoral votes: 59*Republican-leaning provinces:**\\n1. Alberta: 9 electoral votes\\n2. New Brunswick: 2 electoral votes\\n3. Saskatchewan: 3 electoral votes**Total Republican electoral votes: 14*Swing state:**\\n1. Manitoba: 3 electoral votesSo, if we add these to the existing electoral votes in the U.S., the new totals would be:- **Democratic**: 59\\n- **Republican**: 14\\n- **Swing**: 376 new electoral votes thrown into the mix would mean we have a grand total of 614 EVs, or a vote requirement of 308 to win a majority. 226 (Kamalas winnings) + 59 = 285\\n312 (Trumps winnings) + 17 (lets say he took Manitoba given the landslide year) = 329So Trump still wins, but more narrowly. Had he lost, for example, PA and Nevada, he wouldve lost outright given the shift in partisan leans of the EC.","title":"What do you think the chances that Canada would be annexed by the US?"},{"text":"Careful there, buddy, this almost constitutes a vertebra.

The media and the general public have all but sane washed and normalized Trump's irrational behavior and supposed \\"trolling\\" remarks. Even as he grows more and more unhinged, constantly posting meandering, incoherent, emotional tirades to his Truth Social account while making dangerous, and often unconstitutional threats.We've been told time and time again by his defenders that he's just \\"exaggerating,\\" or he's just \\"joking,\\" that the left wing media is blowing things out of proportion and taking Trump too seriously. Which if you think about it, is basically admitting that Donald Trump is not an earnest person, president or candidate...In other words, Trump's absurdity has magically rendered him benign. But he is not benign, he is not joking, as made evident by his actions and his intentions to follow through on his crackbrained proposals.Donald Trump is not harmless, he is an idiot, yes, but a useful one at that. He has surrounded himself with loyalists who not only enable him, but take advantage of him. This coalition of MAGA cohorts and fanatics will not hesitate to exploit Trump's weaknesses, his narcissism, his worsening mental health, and the transactional nature of his relationships to enact their far right agendas through him.Come next term, Republicans will seek to consolidate power and establish a unitary executive. Their goal, for all intents and purposes, will be to make Trump a king-like figurehead. They'll have the best opportunity they've had in decades to assume control and create what can only be conceived of as of one party system or state.It's not a joke at all. If it were, Trump supporters wouldn't be cheering on his threats to annex Canada, colonize Greenland, seize trade routes, rename the Gulf of Mexico, and intervene in the affairs a foreign nations, not to mention his continued threats to \\"go after\\" and jail his political opponents. Think about the general tenor of this last election. The bar for Trump and his MAGA allies remained and still remains shockingly low in comparison to the high standards that Americans expect of Democrats.The media have definitely played a role in legitimizing and downplaying Trump's anti-democratic rhetoric, his incompetence, his corruption, his misconduct and criminality, and his increasingly unhinged behavior. So much so, that many Americans have stopped taking him seriously or have tuned him out. So it's not only Trump's growing inner circle of loyalists that are responsible for enabling him, the fault lies with the general public as well. Trump's authoritarian impulses will go unchecked come next term. While his coalition of MAGA loyalists won't hesitate to take advantage of him in order to push their far right agendas and consolidate power for the foreseeable future.","title":"The Trump Sanewashing Begins Anew | New year, same media strategy: Downplay Trumps most dangerous, extreme ideas as trolling or even branding."},{"text":"Im at the edge of my seat waiting for him to get into office.

American business elites have overthrown entire governments (Hawaii, South America countries) to get what they want, or pressured America directly into engaging in Imperialistic conquests.America was a model nation that Nazi Germany modelled itself off of in the 1930s; and one of the relevant things to note is fascism cornerstones include an protection of and empowerment of capitalistic interest. Its neo-feudalistic in a sense, and you should note that *a lot* of America elite in the 1930s supported the Nazi government right up until it became more publicly unfavorable in 1941 when Germany started targeting American commercial vessels, and even then, we have tons of evidence that business, political elite and military officials continued to support Nazi Germany even as we were fighting them throughout the early 1940s.Ford, yes that one, *famously* was a massive supporter of the Nazi Party and if you ever read into his history you....really understand the overlap ideologically.TLDR: My point here is .... American business elite run this country; and have wanted a fascist government since the early 20th century.","title":"Trump wants Canada to be 51st state.

The Trump Organization accused Fintiklis of violating the terms of his original acquisition deals for the units, saying he agreed not to interfere in the Trump teams management of the hotel.\\\\By the following year, as Fintiklis sought to assume what he argued was majority ownership of the tower, shoving matches broke out between his employees and remaining Trump Organization staff.

Why isn't the media correctly reporting on this?. Canada is a country that spans the entire northern border of the US, they have 13 providences each with their own governments, it would require all 13 of those providences to elect to join the United States, then the federal government of Canada would have to allow them to seceed, effectively shutting down the Canadian government. In which case you would now have 63 states, not 51 (because I highly doubt all 13 provinces will choose to merge). Then how do you determine who are the governors, senators, house representatives, house districts etc for each of the new 13 states?. To do this would be a years long endeavor. And that's IF it's all done in a civil way. A Canadian province seceding could trigger a civil war in Canada. And if Trump tries to take Canada (or Greenland for that matter) by force that would be an act of war, which could easily trigger another global war. This isn't just stupid, it's insane.Edit: to add to this Mexico has 31 states. So in the case that all 13 and 31 provinces and states of Canada and Mexico choose to join the United States. We would now have 74 States, 44 of which are brand new, bringing entirely new people and cultures with them.

The fact is that people like to do drugs, and as long as the demand exists then there will be criminals who take the risks to supply it in order to make money.Having said all that the particularly nasty part of the Mexican cartels is how they destabilize a government that borders the US, which causes chaos in Mexico, and how it causes chaos along the border itself which creates chaos in the US.Both the US and Mexico very much have vested interests in removing the cartels, but huge parts of the Mexican government have been corrupted by the money and are working against the interests of their country.","title":"Trump team resurfaces plans to designate Mexican cartels as terror organizations"},{"text":"Any townhall he did usually ended up in an absolute mess\\nHe struggled to stay focused during any answers, and would end up in entirely different unrelated trains of thought which he tried to say was all part of the plan and would coin it \\"The Weave\\"\\nand when he wasnt doing that he lied so...no not usually","title":"Donald Trumps team was fed questions prior to Fox News town hall in 2024, according to a new book"},{"text":"That was also under Jack Smith.

It lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe and is key for missile defense systems, space surveillance, and monitoring shipping lanes such as the Northwest Passage and the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap. The island has been a site for U.S. military bases since the Cold War, notably Pituffik Space Base, which underscores its military significance.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/why-does-trump-want-greenland-could-he-get-it-2025-01-08/)[](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/01/07/donald-trump-buy-greenland-denmark-minerals-security-space/)[](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/07/nx-s1-5251168/trump-greenland)2. **Natural Resources**: Greenland is believed to have vast untapped natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals like rare earth elements, zinc, copper, and uranium. With global warming leading to the melting of ice caps, these resources become increasingly accessible, making Greenland an attractive proposition for resource acquisition. Trumps interest in Greenland aligns with his broader policy of promoting U.S. energy independence and securing vital resources for industrial and technological advancement.[](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49422832)[](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/why-does-donald-trump-want-to-buy-greenland)[](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/climate/trump-greenland-climate/index.html)3. **Geopolitical Influence**: Buying Greenland could potentially counterbalance the growing influence of countries like Russia and China in the Arctic. Theres a concern about Chinas increasing investments and interest in the Arctic region under initiatives like the Polar Silk Road, which could challenge U.S. strategic interests. Greenlands autonomy from Denmark but geopolitical ties to Europe also make it a point of interest in broader U.S. foreign policy.[](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/21/heres-why-trump-wants-to-buy-greenland.html)[](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/23/trump-buying-greenland-us-ownership-plan)4. **Historical Precedents**: The idea of the U.S. acquiring Greenland is not new; past U.S. presidents, including Harry Truman, have considered purchasing the island. Trumps proposal can be seen within the context of historical U.S. territorial expansion strategies, where acquiring strategic territories was often on the agenda for geopolitical advantages.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_the_United_States_to_purchase_Greenland)5. **Personal and Political Motive**: Trumps interest might also be driven by a desire for a significant real estate deal, aligning with his background as a real estate developer. Moreover, such a deal could be seen as a bold move to cement his legacy in U.S. history, much like previous presidents who expanded U.S. territory. However, this aspect is often critiqued as an oversimplification or personalization of geopolitical strategy.[](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/01/07/donald-trump-buy-greenland-denmark-minerals-security-space/)Overall, Trumps interest in Greenland combines elements of strategic military positioning, resource security, geopolitical strategy, and a personal flair for monumental real estate deals. Despite these reasons, both Greenland and Denmark have firmly stated that Greenland is not for sale, emphasizing Greenlands autonomy and identity.[](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-buy-greenland-denmark-b2675291.html)[](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c791xy4pllqo)","title":"Help me understand the interest Trump has in other countries"},{"text":"I like the way you put this.","title":"Canadians helping while Trump is taunting"},{"text":"Waves ?? at woke person to busy humping the down vote button to check the receipts. ??","title":"The Press and Democrats Mocked Trump Over Wildfires, Now the Receipts Loom Large"},{"text":"is that what they call thinking for yourself instead of following the herd these days?","title":"Donald Trump threatens ally Denmark over Greenland"},{"text":"He should have gone to jail for that.","title":"Justice Department says it plans to release only part of special counsel's Trump report for now"},{"text":"That claim is so easily falsifiable.

Leaving the terrorist-designation decision to Trump is expected to substantially extend the timeline of powerful U.S. sanctions imposed on Syria during the Assad regime.\\n \\n . . . \\n \\n While keeping the terrorism designation in place, the Biden administration on Monday [eased several key restrictions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/06/treasury-bashar-assad-sanctions-syria-biden/421c0036-cc67-11ef-be73-ad8966084721_story.html) on Syria aimed at jump-starting the countrys recovery and building goodwill with its interim government.\\n \\n . . . \\n \\n As a result of the U.S. decision, foreign governments such as Qatar plan to bankroll public-sector wages for a huge number of workers in Syria, a U.S. official told The Washington Post.\\n \\n The Qatari plan, first reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatar-plans-help-boost-syrian-government-salaries-sources-say-2025-01-07/), is key to shoring up Syrias interim government, which pledged a 400 percent pay increase for public-sector workers. Syrias new finance minister estimated that such a promise would cost $120 million a month, covering more than 1.25 million workers on the government payroll.\\n \\n . . . \\n \\n An adviser to Trump, Ric Grenell, described the militant groups that overthrew Assad as a mix of a lot of different types of people.\\n \\n Were going to judge them by their actions, he said in an [interview](https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/ric-grenell-syria-rebels/2024/12/09/id/1191025/) last month with Newsmax.I feel uneasy about leaving the decision in the hands of the Trump administration, though I can see the logic behind giving it some time.

Will it be economically worth it for Europe to engage in wr for Denmark without USA? Who knows. So Trump says 'we want Greenland'. This is business, and leverage. Don't want me to take Greenland? Spend more on nato so we don't have to. Don't want either? OK I'm leaving nato good luck with Russia and China and... EU lol.Trump is a king, negotiating resources and borders with highprinces.

Canada, despite its strong European heritage and shared values, is geographically in North America. This isn't just a technicality - it's a fundamental barrier.But let's talk about what you're really concerned about here - security and independence. Canada already has robust defensive arrangements through NATO, which includes both European and North American allies. Plus, Canada has NORAD with the US, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and numerous other international partnerships that provide strategic depth.Think about the practical challenges for a moment. The EU's regulatory framework is designed for European market conditions and geographic realities. How would Canadian businesses adapt to EU regulations while simultaneously maintaining integration with their largest trading partner, the US? The Canada-US trade relationship is worth around $800 billion annually - that's not something you can easily restructure without massive economic disruption.Furthermore, the EU's decision-making process is already complex with 27 members. Adding a member from across the Atlantic would create unprecedented logistical and governance challenges. How would Canada participate effectively in EU council meetings and parliamentary sessions across multiple time zones?Instead of looking to join the EU, wouldn't it make more sense for Canada to strengthen its existing multilateral partnerships and continue diversifying its international relationships through agreements like CETA with the EU and CPTPP in the Pacific region?

Luckily I dont live or work stateside any more and I'm going to be fairly insulated from most of whats about to come. I spent years talking to \\"friends\\" and family.

I'm not gonna argue, help, discuss, debate, or do anything to help those ass hats out when their SS gets cut, needs a emergency flight to take care of a \\"medical\\" issue that they cant get help for where they live. Some one needs a bit of cash to make it to payday because gas and groceries are shockingly more expensive now. There are a whole lot of people in my family that are gonna have to start tugging on those boot straps. These people have no empathy. The final straw for me was discussing the immigration process my wife is going through and they were all horrified at how long it has taken and how demeaning the process was. Then they told me that she was one of the good ones and things should not that difficult. They are absolutely incapable of understanding that people they dont personally know are also real people and that living in immigration limbo is a special type of hell. if you invest in your new life and country you could loose everything if (years after applying) you are denied. Who wants to start a family when your life could be uprooted instantly and you need to try to sell everything you have at pennies to the dollar in less than 30 days. But yeah screw them. Most of his supporters are mostly functional adults who are not stupid. They saw what happened the first time and did not like it. Then they decided to try it again just because dems are bad. I have no respect and am no longer capable of empathy towards them. The fact they voted for a felon who is actively talking about and planning to hurt our fellow Americans instead of a person who they disagreed with but was actively trying to make their lives a little easier is sickening and the last straw for me.
