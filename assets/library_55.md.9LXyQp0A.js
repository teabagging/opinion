This was called operation mockingbirdBy capturing every news outlet and employing every journalist, they could say whatever they wanted and it would be truth. This is the single biggest destruction of actual journalism that holds people to account, what followed was a theatre performance where a few little scandals were dropped to keep the act upThe fact they arent going after and silencing mainstream journalists shows that those journalists arent threatening their narrative. The fact that they did before this, shows they used to threaten the narrativeIn the days of social media there is far more openness because its so decentralised, so once again you have journalists being murdered at scale rather than the odd one or two, because they are once again putting out journalistic discoveries that run against the ruling classs interests.

The reality is more nuanced.When people talk about \\"objective journalism,\\" they mean following established methodological principles: verifying facts with multiple sources, presenting different viewpoints fairly, separating facts from opinion, and being transparent about methods and limitations. It's similar to how scientists strive for objectivity through rigorous methodology while acknowledging their own potential biases.I worked as a court reporter for 15 years. When covering trials, I had to report exactly what was said and what evidence was presented, regardless of my personal views on the case. Was I completely \\"objective\\"? No. But by following strict journalistic standards, I could produce coverage that accurately informed readers about the proceedings.Even if the manner in which the subject is dealt with isn't overtly partisan, the subjects that are chosen to be presented themselves IS a political choice.This is a cop-out. By this logic, we should abandon any attempt at objectivity in any field because humans make subjective choices. Should we throw out the scientific method? Academic peer review? The justice system? All these institutions acknowledge human bias while still striving for objectivity through established procedures.The solution isn't to abandon objectivity as a goal - it's to be transparent about methods while actively working to minimize bias.

AstraZeneca, which developed a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus, dropped by 3pc.Paris-listed Sanofi, which makes flu vaccines, was down as much as 4.4pc to hit a four-month low.In the US, Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna was down by more than 2pc in pre-market trading, while BioNtech was down 2pc.The declines came after?Mr Trump said he would make Mr Kennedy Jr, who is?the nephew of John F Kennedy, his health secretary to make America great and healthy again.Mr Kennedy Jr C known as RFK Jr C has previously voiced anti-vax opinions and suggested fluoride is lowering childrens IQ. He once said: Theres no vaccine that is safe and effective.Analysts at JP Morgan said: Admittedly, it is difficult to evaluate the exact impact this appointment could have on the industry until we have more information on specific policy proposals and priorities of the incoming administration on healthcare and the drug industry.That said, we are not surprised the sector has been under pressure on the potential for RFK Jr. having oversight of the various agencies within HHS \\\\[Health and Human Services\\\\] (including the FDA, the CDC, NIH, and Medicare/Medicaid) given his previous stated views on the industry.Mr Kennedy Jr urged people to resist guidelines on when children should be vaccinated during the pandemic and has been accused of spreading misinformation regarding vaccines, including promoting debunked theories linking childhood vaccines to autism.Dr David Elliman, a consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: What is really concerning are his views on vaccination. He has perpetuated myths, including that of a link between MMR vaccine and autism, with an utter disregard for the evidence.If he is appointed and continues in the same mode, I fear not just for the vaccination programme in USA, but similar programmes around the world, and for healthcare, in general.While he is sceptical of vaccines, Mr Kennedy Jr has said that were not going to take vaccines away from anybody.**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/11/15/vaccine-stocks-plummet-trump-robert-f-kennedy-jr-health-sec/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/11/15/vaccine-stocks-plummet-trump-robert-f-kennedy-jr-health-sec/)","title":"Vaccine stocks plummet after Donald Trump names RFK Jr health secretary"},{"text":"Gotta give it to RepublicansYes, thats the plan.","title":"Trumps New Oligarchy Is About to Unleash Unimaginable Corruption"},{"text":"Don't share any paintings without noting the painter, rule number 1","title":"What do you see in this picture:"},{"text":"The consensus amongst historians appears to be that Bill Barr was the most corrupt Attorney General in the history of the country.

After endorsing Trump following a July assassination attempt, Musk has contributed millions to pro-Trump super PACs and has been appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, an outside advisory commission focused on identifying government spending cuts alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.However, some Republicans are skeptical about the longevity of this alliance, citing Trump's historical pattern of falling out with those who gain too much spotlight. They point to past examples like Steve Bannon and Dr. Anthony Fauci, where Trump grew frustrated with their prominence. While Trump's team publicly celebrates the relationship, calling them \\"great friends and brilliant leaders,\\" insiders suggest Musk might be \\"a little big for his britches\\" and question whether Trump will tolerate another \\"alpha\\" in his orbit.","title":"Some Republicans wonder whether Trump-Musk honeymoon will last"},{"text":"What do you think they can do?","title":"President Biden, and President elect Trump seen pictured with the American people"},{"text":"Sure but the policy of the DOJ doesn't magically change because someone is a public official or is nominated to a cabinet position.

One is that they spend less time checking the accuracy of their stories to make sure theyre true and the other is that they are having to rely less and less on their their own investigative journalism and more and more on other sources of information. Now the normal pipelines of information, the local newspapers and independent journalists, have been cut and replaced by new kinds of service providers.One of the big ones are the wire agencies like the Press Association. These are the people that the Queen or an MP or the police service or government departments speak to if they want to make a national or an international statement. Every news organisation of any sizes subscribes to them. All the national papers, all the major regions, all the freesheets like the Metro, all of the BBC national and regional outlets, all the commercial news and radio stations, they all subscribe to it and they all rely on it. A study into the major Fleet Street publications, the respected ones like The Times, The Guardian, The Independent and The Daily Telegraph, as well as the Daily Mail because its a monstrously well-selling mid-market title found that about a third of their articles were direct rewrites of Wire material where at best theyd just slightly changed the layout. Another fifth were largely reproduced from the Wire and another fifth on top of that contained elements of wire stories but had a fair amount of original material added on top. Thats about 70% of major uk stories either wholly or partly rewritten from wire copy. Its completely replaced the national network of local journalists as the major pipeline of stories into the big papers. A typical journalistic rule is that you need two sources for every story. For a lot of media organisations, including the beeb, a Press Association story pulled off of the wire doesnt need a second story to go on the waves, its considered good to go as is.  The problem is that wire organisations just arent up to the job, either in terms of coverage or accuracy.This means that the unique selling point of media is no longer the unique stories they've investigated and scooped their competitors on, because they're all really just regurgitating the information from the same sources. So how can they stand out? What can they do to attract attention now? It's to give their paper a spin to target a particular demographic, which is usually a political segment.Journalism in the past wasn't perfect, but it also wasn't inherently based on political division as it was in the past.2/2","title":"cmv: \\"Objective\\" Journalism isn't real and never was"},{"text":"this election made it clear that people prefer their politics in their face, not behind a closed curtain.","title":"Musk admits to being the \\"George Soros of the right\\""},{"text":"Matt Gaetz makes Diddy blush","title":"Influential Conservative Journalist Unleashes On 'Vile Sex Pest' Matt Gaetz"},{"text":"The *best* case scenario is Donald Trump's second term is the most corrupt in American history.

The dates will be a bit out of date as it was a few years ago and I can't be bothered to change them .The core point though is that as journalism has become increasingly commercialised there has been a far greater push on producing content rather than investigatory journalism.The network of journalists that are the essential to reporting news just dont exist any more in the same way they used to and in large part this is down to Murdoch. Before 1986 the printers unions and the National Union of Journalists did a fair enough job of holding off commercial interests and standing up for their principles. An example of this is a couple of years before when the miners strike was ongoing, the Sun tried to run a front page of Arthur Scargill waving to miners in a way that looked kind of like a nazi salute with the headline Mine Fuhrer in a fairly obvious attempt to slur him in an obvious politically motivated attack co.  Well I dont know if anyones seen the picture of The Sun from the day they went with the story, but theres no photo and no headline. The printers just werent willing to put it together. Instead there was a large print statement saying that the Sun production chapels had refused to print the headline or picture. It wasnt just basic morality and a sense of decency which lead the printers to do this, but also a recognition that if Thatcher succeeded in breaking the miner strike then they could be next and thats basically what happened. At the time however, collective action from labourers served to hold media accountable and stop gross politicisation. That's disappeared.Murdoch built a new print plant in Wapping and tried to reach agreements with staff which would limit their ability to organise as a union, like the end of the closed shop and a no strike clause. After months of negotiation the employees went on strike and with military precision Murdoch had all 6,000 of them fired, convinced enough journalists to work as scabs to carry on publishing and got new workers in from EETPU (which was a catchily named electricians union that got expelled from the TUC a couple of years later) to run their new presses. The strike managed to last over a year under a lot of criticism from the government and newspapers as well as police suppression, but in the end it was broken. After that, the rest of the Fleet Street papers followed suit.From there there was little resistance as journalists were fired and not replaced on a massive scale. Before the Wapping change Murdochs titles made 35 million in profit. Three years later and this had quadrupled but during the same period their total staffing had dropped from 8,731 to 949. The other papers were quick to follow him.Its this breaking of the unions that has really accelerated commercialisation of news. Its not news that in every privatised industry, the drive for profit will turn the focus away from social benefits and towards increasing earnings. With journalism,Id consider that what theyre meant to be supplying is a truthful representation of the important events. If we look at how the system has changed, especially in comparison to Wapping, then we can see a lot of ways in which the current set-up has really got in the way of that goal. This isnt just just because there are a few bad eggs wholl break laws if it gets them a good scoop and some money, its a systematic failure of the medias ability to accurately report the truth.Firstly there are simply far far less journalists out there. There arent and have never been tens of thousands of Guardian, Independents and Times journalists out there digging up stories all across the UK for the big top tier nationals. Instead theyve relied upon a network of smaller local papers and specialists scattered about the country that form the essential infrastructure of news gathering. These organisations simply no longer exist in the same way they did a few decades ago. The local newspapers themselves have have gone down by a third in the last two decades, while the number of journalists at the local newspapers still up and running has gone down with more than half of the provincial NUJ members lost their jobs in the decade and a half after Wapping.The local freelance agencies were the other place that journalists could go to to get news from across the country, but these are even worse off as the big papers cut their budgets for buying stories and froze the prices of those they did get meant the agencies had to shed staff and close. There were five agencies in Leeds, now there is one. Around Merseyside three of the four agencies closed and the one that did remain shrunk to around half the number of staff. The same thing happened in Stoke, Manchester, Derby and pretty much every city across the country save London and to a certain extent Birmingham while in rural areas, the smaller towns and villages, the one-man-bands that had covered them simply went bust.The story is the same wherever you look, like the specialist court reporting agencies that used to dig out severalt national news stories every day, including some fairly large scandals like when they caught the Chancellor Nigel Lawsons wife being snuck into her drink driving hearing which had been scheduled for before the courts would normally be open. Practically every supply line of national news and information to the major new organisations has collapsed in a bid to save money and cut costs. Meanwhile, at the big well-known news organisations things arent much better. Although they havent suffered cuts as massive as the ones faced by smaller newspapers because for instance that 8000+ employees being reduced to less than a thousand was mostly normal working people like the printers rather than journalists who are involved in finding and reporting on news, the numbers of journalists at the major Fleet Street organisations has still dropped a bit. The big problem they face though is the workload. Although there are almost as many journalists at major papers as there used to be, they space theyre expected to fill in a paper has trebled and thats before you take into account more recent innovations like free sheets, websites, blogs, podcasts and all those extra things that are considered essential nowadays.1/2","title":"cmv: \\"Objective\\" Journalism isn't real and never was"},{"text":"HA, you guys still think theres a next election.","title":"Trumps New Oligarchy Is About to Unleash Unimaginable Corruption"},{"text":"Lets hope ??","title":"Some Republicans wonder whether Trump-Musk honeymoon will last"},{"text":"I really got downvoted for thinking some color in my hair is pretty!?

In most cases (not the outlier cases) you have someone who didn't t have proper contraception, engaged in an act for which the risks were known and ended up in pregnancy. To pro-life people the fetus is seen as another person. Sure the fetus is reliant on your body, but it is your actions that led to this situation (again, exceptions apply). So you go, to people, who see abortion as killing a person, and you tell, that because it is your body, that killing a person, who came to existence because of your actions (exceptions apply) is fine. Essentially, to a pro-life person it seems as if you acknowledge that the fetus is a person, and to you, your discomfort in which you got into due to your own actions (exceptions apply) overrides the right to life to another person.Sure, there are exceptions, like rape, like medical complications etc, which are unique situations in themselves. Even if I put in every place that exceptions apply, in Reddit someone will have to point out that there are exception cases, but that is common sense and derails the core of the argument.To me, consciousness is the main reason why abortion ok. Until 20-28 weeks, fetus simply doesn't have the \\"infrastructure\\" to register pain, feel fear, think... Essentially, until then, its simply not an entity which can be distressed, it simply doesn't register any stimulus. In comparison with coma, its kinda like a movie. In the case of fetus, movie has not even started. In case of a coma, the movie has already been going on, the person has family, friends, aspirations. So here the dilemma is stopping a movie that has not even started, or stopping a movie that is already mid-way. Moreover, there are plenty of cases where coma patients report having some glimpses of consciousness during the coma. Its actually encouraged to try to interact with them. If its brain death, then the movie has ended, there is nothing that resembles the person in there anymore, its just the shell, and I believe that the ethical decision is pulling the plug.The comparison with animals has much more to do with psychology and human ability to empathetise rather than anything else. It is true, much of the animal world is highly concious, and yes, we are hypocritical in our behavior there. That is not an argument that shows that consciousness is irrelevant, it just shows that we are hypocritical in our behavior to other conscious creatures. Our innate psychology is that we can much more empathetise with creatures that are simmilar to us or exhibit their emotions simmilar to us. Humans are not rational beings. In general, I think that people who don't bother understanding where the beliefs of the opposing side are more damaging to the cause they support. You have to understand what drives the opposition, and address their misunderstanding. Its often the case that people who fail to understand the reasoning of opposition, say things that get misinterpreted by opposition and only strengthen their opposition.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Subtle high-fives were exchanged and remarks about the impending success of the next four years were whispered around.

There's a lot of junk.But there is also gold.A comparison would be someone saying 'all TV is trash and movies are terrible' because they come across some telenovelas and watched fast and furious 25'.2. Fanfic has a bad reputation. Partly because there IS a lot of junk, but also because, routinely, things women and girls like and enjoy are disparaged. You know the bechdel test. Because so much media fails, people take the characters and settings they love and flesh them out. Queer people also use the space for similar reasons. It is a space where writing is not monetized. That is another reason why there is some disparagement given 'hustle/side gig culture'. That you're a chump for doing something for free and that free output is probably garbage.3. There is good stuff.Some fanfic writers are professional writers. They just want to have fun, away from their main work, and fanfic is an anonymous platform with a built in audience. What's not to like? So how do you find the good stuff.Ratings:\\nThat can be hit or miss. Sometimes something is just popular because it is popular. Or the writer is some sort of influencer with a following elsewhere. BUT Usually, if something has ten thousand likes, it's because they get something very right.I started one of the so-called best fics and it was crap.These are mostly not professional writers. It can often take a little while for the writer to get into their stride. Think of a newborn horse. Wobbling a bit, falling over a few times, but a couple of hours later, they are trotting along.The best way to find something is recommendations. If you find something you enjoy, you can look at what the author has saved as favourites. Places like r/fanfiction are also good.

Damn any concessions to them until that changes pronto.Edit 2: I mean for Christs sake, male child rape victims have fk all for parental rights but we are supposed to have bleeding hearts for women only? Im sorry I cannot do thatIm about as the primary power should lay with the states as it gets as my ideal is returning the federal unitary part of our government to a state more in line with the  articles of confederation and I also believe in states rights, nullification at least to some degree, and voluntary union. Put another way, I think the outcome of the Civil War did egregiously wrong things with dire consequences for one of the best possible reasons, but that doesnt change my view that outside slavery being abolished like it should have been the moment we gained our independence, a lot of the other consequences that arose from the war were extremely negative and directly led to a lot of the problems we face today with an openly corrupt federal government that has gone so far in exceeding its mandate I struggle to understand why my forebears allowed this to happen.  It should have been checked and severely curtailed by whatever means necessary for wt least 60-70 years, and honestly maybe even 100 or more. But now those of us alive today are stuck with it because of what I can only see as complacency and/or cowardice.I get this is a losing issue but it should have never been made legal in the first place aside from clearly spelled out instances of necessity for maternal health that are clear enough that there isnt any delay or concern some POS prosecutor goes after a mother or a doctor for carrying out the procedure in such instances.But we cannot have fetal homicide laws, even in states like California where penal code 187 which defines murder as Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought which is but one state in the majority that has laws on the books regarding fetal homicide. A human fetus is the only life form on this planet that is selectively defined as alive but murderable in legal terms if the woman carrying it wants it that way, or alive but not murderable if the woman carrying it wants it that way. In no other instance, and with no other species, does an individual get to willy nilly decide not only whether a being is alive or not, but whether or not the killing of that being results in a lucrative career choice for another person, or the permanent taking of the freedom of another person.So in this topic, a single human being gets to both decide whether one person involved in this potential triangle gets to live or die, and simultaneously gets to actually decide whether the person that does the deed faces wealth or prison. In no other aspect of law does an individual get to determine whether someone faces prosecution or not. In no other case within the law is an individual not empowered by the constitution and the state allowed to make such a determination. The one place we do allow that determination is for the convenience of a group of humans.Whether one believes in God or not, and whether it is an affront to God or not if they do believe, it is still an affront to law, to logic, to the equality of all, and to life itself. Then God forbid you ask from compromise from the other end oh noooo, only one segment of the population has to sacrifice and accept what to them is murder, something that nobody has the right to do except in self defense (not murder) unless you are a government and even that can be debatable. Okay well what about granting an equivalent right to men? Obviously there is no way for the male to carry the child but abortion allows the female half of the population to determine whether a child is born or killed and therefore whether the male is a father or not, which is yet another way that in this case only an individual gets to decide whether somebody faces lifelong legal repercussions or not. Since the United States government has repeatedly ruled that a female raping even an underage male is not grounds for the woman to lose custody nor release the underage rape victim from child support obligations, how am I supposed to view a government that goes wildly out of its way to protect one sex, while legitimately facilitating the rape of men, even underage boys, by granting child raping women custody AND child support FROM THEIR RAPE VICTIM?I realize compromise is inevitable and the ship in my beliefs has sailed long ago. But Ill be damned if I support any kind of concession or compromise when the United States Government has the view that a male child raped by a woman is on the hook for child support and not even having custody of the baby born of his rape. There needs to be major major major changes to the rights of men in this domain before women that want abortion should get any kind of concession and compromise.edit: spelling","title":"John Thune: 900,000 Babies are Killed in Abortions Every Year, Thats Like Killing My State of South Dakota"},{"text":"Trump is the \\"iPhone\\" of politics.

This is why they don't actually care to resist fascism, because doing so will make their politics completely unappealing to voters.

They claim that only bible (or god) say life starts at conception. Im an atheist and in my eyes, people who make such claims are themselves very ignorant of how these things work.DNA is like a self-unwinding mechanism. It synthesizes proteins to envelop itself into a cell. It makes copies of itself with different regions covered to synthesize different kinds of proteins allowing for different cells to form by the same DNA. The DNA carries the info about the position of each cell in your body and the timing when it must form. It even carries data about the organisms eye color, personality, location of birthmarks, and even first grey hair and wrinkles. Quite literally, everything that you are - is that DNA chain. So, life really does start when the first DNA chain forms - within 2 days after conception. Brain and cardiovascular systems form first. When the heart starts to beat, the embryo will continue to maintain its own blood pressure and body temperature going forward. So, saying that life starts at conception is more scientific than saying that it starts at a point of viability or at birth. And because brain and neurons form first and embryos are capable of moving, there is a 100% guarantee that the embryo can sense external stimulus - a temperature, or a touch. Because they react to such stimulus, there is no reason to believe they wont sense pain if they get ripped apart by a surgeon. A pro-life argument is not trying to be evil to a woman - its trying to be nice to that teeny-tiny human being inside! And if the earliest premature birth these days is at 21 weeks, then abortions at that point or past that are murder.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"yeah if bodily autonomy applied to things that were basically purely behavioral just because you use your body to do them and not, like, psychic powers or an astral self or something, then why would someone need to resort to emotionally-manipulative arguments like repealing mandatory reporter laws when you could just make the same appeal-to-hypocrisy as those were also trying to do about participating in society as a whole.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Oh I didn't know you live at a place where there are natural disasters 365 days a year.Of course you have some cash and gold at hand for extreme times.","title":"Congratulations USA you are now 36 trillion dollars"},{"text":"It's like the internet is reading my mind.

It perfectly sums up what makes the US special. Its special because it was founded specifically as the opposite to the norm at the time of tyrannical Kings and their supposed divine right, by God to rule and oppress the people. The US constitution was a concrete example of the Age of Enlightenment thinking. Discussion of Christian Nation is as un-American as King and Queens are. That the ideas of Liberty, Equality and Freedom run so deep in the US psyche is a testament to this. This is a product of the Enlightenment era. That US citizens would wish to put themselves back in the chains of oppression where church and state embrace says a lot about humanity and our inability to be free. We are like cached animals. We want to be out of our cage but are scared when we are. We want, or depressingly need the safety of its walls.For me the key conclusion from the Enlightenment era was you are only truly free when you are free from all oppressors. This includes God. True freedom is breaking the last vestiges of self oppression where God is you oppressing yourself (and others).For many, Freedom isnt free its terrifying. They want to be oppressed with God as their oppressor.","title":"Oklahoma Superintendent Mandates Schools Show Students a Video Inviting Students to Pray for Trump: Oklahoma also ranks 49th out of 50 states in 2024 for low test scores and graduation rates.

In fact the Central Bank had already bought around 16 billion USD and bolstered the reserves itself just this year.This year's inflation will be something like 120%, next year private firms predict it to be 25% or less, and 2026 a single, little digit like a normal country.","title":"President-elect Trump with President Milei and Elon Musk (11/14)"},{"text":"yes waste of money ukraine cant win anyways . the plus bricks wants russia to stop the war and his country is taking a financial beating . the peace will help pave the way for bricks to get stronger cause the dollar is phasing out","title":"Nobel Prize - Trump"},{"text":"Compared to the coverage The NY Times gave to Biden, Trump got very favorable coverage.","title":"Trump Threatens New York Times, Penguin Random House over Critical Coverage"},{"text":"Nope","title":"Line up to kiss the ring!

Full disclosure, I'm a Democratic Socialist from outside the US, but I have no choice but to pay attention to America politics. I'm only here because this was the first subreddit that popped up on election night outside lgbt. You call this a compassionate critique, but frankly, what even is this? Critique requires engaging with some semblance of the substance of the thing being critiqued, but besides the valid attacks on wokescolding, this is nonsense. Objectively, nearly every single metric you cite in this masturbatory screed is wrong, and easily verifiable as wrong from even a cursory glance through this very subreddit, to say nothing of any of the actual subs for marginalized peoples.

If they're pushing allies away, how were leftist, if not outright DemSoc policies being passed nearly every time they were made direct ballot measures? How were State Supreme Courts being flipped? You say there's no appetite for pragmatism in the American Left, but that doesn't bear out in any of the data collated so far. Spoiler votes were a rounding error and Progressives overwhelmingly turned out for Kamala. How is it their fault that centrists can't be bothered to learn, or more importantly, leverage, Intersectionality? Why should they tolerate underwhelming candidates, when underwhelming candidates are the reason the Democrats lost? You've mistaken frustration at the pace of progress and chosen to blame that for the Dems' loss over any of the objective factors that have been identified. You fetishize incrimentalism, sanitizing the often thankless, painful, and sometimes bloody work of advocacy. You have no concept of realpolitik or solidarity. I don't mind fighting in coalition with center leftists, or even centrists, but I'm not fighting Fascism with someone who doesn't even know how to fight.Bernie was right. You centrists love stealing our ideas and pretending you were allies all along, and the blaming us progressives the second things go south. Anything it takes to keep from looking inward.You want to see what Progressive Left \\"hard work\\" looks like? Look to the ACLU. Look to Spain and France and Germany.

It's written asThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to pro mote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Board of Governors shall consult with Congress at semiannual hearings before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives about the Board of Governors' and the Federal Open Market Committee's objectives and plans with respect to the ranges of growth or diminution of monetary and credit aggregates for the upcoming twelve months, taking account of past and prospective developments in production, employment, and prices. Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to require that such ranges of growth or diminution be achieved if the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee determine that they cannot or should not be achieved because of changing conditions.There is some serious creative interpretation to get from stable prices to exponential growth at 2%, the dual mandate was created during the 70s, stagflation. I do not see it surviving long in the post chevron era. You can reasonably argue that the mandate is for deflation at the rate of productivity growth, by keeping stable prices for land and labor, but arguments for permanent exponential inflation do not match either the letter or the spirit of the law.","title":"Harris got nearly as many votes as Biden 2020 in every battleground state.

As an adult this woman has had 5 abortions! All as a form of birth control and oh because she found out they were boys! She kept the 6th as it was a girl. A lot more of this scenario happens more than I think liberals want to admit. Im also a 20 year seasoned nurse who works in a Pacu at a level one trauma hospital. Ive seen plenty of d and c preformed because the baby is likely to have down syndrome and the mother doesnt want a disabled child. Now we have seen down syndrome individuals go on to have incredible lives with profound impact on this world and the people around them. To imply that those human beings would have been better off not existing is not for us to say IMO. I understand the need for a d and c for a missed abortion. Then baby is not viable and the mother hasnt completely passed the baby herself. This is an emergency and the mom will die of sepsis if a d and c is not preformed. Then again in that instance the baby has already died. I have also never known a woman who has gotten an abortion that doesnt regret it. It has had a huge impact on their lives down the road for these women. They struggle forever with the decision they made. As anyone should if you decide to end anothers life. Also, the liberals did this to themselves by constantly pushing the envelope. Having abortions wasnt good enough. They insist they have to be able to have them at any time of the pregnancy and for any reason. A good deal of people should and do have a problem with full term abortions. I am 45 years old and have never gotten pregnant by accident. It turns out having one partner and using birth control works very well.

America is fucked up but it is not at all analogous to the late Soviet Union. Thats bonkers. Is it about to be that bad soon? Maybe. If Trump and his goons get their way. But your analysis is honestly a ridiculous misrepresentation of history and current geopolitics. The main and most glaring issue being you drastically underestimate the advancement and power of the U.S. military. Its unquestionably the strongest military on Earth, backed by the largest economy to match. The Soviet Union never came close to achieving that level of dominance in either sphere, economically or militarily. Its not even close.Hell, most of the Russian military gets a fraction of the training even your average grunt in the U.S. military gets, and the military in the U.S. doesnt even have to rely on conscription, meaning all the soldiers are volunteers who actually chose to be there and serve. Between that and the training, even a below average grunt is probably more skilled and prepared for real warfare than your average Russian soldier. It doesnt get much better if we take into account the large mercenary groups like Wagner that augment Russias manpower, even their more professional career soldiers arent nearly as effective and lethal as elite U.S. combat groups like our special forces. Particularly not when supplemented by airpower, an arena the U.S. is also uncontested in. We have recent examples that show this. Back in 2018, a team of some 40 U.S. special forces soldiers supported by some aircraft and a few armored trucks took on over 500 Wagner mercenaries accompanied by dozens of armed vehicles of their own, including 10 Soviet tanks, 9 of which were destroyed by the U.S. forces. They also reportedly killed or incapacitated 200 or more enemy soldiers. The U.S. forces suffered one injury, but no deaths. Thats what happens when the most professional army in the world wages war. To equate that to the waning conventional military power of the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s is worse than absurd, its so downright silly that its laughable.","title":"How bad could a second Trump presidency get?

Not everything is political. Sometimes people just want to create something that is entertaining. Propaganda requires some level of intent to persuade.I don't think your exactly ready for gender trouble yet. See this is the problem with people who consume primarily liberal media. The total inability to even comprehend what the opposing argument is about. Both sides of this debate make perfect logical sense if you assume their philosophical argument is true. If a fetus isn't a person deserving of rights, then it makes no sense to limit abortions. If it is a person deserving of rights, you would have to be a psychopath to support killing it. The argument is about whether the fetus should have rights. That's the only thing in debate. It's really not that difficult of a concept to understand.I understand it. It seems you are just projecting whatever you think i believe onto me. Abortion relates to healthcare because abortion bans directly effect healthcare in real life. Secondly, arguments for abortion stem from personhood and bodily autonomy as well. They all have implications for healthcare since abortion is a procedure for medical complications.  This is simply incorrect. A neutrality bias implies that I'm giving up some level of objectivity to appear neutral. In my example, i maintained perfect objectivity in my rewording. The difference is that rather telling the reader what to believe using language loaded with negative connotation, I'm simply informing them and providing reasoning and evidence.

Also, when a child dies, I say \\"that's terrible, they had their whole future ahead of them\\". What I don't say is \\"that's terrible because they had the ability to deploy consciousness\\". Literally no one thinks that way. The reason why we view killing or an early/preventable death as particularly tragic is because of?*the future that was stripped from that person*. So why is a baby any different from a fetus in that way? They both have futures ahead of them.indeed, it's tragic because of \\"the future that was stripped from that person\\". but in the case of a fetus (before 20 weeks gestation), there *is* *no person* from whom a future is stripped. there is no victim. to be a person you need to have began your consciousness. preventing the continuation of consciousness is immoral, preventing the start of it is a victimless crime.  Also, as I already said, we have killed countless orcas even though they arguably have a greater sense of consciousness than we do. How is that permissible if consciousness is our greatest determinant as a society? I would say because it's actually not, even though we'd like to think so.it's not. as i said in my original comment.  Also, the capacity to deploy consciousness is already such a vague and philosophical concept. We literally have no way of truly knowing when that begins and ends.why does this matter? we recognise the ontological moral facts and we do our best to approximate when it begins and ends and act accordingly. so far the evidence suggests it begins \\\\~20 weeks into gestation and ends at brain-death.  Of course you can, and women do all the timecome on now, this is a 'can' of obligation, not of possibility.  Also, consent to sex isn't consent to pregnancy.yes it is, you know full well the risks of the biological process you're engaging in.  But even if she?*wanted*?to get pregnant, she can revoke consent at any timeno she can't, this is the right she gave up when she consented to pregnancy. i can stop holding my child in my arms at any time, but not if i chose to hold them over a balcony. once i've chosen to do that, i'm obligated to keep holding it until it can be safely let go of.  It's her body that is being used by this fetus to keep itself alive, she is the donor in this situation. She is very generously giving up her own organs and body to this other person so that they can live. So honestly, they're lucky that she's even given them as much life as she has.she is *not* a donor, there was nobody in need of a donation in the first place. she created the problem and now wants to kill the person with the problem instead of solving it.  If it wasn't for her, the fetus wouldn't have had any bit of life at all.this is not how it works whatsoever, it is better not to have lived than to be created just to be murdered. would you say it's good for a woman to conceive, birth and then murder her newborn? at least she gave it a bit of life, right? would you also say that refraining from conceiving a child is as bad as murdering one? or even worse, after all the potential child had more potential life it could have potentially lived.  We don't ask anyone to do this. Even if a murderer stabs me and I'm bleeding to death, the government cannot catch him and force him to give his blood to me so that I can live. Keep in mind that?*this murderer is the one who put me there. They did that.*?And that still doesn't give me that right to forcibly take their blood from them. And that's just a little bit of blood--it takes 20 minutes of their time at most! If we can't even force a literal murderer who stabbed me to do that? What the hell makes anyone think we can force a woman to give up?*so much more*?than just a little bit of her blood?it is a moral failing of our legal system that we don't do this. as i've demonstrated, we happily obligate people to fix the problems that we ourselves create rather than kill our victims all the time.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"They were claiming this before the election, as if the RINOs still had any significant control of the base or the party.

What physical processes are being used against my will?Energy, agency, consent, etc. You know. Like the ability to make decision over what your body does...like bodily autonomy. You could be obtuse and say your brain or your mouth but thats obviously and clearly not even close to comparable to being forced to donate an organ or another physical part of your body to another person.No, in many ways its worse. a persons body will automatically grow a fetus and induce birth without intervention. The woman (person) is not being compelled or coerced by anything where as good Samaritan laws are. This is why I say bodily autonomy is a terrible argument. It turns people into libertarians. Your ability to get a legal abortion is completely reliant on the law and a medical professional to perform the abortion. The bodily autonomy argument itself cedes control of women's bodies to the state. If your bodily autonomy is dependent on finding another person to maintain your autonomy, you have a weak case for autonomy. If abortion pills were legal, and then after the 10 weeks they work, you were only allowed a coat-hanger abortion would you be okay with your \\"bodily autonomy\\" being in tact? I assume not. Abortion is a medical and scientific issue and the rationale should be medical and scientific This is why the rationale should be based on personhood and science and not arcane enlightenment philosophy.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"X feels like its in a slow, inexorable, spiral into the ground, but if LibX dies before ConservativeX, that wouldnt upset me none.","title":"MSNBC Host Joy Reid Becomes Latest Lib To Quit X Following Trumps Triumph"},{"text":"Very good point.

The market will favor ICE for a really long time, especially if battery tech doesn't end up being economic after research and development.

Most consumers don't really demand this, so EVs aren't in any position to dominate the market. Ps. Low maintenance is not an advantage when your several thousand dollar battery fails in two hundred thousand miles(or possibly less if you cheap out.)

It sounds a whole lot to me like you're just labeling any piece of media that isn't actively trying to overthrow every part of society as \\"conservative propaganda\\", which is obviously ridiculous. Not everything is political. Sometimes people just want to create something that is entertaining. Propaganda requires some level of intent to persuade.That is quite literally what the abortion debate is about.See this is the problem with people who consume primarily liberal media. The total inability to even comprehend what the opposing argument is about. Both sides of this debate make perfect logical sense if you assume their philosophical argument is true. If a fetus isn't a person deserving of rights, then it makes no sense to limit abortions. If it is a person deserving of rights, you would have to be a psychopath to support killing it. The argument is about whether the fetus should have rights. That's the only thing in debate. It's really not that difficult of a concept to understand.This is the definition of neutrality bias. Not calling it a conspiracy commits the middle ground fallacy and sane washes the belief. It give more credibility to the issue when their is none.This is simply incorrect. A neutrality bias implies that I'm giving up some level of objectivity to appear neutral. In my example, i maintained perfect objectivity in my rewording. The difference is that rather telling the reader what to believe using language loaded with negative connotation, I'm simply informing them and providing reasoning and evidence. A middle ground fallacy would mean I'm arguing the truth is in the middle of the opposing sides. My rewording explicitly states that one side is right and the other is wrong. The message is the same.

The United States cannot possibly compete with the rest of the world developing and building the large scale projects needed to compete technologically.  The United States is simply in a position similar to that of the Soviet Union in the late 1970s, when it would have already been apparent that the Soviet Union was in a state of continuous decay, including its institutions.The Soviet Union back then had only one asset, a massive military build-up that attempted to project hundreds of thousands of troops in lightning takeovers of countries.  However a strategy of planning for reaching the Rhine River in 7 days was completely ludicrous.What the Soviet Union should have done was leverage its military to offer a carrot-and-stick for Europe to have the United States withdraw its own forces.  Only as a last resort would an attack on West Germany be made, and it would be to knock out Rammstein Air Base as its objective, not an impossible swallow all of Germany by reaching the Rhine in 7 days.The carrot the Soviet Union would have offered would have been a complete demilitarization on its side across Europe, in exchange for open trade and other ties.  This might have given the Soviet Union the breathing room to reform its own economy away from the worst parts of Communism.What is disturbing to me is the continuity across Administrations in seeking regime change simultaneously in all of China, Iran, and Russia, with the accompanying propaganda promoting this as being possible across social media.  This is the political equivalent to the Soviet Union being able to convince the Europeans to eject US forces in the late 1970s or early 1980s.","title":"How bad could a second Trump presidency get?

That is to say that walking across the room to give the baby milk (which isn't even forced because you can always put them up for adoption) is nowhere near the same as being forced to share your internal organs and body with them against your will, for nine months, putting your own life/health on the line in order to do so, and then very painfully giving birth at the end of this process.First off, you are playing semantic games. The state compels parents to use their bodies to care for their living child. It requires organs  and tissue. For some they are compelled and end up dying  are being serious injured. It's less often than the rates associated with giving birth but it's still there. The difference is inconsequential to bodily autonomy. Bodily autonomy is an out of date concept that existed before social contract theory. in the early 1600s. Today, it's almost universally accepted that you give up your basic liberties for the good of others. This is to say, almost everybody understands that there are limits to liberty. So what you've touched on is people's?general autonomy,?or the right to make any decision, period (which isn't allowed).No. You are not allowed to go on vacation for 3 weeks and leave the baby at home alone. Everybody understands that this requires responsibility and duty placed on people's bodies. However, as you mentioned, this only accounts for 90% of abortions. It doesn't account for all of them, which bodily sovereignty does account for.Actually a large portion of the remaining 10% involves non-viable fetuses. I don't know how many and it's late so i can't look it up. Also, I'm willing to bet that pro-lifers would fervently combat your definition of personhood and argue that fetuses should have different protections established for them because they have the potential for personhood, as you mentioned.?Right but I think I pretty clearly explained why personhood doesn't begin at conception and that states already have the legal right to restrict abortions and have had that ability since 1992 with the Casey supreme court ruling. ?just like how it would concern me if a pregnant woman drank heavily during her pregnancy and still planned on giving birth,?*because she's knowingly causing harm to a future person.*Huh? Whaa? By this logic, how is killing the potential life not harmful? Because they will never be a person? Remember when I said, bodily autonomy assumes personhood? That means you are killing a person. Which is causing harm. This is why the bodily autonomy standard doesn't make sense. If a fetus is not a person, it has no rights and it's not a living human. Thus bodily autonomy is not a standard that comes into play at all.You're correct. But at the same time, nobody thinks a mother should be forced to share her internal organs and body with her newborn whose organs are failing either, if she says no for any reason.In almost every hospital they will not require intent to do a cesarean and save the baby if a fully pregnant mother is unconscious. In many they will use the mothers blood without consent as well. So I think many people think mothers should be forced to share internal organs without their consent. Also, do you think a conjoined twin should have the right to revoke consent of their internal organ from their twin, thus killing the twin? I assume not because that would be insane.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Dude looks like he wiped his hands with it after eating French fries.","title":"John Fetterman - Trump's cabinet picks are \\"'God-tier Level Trolling\\""},{"text":"He is a politician.

A fetus only starts to develop any of that right towards the end. And if you don't believe in this whole theory, consider this: which has value, a zombie that is a functioning human body but doesn't have a human mind to control it or a sentient chair with thoughts and feelings and all. Basically what I'm saying is that you can argue that the fetus has value, but a person's choice in this matters more for various reasons and so does the future interest of a potential person (only if theyre actually gonna be born, a concept of a person doesnt have that), so giving birth to them if they are going to be struggling anyway because they cant take care of it properly or dont want to is questionable.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"don't worry by that point he'll realize everything and stop supporting trump so much instead of being a ducksucker he'll become his shoe polisher","title":"Republicans Float Lara Trump to Fill Rubios Senate Seat"},{"text":"especially when the makeup like doubled in thickness","title":"Donald Trump Tells House Republicans He Won't Seek a Third Term Unless They 'Figure' Out a Way to Allow It"},{"text":"Does he operate much in the same way as Obama?","title":"Donald Trump, Digital Currency and the March Towards a Digital and Financial Prison Planet"},{"text":"[All BlackRock Companies by Weight](https://www.slickcharts.com/blackrock)[BlackStone Holdings](https://fintel.io/i/blackstone)[Vanguard ETFs](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/list/etfs)[State St. Corp Institutional portfolio](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/institutional-portfolio/state-street-corp-6697)It makes no difference to financial markets who wins the US presidential election, according to Larry Fink, chief executive and co-founder of BlackRock, the largest money management firm in the world.

Any vegan could tell you all about it. Also, when a child dies, I say \\"that's terrible, they had their whole future ahead of them\\". What I don't say is \\"that's terrible because they had the ability to deploy consciousness\\". Literally no one thinks that way. The reason why we view killing or an early/preventable death as particularly tragic is because of *the future that was stripped from that person*. So why is a baby any different from a fetus in that way? They both have futures ahead of them. Also, as I already said, we have killed countless orcas even though they arguably have a greater sense of consciousness than we do. How is that permissible if consciousness is our greatest determinant as a society? I would say because it's actually not, even though we'd like to think so. Also, the capacity to deploy consciousness is already such a vague and philosophical concept. We literally have no way of truly knowing when that begins and ends.you give up your right to lethal self-defense when you consent to pregnancy. you can't bring a baby into existence inside you and then kill it for existing inside you.?*you*?did that.Of course you can, and women do all the time. If the fetus is threatening her, she can kill the fetus to preserve her own life/health. So no, you really don't \\"give up\\" your right to self-defense whenever you consent to pregnancy. Also, consent to sex isn't consent to pregnancy. But even if she *wanted* to get pregnant, she can revoke consent at any time. It's her body that is being used by this fetus to keep itself alive, she is the donor in this situation. She is very generously giving up her own organs and body to this other person so that they can live. So honestly, they're lucky that she's even given them as much life as she has. If it wasn't for her, the fetus wouldn't have had any bit of life at all. But now, for whatever reason, she has decided that this pregnancy is actually too much for her, so she no longer wants to continue being pregnant. If you force her to continue, you're now asking someone to sacrifice themselves and put their own life/health on the line for the sake of someone else. We don't ask anyone to do this. Even if a murderer stabs me and I'm bleeding to death, the government cannot catch him and force him to give his blood to me so that I can live. Keep in mind that *this murderer is the one who put me there. They did that.* And that still doesn't give me that right to forcibly take their blood from them. And that's just a little bit of blood--it takes 20 minutes of their time at most! If we can't even force a literal murderer who stabbed me to do that?

He has a very sizeable base of people enraptured by his cult of personality, but it's not enough to win a national election.The demographic which swung for Trump this year were not hardline MAGAites, they were people who genuinely believe \\"the Democrats\\" (as a monolithic entity) had swung too far left, and were destroying the economy, personal liberties, and their livelihoods with their policies. Whether or not this is true, the Democrats need to give an olive branch to this group next election, rather than pandering to a progressive base that will never, *ever* be a swing demographic.This is a problem first-and-foremost with America's federal structure combined with its current high-discipline party system. Every swing voter looks at solidly Democrat-controlled states as an example for what America will look like under a Democratic presidency, when these states are frequently controlled by progressives and even somewhat authoritarian (by the standards of most swing states) governors who never have to make any compromises to the other side of the isle.In my opinion, the national Democrats need to more thoroughly decouple themselves from the actions of their state/local branches, and embrace a much more moderate-looking national agenda in order to win. A genuine, down-to-earth candidate running on a platform of gun *rights* and a clear classical-liberal/libertarian concept of \\"personal liberty and personal responsibility\\" (moderated by support of basic welfare and New Deal corporatist policies, of course) could win the deep south if the Republicans don't catch on, particularly if they're a figure who genuinely projects charisma and inspiration.","title":"Harris got nearly as many votes as Biden 2020 in every battleground state.

He also said he will remove advertising from big pharma on TV and wants to stop the FDA getting funding from the companies it is supposed to regulate. These are things that should have happened eons ago. As soon as he was named on Trump's ticket I was hoping Kamila would see these issues about Big Pharma and the FDA and add them to her platform but she didn't. There is absolutely no reason the lifespan of the rest of the western world continues to rise but America's is lower now than it was in the year 2000.Criticise RFK for being an idiot in the past.

Instead, argue that whats being killed isnt really a child at all.Well that's just it, though--this approach directly engages their beliefs about a parent's obligations to their child, because it's asking them \\"in what world is a parent being forced to share their internal organs with their child a reasonable 'obligation'?\\" Not ours! There's actually no country in which this is considered permissible, even if the child is a newborn. So it strange to say that it's a \\"parental obligation\\" just because we're talking about a fetus. That would require a special set of rights to be granted to fetuses that no other human at any age has: the right to use someone else's organs against their will, to keep one's self alive. All that's to say that there's a pretty big difference between *parental obligations* (i.e. walking across the room to give the baby some milk), which aren't even \\"forced\\" because you can always give the baby up for adoption, and *bodily obligations* which forcibly require you to share your internal organs with someone else against your will.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Honestly Id vote Hannibal.

From then on, you can't universally condone the *killing* of what is now a person, without also excusing some dangerous parellel situations for adults.Also, i don't agree with the idea that the fetus is somehow to blame for the situation. The fetus isn't 'using' anything, it has no agency to do so. It's been *put* there, willingly, by the parents. Whether it was intended or not, you as actual living people, have infinite more responsibility for the fetus being there than the fetus has for it's presence. It's not 'alive' yet, it can't make decisions.I think the current system in most countries is fine.

No, hed be vilified as an awful, evil person, Americas worst father. Now add in the fact that:1. He caused this situation. He put his child in the situation where they need his organs.2. A positive action isnt required to save the child. The opposite, a positive action is required to kill the child and let him go about his day freely. That alone brings us outside of the realm of his rights. People DO have the right to not be murdered. You cant murder innocent people. So if its a person, thats it. That person wouldve had no right for a positive action to tie in your organs with theirs, but thats been done, in the vast majority of cases through your actions, so it doesnt matter.Now the question has become Do you have a right to take the positive action to kill them?

Kennedy did not travel to Samoa to attend the 57th Independence Celebrations until the summer of 2019, just a few months before the measles outbreak.  \\nCompounding matters for the worse, recent studies reveal that [Samoan children are malnourished](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37166449/), which was a suspected contributing factor to the outbreaks 1.45% case fatality rate.Researchers found that [Samoan children are deficient](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29877157/) in calcium, potassium, and vitamins A and E.Historically, mothers who acquired natural measles in childhood went on to confer excellent passive immunity to their babies, which protected those babies from measles infection until they were young adolescents. This is not the case for vaccinated mothers.The unforeseen consequence of vaccinating the globe for measles is that infants are no longer born with passive measles immunity, as immunity cannot be passed on by a vaccinated mother who lacks naturally-acquired antibodies.In 60 years of measles vaccination, infants under 12 months have shifted from being the most protected demographic to being the most at risk. This fact may also help to explain the very high mortality in Samoan infants.In addition, vaccination sites are often not sanitized against infectious disease, turning vaccine clinics into infection-spreading hot spots, rapidly accelerating infection rates. Jose Hagan, Immunization Specialist for the World Health Organization (WHO), suspected this paradoxical outcome was the case in Samoa. \\"This is a feature of almost every outbreak I've ever been a part of,\\" he told [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/18/these-babies-should-not-have-died-how-the-measles-outbreak-took-hold-in-samoa)in December 2019.Lastly, while the [D8 measles strain](https://reliefweb.int/report/samoa/national-measles-response-and-recovery-appeal-6-december-2019) was present in the outbreak, we do not know if D8 was the only strain, or if vaccine strain measles also played a role.Regardless, according to pediatrician and vaccinologist [Dr. Stanley Plotkin](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/221/10/1571/5610905?login=false), the D8 strain is \\"not as well neutralized by antibodies to the vaccine genotype.\\" In other words, it was not unexpected that the D8 strain that was circulating in the fall of 2019 could cause an outbreak in even highly vaccinated populations because researchers already knew that the vaccine is not as effective against D8.","title":"Trump just appointed RFKjr to run HHS."},{"text":"I have been saying for years the dems need to man up and play hard ball.

These sources are the alternative media, and are popular in part because they offer interesting and satisfying alternative perspectives and narratives to the official one. **But many people don't listen to or watch these podcasts and still generally believe the mainstream narratives.** And so in that sense it is still \\"Mainstream\\" even if it is less so than it used to be.Nothing here negates the narrative that non-legacy media is less popular than alternative media overall. since \\"facts have liberal bias\\" it is perceived as Left leaning. Frankly, this is ridiculous though. Idk that the proper term is truly liberal/ left-leaning, but rather the Mainstream Media is clearly and often pushing narratives on behalf of the D.C. establishment, and often for the Democratic Party specifically. For example, it was clear to pretty much everyone that Biden was mentally declining over the past few years and was not fit to be president for another 4 years (nothing to be ashamed of really).I never claimed  that the MSM was always correct or never biased. Also there are counter points to this. Firstly, almost all news channels underreported on both candidates mental decline. Futher more the MSM has also does stuff like report on bidens ''garbage'' comment to a significantly greater degree than any of trumps comments ever. here's a 0% chance that all of the facts would always support the liberal point of view- political issues are far too complex for that. The fact that Trump gets something like 95% + negative coverage on these media outlets while Biden/Kamala got like 90% positive coverage really can't logically be explained by just objective factual reporting. Sure Trump is plausibly wrong on some things and if it was more like a 60/40 split for Biden/Kamala then I think u could argue that it was unbiased, but a 90/10 split is ridiculous.Again, I never claimed  that the MSM was always correct or never biased. . This is also exactly what im taking about when I say neutrality bias. The MSM has sane washed trump by even comparing him to Harris. It is absolutely the case that weighted based on good/bad things trump/ harris has done is easily a 90/10 split. Haris is a run of the mill liberal candidate with some blunders. Trump is an unprecedently bad candidate on every level.","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"94% of the population is vaccinated against measles.  \\nSome speculated it could have been as low at 31%the guess was 74% for 2017 and 31% to 34% for 2018, only two years that were out of wack.so taking that into account they had 94% herd immunity on the island, and people feel that 95% is the threshold.&amp;#x200B;poor nutrition is a huge factor, 30% are deficient in Vitamin A.  \\nthat is why you get ten fold of the deaths from like 0.2% to 2.75% or soch.At least you didn't single out malnutrition or hygiene, which which 'naturally' had. nothing to do with it.Ad they kept the schools open in the early part of the outbreak.","title":"Trump just appointed RFKjr to run HHS."},{"text":"When the bullshit is this prevalent it takes a lot to notice it anymore.","title":"Republicans promise to protect the Senate filibuster, even if it hinders Trump's agenda"},{"text":"The sad thing is Healthcare for all would be cheaper.","title":"Congratulations USA you are now 36 trillion dollars"},{"text":"Bro Elon already overstayed his welcome!","title":"Trump jokes he cant get Elon Musk out of Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"Everyone is Trumps orbit is temporary, they leave once they stop being useful or attempt to take some of the attention he think is his .

Took me a few times reading it, though that could just be because I've already read through and responded to over 30 of these and it's late, lol. Anyway, let me explain that part a little bit more:It is still about her bodily autonomy, simply because her body is the one that now has to undergo trauma for the sake of someone else. It's actually for this very reason that third trimester abortions for the life/health of the woman occur, because it's so much easier on the woman's body when the fetus is dead and you're performing a 3rd trimester abortion as opposed to a live birth. You can administer different medications, they are two different medical procedures, and the woman can even be put to sleep during the abortion (but not during a live birth). Now, if you're asking me about \\"what if she's completely healthy, and so are the pregnancy and baby?\\" then I'd say what any medical professional would, we can just deliver the baby early so that the woman doesn't have to agonize any more. If she says \\"no, I want to kill the baby instead,\\" then no doctor will perform that abortion for her. The only clinic in the US that even performs 3rd trimester abortions like these does so because the fetus has a fatal anomaly, such as the absence of a brain. And if you're asking \\"well what should the law be then?\\" There doesn't need to be a law, as any restriction on abortions also interferes with the medically necessary abortions. If the doctors turn her down, then she doesn't really have any other recourse except to wait for the baby to come out naturally. Otherwise she's putting her own life and health at risk.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"We gonna pretend Trump and the GOP aren't ardid fans of Putin, now?","title":"Donald Trump Tells House Republicans He Won't Seek a Third Term Unless They 'Figure' Out a Way to Allow It"},{"text":"Anti-Semitism is lack of support for Israel.

You can maintain objectivity and alienate fewer people with something like, \\"alleged voter fraud that evidence has shown would not have swung the election\\" with a link to another (opinion-free) article that runs through the evidence.This is the definition of neutrality bias.

Not outright bribes per se but, thanks to certain SCOTUS rulings about money in politics, it's basically mandatory to have things like pacs/super pacs to support a national level candidacy. That money largely comes from lobbyists, corporations, and the wealthy, all groups that benefit from the status quo that left wing political discourse believes that it is necessary to disrupt.They made a bet that these policies would peel away more Republicans from Trump than they'd lose from their own base and they lost that bet hard. You'd think they'd learn after Hillary, and Kerry before her, made the same gambit and lost their presidential runs for the same reasons.Ironically, the same forces that prevent the Dems from going \\"too far left\\" may help contain Trump to some degree, basically, he'll be able to do whatever he wants as long as it doesn't affect the bottom line of our oligarchs.Problem with that system is that the status quo is unsustainable, infinite financial growth in a finite world is a pipe dream. Everyone always hears about how well the economy is doing but the average person feels like they're just keeping their head above the water, too much of our supposedly amazing economy that both parties dote over only benefits the rich. And that is why our politics are so unstable, a lot of people have decided that if the left isn't going to save us from the system then they'd be just fine with having Trump tear it all down.Things like race, gender, and sexual orientation tend to get more air time from our representatives because they both motivate people to vote but ultimately don't affect the bottom line of the wealth class (of which every politician, CEO, and person on the TV is part of) whereas the class issues almost never get talked about even though 90% of the population feels the resulting problems in their daily lives and that is by design. In a nutshell, the reason why in American politics it always looks like disparate groups are engaged in multiple zero sum struggles with each other is because our ruling class/wealthy elites are actively manipulating the animousity of these groups to prevent them from uniting against the elites in a full on class struggle. Better they fight each other than us is the thinking behind this plan.Anyway, sorry for the trip to Narnia (honestly, even this is a gross oversimplification) but sometimes I feel like there's a lot of context to American politics that people from the outside looking in don't have.","title":"Jasmine Crockett Lays Bare The Stunning Hypocrisy Of Trump's Unqualified Picks"},{"text":"The bots preferences/filters have been changed to hate Alex Jones instead.","title":"Its funny how 90% of the trump hate is gone overnight"},{"text":"Even discounting the forbidden topic, Rowling was still pretty awful on slavery, minority metaphors, Eurocentrism, antisemitism, etc. and covered it with shallow and forgotten platitudes.

Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy is an excellent and much more mature fantasy novel series, with some serious philosophical content, if that's your bag.James, Snape and Dumbledore come to mind, but arguably all of them fail. We are never explained in depth who Dumbledore was and what his exact motivations were when he was younger. Snape is a bullied loner from an abusive household and him becoming a death-eater is completely understandable. Him becoming a simp for life and this somehow saving his soul (sounds like the ultimate female fantasy) because someone was nice to him, is not. James we don't even get to know, we just get told that he was one of the good guys despite of him being a sadistic bully because he was popular in the right social circles (do I see a pattern here?)Aside from explorations inside the Pensieve, the story is told through Harry's eyes (mostly) and mostly in the present day. I actually think this very much reflects something from real life, we rarely know much about the true nature and character of elder figures in our lives, like teachers, headmasters and parents. Our interactions with them are either extremely time limited, or context limited (we get speeches from headmasters, or lessons from teachers, with perhaps a personal tidbit here and there, but we don't get to know a great deal about their personal lives). The same goes for parents, any reflection of their lives we know is those that are told by the parents themselves, and is likely to be as positive as possible.","title":"CMV: Harry Potter depicts human nature poorly"},{"text":"She is, even by Democrat standards... a remarkably noxious and repulsive woman.

Do you think a parent should be allowed to simply allow a baby to starve to death?So, not quite. It's saying \\"even IF you consider the fetus a fully developed human person with all the viability and value and consciousness of every adult human or child, that STILL doesn't give you the right to force this woman to give up her own internal organs to them against her will, as we cannot force her to do that for anyone, even her own 1-year-old child.\\" To draw a distinction between what you are referring to and what I've outlined, you're talking about parental responsibility whereas I'm talking about bodily sovereignty. That is to say that walking across the room to give the baby milk (which isn't even forced because you can always put them up for adoption) is nowhere near the same as being forced to share your internal organs and body with them against your will, for nine months, putting your own life/health on the line in order to do so, and then very painfully giving birth at the end of this process. So what you've touched on is people's *general autonomy,* or the right to make any decision, period (which isn't allowed). Meanwhile, what I'm talking about is specifically people's right to *bodily autonomy,* which refers specifically to sovereignty over their own body/organs. That means she gets to decide whether she shares her internal organs with someone else, for how long, and to what extent she does so. Other people do not get to decide that for her.If personhood begins at conception, does tbat mean identitcal twins are only one person? No... because personhood doesnt begin at conception.This time frame accounts for 90% of all abortionsYou bring up some excellent arguments in terms of personhood that I had never considered before, so thank you for that! However, as you mentioned, this only accounts for 90% of abortions. It doesn't account for all of them, which bodily sovereignty does account for. Also, I'm willing to bet that pro-lifers would fervently combat your definition of personhood and argue that fetuses should have different protections established for them because they have the potential for personhood, as you mentioned. The pro-lifer is concerned with protecting the potential human person's life, just like how it would concern me if a pregnant woman drank heavily during her pregnancy and still planned on giving birth, *because she's knowingly causing harm to a future person.*Again, I would point to babies and neglect. Nobody thinks a mother should be able to throw a newborn in a dumpster. If a fetus is a person, there is an expectation of care.You're correct. But at the same time, nobody thinks a mother should be forced to share her internal organs and body with her newborn whose organs are failing either, if she says no for any reason. You could argue \\"well she's the one who brought them into this world so now she has a parental responsibility to give up her own organs to ensure that they live\\" but is that actually a parental responsibility? No, it isn't. There are actually specific laws in every state that prevent us from forcing a person to give up their own life/health/organs/body for the sake of someone else's, including their own child's.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"One of the things I love about Trump that you couldn't say for harris/biden, is that he's in NOBODY'S pocket.

It's obviously possible to have an induce preterm birth (after the baby passes the viability stage) but I'd be surprised if this was legally allowed without any medical necessity, in countries that have abortion limits.Unless you want to argue that killing the fetus should be allowed at any time up to the moment birth, you won't get around acknowledging that the personhood of the fetus/baby is a necessary part of the abortion debate.(I am pro-choice)","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Trump wont release that list because hes on it ?? he was president when epstein was killed in jail.

We can see this by recognizing that 1) Once restrictions of any kind are placed on abortion, we lose our ability to track abortions with complete accuracy because suddenly many abortions move underground. And 2) that countries with abortion bans have some of the highest rates of abortion in the world, and those are just the abortions we can track due to clandestine clinics and underground organizations providing the pill and abortions to women in these countries (as well as online forums where women can talk about their abortions anonymously in these countries). So even though many of the abortions in these countries are unaccounted for, the ones that are accounted for already far surpass many pro-choice countries. That already speaks volumes, but then you consider why that might be and it makes a lot of sense:\\\\-A woman finds out she's pregnant unexpectedly\\\\-Normally, she would consult her friends, possibly family, possibly boyfriend, maybe even Planned Parenthood, a healthcare professional, or a pregnancy center to seek support, resources, options, and to not feel so cornered and trapped.\\\\-This particular woman lives in a country that recently banned abortion, however, so she can no longer confide in anyone for fear that they might report her to the authorities and then she won't have a choice. Right now, she does have a choice.\\\\-The woman chooses not to tell anyone she's pregnant and realizes her position: she's entirely alone and forced into silence and secrecy. So now she feels like she has no support, no one to talk to, no resources, no options. It's either 1) Be forced to give birth, or 2) Have an abortion in secret.\\\\-We know that when put in this position, the vast majority of women choose to have an underground abortion. That's what the forums in abortion ban countries like Madagascar say, that's what studies lead us to believe, and that's what naturally follows when a woman feels like she has no other options or support.So with respect, I don't think this really is \\"getting into the philosophical weeds\\". We already know that any restrictions whatsoever on abortion are both impractical, counter-intuitive, and harmful. So it really does become a question of bodily sovereignty and the state's right to override that.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"the real reason I'm here is always the comments","title":"John Fetterman - Trump's cabinet picks are \\"'God-tier Level Trolling\\""},{"text":"The key word in that quote is expendable.","title":"Jasmine Crockett Lays Bare The Stunning Hypocrisy Of Trump's Unqualified Picks"},{"text":"I dont think Trump gives AF about the Nobel Peace prize.","title":"Nobel Prize - Trump"},{"text":"Well its a political sub thats their point, hopefully the rest of the subs goes back to normal again.\\nMost people will go back to survival mode and try to deal with the consequences of the election, no point complaining now, cant stop whats coming anyway.","title":"Its funny how 90% of the trump hate is gone overnight"},{"text":"Meanwhile I'm just estimating the damage that's gonna be done so I know, very roughly, how much I'm gonna have to suffer through. \\nNot even mad about it. \\nIf Redcaps and Non-Voters want to suffer in new and surprising ways then who am I to tell them no?","title":"Trump is trying to outrage Washington with his controversial Cabinet picks"},{"text":"Anything he does is better than anything Harris would do.

I can pluck a blade of grass from the ground just for shits and giggles and people wont think of me as a murderer. And the reason is because the value of grasss life is extremely small.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"1. The problem here is that the news that they try to portray as \\"straight\\" is filled with heavily biased framing. For example a mainstream news outlet might say something about how Kamala Harris supports \\"reproductive rights\\" or \\"women's access to healthcare\\", ignoring the fact that this is not what the abortion debate is about. This would be the equivalent of saying Kamala Harris supports murdering children. It presupposes a conclusion to the philosophical argument which is the actual crux of the debate. In a similar, but more subtle fashion, they will often just direct quote a politician or public figure, but when that person frames something from a right-wing perspective, they will often \\"add context\\" by inserting a line about the alternative perspective . On the other hand, when something is framed from a left-wing perspective, like the one I mentioned above, there is rarely any alternative shown.2. If you truly believe that your side is objectively in the right, then you should be able to present both sides of an argument in good faith and walk the reader logically to that conclusion. Not doing this is objectively bad for you. When a neutral/uninformed party reads your news article, which claims to be neutral and objective, but then finds out that it was framed in a misleading way or misrepresented the opposing argument, you lose a lot of credibility in their eyes, even if your side turns out to be right. Similarly, you should ideally want people from the opposing side to read your neutral and objective article, and framing it in such a way that presupposes their currently held beliefs as wrong is likely to immediately alienate them, and send them to a source that reinforces their beliefs. For example, if you want to actually convince people that believe the 2020 election was stolen by voter fraud, it will do you know good to refer to them as \\"voter fraud conspiracy theories\\". The buzzwords do nothing but gain you some extra applause from your existing audience. You can maintain objectivity and alienate fewer people with something like, \\"alleged voter fraud that evidence has shown would not have swung the election\\" with a link to another (opinion-free) article that runs through the evidence. The issue is that these publications simply cannot help themselves from inserting some sort of framing device or opinion into nearly every article.3. It is finally starting to die out, but they are for now, definitely still the mainstream. They are the outlets that everyone else refers back to. Among people over 30, they are viewed as the most credible. They have the most funding. They are what you will see at the airport, in the newspaper, in your google feed and searches, on the YouTube front page, in your windows task bar. Basically anywhere that you're getting news without explicitly searching for something alternative, you are getting legacy media.4.The user base of certain platforms is not what makes the platform itself biased. Twitter used to be very left-wing biased. After Elon bought it, it is mostly unbiased and basically allows anything that is legal. If liberals choose to cede that ground on that platform because they don't want to have to actually defend their viewpoints and convince people, that is on them. Youtube, while it allows some diversity in its content, still has a prety left-leaning bias. It participates in shadow-banning of right wing ideas, and it specifically chooses to promote left-wing news sources more prominently, even to people with no interest in them, while right wing news sources are generally only shown to people who actively seek it out.  Again, if you actually believe your side to be objectively in the right, then you should be able to convince the majority of the population without resorting to any censorship, or hiding of opposing viewpoints. 5. Media is a reflection of culture and what people find entertaining. A movie having gender roles, norms, and status quo isn't \\"propaganda\\". It's just a normal movie meant to appeal to normal people. Status quo is just that. It's the baseline, starting off point. Not every piece of media is a political statement. If you think otherwise, and that status quo is propaganda for the opposition, you are the very definition of a radical. Most movies are just meant to entertain people. The things you listed are nonpolitical and gain more viewership and sales. The left wing movies insert preachy political topics that very few actual customers want, and results in fewer viewers and sales, and are included to push a political message, not to make a better movie. Also, conservative workers/actors in Hollywood are at real risk of being ostracized/blacklisted/fired for their political beliefs. This simply isn't the case with liberals. I do agree with you, though, on the glorification of war/torture/police brutality in war/crime movies.

Trump might have been turned into a Russian asset long before that. Remember where  the beautiful Melania comes from.Perhaps it is not exactly like my guesses. But that \\"the dictator's checklist\\" have been followed is obvious. - And no upcoming dictator has had so much help as Trump has had with Fox News. It has been a virtual brain washing machine for many years now.For years now we have seen all non-Maga people \\"worry\\" every time something new happened. But they have always taken every new thing as a singular \\"something\\" and not as another baby step towards the final goal. The pattern was not seen or taken seriously. Even now we see Democrats staring to rearrange the deck chairs after the bump when Titanic hit the iceberg. - They simply don't get what has happened. They don't get that this is the culmination of someting Putin has worked on for 20 years.I think that Putin simply struck gold when Trump was \\"activated\\" or became available and gave Putin's plan a big push forward.The election was not close. Remember that about 80 million possible voters did not vote. So there are really 160 million American voters who were willing to accept that Donald Trump might become president. And only 80 million who were not.So the vast majority of American voters are so stupid/ignorant/indifferent that even if they ever realize the disaster then it will be too late to do anything about it. Democracy will be gone in the USA. Like in Russia and China and the other dictatorships. And I don't think that the indifferent voters suddenly will rise and start a revolution. So I guess that the already existing fear will increase and increase so nobody really dare to try to do anything. The Maga crowd will be the local \\"enforcers\\" at community levels.When I saw and heard Joe Biden promise a peaceful transfer of power it was very sad. He was basically handing the key to the Emperor's Palace and promise to do it \\"peacefully\\". It was like seeing Chamberlain going to Germany in 1938 to talk sense and cooperation with Hitler. - Trump must have laughed inside, just like Putin must have.","title":"What Could a MAGA Government Accomplish?"},{"text":"The values are hardly all that important.

Most people believe that parents have obligations to their children that go beyond the obligations they might have to anyone else. And legally, this is true from the point of birth. But pro-lifers typically see that ethical relationship beginning prior to that, and using someone elses body as a callous characterisation of pregnancy. To win the body autonomy argument against them is effectively to argue that women have a right to kill their children at their own convenience. Youre talking right past them, and not actually engaging the root of their beliefs at all. This actually galvanises them against you, because they feel like theyre not being listened to.So to someone with that mindset, if youre interested in actually persuading anyone, I believe the most effective argument is illustrating the ways in which a fetus is *not* the same as a baby. Give them a biology class. Talk about brain activity, sentience, and how for quite a large part of a pregnancy a fetus displays very few characteristics of what makes a baby a baby. Abortion used to be argued much more commonly along these lines, though the pro-choice camp has mostly left that goalpost unguarded (I suspect because its not very effective at defending third trimester abortions)Your own rebuttal to this argument in your post defaults to your premise about body autonomy, which again, does not engage with the most persuadable voters typical rationale for opposing abortion.Of course there are some people out there who are motivated more by misogyny (holding immoral women accountable for their promiscuity) or fundamentalist religion (god imbues a baby with their soul at conception and to intervene is a heinous sin). I think youd agree these people are beyond convincing, at least within the scope of this particular debate. But if, as you say, youre interested in persuading the others, I would argue its best not to directly contradict their beliefs about a parents obligations to their child. Instead, argue that whats being killed isnt really a child at all.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Its obvious how he'll define antisemitism, and every \\"free Palestine\\" protest will count as antisemitism.

The sole reason isn't because they're less valuable than us, that's just a factor in the decision-making process, a factor which again detracts from the main issue when we're discussing abortion, which is a woman's authority over her own organs/body. Like, let's say that the fetus is a fully valuable person with consciousness--so what? I'm also a fully valuable person with consciousness--does that suddenly give me the right to use someone else's organs if I need them to keep myself alive for 9 months while my own organs are rehabilitated during that time? No, it doesn't give me that right.

There may be a gray area between what is considered medical and what isnt, in a legal sense. As a consequence, youd have doctors refusing to perform abortions that may in reality be medically necessary because they dont want to lose their license or end up in jail. So ultimately, youre left to choose between a world where more medically necessary abortions are not actually performed, but the small number of non-medical late term abortions goes downversus a world where the medically necessary ones are more freely accessible but the late term non-medical abortions dont  necessarily decrease. I think its probably extremely rare that any woman wants a non medically necessary abortion that late in a pregnancy anyway, and I think its far, far worse to deny care to women for whom giving birth would put them at risk of health complications, so I think were better off not banning them.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Gabbard is horrible, but at the same time I do think the US can survive some intel leak.

So doctors are having to call courthouses and lawmakers' offices 24/7 to ask \\"is this medically necessary by your standards? Can I perform this abortion free of penalty?\\" And obviously lawmakers' offices cannot answer all of these phone calls every single day, and doctors are having to wait way too long to hear back from them.

That's it.  If the baby is viable, remove it and move on.  Otherwise, the mother has the choice. I have a friend who had breast cancer.  She has a son.  Her son was 3-4 years older than my kids.  She got cancer when he was about 5-7, and she eventually beat it when he was about 10.  She actually beat it.  His entire memory of his mother was basically her having cancer.  That's a rough childhood. She can't be on hormonal birth control because that increases the risk of her cancer returning.  She was happy that she was cancer free, and she celebrated with her partner.  She was supposed to not get pregnant ever again, but since she was pretty young and doctors think it's appropriate to tell her not to get her tubes tied, she couldn't get her tubes tied.  Her birth control failed and she was pregnant.What should happen now?I can see why some people would want to go through with it, but I think that's stupid.  She would likely have the cancer return.  The fetus would die.  She would die.  The boy would lose his mother.  The baby's father loses a partner helping him raise his son.All of those people get a say but ultimately, the decision is the mother's. I think it's more important to avoid terrible situations where a woman has to jump through hoops to get the healthcare she needs than anything else.  I think deciding when a fetus is a baby is a religious decision.  I think deciding when a fetus is a viable baby is a doctor's decision, but when that baby is taken out, nature will be the judge of that.I support choice because of the miscarriage problem.I've known a few women who have had miscarriages.  It's awful.  It's dangerous too.  A miscarriage could mean your body can't get rid of all the material and your body goes septic.  I'm sure you've seen headlines of women who need to be at death's door before they get care.But that's not the point.  In other places where abortion is illegal, women who miscarry could be hit with murder charges because someone thinks she tried to abort.  These trials are nothing but character assassinations.  Marginalized women are simply punished. Even in places where abortion is legal, women still get punished for miscarriages.  It's often a homeless woman who dumps the corpse somewhere and then she is accused of killing the baby.  No one protects her.  No one speaks for her. I think this is horrible.  One of my friends still mourns on the day she was supposed to give birth. To think that she would have to stand trial for murder is horrendous. I think it's cruel to take a couple who just experienced tragedy to now face a lengthy prison sentence. They can't prove their innocence.  They just hope the jury buys the story. One of my friends was having twins.  One of them died.  It was early enough that they could have aborted.  Her body didn't expel the material.  There was a chance she could go septic.  What should she do? She chose to roll the dice.  She was lucky.  Her body absorbed the material and she eventually gave birth to a single baby.That's her choice to choose the level of risk she is willing to accept.It's for reasons like this that I'm pro choice.I think limiting the choice of women is subjecting too many to cruel and unusual punishment.  I think determining the line of when something is a life is a religious discussion.  The state draws the line at birth, so that's where I draw it also.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Seems blasphemous imo.","title":"Walters mandates schools show video inviting students to pray for Trump"},{"text":"Well I dont work at all, dont need to.

Charges that racism propelled voters to Donald Trump are at odds with the rightward swing among Black and Hispanic voters, and with a raft of data showing that racial prejudice is in steady decline among Americans of all political stripes.\\nInstead, the data shows Democrats taking a sharp turn leftward on social issues over the past decade. This has distanced them from the median voter, just as Wrights cartoon depicted.

This is also a terrible pro-choice argument because it once again undermines the womans authority over her own body and organs. Who cares if the fetus is a viable person or not? Its still using HER organs to keep itself alive, so she gets the final say on whether or not she wants to continue providing her body in this way\\nThis directly ties into the bodily autonomy argument. If your whole argument is that a woman should be able to kill the fetus up until the point of birth because it's inside her and relying on her, even though past the point of viability it could be outside her and not relying on her, and it could still completely survive, that's no longer about her autonomy.?\\nYou might argue that it's her autonomy and her choice if she wants to go through birth or a C section vs killing the baby to remove it, but that ties back into the personhood argument. If you view the fetus as a person and hold some level of regard for their life, you wouldn't say it's okay to kill it when there are other options to remove it where both the fetus and mother can live. Not to mention that the point of viability is far along into the pregnancy, where there is a real chance to have an abortion before that if someone wants one. So you are essentially taking the side that the fetus is not a person if you think it's fine to kill it even when it can survive on its own? outside the womb. (Obviously when I say \\"on its own\\" someone would still have to care for it, but that doesn't have to be the mother so not the point).","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"IFNO: did you cross-post this to r/NotTheOnion?","title":"Walters mandates schools show video inviting students to pray for Trump"},{"text":"And Bidens was a bunch of dei hires...

We see others do it, we do it ourselves (often times being too late to stop ourselves until we do some self reflection), etc.You can see Dumbledore is wrong as a reader, but *he cant* and makes decisions that are flawed and imperfect, same with Snape.

Her organs/body are the ones being used, so she gets to decide how long she wants to give up her own body/organs for this other person to use, and to what extent (to what level of risk) she is willing to go. This applies to any and all people and situations, not just fetuses, and not just pregnancy. I'm pro-choice and think this is a terrible argument. It cedes to the other side that a fetus is a living human before the argument begins. Do you think a parent should be allowed to simply allow a baby to starve to death? No. If a fetus is a human child, our society has an expectation that the parent care for or that child. We have a crime for it. It's called neglect. PersonhoodThis is the only one you need. A fetus is not a person. It's a collection of tissue with the potential to become a person. An embryo can be reabsorbed back into the mother until the 11th week. Along that same time frame the embryo can split into identitical twins. If personhood begins at conception, does tbat mean identitcal twins are only one person? No... because personhood doesnt begin at conception.This time frame accounts for 90% of all abortionsLikewise, the issue with personhood is human rights and our legal system. Our legal system isn't equipment to handle fetal personhood. Let's say personhood then started at 11 weeks. If a woman has a miscarriage, should their be a full investigation? That's 1-2 million new investigations per year and absurd amounts of anguish and trauma for grieving families who just lost their pregnancy and are now murder suspects. Also, are we now issuing birth certificates at conception or 11 weeks? That's the basis of legal personhood for most official government business. Viability: The fetus can be killed all the way until it is viable. This is also a terrible pro-choice argument because it once again undermines the womans authority over her own body and organs. Who cares if the fetus is a viable person or not? Its still using HER organs to keep itself alive, so she gets the final say on whether or not she wants to continue providing her body in this way.Again, I would point to babies and neglect. Nobody thinks a mother should be able to throw a newborn in a dumpster. If a fetus is a person, there is an expectation of care.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"I supported Jill Stein in both 2016 and 2024.

It is the only consideration we take into determining the life of a human being. You are attacking a strawman argument of consciousness. For starters, the argument is the ability to deploy a consciousness. This is why you can't morally kill someone in their sleep, because they have the ability to deploy their consciousness when they wake up. You also bring up the issue of people going into indefinite unconsciousness via comas, but are you forgetting we pull the plug on people who have been in comas for years? If someone is braindead and kept only alive by machines, are they really alive? People take consciousness into consideration when it comes to ending a life, so if you take consciousness into consideration at the end of a life, you must take it into consideration at the beginning of life. Secondly, not being able to remember events from your childhood doesn't mean you weren't conscious. If you believe it's not morally right to kill a child just because they can't really use their consciousness, I don't know why you felt the need to bring it up. If you wouldn't kill an 1 month old baby, why is your position justified to terminate a 9 month pregnancy? (Not saying people do this, it's a moral litmus test). Animals do not get the same level of consideration as humans, and I don't know why you think arguing for the consideration of human consciousness means you have to value animals the same. Would you kill a human? Probably not. Would you step on a bug? Probably. It's logically sound and is not hypocritical in any way so approaching the argument in that way doesn't make any sense. Logically speaking, if consciousness is the way to determine a human life worth keeping, you must approach a human's birth in the same way. If you are not, you are fighting on different moral grounds for the same thing, making your position weak.Your position of bodily autonomy also poises a really big issue. Do you think it's okay to terminate a 9 month pregnancy? If you think it is, you are never going to convince any pro-life person of anything. If you don't think it is, then by what grounds from your argument (excluding viability since that's what you wanted to do) makes it wrong to do so?","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"?Slavery was legal in all 13 colonies prior to the revolution.Vermont cemented into abolition law in 1778, 87 fucking years before the ratification of the 13th Ad,Again if the fed gov had the power to interfere with slavery from the beginning slavery would have been abolished a half century earlier and without the civil war.Why did the south fight so hard during the convention to ensure the fed gov couldnt interfere with slavery??Long before the nation average which is full of millions of cunts, gradually sees the light.The national majority had already seen the light decades prior but couldnt do anything because of states rights?If we didn't have states rights Crow and slavery would have been federally mandated.And then would have been overturned decades earlier.. again laws are not eternal they can be changed ?LMAO","title":"CMV: The Roosevelts are incredibly overrated Presidents"},{"text":"Defund the Marines- we have Army Special\\nForces , dont need navy special forces too","title":"Ramaswamy wants to defund unauthorized government programs - like veteran healthcare"},{"text":"They still can. 14th amendment section 3.

Ultimately, as we all have different axioms that we base our beliefs off of, some of those arguments are going to \\"pop\\" for any given person and others are going to look very silly.A lot of pro-lifers base their beliefs off religious values, so in that sense, all arguments for pro-choice that don't specifically relate to the religious history of abortion probably aren't going to be very convincing to them! But somehow, I doubt an argument related to that would be very compelling to you if you don't share that particular axiom. So I think that is important to consider when evaluating arguments that aren't compelling to you personally, that people are approaching the problem here in a radically different way than you are. The logic of a position may be less important compared to how well it coheres with their understanding of the world and sources of authority they find within it for instance. A compelling argument on abortion to a religious person might be referencing the part in the bible that talks about the consequences if a man gets in a fight with another man and accidentally hits a woman, terminating their pregnancy (Exodus 21:22-25), which indicates that the life of the fetus is not the same as the life of the woman pretty clearly!

I have been watching this insanity unfold in the US for 8 years and I've been proven right about Trump every step of the way. If elected, he would ultimately destroy America. First up was Covid and the havoc it wreaked on America was not by chance. He lied, obfuscated and completely abdicated his duties as president, before, during and after the virus spread. As a result, Americans died at the highest rate in a century. That was the first shoe to drop and the first major event that vindicated my fears for the fate of this country under a Trump presidency. .Then the unthinkable happened. American's reelected this sick and deranged animal to a 2nd term. They chose the man that botched Covid over the party that actually engineered our recovery from it. By all metrics we had the strongest economic recovery in the world from Covid 19. I'm not going to sit here and hash out Democrat vs. Republican either because you have to be an insane person to think that's an appropriate conversation when option B is Donald F'ing Trump. Without hyperbole, American's from all generation's (Gen Z will save us? LMFAO), elected a Hitler clone pedaling the same fake populist message about the enemy within, but this time without the benefit of an actual depression to point to. What's your excuse America? It turns out we are just a shockingly ignorant, greedy, hateful and misinformed society. We had one chance as a country to choose the better path forward and we refused.  Instead we made the devastating decision to embrace a known felon, rapist, cheater, liar, abuser, turncoat, fascist, the list goes on and on and on...So this is what we are now. It wasn't an aberration or a fluke. Donald Trump represents 21st century America and we're going wherever he decides to take us.  And as someone who was desperate for Americans to wake up before it was too late, only to see them make a conscious decision to reelect Donald and effectively make him a king , I am praying that the chaos and destruction that is on the horizon does not spare a single Trump supporter. I truly hope they get to experience firsthand the effect of the choice they made on 11/5. That's what I'll be rooting for moving forward. That you all get exactly what you voted for in some form or another over the next 4 years. You truly, truly deserve it.","title":"Why did American voters seem to believe Donald Trump more than Kamala Harris? \\"He validates their angers and their fears.\\""},{"text":"Adin Ross","title":"RFK Jr condemned as clear and present danger after Trump nomination"},{"text":"wokeness in military might be holding people responsible for sexual assault and other abuses in the ranks instead of treating it as a job perk.","title":"Trumps Defense Secretary Pick Pete Hegseth Faced Previous Sexual Misconduct Allegation in 2017"},{"text":"Thats a good point about CHEA, but what about the threat to remove federal funding?","title":"Trump to universities: Stamp out antisemitism or lose accreditation"},{"text":"I love this!

And thus they have the ability to shape the general perception of reality for a lot of people. Even if those people aren't actively tuning in to CNN every night or something, when they Google a topic and see several results from mainstream sources they will assume that must be true, or they may watch an online clip from a show on one of these networks and assume it's just saying what is true.Thus, the fact that the most popular podcasts are more right-leaning or that Twitter is right-leaning by default doesn't invalidate the influence of the Mainstream Media. These sources are the alternative media, and are popular in part because they offer interesting and satisfying alternative perspectives and narratives to the official one. But many people don't listen to or watch these podcasts and still generally believe the mainstream narratives. And so in that sense it is still \\"Mainstream\\" even if it is less so than it used to be.Now, u could reasonably ask whether, as u mentioned, these Mainstream Media outlets are actually just reporting the truth in a minimally biased way, but since \\"facts have liberal bias\\" it is perceived as Left leaning. Frankly, this is ridiculous though. Idk that the proper term is truly liberal/ left-leaning, but rather the Mainstream Media is clearly and often pushing narratives on behalf of the D.C. establishment, and often for the Democratic Party specifically. For example, it was clear to pretty much everyone that Biden was mentally declining over the past few years and was not fit to be president for another 4 years (nothing to be ashamed of really). But the Mainstream Media covered it up and insisted he was \\"sharp as a tack\\" and was very coherent behind closed doors and so forth. Then immediately upon seeing his poor debate performance the narrative shifted to him being unfit. A true unbiased media would have been reporting on his mental decline throughout in an honest manner. Also, do you not think it's a bit ridiculous to stake a general claim on the prideful presumption that the Mainstream Liberal worldview is just factually correct? There's a 0% chance that all of the facts would always support the liberal point of view- political issues are far too complex for that. The fact that Trump gets something like 95% + negative coverage on these media outlets while Biden/Kamala got like 90% positive coverage really can't logically be explained by just objective factual reporting. Sure Trump is plausibly wrong on some things and if it was more like a 60/40 split for Biden/Kamala then I think u could argue that it was unbiased, but a 90/10 split is ridiculous. Additionally, there are many instances where the truth is actually hard to discern. In these cases, there often emerges a mainstream narrative that may or may not be true but is assumed to be true by those who trust the Mainstream Media. For example, for many months the Mainstream Media (and Fauci) vehemently denied the possibility of Covid-19 coming from the lab in Wuhan, and even called people racist for suggesting it. However, they were clearly in the wrong to ignore the possibility, and now it is accepted as truth. Many podcasts discussed this topic and said that the lab leak theory was plausible, but if those trusting the Mainstream Media were shown that at the time they would have (and have) said things like \\"There's no evidence for that\\" or \\"That's ridiculous\\". If u pointed out that the media was biased for dismissing it they would have likely said that the \\"facts have a liberal bias\\" or something like that. And yet the media was wrong and was clearly biased. So I think it is clear that the Mainstream Media still has influence on many people and often takes positions that are biased.","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"They cant close it down.

Not on a per capita basis or when controlling for X or Y factors but in aggregate. \\nThis simply isn't true more white people are killed in police interactions than black people by a fairly large margin.A graph showing the data provided belowhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1124036/number-people-killed-police-ethnicity-us/The reason many people don't realize this is because \\"cop shoots black man\\" is far more likely to get a news segment or 20 than \\"cop shoots white man\\" does.

There are horror stories of highly qualified immigrants who lived here for years and still dont know if they can stay and bureaucrats make them a very hard time, which is a shame because qualified immigration is crucial to our future. This will be different if youre able to get citizenship, but you can also live here for a while without citizenship. What I also read a lot is that especially people from the US have a hard time getting used to that introverted culture.As far as I can tell there isnt a high demand of architects, but that doesnt mean its impossible. Theres still a high demand on qualified people working in IT. Just be aware that Germany is nowhere near where the US is when it comes to AI. We pretty much missed that opportunity.

But in general theres the corporate or mainstream media and it is liberal in the general sense of the term of the liberal ideal of free-press.Then there is partisan media which the cable and TV news and therefore press had become increasingly dominant. This is economic and structural and political - media deregulation creating news not just as a mandated thing for the networks but as a source of profit and investment. Structural - profit seeking means finding your market for news that means you can market yourself as confirmation bias or rage-bait and use political outrage and partisanship as ways to keep a market share. It also means that cheap profitable news stays when budgets are reduced but long non-profitable investigation for prestige is less economically valuable. Political - obviously money interests and political factions have an interest in influencing specific demographics and voting blocks. The media and the political establishment become intwined to the point that you have rich people Trump who just gets to move in media and political circles as if they are all one party, you have politicians at news org or married to people at new orgs etc. Its a big pile of inbreeding and they are all out of touch! (Which is how Trumps rhetoric resonates despite him being one of the ugliest toads in the swamp.)So imo the legacy right wing media is more just an offshoot than anything else. But the radio and internet stuff is more interesting to me. All the cheaper unregulated spaces like radio and internet have brought us back to a yellow-journalism era where everything is partisan and backed by one or another robber Barron to push their views and interests.","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"So rare to find such a post.

But sometimes people do self-destructive things. Contrary to the Freudian view of innate self-destructive tendencies, there is scant evidence that normal people ever seek harm or failure for themselves. They do however make self-destructive trade-offs, typically seeking a positive immediate reward that happens to come with a serious but delayed cost. Another pathway into self-defeat is that faulty knowledge about self and world causes people to pursue good outcomes in ways that backfire and thwart their efforts. Self-defeating actions occur in connection with threats to reputation, emotional distress, and failures of self-control.

They rejected the Church of England and repeatedly rebuked the idea of a national religion or churchThere is substantial evidence and documentation that points to these facts.For Christ's sake, and quite literally, even Jesus believed in the separation of church and state Mark 12:17, Jesus said to them, *\\"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\\"*Our founding fathers also staunchly opposed any union between religion and government.In fact, some of them were devout deists, believing that rationality and reason should govern our society, not religion.Thomas Jefferson coined the phrase \\"*a wall of separation between church and state\\"* in his letter to the Danbury Baptist association. Thomas Jefferson's metaphor became part of constitutional jurisprudence. Jefferson was quoted by Chief Justice Morrison in Reynolds v. United States in 1878 and his writings on the separation of church and state have been referenced in a series of important legal cases throughout our history.Roger Williams, an early puritan minister, founder of the state of Rhode Island and the first Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for *\\"a wall or hedge of separation\\"* between *\\"the wilderness of the world\\"* and *\\"the garden of the church.\\"*There you have it, an early American statesman and minister, and a profound authority on the matter, acknowledging the need for this separation. James Madison interpreted Martin Luther's \\"doctrine of two kingdoms\\", as a conception of the separation of church and state.During a debate in the House of Representatives, Madison also contended *\\"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\\"*In his writings years later he documented his support for the *\\"total separation of the church from the state.\\"**\\"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States\\",* Madison wrote, and he declared, *\\"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution...\\"*John Locke also promoted this idea. In his, \\"A Letter Concerning Toleration,\\" Locke argued that, *\\"ecclesiastical authority must be separated from the authority of the state, or 'the magistrate'\\"*Even George Washington supported this separation.George Washington, who wrote to a group of clergy who protested in 1789 against a lack of mention of Jesus Christ in the Constitution, stated *You will permit me to observe that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction.*That same year, he wrote to the Baptists of Virginia, *If I could conceive that the general [federal] government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure  no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.\\"*John F. Kennedy, in his Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association in 1960, stated, *\\"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute\\"*Furthermore, *\\"One Nation under God\\"* wasn't even added to the pledge of allegiance until the 1950s, when there was a moral panic and fundamentalist revival that unfairly persecuted anyone who was assumed to be gay, communist, atheist, or anything but a god fearing, red, white, and blue bleeding Christian \\"patriot\\" for that matter.The pledge of allegiance was first published in 1892 in an Issue of the *Youth's Companion*, an American Children's Magazine.Francis Bellamy a Christian SOCIALIST, who *\\"championed 'the rights of working people and the equal distribution of economic resources, which he believed was inherent in the teachings of Jesus.\\"* worked for the magazine and drafted the \\"Pledge of Allegiance\\" as part of a marketing campaign to solicit subscriptions and sell U.S. flags to public schools.The issue coincided with the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus reaching the Americas, a marketing gimmick. Bellamy *\\"believed in the absolute separation of church and state\\"* and purposefully did not include the phrase *\\"under God\\"* in his pledge.What's more, Bellamy *\\"viewed his Pledge as an 'inoculation' that would protect immigrants and native-born but insufficiently patriotic Americans from the 'virus' of radicalism and subversion.\\"*Additionally, *\\"In God we trust\\"* wasn't officially adopted and mandated for our currency until the mid-20th century, as part of an effort to distinguish the U.S. from the big bad atheist communists of the Soviet Union.The fact of the matter is, Christian nationalism has never been and never will be a foundational code for this country, its government or its laws. It was the biblical literalists in the south who vocally defended slavery and inflamed the sectional conflict. A time when our nation was divided more than it's ever been.It *is* self evident, that in the United States of America, religion has no place in government, and vice versa.","title":"Oklahoma Superintendent Mandates Schools Show Students a Video Inviting Students to Pray for Trump: Oklahoma also ranks 49th out of 50 states in 2024 for low test scores and graduation rates.

Populism and \\"Drain the swamp\\" my ass. Trump's next admin is going to be even swampier than the last. This is not just going to end up being a huge conflict of interest, but an effort at plain old corruption. Elon Musk has been called an extremely difficult person to work with and ego maniac by former colleagues.His companies benefit from billions in federal funding while he whines incessantly about government waste.He bought an overvalued social media platform, fired thousands of workers, especially those that disagreed with him, which also ended up causing a number of issues for the platform. Not to mention, since Musk's takeover of Twitter, the platform's value has plummeted. Elon has turned it into his own personal soapbox and megaphone for any right wing lunatics willing to pay for the privilege, and he's altered the algorithms to direct traffic to him and everyone who lionizes him. He also decided to rename Twitter his favorite letter of the alphabet ffs, and now it's plagued with bots and porn, and right wing propaganda, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, foreign disinformation campaigns, hate and clickbait reach more users and receive higher engagement than anything resembling the truth.He's used his wealth, power and privilege to not only interfere in the election, but buy his way into Trump's cabinet, and into a made up position mind you.His companies have benefited tremendously from being subsidized and having access to government technology, while this has also allowed his privileged and rich ass to benefit from failing over and over again until he makes it. A privilege that we poor fucking schmoes don't have.Musk has suggested that the US should create a technocratic government with positions only reserved for \\"high status males.\\"This is what those political analysts meant when they said that a second Trump administration would bring about a crisis of incompetence at every level of government.But let me get this straight, *this* is who you choose to run your new made up and insufferably named \\"DOGE\\"Department of government efficiency?What am I thinking? Of course you did. A major goal of the MAGA coalition is to cleanse government agencies of anyone who's not on board with the agenda, fill the remaining roles with loyalists, put whatever agencies are left under the direct control of the executive, building a one party system and state that prioritizes the interests of the rich, the plutocrats, the MAGA oligarchs, the right wing power brokers and corporatists, think tanks and dark money groups.
