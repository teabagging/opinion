If you invite them, they have the right to show up, regardless of who they voted for.Second, your fiance should be able to invite who they want, just as you should be able to invite who you want.

Generally, it helps to weigh the relative benefits and downsides. It seems like causing a massive rift in his family that will cause him stress and sadness and conflict for decades is a MUCH bigger downside than you having to stomach some guests at your ceremony that you don't want there. Just invite them and ignore them. Lastly, it sounds like this is a much bigger issue that you and your fiance need to work out before you get married. The ceremony is one day - what about all the others? Are you going to refuse to go to Thanksgiving at his mom's house because some trump voters are going to be there too? What about his cousins wedding? His mom and dad's 30th anniversary party? His dad's 60th birthday? His dad's funeral? His nephews 1st birthday? When you marry someone, there is a lifetime of family events and gatherings. What are you going to do for all of those? Are you two going to fight each time? What about all of your events - only inviting half of his family for all of those too? Is this about your ceremony, or are you really asking your fiance to cut off that chunk of his family forever? That is a really big deal and a lot to ask of your fiance? This is the type of stuff that causes deep resentment between two people.

Maybe because true economic populism is bad for our high-income base, he added.In the wake of the 2024 elections, Democrats from different parts of the party have gone after each other for what they think sunk their chances at the polls, as they lost the Senate, the presidency and possibly the House. Those further to the left have said Democrats didnt go far enough in their direction to excite the partys base, while centrists have said the party went too far left and frightened moderate voters.Real economic populism should be our tentpole, Murphy said on X. But heres the thing C then you need to let people into the tent who arent 100% on board with us on every social and cultural issue, or issues like guns or climate.Sanders argued Wednesday that Democrats have mostly ignored working-class priorities, saying that ignorance was a major factor in costing them the White House and Senate in the recent elections.","title":"Senator Chris Murphy on Democrats losses: Our tent is too small"},{"text":"Identity politics had nothing to do with it.

And somehow the conversation turned and she said \\"At least people like Kim Davis are around. You know. People who stand up for what they believe in.\\" I was kind of gobsmacked for a second and then said, \\"Well, my boyfriend would probably disagree with you...\\" She got really awkward and said she didn't realize, didn't mean it that way, something like that.

She is the only coworker I had that got me a card for my wedding. My point is, your extended family might not be these hateful people you're imagining. People are complicated and contradictory and hypocritical and multifaceted. Coming to your wedding might be an opportunity to show them that you're just a regular person with a regular wedding, doing a regular thing like getting married. It might open their eyes and give them an experience they need. It's not your duty to \\"educate\\" others, but maybe it would be better and healthier in the long run for you.

First is the older 80 year old person. They grew up with a family love of Roosevelt and his presidency and expounded on that with their love of Kennedy.  They watch the evening news every night.  They believe everything it tells them.  \\nThe next set is the hippies of the late 60s early 70s. The hippies believed in living a rebellious lifestyle, sex with anyone and everyone, drugs, protesting etc.  This group grew up and decided to go into politics. They became the leaders of the Democratic Party. These individuals had children and taught them their immoral ways. \\nThey want legislation passed to put in place every type of immoral thing imaginable.  Drugs, sexual immorality, etc. Around the 1980s some of the older democrats figured this out and changed. They changed party. Abortion caused many of them to change party. This caused many Christians to rally around the Republican Party. They became known as the moral majority.  Move to modern times and we now have both parties congressional leaders becoming corrupt making far more money while in office than the money they make from the congressional salary. Enter Donald Trump he saw this corruption and decided to clean the swamp. Both sides became threatened by him.  The first time he ran they did not think him able to win the election but they underestimated his appeal and embarrassed them by winning.  So they hate him.  Even some republicans because they dont want exposed. \\nThe corrupt have control of the media and have the sheep duped. They portray him as evil.  There was even attempts to assassinate him. The old hippies want communism, and immoral things deemed ok. The corrupt politicians want to stay getting fat cash. The media wants their palms greased too.

So under that definition, people might not be called \\"privileged\\" if they're proletariat and not bourgeoisie. We'd generally call someone elitist if they look at a starving homeless person and say they're morally wrong for not being able to become a millionaire, despite the fact that that person has no education/little way to get that education- essentially, to be \\"elitist\\" is to not recognize your own advantages and/or to consider yourself morally superior for having those advantages.But \\"privileged\\" is just slightly broader than just money- \\"having special rights, advantages, or immunities.\\". I'm looking at, specifically, \\"advantages\\".The OP seems to be working on a definition containing not just financial elitism, but also informational elitism. So under their definition, looking at someone who knows the wrong thing and saying they're morally wrong for not knowing the right thing, in other words, saying \\"Educate yourself\\" is \\"elitism\\". Of course, one might be inclined to say, \\"But we have Google, obviously you can learn!\\"- and while true to an extent, there's something they're missing here: a lot of people just don't have critical thinking skills, and critical thinking is, itself, something you have to be taught- some people might have it innately, or they might've learned it in their life experiences without having to be taught, but the truth is that most people very clearly don't.Sure, they have access to flour.

Pro tempore is a Latin term meaning \\"for the time being, signaling that the position was originally conceived as a temporary replacement. The framers of the Constitution assumed that the vice president would preside over the Senate on a regular basis, so the Senate would only need to elect a president pro tempore to fill in as presiding officer for short periods of time.Although the Constitution does not specify who can serve as president pro tempore, the Senate has always elected one of its members to serve in this position. Since the mid-20th century, tradition has dictated that the senior member of the majority party serve as president pro tempore.In addition to presiding over the Senate, the president pro tempore fulfills a number of other responsibilities. In consultation with Senate leaders, for example, the president pro tempore appoints the director of the Congressional Budget Office (jointly with the Speaker of the House), as well as Senate legislative and legal counsel. The president pro tempore also makes appointments to various national commissions and advisory boards and receives reports from certain government agencies.In the absence of the vice president, the president pro tempore may administer all oaths required by the Constitution, may sign legislation, may jointly preside with the Speaker of the House when the two houses sit together in joint sessions or joint meetings, and may fulfill all other obligations of the presiding officer. Unlike the vice president, however, the president pro tempore cannot vote to break a tie in the Senate.","title":"Ex-Harris Aide Urges Biden to Resign and Let Kamala Be President"},{"text":"This argument falls flat when you realize that cis people never had the right to opposite-sex spaces and sports leagues either.","title":"The Democrats Need an Honest Conversation on Gender Identity"},{"text":"I'm fully expecting Trump to attempt to deport natural born citizens just because of their skin tone.","title":"Do you think Trump will eventually deport permanent residents too?"},{"text":" Gays for Gaza the problem is not so much their support for the palestinians but the fact that they and other far left groups call organizations who kill gays on sight like Hamas, \\"resistance\\".","title":"Heres Just How Badly Democrats and Harris Pushed Muslim Voters Away"},{"text":"Exactly... my point here....

And correcting individual misconceptions does- \\"usually trying to debunk stuff\\"- is essentially giving a man a fish. It does feed him, and it helps for a bit, but it doesn't keep him fed- so you might be inclined to look at that and say, \\"Why bother feeding him?

In other words, to give someone with inaccurate assumptions the ability to correct their own assumptions- critical thinking skills. You'll have an easier time of things than either the elitist version (saying the man should just feed himself) or the gut reaction (giving the man a fish.)Of course, I think you can still go one level deeper than that, wonder \\"why can none of these men fish?\\" and support efforts to have critical thinking be taught in schools, but that might a bit of a tangent.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"How come we dont have neofascists","title":"Chris Murphy calls for \\"a firm break with neoliberalism\\""},{"text":"Irrelevant old man yells at cloud.","title":"Bernie Sanders responds to his scathing reaction to Trumps win"},{"text":"I hoestly think we could sell some of our current policy's as populist, if we retool them to be simple and straight forward:* Tax land, not wages* Cut red tape and build* Suport new business* Tarrifs are a tax* Immigrantion action that works* Innovation that works for everyone* Improve the police (might be a while before we roll this one back out)* etc.But we'd need to figure out how to sell them, especially to the audiences we don't currently reach.

Sure it's illegal, but often it's necessary for them to be here filling positions in various roles. There could be a legal way to allow temporary work and assimilation/citizenship. Instead we're going to with a slash and burn version that tears families apart and at the very least will cause issues with industry. Stephen Miller has even talked about \\"denaturalization\\" which would take the citizenship of whoever they don't like probably aimed at first or second generation immigrants. Whether it's all legal or not is dubious, but it's very funny that the guardrail is \\"oh they won't let him do the awful thing.\\"We didn't invest in housing, now rents are high. The situation with housing has been an issue since 2008. Trump didn't touch it or really any other issue than tax cuts for the rich his four years in office. Inflation was high but I don't see a policy that Trump has that would actually lower costs. He promises lower energy prices but I seriously doubt the oil companies will want the price of oil to crater and they'll keep production going at a rate that keeps the price stable. In this first administration he also promised the moon and what did he deliver? He promised this infrastructure week and he did nothing with infrastructure. He doesn't like unions. He doesn't like that unions give workers power. He joked about killing unions with Elon Musk. So we're not going to get a better deal on pay when we unionize we're not even going to be allowed to unionize. Then there's the tariffs. I don't see how the hell this is going to do anything other than create a mess in the global economy and push our allies away from us. Trade with Europe, people who pay their employees well is what we should be doing. I get that we should be putting some restrictions on China and I agree with some of them. But the problem is that we're going too far with it and it's going to hurt us badly. I really don't see how we have the capacity or the workers to just suddenly become a manufacturing powerhouse that replaces everything that China gives us. Second part on tariffs. China can retaliate against us. And they will retaliate against us. That could mean stopping from sending us drugs, electronics all kinds of different things that they could stop sending us. That would cause massive disruption and issues. We use them for tons of equipment in healthcare and things like that. That can't be replaced tomorrow. This is why I'm saying we're scapegoating immigrants here. A lot of these problems don't have anything to do with immigrants. They've picked their Boogeyman. They won their election and now we're going to get to see what oligarchy looks like. Because these people have given Trump so much money and Elon Musk is in charge of so much stuff now because he helped Trump so much. This is going to be cronyism, I guarantee you we're going to see the net worth of Elon Musk blast through the f stratosphere. It's not going to be because he made a company that was better and paid their workers better and provided better services. It's going to be because he had access to the government coffers. I cannot believe what you guys have signed us up for. We've cautioned you against it. I would be laughing at you if I didn't have children. Because I've been poor, I've dealt with hardship, and I don't need much to get by.

It's a platitude repeated again and again, and IMO it's just ineffective. IMO general education will not produce sufficiently informed citizens. Even the best educated citizens will still be ignorant on the details and nuances of complex policies that are outside each citizens' educational specialties.Public policy essentially encompasses all human activity and knowledge. Sometimes we're talking about nuclear energy regulations. Or we're talking about climate change mitigation strategies. Or we're talking about how to reduce inflation. Or we're talking about how to act in an epidemic. Or we need to understand military strategy and international relations. It is of course absurd to expect any one voter to understand any or all of these complex topics. In contrast with a Citizens' Assembly, these assemblies can choose a specific topic of discussion. Let's say it's nuclear energy regulations. With the power of compensation, *citizens can be compelled to learn the specifics of the topic*. We can force them to take classes on the subject. We can force them to listen to testimony on the topic, as well as proposals/solutions/remedies. Then we can force them to make an informed decision, in contrast to the uninformed decision of a voter. In other words a Citizens' Assembly facilitates tailored, specialized learning in a way that doesn't break the bank. Giving 300 million Americans a bachelor's degree is of course, ridiculously expensive. Imagine in contrast 500 Americans, selected to participate in a Citizens' Assembly. Give them all ivy league educations on the topic of discussion.

They want to split up the family unit so twice as many workers join the workforce for less money and the divorce rate will skyrocket then benefiting big pharma again because kids are using meds like adderall and SSRIs, women begin leaving their marriages and embracing singlehood by injecting birth control into their body which has been statistically proven to change the chemistry in how women choose partners ultimately resulting in more breakups and less successful unions.

It does not discuss pensions.She endorses strengthening ACA, but not Medicare for All. It does not mention dental, vision, or hearing care.She does support bringing down prescription drug costs, and that has been something the Biden administration has put effort into.She does support family and medical leave.She doesn't mention equal pay for equal work in those words, but does support equality acts, which include that, which I think is good.She is committed to the three million housing target.She says she is against unfair trade practices, which is probably close enough.

She does support affordable childcare. She does not mention teachers at all.She does support cutting taxes on the middle class and raising them on the wealthy. I think you can argue details, but the sentiment is close enough.She does not mention the Pentagon. I agree with Sanders on this one, but that's long been a bugaboo of his, and I don't think it lacking in her campaign policies is that big an issue.I would say, overall, there is a lot of overlap, but the lack of focus on some of those issues probably didn't help. Given how narrow the margins are overall, every little bit helps. Some of those weren't brought up as much in campaigning, but she also had a narrower window to campaign in, and only one debate. Typically, having a few debates lets candidates hammer in on individual issues, but you can only get so many in during any one debate. It's kind of like HRC's campaign website: she also had a lot of good policies, with decent alignment with some of Sanders' positions.

I was skeptical.   I did find this:  51% of populations across OECD and 51% in Canada can successfully perform tasks at least at Level 3 Level 3 is: Texts at this level are often dense or lengthy, and include continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple pages of text. Understanding text and rhetorical structures become more central to successfully completing tasks, especially navigating of complex digital texts. Tasks require the respondent to identify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information, and often require varying levels of inference. Many tasks require the respondent to construct meaning across larger chunks of text or perform multi-step operations in order to identify and formulate responses. Often tasks also demand that the respondent disregard irrelevant or inappropriate content to answer accurately. Competing information is often present, but it is not more prominent than the correct information.Via: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-555-x/2013001/t/tbl1.1-eng.htmSo, a few things.   ~50% of the population is worse than level 3. Level 2 (83% of Canadians):  At this level the medium of texts may be digital or printed, and texts may comprise continuous, non-continuous, or mixed types. Tasks in this level require respondents to make matches between the text and information, and may require paraphrasing or low-level inferences. Some competing pieces of information may be present. Some tasks require the respondent to:? cycle through or integrate two or more pieces of information based on criteria\\n? compare and contrast or reason about information requested in the question\\n? navigate within digital texts to access and identify information from various parts of a document.(50% of Canadians are L2 or worse)My takeaway:  yor reading comprehension is suspect.  In the sense that you likely consumed a high pop article with a clickbaity headline but failed to vet.  I guess \\"functional\\" is a very flexible word, but L2 doesn't seem illiterate by any reasonable standard of \\"functional\\" that I would use.

During that time, Dems restructured the banking system, strengthened government over site and penalties for corporations, raised minimum wage with the cost of living, created social security, created Medicare and Medicaid, housing act of 1949, creation of FHA, and increased stabilization of prices through federal over site post WW2. Whenever older republicans talk about the good old days theyre talking about days of very progressive Democratic legislation.???With all of that said the 1980s was the end of New Deal Dems and more adoption of certain Neo Liberal stances such as NAFTA, smaller federal spending, and tax incentives to direct corporations. The last legislation that could have truly revolutionized the U.S. and probably rivaled that of SS, Medicare, etc. was the ACA and this is where I think the working class once again lost trust in Dems.?We failed to hold those accountable for the 2008 financial crisis and then the Public Option was stripped from the final version of the ACA which imo was the single largest portion of that bill. Then the courts stripped the mandatory expanded medicaid requirement. Then you look at policy positions voters have been clamoring for for more than two decades (Expansion of Medicare, Paid family leave, increasing federal minimum wage, and banning Super PACs/corporate money from politics) and we just dont move on it. ? Imo these are policy positions they need to run on because traditionally, Dems have dominated politics when they have bold ideas. Right now Dems to the electorate just seems like the status quo.

The ideology capitalism promotes is about greed and selfishness being a virtue and a reliance on violence against aggressors.","title":"CMV: the political compass should be a diamond (rotated 45 degrees)"},{"text":"mods what happened to \\"no memes\\"","title":"I love democracy!!!"},{"text":"Anyone have a good place to keep track of the house race?

If there was no pandemic there would be no president Biden.Democrats were so focused on winning one battle the way they wanna win it (aka with an establishment stooge) that they ended up losing the war. What good is it to have an ineffective (as far as the average voter is concerned) 4 years and then cede the entire control of the government in the next election? All they did was delay the next Trump term and now he's even more extremist than before being re-elected with felony convictions, a coup attempt, and countless other insane charges under his belt.I just don't know how people can look at how this has all played out and still act like that was the right call.

However, now that the election is over, this is terrible framing. The left has ceded control of entire sections of the media landscape (Twitter, the entire podcast space, Youtube etc). Unfortunately, Democratic leaders like Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, Obama etc seem to lack the cultural competence to understand why what's such a problem. Acting like the answer here is for Democrats to simply \\"reach out\\" on right wing spaces is the worst lesson you could take away from what happened during this election. I promise you, it won't work. You will never, ever win begging your opponent to treat you fairly on their own turf. I'm not a Rogan hater but I would bet my life that interview would have been a trap. Even if it wasn't, it wouldn't matter. The worst 30 second clip from the whole interview would be amplified 1000 fold on Twitter, everything else would be suppressed. The right understands these concepts, that's why all of their major players are obsessed with either starting their own media outlets or buying existing ones. Look at what Elon did with Twitter/X, look at what Vivek is doing (he's taking over Buzzfeed), look at what Ben Shapiro is doing with Daily Wire,  look at the top podcasters on Spotify (mostly right wing firebrands), look at how Trump started Truth Social, look at how the Trump campaign built their entire media strategy around the right wing manosphere. None of these guys are trying to be \\"reaching out\\" on leftist platforms because they know that's a loser's strategy. The left needs to get wise to this fact and get aggressive about creating left wing media spaces, because the right isn't fucking around at all with this stuff.Honestly, If left leaning billionaires could get together and persuade Bytedance to sell TikTok instead of shutting it down in the US, that would be an amazing play. That's the kind of move we would need to counter what's going on right now. Forget about going on Joe Rogan in 2028, the left needs to try to create its own Joe Rogan own its own platform.

Everyone wants to assign blame because we're in shock and depressed.But I've realized, it's much simpler.Obama set things up so well that in spite of everything, for most people, the first few years of Trump, prior to COVID, were pretty good. Prices felt pretty low, mortgages were low, and we didn't have any major wars going on. COVID was almost certainly made worse by Trump, but it wasn't his direct fault.Similarly, the incredibly bad economic position that Trump left us with wasn't Biden's fault. Russia invading Ukraine? Not Biden's fault. Hamas slaughtering Israelis and starting a devastating war in the Middle East? Not Biden's fault. Despite a few missteps, Biden has handled some of the worst possible situations with aplomb. But what it doesn't change is how it feels to live in the US right now.I'm doing well for myself, but the last years under Biden have objectively been pretty bad. The actual job market is full of Ghost Jobs and highly volatile. I've only recently finally gotten a stable job. I got blindsided with my mortgage rate doubling between Trump's administration and Biden's as they desperately tried to control interest rates and I lost my original mortgage due to delays. *I* know that this is still better than the alternative. *I* still support Biden, Harris, and the DNC because the rough time I had under Biden is largely inherited from Trump and coupled with difficult global events.But there were people searching, on election day, whether Biden had dropped out. If people didn't know that, of course they don't know Harris's plans to help them, nor do they have the awareness to understand how badly Trump can hurt them. To a lot of people, it's simple. Things generally felt good under Trump, and things generally felt bad under Biden. So they vote for Trump again. I think we *need* Trump to be in power right now, because people need to be reminded that you can't vote with a gut feeling and nothing else. You have to educate yourself.

Hell you could probably analyze / criticize dem politics in general through most of that framework, and use that to objectively prove + deconstruct why and how many / most dem leaders and above all young political activists are outright terrible at and do not understand politics / power conflict, and tend to get stuck on idealistic + moralizing issues (eg gun violence) instead of being 100% laser focused on actually winning.d) attempting to crucify him on the insurrection, jan 6, etc, completely and totally backfiredThis really should not surprise anyone. MAGA is practically a religious movement at this point (note: I mean that in the sense that marxist-leninism + maoism were secular utopian religious / ideological movements), and you CANNOT stop religious / ideological movements by persecuting or crucifying their leaders.e) young, and again stupid and utterly incompetent left-wing activists in corporate media have among other things pissed off the nerds. History nerds - by pushing at times bad and objectively incorrect history, and other shit takes; comic book nerds; star wars nerds; fantasy nerds; gaming nerds. And hell sports nerds, fitness needs, et al.This has turned public sentiment in a significant chunk of the young 20-40 crowd, WHO ARE LIBERALS, against what was broadly seen as annoying / aggravating overreach by left wing (note: very dubiously *useful* left wing *avant-garde*) activists.This has shaped the ground for why pushback on those things were seen as acceptable in online spaces, and which has, in turn, enabled the proliferation of full blown fascism among the alt right in young 20 somethings and teenagers.This would also not have been an issue if these people (writers, showrunners, et al) were actually good at their jobs.Much of this might just automatically fix itself itself as corps will, frankly, just start firing left wing social activists - because they are at this point actually starting those companies to lose money - and this election has demonstrated that public future support for where these companies thought the US was imminently heading was not substantiated.The trump admin will give people real issues to actually care about and fight against.And, provided that we *drop the people who were not helping us win elections* - and focus on actual, real race / gender / orientation / whatever blind liberalism, and try to focus on relently grounding our messaging in *factual* correctness, not far-left twitter activist crusades (and provided that people dont lose their goddamn minds again as in 2016), then *of course* we have a very real path to push back and win.f) liberals swung to the far left on immigration *as a reaction to* trump winning in 2016.To be clear here, we should *not by any means throw migrants etc under the bus*Advocating *very loudly* for them however, and to the point of very visibly providing free subsidized public govt funded services for them, in some cases above and beyond what we provide for our own citizens, is however terrible *national* policy/ electoral strategy.For among other things the simple and *should-be-really-f-ing-obvious-reason* that US non-citizens *do not vote*.And, in addition to this, the fact that ANY US citizen can, *absent extreme levels of xenophobia and racism directed against them*, also join and help grow nativist resentment and backlash.Oh, and yeah, its worth noting that a lot of stuff that left wing demsocs like to advocate for - free healthcare + college education, within-the-US-only UBI, and/or generally heavily expanded social safety nets + per-citizen govt spending, is inherently incompatible with unrestricted immigration policy. And is instead fully compatible with smaller populations, restricted immigration, and comparatively high socioeconomic built up capital investments, as is the case in scandanavia, japan, et al. It is 100% compatible with nativism. And restricted allowed free immigration only at best from other countries that you like. Thats probably a conclusion that many right-leaning bernie bros came to, and why they are 100% unironically pro trump / vance.Thats a whole other tangent.But yes, among other things extreme vocal pushback against *obama era policies* - and to be clear persistent in good faith attempts by dems to incrementally fix the USs broken immigration system - is also partially what led us to the point. ie calling *Obama era* policies + border enforcement fascist. etcThe problem, basically, is that if you are a far left politician running in a solid blue district, running on all of this stuff will reward you and win out an edge against less progressive rivals.And to hell with the rest of the US. And some downballot dealing-with-an-entirely-different-electorate in say, Ohio. Or PA. Let alone the deep south or what have you.","title":"Why Democrats Are Losing the Culture War"},{"text":"Andrew Yang hasnt won ANY political campaigns. Kamala has won several.

But it would still hurt Joes ego and legacy, so I think he will not resign anyway. But if he did resign, Kamala could appoint someone really partisan as the new Vice President, so he or she could preside over the opening of the ballots on January 6, 2025. The new Vice President could get the Senate to invalidate all electoral college ballots cast for Trump on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendments disqualification clause. The next step would be to pick a moderate Democrat or an Independent senator as a unity President.I think Joe would not go along with this because it would be too extreme and would hurt his legacy. Instead he will let Trump become President.If the Sisonites want to foment a lot of trouble, all they have to do is distribute their personal arsenals, such as those used for training during Socialist Rifle Association and John Brown Gun Club meetups, to everyone facing deportation.

Democrats often went along with MSM while apparent leftists really trashed Democrats. I don't know for sure what you do when someone as progressive and successful as Joe Biden slips to low popularity but perhaps Democrats in general and Harris is particular could have navigated the situation with more positive things to say about Biden. 2. Kamala Harris did not run as \\"republican lite.\\" Stop using these general terms of propaganda already. However, Harris should have leaned more into most progressive policies. Many people who supported Harris were begging George W. Bush of all people to endorse her. What for? I thought it was acceptable that Liz Cheney would support Harris due to the unique circumstances and considering the fact that Harris did not give up a single policy to Cheney; but as more Republicans lined up, it gave legs to the absurd idea that 'the parties switched sides' or the notion of 'both sides same' which helped to sell fake 'outsider' Donald Trump just like happened in 2016.","title":"Democrats dreamt of an unbeatable coalition.

I grew up on the unhinged 90s internet where neo nazis and pedophiles were EVERYWHERE. I grew up with conservative + religious family, friends, and community.I was a jock or meathead, but I read books and being smart was seen as something to aspire to by everyone in general. Thats no longer the case for American conservatism  today  this ideology doesnt value intelligence or expertise. It values the exercise and display of power, strength, etc, and idolizing these concepts. Despite everyone telling me to play college football, I went to a cheap, affordable community college. I continued to learn because I know educating myself is important. I learned about the history of the world and America in particular (focused on Civil War period during Masters).I have experienced many epiphanies throughout my life because I am open to new information and change. I had Conservative views growing up. My opinions and views about everything have changed many times and I hope I change more in the future.The problem is that this is easily doable for anyone with access to those resources I had, BUT they dont do it. They dont educate themselves because theyre simply lazy and shameless about it. No one can tell me its too much to expect from someone, because I did it and it wasnt even hard. Too many people simply seek out information that confirms what they already believe. They think thats doing research.They are not going to change their mind regardless of what people tell them. The only thing that can change their minds is personal experience. So, in order to get someone to do the research, they have to experience extreme discomfort or pain  enough to realize that their worldview is harmful to themselves. It needs to affect their survival in a direct way.Look, in the past people came up with all these political ideas and concepts to have their will represented in some form. They organized and overthrew shit. But the living conditions were BAD in the past. Things have never been better than the modern era globally (in general). People overthrew shit in the past because it was SO bad. Thats how it always happens.

Taking the election projected outcome exactly the way dictators and fascists need them to.A lot of you will call me delusional and say that I am on \\"copium\\". But what this actually is: I am a realist and a patient person who feels that upholding transparency and the truth always matters, whatever happens in the end.Anyone can factually verify that neither candidate has yet won, by looking at the vote counting map and thinking critically insread of emotionally. Neither candidate has won yet because votes are still being counted in several states where the margin between the two is small enough for it to go either way already as is, but especially because the currently announced votes being counted are \\"expected votes\\" which means there can legitimately be more to count before the end. Mischigan, in example, accepts absentee votes up to a week after election day. It is also possible that recounts need to happen for various reasons, which may or may not change things to either direction. Either way, recounts happen in all close elections and they are done to enforce legitimacy and security. Some of you will say this is not a close election but a landslide for Trump, but again, those who say that are ignoring the fact that votes are still being counted in states with razor-thin margins which can yet make this the closest election in history.It is exttemely important to care about transparency in the democratic process, and about fair and thorough vote counting taking time. And to be patient with waiting it to complete, instead of this automatic acceptance of a immediately projected winner before vote counting has ended and even regardless of how dead-heat close the margins are in remaining states. Parience, and respect for the value of every single vote cast, is totally missing in the post-election day discussions. Fascists and dictators are loving this--because they benefit from this kind of impatience and self-inflicted defeatism when vote counting is not even over yet, they benefit from massive emotional response and lack of critical thinking. So I don't mean just in this election but in all elections to come. Americans can't continue behaving this way about elections, especially if Trump wins.Close elections like this are not over until every single vote has been counted and certified which may not happen for a few more weeks in a large country. The media does not decide who wins, nor do Harris, Biden or Waltz, Trump, Vance or anyone else in advance. The votes that were cast decide it and this is why counting every single vote and doing everything proper to ensudre all went according to protocols and rules, before declairing a certain winner, matters. And right now, y'all completely ignoring this truth.Your mental health would be in a much better state if you were patient and wanted and looked for the truth instead of for a feeling of immediate certainty. I know it's been emotionally exhausting, scary and tough for ages but that's all the more reason to not fall victim to harmful cultural habits.Laywers, election workers and other officials are working hard to make sure this election just like all the ones before it is free and fair and secure. Media continues to fail you and current leaders are overly caurious at this critical time. So take your powerful voice and make it known loud and clear that everyobody's votes matter, a lot of them have not yet been counted, and that your desired outcome is legitimately still within reach. Also remember that one of the yet to be counted votes may be yours. Be proud of having cast it and defend its immense value.Trump may win. But he has not won yet. Harris may win. But she has not won yet. The election is not over and won't be for another few weeks because it's being conducted throroughly and being taken seriously by those tasked with protecting and ensuring its fairness and accuracy. And that, is a good thing when the stakes are this high.This message is important. Because IF Harris wins by the slimmest of margins, it must be after everyone has kept in mind that it was all along legitimately possible and that your democratic process can be trusted. This is also important because continuing to accept lack of transparency and continuing to prefer immediate results over paying attention to the real process, would lead to deeper troubles IF Trump wins. This message is important no matter who wins.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"I also got a few \\"followers\\" after some comments agreeing with other right wingers, here and elsewhere.

Until now it felt like I also had to be the one to put the time and actually deeply research issues while a certain demographic just gets to vote based on their gut. Since I cared about these people I would try to talk and have a conversation first, then I realized that words dont matter so it was up to me to talk and provide non biased sources.

So then I was left with, just go and educate yourself with the idea that if they found the information on their own that they would actually believe it.Now, I just dont care and I feel like engaging just drives others farther away. I think liberals would be best served by minding their own business, stop protesting, stop making angry posts on the internet. Dont harrass congressmen to vote a certain way. Dont engage in any boycotting. Just let conservatives govern unhindered long enough for people to realize either everything is going to be okay and Trump is full of lies and isnt going to be any different than any other republican president or he is telling the truth and will follow through on some of his policies most economists (regardless of party) believe will make life much harder for the working class. Either way liberals win at the end, but not if they keep pushing away the very same people they need to show up at the polls. Lets face it, Dems suck at messaging and can only control a narrative for liberal audiences. An incumbent Trump is the only way to get liberals and independents to vote and conservatives to stay home.

Im sure your family is one of the many that has called American home and wants to see it restored to what it was several years ago. Not what we see today as some celebrate burning the American flag and trying to destroy the community in which they may reside. I understand and sympathize your familys fear but I think its unfounded and legacy media is playing up on those fears in the most disgraceful ways. Trying to paint Trump as a hitler figure is straight out wrong and offensive to so many people in this country. It pisses me off. If you actually watch his long interviews you can see his comments taken completely out of context repeatedly. The illegal immigrants committing crimes and causing chaos through the communities are at the heart of the issue. The non-vetted illegal immigrants with gang member ties that have been green lighted to kill Americans cops. Those who are flooding the nation with fentanyl. The illegal immigrants from multiple nations from both borders on the terrorist list. There is absolutely no justification for any of these individuals from other countries, individuals who have committed crimes and been deported in the past (even repeatedly) and show back up on US soil to do it again. Then you have the Biden admin flying immigrants from countries like Haiti, as we heard about in the last few weeks, and dropping them in these very small communities that DO NOT have the resources to provide the necessities to help them BUT its somehow its the republicans fault when its exposed in the media! Its an utterly deplorable situation created 100% by the Biden/Harris administration who has purposely allowed this to happen, they dont give a shit about the people in those communities NOR the poor Haitian dropped off like hot potatos for political gain. There is a God Damn reason Trump, as much as I personally hate the orange man, won the election.

That's why we' always said, they'd rather lose to Trump than win with Bernie, because - for them - to win with Bernie, that is more existential than losing to Trump, because at that point, they've lost the party in every meaningful way\\"In other words, the Democrats don't really mean it when they pose as a left-wing party. Identity politics is the distraction that they use to stop from having to deal with actual left-wing issues, like the economic issues that actually affect the working class or putting, an end to the endless wars that only benefit the ruling class. It isn't that they are just doing a bad job at representing a left-wing base, it''s that they are not in any meaningfrul way a left wing party.The Dems *are* controlled opposition, because they have managed to convince large sections of both the left and the right that the purpose of \\"leftist politics\\" is to get shrill about identity issues and to censor the words people use, rather than to protect workers from economic exploitation - and ultimately to keep ordinary people from becoming canon fodder for rich men's wars, if push ever comes to shove... which it has before and could again in our lifetimes.","title":"Progressives beginning to realize Democratic Party has been controlled opposition the whole time"},{"text":"He also scammed his own supporters out of hundreds of millions in donations for stop the steal lawsuits with no evidence, social media censorship lawsuits his lawyers deliberately filed in the wrong state, and while campaigning for other candidates in 2022.

Claiming that there are no respondent documents.And so forth. If you receive a subpoena, you always have the right to challenge it. But trump did none of these. What he did was move a bunch of the documents, then tell his lawyer to go into the room with the remaining documents, collect them and sign off on a statement saying they had returned the documents.That is to say, Trump didn't contest the subpoena, he complied with it.This would be like if you got a subpoena for all your e-mails relating to a subject, then went on your computer, deleted half of them and forwarded the rest. You've acknowledged through your compliance that the subpoena is lawful, but you've obstructed justice.That is a crime.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"But paying your worker better O WOE is ME!!!

So state governments like Texas, Florida and so on have attempted to make that the exemption. But in practice they have run into issues, which are going to mount and cause public anger unless resolved. Those issues are:\\n1) Sepsis and infections that effectively make the fetus non viable, make women infertile, and result in severe cases in death if left untreated.\\n2) Slow speed of government bureaucracy vs medical need for near instant answers. A pregnancy can become a threat to the life of a mother in literally minutes, so an hour wait for a decision could mean infertility or death for the mother. \\n3) The medical insurance and health industry putting profit over the life of the mother and the child, and literally not bothering to put in the effort to save either. I think the problem of the debate, whether you are pro life or pro choice is that laws on abortion are a wishlist, and they don't fix the real ethical and more issues that actually require persuasion of everyone involved and medical advances to increase the chances of survival for the mother and child.Like in a perfect world, you wouldn't need any laws on abortion. In that world if someone became pregnant, and couldn't take care of the baby, then society would take it on and there frankly wouldn't need to be abortions.But right now, despite all the medical advances, we have no means to transfer a fetus to an artificial womb, and unfortunately we are unable to save the mother without an abortion. The extreme side of the debate, seems to argue the fatalist moral position that it is god's will if the mother or fetus dies, or that we should have no restriction on abortion whatsoever. While some may believe these things, most Americans take abortion as something terrible, but necessary to protect the life of the mother if medical issues happen.","title":"Something fishy in Arizona.

LBJ changed the rules of the filibuster in 1959 to push the Civil Rights Act through. In 1972 they moved to a two track system. They can vote to table the legislation being filibustered, and move on to other business. This is what allows the threat of filibuster to kill a bill now without having to actually filibuster. In 1975 they changed the rules of the filibuster again to make it harder to break cloture. In 1979 they changed the rules on a time limit on debate after cloture is invoked to 100 hours. In 1980 the Senate voted 38C54 against sustaining a decision of the chair and thus set a precedent that a nondebatable motion to proceed to executive session to consider a specific nomination (or treaty) is in order. Therefore, nominations can now be brought up without the threat of a filibuster on the motion to proceed.In 1986 they reduced that time limit to 30 hours. 2013 they declared the filibuster on judicial nominees against senate rules. 2017 they did the same for Supreme Court nominees.

It also depends on if the individual is open-minded, uses critical thinking skills, and has a basic understanding of media literacy. While all of these are partly dependent on their upbringing and community, they still have the ability to look information up themselves. This access to information is exactly why it doesn't matter where you grow up and if that location has some deep ideology. I don't see where you get that the vast majority of people can't build their own world view considering nearly everyone in the US has that easy access to differing viewpoints and credible information.There's more factors that go into where people get their political ideologies from.

Information is available to all of us, so it's not \\"elitist\\" to have access to knowledge of what is going on in the world, and how things work. As far as the time to research it, you don't *need* to have a strong opinion on something you know nothing about. If you don't have time to research it, stay out of it. I'll lean towards the idea that you may be more privileged than others if you have the time to really dig in to the facets of every nuanced tiny detail about how the world works, but that's not what people are expecting you to do when they tell you to educate yourself in this instance. They're telling you that if you're making a strong decision or stance, then you should educate yourself on that stance and how it will effect the world before you make strong claims about it.It's true that you're a product of your environment. But we are all capable of critical thinking, and most of us make a choice: do you choose to research for yourself and make the best decision, or ignore reality and just move forward with what sounds cool? Decisions in relation with the latter for important things like elections, absolutely are a detriment to society. I would argue either educate yourself there or simply don't get involved. There are some situations where you quite clearly do have a higher morale ground than others, in my opinion. Take the extreme of someone that kills or rapes someone, you obviously think that you'd be morally superior to them. So that concept exists in some capacity, undeniably. Now extend that to a hypothetical situation where people are being killed outside of your town left and right. You've heard from someone that's being accused of being responsible, that it's actually their accusers that did it. You have a group of people that went over the hill and saw evidence of the person being accused actually being responsible. But you refuse to walk to that hill and peer over; instead you blindly agree with the man that was accused. If you refuse to \\"educate yourself\\" in that situation, then yes absolutely, others are morally superior to you because they investigated, found the truth, and took action on that truth; whereas you took a strong stance with no evidence at all.I'll also add because you added a lot of political coloring to your post, that if it's genuinely just a difference in opinion, then \\"educate yourself\\" is being used toxically. For example, if people acknowledge the risk of the US pulling out of certain areas where we are posturing to maintain free trade and relative peace, and say it's worth the risk due to other clear benefits -- they aren't speaking out of ignorance. They have a different opinion on what matters, what level of risk should be allowed, and what actions we should take because of it. What *would* be an \\"educate yourself\\" moment would be someone denying that the US played an incredibly strong role in global peace and the free trade we experience today especially since the end of WW2, because that is an undeniable fact.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"So, did you vote for the person with better policies that would be better for our country but with weaker communication skills or the better communicator with the worst policies for our nation and the world?I agree that what you are saying as part of why she lost, because being a better communicator makes you more likely to connect with people on an emotional level and most people are not rationally-driven voters, but it wouldn't cause me individually to vote for the worse candidate for our country just because he's more charismatic and engaging because I don't vote primarily based on emotion.","title":"Charlamagne tha God admits Trump 'speaks to people's grievances better' than Democrats"},{"text":"To be fair, the GOP is defending 23 seats, the Dems only 10, and some are in deep blue states.

Absolutely not.What he did do was divert the festering anger in our country at a greedy and out-of-touch corporate elite into a politics that served his political goals and will end up further enriching his fellow billionaires.Trumps genius is his ability to divide the working class so that tens of millions of Americans will reject solidarity with their fellow workers and pave the way for huge tax breaks for the very rich and large corporations.While Trump did talk about capping credit card interest rates at 10 percent, and a new trade policy with China, his fundamental explanation as to why the working class was struggling was that millions of illegal immigrants have invaded America and that we are now an occupied country.In his pathologically dishonest world, undocumented immigrants are illegally participating in our elections and voting for Democrats. They are creating massive amounts of crime, driving wages down, and taking our jobs. They are getting free health care and other benefits that are denied to American citizens. They are even eating our pets.That explanation is grossly racist, cruel, and fallacious. But it is an explanation.And what do the Democrats have to say about the crises facing working families? What is their full-throated explanation, pounded away day after day in the media, in the halls of Congress, and in town meetings throughout the country as to why tens of millions of workers, in the richest country on earth, are struggling to put food on the table or pay the rent? Where is the deeply felt outrage that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care for all as a human right while insurance and drug companies make huge profits?How do they explain supporting billions of dollars in military aid to the right-wing extremist government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which has created an unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Gaza that is causing massive malnutrition and starvation for thousands of children?In my view, the Democrats lost this election because they ignored the justified anger of working class America and became the defenders of a rigged economic and political system.This election was largely about class and change and the Democrats, in both cases, were often on the wrong side. As Jimmy Williams Jr., the president of the Painters Union, said, The Democratic Party has continued to fail to prioritize a strong, working-class message that addresses issues that really matter to workers. The party did not make a positive case for why workers should vote for them, only that they were not Donald Trump. Thats not good enough anymore!As an Independent member of the US Senate, I caucus with the Democrats. In that capacity I have been proud to work with President Biden on one of the most ambitious pro-worker agendas in modern history.We passed the American Rescue Plan to pull us out of the COVID-19 economic downturn; made historic investments in rebuilding our infrastructure and in transforming our energy system; began the process of rebuilding our manufacturing base; lowered the cost of prescription drugs and forgave student debt for five million Americans. Biden promised to be the most progressive president since FDR and, on domestic issues, he kept his word.But, unlike FDR, these achievements are almost never discussed within the context of a grossly unfair economy that continues to fail ordinary Americans. Yes. In the past few years we have made some positive changes. We must acknowledge, however, that what weve done is nowhere near enough.In 1936, in his second inaugural address, FDR spoke not only of his administrations enormous achievements in combatting the Great Depression, but of the painful economic realities that millions of Americans were still experiencing.Roosevelts words remain relevant today: I see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day  I see millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children  I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.Of course, the world is today profoundly different than it was in 1936. We are not in an economic depression. Unemployment is relatively low. People are not facing starvation.But the Democratic leadership must recognize that, in a rapidly changing economy, working families face an enormous amount of economic pain, anxiety and hopelessness  and they want change. The status quo is not working for them.In politics you cant fight something with nothing. The Democratic Party needs to determine which side it is on in the great economic struggle of our times, and it needs to provide a clear vision as to what it stands for. Either you stand with the powerful oligarchy of our country, or you stand with the working class. You cant represent both.While Democrats will be in the minority in the Senate and (probably) the House in the new Congress, they will still have the opportunity to bring forth a strong legislative agenda that addresses the needs of working families.If Republicans choose to vote those bills down, the American working class will learn quickly enough as to which party represents them, and which party represents corporate greed.In my view, here are some of the working class priorities that Democrats must fight for:","title":"Bernie Sanders Boston Globe Op-ed: Democrats must choose: The elites or the working class.

Rising from the tents of the dejected Democrat camp comes the whimper of self-reproach. Its all our fault. Liberalism created this monster. Theres a distinct whiff of mea culpa in the air. Nostra culpa, nostra maxima culpa for the alienation of half the American people. Donald Trump and his mob? Its the fault of liberals for not feeling Trump-Americas pain. We fed their despair. Nigel Farage and his Reform party? Liberal Britains fault for being too stuck up to take Red Wall voters concerns seriously. Noses in the air (apparently), deaf to the woes of all those deplorables, and babbling about trans rights, preferred pronouns and all the rest of the woke agenda, we have lost the trust of those we (apparently) secretly consider negligible.Hence Trump, apparently. Hence Reform. Hence Le Pen. Hence the AfD. Hence populism. Symptoms, all of them, not agents: unwitting by-products of American and European liberalisms self-indulgent disregard for the silent majority of the just-about-managing. Apparently Theresa Mays citizens of the world have simply blanked what the (normally liberal) David Goodhart calls the Somewhere people in his The Road to Somewhere. No wonder theyre revolting. Blame the Anywhere people.The US presidential election has provoked an inflamed outbreak of this liberal self-flagellation. A hero of mine, Andrew Sullivan, high priest in the marriage of personal freedom with conservative politics and one of the finest essayists alive, writes in the Sunday Times about how he was almost (but not quite) ready to vote for Trump, so sympathetic is he to forgotten Americas rage against the woke elite. The Democrats (he writes) have missed a critical new reality in American politics: its about class, not identity C and we liberals are snobs.An equally hard-hitting essay by David Brooks in Atlantic magazine (Confessions of a Republican Exile) describes why, as a former Republican voter, he has almost (but not quite) despaired of his new roost among the Democrats. They just dont seem to get the frustration with liberalism that has driven the supposedly left-behind half of America into the arms of Trump, he laments.Enough. The self-criticism has gone too far. All this wailing about what we liberals have apparently caused calls to mind (and will remind Spectator readers old enough to remember Peter Simples weekly parody in the Telegraph) Dr Heinz Kiosk, the popular psychoanalyst and consultant to the Ministry of Jet Propulsion. Dr Kiosks audience, as he approached the habitual peroration to his lectures C We are all guilty! C would make a despairing rush for the doors and windows.Theres a double irony in the liberal urge to blame populism not on the populists, but on ourselves as liberals for neglecting them. The first irony is that blaming societal conditions rather than individuals is what in other circumstances infuriates your western populist. The habit is mocked in Sondheims parody of liberal social workers in West Side Story: Gee, Officer Krupke, were very upset/ We never had the love that evry child oughta get./ We aint no delinquents,/ Were misunderstood./ Deep down inside us there is good!But, in the case of Trump supporters, deluded populist fantasists and their deranged leader are proving the beneficiaries of the liberal blame-shift from someone to everyone. Listen, for the British version, to that supremely articulate once-student (now cheerleader) of the populist right, Professor Matthew Goodwin, interviewed recently on Nick Robinsons Political Thinking podcast. Cogent, fluent, passionate, Goodwins is nevertheless essentially a massive bleat. The elite (it emerges), blind to ordinary voters anxieties about immigration, two-tier policing, economic hardship, etc, has radicalised his crowd. Its all our fault C or so we are supposed to believe. Populists who get so irritated when race riots are blamed (by the liberal elite) on white privilege now bask in the comfortable conclusion that they and their politics are victims of elite privilege.The second irony is that excusing Trump supporters for believing nonsense and placing their faith in a rascally demagogue on the grounds that they know not what they do, and college-educated people drove them to it, is deeply if subtly insulting. Its as if we consider them to be children, unable to make informed decisions. Be clear: we liberals do not believe a Trump presidency will be in the interests of Trump supporters. Yet the poor lambs have been deceived by his infantile promises. It must be our fault, we grown-ups who (unlike them) have rumbled him.Its time we stopped patronising populists by cooing that were sorry we didnt listen and will henceforward do our best to address their concerns. We should treat them as the adults they are, and tell them, man to man, that their concerns cannot be met. In countries like Britain or America, where money, talent and ambition gravitate towards clusters where success breeds success, we cannot realistically level-up with scarce public funds when the Treasurys cupboard is bare.In a national workforce where whole sectors of the economy are critically short of workers to fill jobs we must either import labour (immigration), hoist wages to a level that attracts native workers (inflation and higher taxation) or starve the health, social care, farming and service sectors of workers (ruination). We (or the Americans) can keep out imports at a stroke, but prices will rise and our own exporters will face reprisals.Yes, we can put more and more people in prison and keep them there longer, and C yes C serve them right; but all experience shows this does not reduce criminality and costs a bomb (taxation).British populists wanted us to leave the EU, so we did: our leaders complied C and much good it did anyone. But, yes, we British and more importantly the United States can draw in our horns, run down defence  and leave foreign tyrants to do their worst. Thats what populists wanted before the second world war. They were wrong.Wrong, plain and simple. Liberals should stop beating ourselves up, stop whimpering about how we failed to address populist concerns, and face millions of good but deluded men and women with honest argument. They are wrong. We are right. We shall be proved right. Chins up.","title":"In defence of the liberal elite"},{"text":"Dont you know? Liberalism is dead.

Very rarely do actually educated people tell somebody to \\"educate themselves\\" as opposed to trying to explain or argue their side. So, from your title, it's a line most commonly used by people parroting beliefs or memorized phrases they've internalized as the \\"correct view\\" on a topic they're not properly informed on. It would be elitist if they actually knew the topics they've stated that on, but that's almost never the case.  \\nTo add on to that, from what you've stated, this seems much more like a left versus right argument as opposed to any form of intellectual elitism. This statement falls into the same trap you see other statements like, \\"do better\\" fall into where it leaves the end open. Do better how? Educate yourself on what specifically? These are poor attempts to end an argument putting the person stating them on, like you said, some semblance of a moral high ground, but provides no actual information to reflect on and can easily be turned on the person stating them if they're arguing with somebody informed on the topic. It's an easier tactic for leftists to use due to the growing understanding of intersectionality and critical theory playing into identity politics and these being burgeoning topics in social science. However, it all circles back to a defensive argument that an actual educated person would likely come with an argument as opposed to retreating. Are there cases where the person you're arguing with doesn't have the depth of knowledge to make a case and maybe they do need to go educate themselves? Sure. However, that's really more for higher level, specialized discussions and much less for any form of moral argument. If you're expected to have a philosophical discussion on moral/ethical frameworks, maybe go read a philosophy book and be amazed at how the outcome is there can't be an outcome. But if it's Suzie down the street saying you should have voted for a certain person, just ask them to name the actual policies that person supports, how they've voted previously and other topics along those lines. If they can't reinforce the side their arguing then you're arguing with a parrot, not an intellectual elitist.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"you know, i don't remember. i do remember kyle was a part of it following the clear rigging of the primary by the DNC, so many people were so pissed off and full of energy. organizing an actual movement seems somewhat impossible from where i sit.","title":"The DNC is an oligarchy.

It can be very easy to dismiss someone with an opposing view or less awareness on the subject and this response runs the risk of the other person \\"educating\\" themselves with flawed or dishonest sources. If you aren't willing to educate someone on a topic, someone else will.That being said, I think this term is valid when trying to discuss something in depth and nuanced when the other side has put far less time and effort into the subject. It's like trying to coach a varsity team with someone who doesn't have the basics: if you want to be a quarterback, you gotta come in knowing how to throw. Discussion works the same way: For arguments sake, you say Columbus doesn't deserve the acclaim he's been given, someone asks you why. You can tell them about his connection to the early slave trade, about his views of the natives, how Columbus Day was started to ease tensions with Italian immigrants and not out of respect, etc. This person now understands the topic, or at least your view, better. They have more to go on and can further their own education.Now, have that discussion ten more times. Fifty. One hundred. Sometimes with people who demand sources out of thin air, as if you have the book shoved up your ass for just this occasion. Sometimes with people who are emotionally invested in the topic and won't be asking in good faith. It has suddenly become your job to defend a position that can easily be researched, to have sources at hand, and to be able to overcome resistance and bias. ( And for a topic that you may have no real attachment to)Is this your life now? Forever arguing over Columbus and lecturing folks? Having to devote more time to explaining your view for others' sake?\\"Educate yourself\\" is not always a dismissal. Oftentimes, it's a surrender: I can't have this discussion again, I'm so tired of having to explain and defend my position from square one each time.It is a clear, concise suggestion to someone honestly interested in the topic and a dismissal to anyone asking in bad faith.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Idk, did she say she voted for them?","title":"Progressives beginning to realize Democratic Party has been controlled opposition the whole time"},{"text":"Maybe it was the dead relatives voting again?

The only people rampant inflation benefits are those with sizable investments ($10M+) in the stock market or real estate. Everyone else gets diluted. The practical effect of inflation is the transfer of wealth to the richest people. Its been a huge trend since the early 90s that has only widened the wealth gap between the ultra rich and the middle class and it will not end any time soon.There is a reason this billionaire Trump and his billionaire friends love uneducated voters: They will get even richer than before.

One of the problems with democracy is that everyone wants all of the things provided by an effective government but no one wants to pay for them. Billionaires, who benefit the most from thriving democracy, want to pay the least for it. With the power their wealth gives them they are able to accomplish this, shifting the tax burden more and more upon the rest of the income distribution, making taxes more onerous and even less popular2. There was a reason the original system of taxation was changed: it didn't work. 3. This idea that income tax is theft is promoted exclusively by people who don't think government should be in the business of improving or preserving the lives of the people it serves. Many of them don't think government should be in the business of serving anyone. Some of them, about 700 billionaires and thousands of millionaires, believe it should exclusively serve the whims of the wealthy, who after all, deserve it. It's not supported by liberals because liberals believe the only function of government is to do things for people that people cannot do alone: national security, develop vaccines, build schools, protect consumers, police criminals and corporations and corporate criminals, etc. Liberals understand that these things cost money.Your logic about who'd end up paying more or less is specious as well as circular.The reddest states are already the poorest indirect proportion to the poor choices they make at the ballot box. They are so close to failed states that they absorb far more of the welfare they hate so much and carry far less of their economic burden than the more successful blue ones. We're going to see this played out in spades in the next 4 years as people have their health care, overtime pay and other benefits taken away along with deporting everyone who harvests our food, builds our houses, works in our restaurants and gutting of federal agencies that protect consumers, direct the development of safe drugs.
