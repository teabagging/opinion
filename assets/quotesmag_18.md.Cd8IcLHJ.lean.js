You look at the economics as if each country has one big pie and it needs to be shared and policies should be based on equitably sharing the one pie.  I support policies that create more pies to feed more people.  Many will bring up that the middle class is shrinking and that is true but what many fail to point out is that it's moving in both directions and more people have actually moved up rather than moved down.  [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/04/20/how-the-american-middle-class-has-changed-in-the-past-five-decades/](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/04/20/how-the-american-middle-class-has-changed-in-the-past-five-decades/)Billionaires may be the reason these folks have dropped out of the middle class but it's not based on the OP's core hypothesis that they have too much money.  Its how they used their money to influence public policy to grow their wealth while reducing opportunities for lower and middle income folks.  Many billionaires support illegal migration and sanctuary cities which bids down the cost of labor allowing them to pay less for work.  NAFTA and other free trade agreements have discouraged domestic manufacturing in favor of moving jobs overseas where its cheaper to build and make goods.  These jobs were replaced with lower paying service sector jobs.  Billionaires also encouraged the Federal Reserve to flood the market with cheap credit this way the folks with the lower paying service jobs could boost their loss of income with credit and other risky loans.  This creates bubble economies as seen with the mortgage crisis in 2008/2009. Passing Congressional term limits, laws against stock trading while elected to Congress, and a 10 year lobbying ban upon leaving office would do far more to help than an arbitrary cap on individual wealth.","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"Exactly.

Or is it ok to kill a person because they're in a particular location, in a womb for example? Or is your argument that it's ok because this being cant survive on it's own?

That would answer almost all your questions, and until everyone wakes up and goes against these people then no true justice will ever occur. But unfortunately human psychology is easily manipulated and most are too stupid or sheepish to go against the ruling class.There are failsafes in place too, for example in the UK they started arresting citizens for \\"wrong think\\" and inciting violence for protesting against the mass immigration that led to the stabbing murder of 3 kids in Southport. While letting any Muslim protestors off free despite some of them carrying weapons. They want to demoralise and beat you into submission of whatever they want, and will make examples of anyone brave enough to stand up as a result.For Trump, there are enough people that believe that hes not part of this ruling class to vote him into presidency - including a large percentage of women. Imo I'm still unsure, sure it makes the most logical sense, however the biggest argument against was that assassination attempt. I'm very inclined to believe the Secret Service was given orders to stand down and give that kid a clear shot at Trump, I mean he had to turn at the exact right moment to not have his head blown off, that is not indicative of a staged attempt, Trump would never agree to that and he was clearly suffering from Trauma in the days after, even mentioning God and divine intervention.As for the \\"what is a woman\\" question, it may not be important to you but it encapsulates how far gone the Democrats are from a social policy standpoint. And the same mindset resonates with a lot of people, including women. He wouldn't have won by as big a margin if that wasn't the case.

And this is the factual part people seem to hate? \\nThe 9-11 commission found a direct connection between the National security vulnerabilities of that insecure transition to 9-11 happening. https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2024-11-13/when-trump-takes-office-national-security-depends-on-a-smooth-transitionOne of us served in the Presidential Personnel Office during the 2000 transition, advising incoming President George W. Bush on appointments to the State Department, Defense Department and other key agencies and roles. These appointments saw a long delay. At that time of the 9/11 attacks, only 57% of the top 123 Senate-confirmed positions had been filled, due to a slow Senate confirmation process and time-intensive background investigations. Prior to 9/11, while certain parts of the government were deeply concerned about the threat from al-Qaida, others considered ballistic missile defense the highest priority. As history proved, failures to effectively share critical information can lead to lapses.Heres the 9-11 report itself https://9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdfPre-election info from presidential transition website:\\nhttps://presidentialtransition.org/lessons-from-the-9-11-commission-report/Saturday marks the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, a tragedy that changed our country and the world. In 2004, a bipartisan commission investigating the attacks issued the 9/11 Commission Report, which made 41 recommendations to prevent future terrorist attacks and strengthen our national security. One of the reports most notable findings was that a delayed presidential transition in 2000 hampered the new administration in identifying, recruiting, clearing, and obtaining Senate confirmation of key appointees.Importantly, this finding revealed our countrys flawed political appointment process and showed how slow Senate confirmations can imperil our national security. The commissions report recommended several improvements to this process to ensure both our countrys safety C particularly during and in the immediate aftermath of a presidential transition C and continuity within government.","title":"Elizabeth Warren Warns That Trumps Transition Threatens the American Public: And as the New York Times reports, we dont know whos funding the transition team."},{"text":"Again, you are wrong.

So if people think they are getting infected 1-3x a year, they are actually getting infected 2-6x a yearCovid attaches to the histamine receptors on the surface of the cellIt is becoming inexorably more and more clear: each infection increases the chances of long haul Covid, you don't become more resistant, you become increasingly more likely to take long term damage.HI = histamine intolerance = we can't metabolize the histamine in normal health food, so normal healthy food poisons usMCAS = mast cell activation syndrome = immune system destabilization. Mast cells have an almost infinite capacity to manufacture histamine, if the immune system is destabilized they are constantly dumping it into the bloodstream. This poisons us.Consider peanut allergy. You've heard of people dying from a peanut allergy, I assume.It is not the peanut that kills the person. It's a reaction to an ige protein, their own immune system, flooding the bloodstream with histamine and a massive amount of other chemicals. Worst case scenario of anaphylaxis = death within 15 minutesSo, Covid doesn't do this; not quite. You just end up having your own food supply, and your own immune system very  very slowly poisoning you, and you feel like you're dying, but the doctors can't see anything wrong, not really. You just become slowly and progressively more and more poisoned, until you can't really do your job anymore. Then, after awhile, you can't really drive a vehicle, shop for groceries or leave the house. If you're really unlucky, you can't even leave the bed anymore.I figure the vast majority of deaths from long haul Covid aren't deaths directly from Covid; it's from people committing suicide.Nobody talks about HI/MCAS much but the data is obvious if you look for it.This is the REAL conspiracy hereI ought to make a post and link the research, because I've got all the evidence and it's publicly available but it would probably be a waste of time in this sub","title":"New Study: Covid Vaccines linked to surging heart deaths"},{"text":"Yup.

One of the big things that my therapist and I worked through to alleviate my symptoms was doing DBT / CBT exercises, and it helped me, but honestly I think the most impactful thing for me wasn't that at all. It was developing healthy deep friendships in my city, and in particular my friendship with my best friend, who honestly is my rock.She is not my favorite person in the way that I used to have favorite people (a common symptom of BPD, and generally coincided with my romantic partner). I don't hang on her every word, I am not jealous when she spends time with her boyfriend, I don't wonder what she \\"actually\\" thinks of me, and I don't test her affection for me.She's an extremely direct person and hates dishonesty and I trust her completely. When she says something, I believe it. And having that has alleviated so many of my symptoms. I feel like I have intrinsic self worth because I know and trust that I am valued by her. I feel like I don't have to worry if we ever get into an argument, because I know we will always be friends. I know she cares for me deeply and I know I care for her in the same way. I rely on her for emotional support in a healthy way, only intermittently, and without the self-destructive and self-hating tendencies I used to have.But am I really in remission if I am reliant on her for so much of that feeling? I feel so much better. But still, if I were to lose her (which wouldn't happen, short of like, unexpected death, given that she is based in my city for the long haul as am I), I don't know where I'd be.It's hard to parse. On the one hand, I am happy and secure. On the other hand, that happiness and security still is kind of contingent. I don't know. And I don't know if I *could* be happy without someone like her.

It's a good reason to take a much needed hiatus.I understand wanting to bounce back after such a loss, she probably doesn't want her legacy to end up being associated with a second Trump term. But maybe considering a cushy consulting job for now, if she's really itching for work, like some politicians do after they retire or get voted out, is the better option.She's not a social pariah or anything, but she's a bit out of favor right now with the American public. Trying to make any sort of comeback right now will just make things worse for her reputation.And I get it, id be losing sleep too over being the candidate that lost to Donald Trump of all people, especially considering it's his third run for president in the past 8 years. Oh, and especially especially considering the reality that Trump won the popular vote and every swing state.That being said, there should be some consolation in the fact that Harris was kind of shoehorned in at the last minute, and Joe Biden is partly to blame in retrospect because he shouldn't have run for a second term in the first place.Also, it's not like Harris ran an abysmal campaign, considering she had little time to work with, but the onus was on Democrats this election to really drive home a message that prioritizes the issues that Americans were most concerned about.I mean, Democrats have to take some of the blame, they were dealt a bad hand from the beginning, but they also played it poorly.Most Americans were more concerned about their immediate circumstances than Trump as a threat to core Democratic values, which is unfortunate if you ask me, but Democrats should have focused more on Trump's disastrous foreign and economic policy considering that these issues were at the forefront of the electorate's mind.Democrats should have taken the short term memory of voters much more into account. Their strategy should have better considered the fact that it's low propensity voters who decide our elections, and just how misinformed voters are about the things they cared about most this election. Inflation/the economy, foreign wars and immigration.Democrat should understand at this point that most voters aren't making politically informed decisions, they're simply voting based on feelings, and that's what got Trump elected this time around, feelings.And yeah, the problem, or at least one of the problems, is that a lot of these voters are tuning in at the last minute while being inundated with an increased amount of propaganda, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, conspiracy theories, foreign disinformation, etc, because these messages are what receive far more engagement. In other words, the truth is... Boring in comparison and often buried beneath this gish gallop of bullshit...Studies consistently show that outright lies, sensational rhetoric and headlines, misinformation, and fearmongering propaganda travel farther, spread faster, and reach much wider audiences than anything resembling facts or nuanced points of view.You may ask, how could Democrats possibly inform voters if this is the case? Well, first of all, It would have helped if the Democrat front runner had more than three months to work with in order to craft a better campaign message. However, and like I said before, Democrats didn't use those three months effectively enough to get through to the voters who might have been able to make more politically informed decisions.Instead, feelings decided this election. Beliefs like, \\"the current president/administration must be responsible for inflation and every conceivable economic problem,\\" or \\"because the economy was better under Trump, that must mean Trump is better for the economy,\\" or \\"the current president is responsible for these foreign conflicts,\\" or \\"immigration is out of control because Democrats want open borders,\\" yada yada yada But they're not going to take into account the fact that an economic crisis emerged during the last administration, and how Trump mishandled it. How Biden was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. How under the previous administration, the Natl debt exploded, how Trump pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low, how his tax cuts permanently and disproportionately benefitted the rich and corporations, how his admin made it more difficult for unions to operate effectively, how he instigated a trade war with China, and how all of these things contributed to inflationary trends that extended into the next administration.They're not going to take into account the fact that the war in Ukraine was all but inevitable, and Putin was always going to find a justification for invasion, or how Trump helped embolden Putin's agenda, aided Russian proxy wars, tried to rescind Russian sanctions, repeated Kremlin propaganda, weakened our alliances, wanted to withdraw from NATO, among other things, which are all far more likely to have helped accelerate the war in Ukraine.They're not going to take into account The fact that Donald Trump escalated foreign conflict in multiple theaters, how he compromised our ability to act as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians, how he exacerbated tensions in the Middle East, how he negotiated with terrorists, how he caved into Bibis political pressures, how he cozied up to dictators and autocrats around the globe, how Congress had to pass not one, but two historic war powers resolutions due to Trump's dangerous interventionism. And how the conflict in the Middle East has been going on for over a century. They're not going to take into account the fact that there was a global slowdown and immigration due to the COVID pandemic, and the Trump administration relied strictly on title 42, a pandemic emergency policy that not only deterred immigration, but created a massive backlog that would affect the situation at the border for the next administration.They're not going to take into account the fact that Republicans shot down one of the most stringent bipartisan immigration reform bills in recent history at the behest of Trump because it was too politically advantageous for Democrats. Or the reality that Republicans prefer to run on immigration instead of fixing it, and would rather propose extreme, non-viable, and impractical so-called solutions to the \\"border crisis,\\" than consider reforms that are far more pragmatic and humane...I know I went off on a tangent here, but I think it's important to understand what got Trump elected In spite of the fact that he is demonstratively unfit for the presidency. That being said, and considering everything I've just laid out, you can hold on to your sanity because this wasn't some historical political realignment, or some \\"mandate\\" from the American people. There were a multitude of factors working against Democrats this election, It was an uphill battle from the beginning, but that doesn't mean they're blameless either. Id say both Democrats and the general public are to blame.","title":"California governor could be in play as Kamala Harris decides her next move"},{"text":"It was working on China until they had a 'lab accident'.","title":"Lawfare and nonstop smears from Democrats only contributed to Trumps triumph"},{"text":"Everybody's on a barge floating down the endless stream of great TV?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You actually have Musk as president, the orange guy is probably going to have neural link implanted.","title":"Democrats decry sham for justice after prosecutors drop Trump charges"},{"text":"His favorite line, \\"like never seen before!!\\" Bitch, your like something never seen before.

However, certain topics like abortion always invoke some level of philosophical speculation. If we think abortion is only okay up to a certain point, how do we decide what point that is in a secular manner? What constitutes \\"personhood\\" in that sense? Heartbeat? Brain function? Or some other arbitrary point that we decide? The question of when do we afford rights to a fetus is rooted in philosophy. There is no exact scientific answer to that just like there is no exact scientific answer to consciousness. Why is the fetus only afforded rights if the mother intends on giving birth (when someone murders a pregnant woman, they can be charged with double-homicide)? Or should we take this away too?Whether or not we think the philosophy here is clear-cut (\\"my body, my choice\\"), these questions still have to be answered via philosophical framework. And if so, the reality is, we just want everyone to abide by our philosophical outlook and it has nothing to do with secularism.In conclusion, I can probably go on about the potential problems with a secular society. It isn't all sunshine and rainbows like we think it would be. We got to remember that people are flawed and sometimes the people in power are corrupt. No system can exist without its flaws for this reason.","title":"CMV: Politicians who vote against policies on religious grounds are no different to those who use pseudoscience to justify their stances."},{"text":"Pinged LGBT ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20LGBT&amp;message=subscribe%20LGBT) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20LGBT&amp;message=unsubscribe%20LGBT) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=LGBT&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://juliaserano.substack.com/p/planned-action-for-lgbtq-and-allies!ping lgbt","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"America's First Felon + Elon.","title":"Democrats decry sham for justice after prosecutors drop Trump charges"},{"text":"I would prepare tighter budgets.

As we lost manufacturing here, we started bleeding wealth to other countries via our trade deficit.Trade deficits don't cause a country to lose wealth. [This is a map of nations with their balance of trade](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Cumulative_Current_Account_Balance.png). There is no correlation between wealth and balance of trade. You will notice that practically all of the countries *you wouldn't want to live in* like China, Russia, and Iran have so-called positive trade balances. Japan has the highest so-called positive trade balance of them all and [they haven't recovered from their last recession 30 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decades). A positive balance of trade does not equal wealth. It's very unfortunate that the term 'trade deficit' has become mainstream because the word 'deficit' implies to the average person something bad. But in reality, a trade deficit means your country has to produce *less* products in order to get *more* products. That's less work for more product.When a country sends a product overseas, they get paid in the currency of the nation they are exporting to. If a Chinese company sells something in the USA, they get American dollars. The only use of American dollars is American investments and American goods. Though they may trade these dollars for Yuan, or use them to buy goods from other countries, but the dollars are only good to make those trades or purchases because they have a value in buying American investments and American goods.The idea you're espousing here is called [Mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) - that a country loses wealth if it trades money to foreign peers. This idea is so outdated it *predates capitalism*. This idea is so outdated that its main supposition is that *the amount of the wealth in the world is fixed*. Now, there are some very compelling arguments that manufacturing can't ever come back to the US- but that's a sweeping claim. Biden pushed to bring back chip manufacture to the US, and that was based on reasons that aren't all dissimilar to things we could say about other industries.It's based on [comparative advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp). A nation cannot be good at making all things, and even if it was, it's not efficient to do so. This has been known by economists since Adam Smith. The idea of comparative advantage is simple: countries produce what is efficient. They trade their efficiently produced goods, for goods that others produce efficiently. This is what underpins all global trade to this day. To call this a 'sweeping claim' is like saying 2+2=4 is a sweeping claim. We can demonstrate the claim is true.Biden pushed to bring chip manufacture back to the US for a variety of reasons, but one of the reasons he was able to do it is that the US *already has* a comparative advantage in complex manufacturing and STEM fields. The U.S. does not have a comparative advantage in simple manufacturing. Also all this ignores the national security implications of the chip act; it wasn't signed purely for economic reasons. It was signed because Taiwan has an [absolute advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absoluteadvantage.asp) in chip manufacturing but is at risk of being invaded by China.A single factory worker's salary able to support a stay at home wife and 2.5 kids in a detached house during the 1950s and 1960s is underpinned by two important pieces of context that are almost never considered. The first is: at the time, such work was considered advanced manufacturing, which is something the USA is still good at now, it's just what qualifies as 'advanced' has changed with the times. The second is: the rest of the world was a smoldering mess from WW2.","title":"CMV: Implementing high tariffs on imported auto parts will harm the U.S. automobile industry and economy."},{"text":"If she wants to beat Trump, she should do Rogan.

The desire to have more manufacturing done in the US isn't crazy by itself. As we lost manufacturing here, we started bleeding wealth to other countries via our trade deficit. Fell down a progressive enshitification of the goods we consume in a race to the price bottom on imported crap produced in horrible exploitative conditions. We lost that huge chunk of middle class jobs available to those with a high school diploma. We're also vulnerable to global events and possible conflicts if the supply lines we rely on from other countries are interrupted. Now, there are some very compelling arguments that manufacturing can't ever come back to the US- but that's a sweeping claim. Biden pushed to bring back chip manufacture to the US, and that was based on reasons that aren't all dissimilar to things we could say about other industries.Maybe Trump's specific talking points on where tariff's should be, on what goods and to what levels won't take shape. Few of his campaigning talking points become reality exactly as claimed anyway. But tariffs by themselves aren't necessarily a horrible idea. Trump didn't invent them, we have plenty in place as it is. I don't think it's beyond consideration that SOME levels of targeted tariffs could be part of a strategy to help US produced goods compete within the US market against countries with inhumanely low labor costs.","title":"CMV: Implementing high tariffs on imported auto parts will harm the U.S. automobile industry and economy."},{"text":"What happens when taxes are increased on the poor and taxes on the wealthy are reduced?The poor don't pay income taxes and the wealthy avoid them with careful strategiesIt's the solid middle class incomes that pay them - and don't really have a choice in the matterwhat happens when tariffs are imposed and everything inflates in price?Unlike an income tax, that effective sales tax is something the poor do end up paying","title":"Trumps Border Czar Issues Terrifying Threat to Democratic States"},{"text":"Who cares.

So the right can have their echo chambers but the left cannot by your post. Actually the very fact that you are able to post this disproves your assertion that this is an echo chamber. So too is the fact that there are competing views on X. If a critic of Liberals were to post on Blue Sky, they would have been reported and forced to carry a very negative flair.  I addressed that in my original post. In that regard, liberals are much less tolerant of dissent. That's a pretty big deal considering how liberals insist they are tolerant. \\nThe second issue in particular was really alarming the BlueSky natives. They reported him repeatedly to the Stasi, so on his profile page when you looked him up ( again he is long gone) C he is branded with SCIENCE DENIER as a moniker for all at see. Since it has his real name, he discontinued his account. I did see occasional others branded in a similar fashion C one in particular I remember was branded TRANSPHOBIC C and when I did a bit more looking into his crime, it appears he was emphatic that there were just two genders.The bigger problem is that liberals have lost touch with reality. An \\"Earth is a sphere\\" echo chamber would be ok if they had room for a debate. That's what /r/wayofthebern is. What the Liberals have is an \\"earth is flat\\" echo chamber.That's why we are seeing the situations like how electoral losses like 2016 or 2024 are catching many liberals by surprise. They are out of touch and lack the mechanism for self correction.So by you standards, we have ours but you cannot.\\nEdited because I hit return by accident. Edit : You would be wrong to make that claim. I never said that you can't have an echo chamber or called for Blue Sky to be closed. What I have said is that it is intolerant of dissent, lacks self correction capabilities, and is out of touch with reality.Cancel culture is more of a liberal thing. If anything, cancel culture is something liberals tend to resort to when they don't have counterarguments. Not everyone is like a liberal, calling for a shutdown of anything that doesn't conform to their ideology.

The US is continuing to support Israel despite being extremely unpopular with voters. It's currently more expensive than ever to buy a home, adjusting for inflation. Household incomes have decreased, also adjusting for inflation. Hell, the cost of everything has increased, adjusted for inflation. And with a second Trump presidency on the way, if the tariffs he wants become reality, then all prices will just keep increasing. Basically what I'm tryna say is I think there have been enough changes in the last few years where people are fed up with both parties. Bernie even said in his statement following Harris's loss: \\"the democrats abandoned the working class, so the working class has abandoned them.\\" I'm kinda rambling at this point, but people have been fed up with the Republicans and Democrats for years, and Bernie has remained an enormously popular figure since his presidential campaign started in 2015. He could do it. It may not fix everything immediately, but it's a step.

Because virtually every goddarn gubbernmint on earth implemented the disastrous attack on the plebs by Fauci and Big Pharma and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and their WEF and WHO, weaponizing the bought and captured media, shamelessly enriching themselves off a treacherous and deadly treatment and vaccination program that was safely aiming for mass depopulation and mass maiming, and effective at it to boot, and the few heads of state that resisted got assassinated, you goddarn establishment fuck n tool n serf. Also because they immediately followed up by bankrupting their own economies a second time (at least the realities of those for ordinary folk) in order to enrich BlackRock and the war machine in Ukraine (and to detriment of Ukraine itself even) and through Israel. The famous meme with the crossed out world leaders giving Zelenskyy a hand shake applies, because they all let the malicious and predatory business interests of BlackRock &amp; co prevail over reason, peace, diplomacy, and the simple, modest interests of the people to have a life instead of being cast in the torturous chains of ass-fucked serfdom to the kleptocracy. And Democratic elites and their shills (like OP) blame everyone and everything except the painfully obvious: that they made their bed with these immensely sordid and criminal policy choices.

Those who have not committed any crimes (including identity theft) other than immigration law violations could be given an amnesty. Not citizenship obviously, that's not an amnesty that's a reward for breaking the law which is patently ridiculous. No, the amnesty could involve signing up to register for a short-term visa (say, 6 months) which allows them to stay in the country legally while they get their affairs in order and make plans to return to their own countries. A small financial help for relocation could possibly be given. Possibly even an exemption for their violations so they are not permanently barred from returning on a legal visa. Things like that.I don't see what you need to \\"see how it works\\" though. They aren't undocumented or without home countries though, they have documentation in the countries they are citizens of.

They might well have legitimate reasons to worry.  But a survival kit seems a bit silly.  The goal is to make sure things don't get to the point where a survival kit is necessary.  That happens when we work together to resist Trump's crap.  And we have a playbook for that:1. Pressure campaigns - call your House rep and Senators for *everything* and tell them what you want to see happen.  Especially if they're Republicans, when the House and Senate are both going to be extremely close.2. Win local and state elections.  Blue state and city governments are the best security we can get against Trump, and they can do a lot.3. Engage more people.  If they're scared enough to buy survival kits, surely they're willing to pick up the phone and make some calls for Dem candidates, right?

Your argument was that her sole case was that shes not Trump, and now youre off talking about how she compared herself to Biden...You cant even keep your own fucking arguments straight.You need to chill out lmaoI said when she was asked directly what she would do differently than Biden, her answer was not much. This meant her case wasnt much more than Im not doing anything new and the other guy sucks.  WHEN THAT WAS LITERALLY HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. Then you werent listening to him. He made it very clear that he was anti-immigrant and anti-trade. He blamed Democrats for not doing enough because of identity politics.  It seems like its less to do with a candidate and just more to do with the constant pendulum of blame based on absolutely zero understanding or nuance.I mean its a simple decision calculus for most people: we gave these people a shot, did my life get meaningfully better? No? Okay, the other people get a shot. You can try to explain to them what improvements you made, but you cant tell them they should be satisfied if theyre not. The middle class has shrunk for decades regardless of the party in charge. No ones side has alleviated that decline or a lot of their precarious situations.And the *voters* hate this process. A lot. Theyre always voting based on dissatisfaction, not a vision they actually like. This idea that a message matters really just feels like bullshit. Before writing it off, consider that we just havent had a coherent one. Again, Harris was asked point black what she would do differently multiple times. She just couldnt answer that question. Sometimes shed say Im not Joe Biden and Im not Donald Trump, sometimes shed say not much, sometimes shed say she was just VP. It was a pattern. Look at The View, Colberts show, that MSNBC interview in the field.  Youre just cherry picking a single interview and acting like thats all that exists.Feel free to give me the interview or stump speech where she nails the answer, because she briefly mentioned price gouging in one speech and then her campaign rolled back from emphasizing that. She also refused to respond to media requests that asked her if antitrust lawsuits would still be going forward after she met with CEOs of companies that had ongoing suits with Bidens admin. She undermined her own ability to come across as a prosecutor going after corruption and corporate greed.There was a pattern of poor communication here. The idea that because she didnt throw Biden (and herself) under the bus so she didnt have a good message is beyond stupid.I agree, which is why I never said to throw Biden under the bus. To act like Trump isnt some unprecedented level of stupid is just insane Again, never said it wasnt. Im saying its stupid for Democrats to think voters will automatically agree with their assessment of stupid and not have to make their case when history has shown you always have to. Complaining about the way things work is just whining Literally not what I said, just pointing out how dumb your argument is.Hes not about change, but he is going to make a lot of changes I dont likeok lol And this is your solution?

Your argument was that her sole case was that she's not Trump, and now you're off talking about how she compared herself to Biden...You can't even keep your own fucking arguments straight.\\nAnd I just have to point out that it's beyond fucking comical that you keep going on about how she lost because her only argument is that she wasn't Trump...WHEN THAT WAS LITERALLY HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. He ran on next to no actual policies, and basically just ran on \\"Sleepy Joe and Comrade Kamala suck\\".Why would it matter when they dont have any faith that you have a coherent vision to tie those policies together?Politics is not just about policy, its about being the face of a set of policies. This is so basic that I genuinely do not understand how most people here thought politics worked.Yeah, this is pure unadulterated bullshit. At best, it's just about being a face. But I think after the last 2 decades there's a decent argument that doesn't even really fucking matter. It seems like it's less to do with a candidate and just more to do with the constant pendulum of blame based on absolutely zero understanding or nuance.10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan? Let's vote Obama. 8 years of the same dude? Fuck it, let's vote something different and non-establishment. A massive pandemic? Someone new. Inflation high? Someone new again.This idea that a \\"message\\" matters really just feels like bullshit. At best maybe you can try and tap into what the sentiment already is. But Kamala was basically screwed because of inflation, and no amount of \\"messaging\\" was really going to save her.And they asked her what she would do differently. She didnt have a clear answer.She did have an answer. The current administration did amazing and we're going to continue and improve those policies and go after corporations that are being greedy and keeping prices high at your dinner table. You're just cherry picking a single interview and acting like that's all that exists.Then there you go. People said they were unhappy, and your starting position is well its not like we can acknowledge thatHeres what a smart politician would say: Biden did an amazing job handling the recovery, but now we need to pivot into a much more aggressive attitude towards building the middle class and stamping out corruption. As a prosecutor, I canInstead, she said she wouldnt do that much differently, but that shes a different person. Seriously, go back and look at those answers.Again, you're just cherry picking a single interview. She literally said all these things continuously on the stump. She constantly acknowledged that average people were still hurting. She constantly talked about how she had a plan to fix it. The idea that because she didn't throw Biden (and herself) under the bus so she didn't have a good message is beyond stupid.Whats stupid is all the Democrats saying this as if anything is new and feeling like theyre above having to explain themselves in a way voters like. People have been saying voters cant handle a democracy for thousands of years. Youre also kind of stupid if you look at all of that and think no but surely this time the voters will read our policy papersSorry, but again, this is just fucking stupid. To act like Trump isn't some unprecedented level of stupid is just insane and honestly makes me think you're just trolling. People aren't talking about this a lot now for no reason at all.But as I spoke to before, \\"messaging\\" really doesn't fucking matter. There's way more variables at play that have a much stronger impact.So you dont think hes going to change much from the Biden administration? Then were all kind of freaking out about nothing lmaoLiterally not what I said, just pointing out how dumb your argument is to claim Trump - who was President just 4 years ago - really isn't some beacon of change SINCE HE HAS ALREADY BEEN PRESIDENT.You lack some serious reading comprehension that I have to continually point out your errors of basic understand and following of the discussion.We lost the popularity contest. We didnt get prom queen this year. Yeah, it sucks. Life goes on. Either be part of the solution or stop whining.And this is your solution?

Just starting from the top:  Do you think Russia winning this war, conquering and subsequently annexing Ukraine is an acceptable outcome?  Does that outcome make Europe more safe, or less safe, than one in which the pre-war status quo is restored? Which end does the US reducing or eliminating their involvement make more likely?As a bonus question:  What event do you think prompted the US to allow long range use of weapons they've supplied?Even more important bonus question:  What does the phrase \\"We will pull out and make a peace deal\\" mean when it is said by the leader of a nation that is not fighting the war in question?  What deal can Trump make when the combatants are Putin and Zelenskyy?   The US government has a favored outcome, but they don't actually have a dog in the fight, so what deal can they actually make?","title":"CMV: Trump is bad, but Biden/Harris would have been infinitely worse."},{"text":"The trials should be delayed or pushed through but not dismissed.

Mussolini and Hitler started aggressing on countries around them, the stronger countries who could do something about it chose to do nothing, and the fascist dictators were able to gain huge amounts of resources and political momentum off their victories in these small, less important countries. Remember, off Hitler's victories in Austria and Czechoslovakia, he not only got supplies, fuel, tax money, and industry, but he also united the German people behind him since everybody loves a victor. He became more powerful than ever and the German people were willing to fight and die against the entire rest of the world on his behalf - they were much less enthused about picking a fight with the Soviet Union, France, and the UK before these victories.I would encourage you to look at policy rather than political speeches - what matters is not what a politician says, because talk is cheap. What matters is what a politician does - Trump's actions suggest to me he is an isolationist who would rather appease Putin and allow Putin to do whatever he likes.

Any attempt to make peace will just shove the problem into the future, just like Chamberlain did when he negotiated with Hitler. Also, Trump is the least qualified person to help mediate such a deal.

It makes sense that youd look for someone who seems like theyre pushing for peace. But I think its worth questioning if Trump is really the safe bet here, or if his style of leadership might actually create more risks in the long run.Lets look at his track record. Sure, Trump talked a lot about staying out of wars, but he wasnt exactly the king of de-escalation. Remember when he ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general? That almost threw the U.S. and Iran into direct conflict. Plus, pulling out of agreements like the Iran nuclear deal didnt exactly calm things downit made the region way more volatile. So, would we really be avoiding war with him, or just swapping one crisis for another?And Bidenyeah, it feels like theres been a lot of escalation lately. But is it fair to say hes starting it, or is he responding to Russias aggression? Ukraine didnt invade anyone; theyre fighting to defend their country. If the U.S. just backed off completely, would that stop Russia, or would it just encourage them to keep pushing? History shows that ignoring aggressors doesnt usually end well.Also, Trumps peace deal talk sounds great on paper, but lets be realwhat did he actually accomplish with that approach? He met with Kim Jong-un, took some photos, and nothing changed. Peace deals are more than just saying well work it out; they require trust and consistent follow-through, and Trump hasnt proven himself great at either.I totally get wanting someone to calm things down, but I think we need to look at the bigger picture. Is pulling out and leaving Ukraine hanging really going to make the world safer, or could it just lead to more chaos down the road? Maybe theres no perfect option here, but Im not convinced that Trumps the guy to fix it.","title":"CMV: Trump is bad, but Biden/Harris would have been infinitely worse."},{"text":"A primary might have helped.?

And it was very vibes-based - his appearance and backstory were what people cared about.As you've mentioned, though, Bryce's personality isn't a bad thing.  It's important that we run lots of different candidates, because we want a government that represents our diverse country.  The important thing is being authentic to who you are.  (Though, side note - think of every candidate you've heard described as 'authentic', and count up how many of those candidates were known for their female-coded traits.  It'll be a short list).And the idea that voters don't know what vibes other voters go for is very important.  I was shocked by Trump's 2024 win because I didn't think people would find his insanity appealing, especially after going through it once.  Well, when I was wrong, that certainly inspired some reflection - and a lot of long Reddit posts.Breaking out of the idea that our preferred vibe is best is definitely made harder by emotion.  Like someone else said, lots of us are angry, and just want to lash out at the people who did this.  But that's not how you make things better.

America First. That tight little patriotic sounding populist slogan was both a dont get involved in the war rallying cry and a good profile boosting vehicle for members of Congress who for whatever reason were opposed to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was just an electoral juggernaut at the time.The Justice Department had failed to convict the members of the Christian Front who tried to overthrow the government. They had failed to act on advance warning of explosions at American munitions plants, planned as sabotage. Private activist groups operating outside law enforcement were tracing stolen U.S. military weapons and complex, violent plots involving homegrown violent fascists with help and financing from Berlin. Amateurs were turning this stuff up, not the authorities.William Maloney was an experienced federal prosecutor. Hed spent years at the U.S. Attorneys office in the Southern District of New York handling high-profile federal cases of fraud and corruption. William Maloney had managed to run up an eye-popping, 400-to-nothing record as a prosecutor there. Hed never lost a case.In reality, a number of the most high-profile America First members of Congress were in cahoots with a paid agent of the Hitler government who was supplying them with propaganda intended not just to keep the U.S. out of World War II, but also to divide Americans along political lines, racial lines, religious lines, class lines, all in the interest of national demoralization. George Viereck and the Nazi government were using the America First movement and America First members of Congress for those ends.Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, a leader of the America First Committee, has threatened to demand a Congressional investigation of the way the Justice Department has been handling the prosecution of Nazi sympathizers.This is a moment of great political danger, for these men.Wheeler used his position as a sitting member of the United States Senate to lobby the Justice Department to fire Maloney.

Morality is our basis for what is more important that what - like, for example, how much effort is \\"reasonable\\" to save a life: can you compel a person to try to save a life; to give up their life if it means saving 10 lives; etc. In fact, most of what politics at the national level is morality-based: what is worth giving up for what. While there is an objective basis to some of it; at some point in every political debate, you run into a question that can only be answered by saying \\"X is better than Y, morally speaking\\" - and so people elect officials based on matching morality: on what things are more important, morally speaking, than what other things.And, as a specific example from your post: assisted dying. Many places have laws against suicide - what makes assisted dying any different? How does assisted dying differ from murder. You can get into serious debates over where is the line that separates assisted dying from murder and suicide - and different people will have different moral lines and beliefs....And the problem with morality from an empirical view is there is no empirical basis for moral fundamentals. Morality, at it's most basic level, is orthogonal to empiricism. There is no objective or empirical basis for a person saying \\"I believe animal lives matter as much as humans\\" vs. \\"I believe animal lives matter less than humans\\". There is no objective or empirical basis for most persons saying whether family or friends matter more in life. There is no objective or empirical basis for measuring the relative value of lives.And if you think there is, tell me: I will give you a scenario where your \\"objective\\" or \\"empirical\\" standards tells you to do something that you think is wrong....Put those together, and you run headlong into the situation that, no matter what system you implement, the government and elected politicians will be making moral judgements that you disagree with; and come from sources that you disagree with.Christianity, like it or not, provides the moral framework for a lot of people. To deny them the right to make political decisions based on that is to restrict not just their religious rights; but their right to their humanity.","title":"CMV: Politicians who vote against policies on religious grounds are no different to those who use pseudoscience to justify their stances."},{"text":"Pretty sure hes going to pardon himself there will not ever be federal charges against him, now.","title":"This is how democracy dies"},{"text":"There's a special place in hell for Merrick Garland","title":"Democrats decry sham for justice after prosecutors drop Trump charges"},{"text":"You keep forgetting Biden admitted it.

When it got too political he appointed a Special Counsel to oversee the investigations.The Espionage case was the easy one. Bad luck meant it went before a judge willing to throw out decades of law (and any suggestion of impartiality) to ensure Donald Trump won.The Insurrection case was much harder to prove, but they gave it a go.

Caesar was forced to march on Rome because the conservatives were wrecking the constitution simply out of spite and to take vengeance on him. Pompey's sole consulship was a travesty of Roman Law. As was the blatantly partisan attempt to pin any charges they could think off on Caesar to deny him the right to stand for election which everyone knew they would win. The people who broke the Roman Republic were the likes of Cato and Cicero.and after him was a brutal civil war, Yes. One that Caesar was *incredibly* restrained in. The brutality tended to come from his opponents. And later his successors. Caesar was constantly granting clemency to his opponents. And his actions both before and after the Rubicon speak to someone who was a lot more constitutionalist than his opponents had ever been. During his first consular election he chose to give up his own triumph in favor of abiding by Rome's laws. This wasn't a dude who was trying to tear the system down. He was forced to do it by his opponents who hollowed the system out and weaponized it against him and the people. Not very differently from what the Republicans are doing. It is what conservatives have *always* done. They use the law, but only to bind their opponents and ordinary folks. They hold themselves above it. which lead to the Empire.  Augustus and Antony created Empire. After Caesar was assassinated by the very people he spared and returned to the Senate in dignity. That's why I call Trump Julius as opposed to Augustus - he plays at being popular, but his grasping at ever-more-power will have ramifications we can't conceive of yet.And that's my point. Caesar did not play at popularity. He was popular. And it was because he looked out for regular people. Caesar was forced into action by a bunch of corrupt conservatives who were the ones who made a mockery of the justice system and weaponized the institutions of the republic against him and regular Romans.They were aided in this by Pompey, who was also popular, but who leveraged his popularity to cater to the interests of the moneyed elite. Pompey was a convenient puppet, who did whatever the corrupt, conservative elite wanted because his ego was injured.

Slightly longer answer: Its not just the top positions that transition, but also all politically appointed leadership and staff, and those people need to be vetted and interviewed and trained, and all of that requires people doing work, which means they need to get paid from somewhere. It also requires the exchange of sensitive and classified information, so there are ethics agreements and background checks as safeguards so that info doesnt get into the wrong hands. Usually this is funded by the federal government and special transition campaign accounts that have mandatory reporting on who donated, how much, etc. It also includes ethics agreements for paid and unpaid staff to prevent conflicts of interest, corruption, self-dealing, etc. So what Trump is doing is skirting all of that to hide who is paying for all of this and what conflicts exist within his team, whether theyre financial conflicts or foreign influence.

He was militarily good, but I actually don't think he was a genius. Caesar, Lucullus, arguably even Agrippa were more competent than him IMO. The only real victory Pompey had that was entirely his was campaign against the Pirates. In most other situations he either picked up from where others had left off (as in Greece where Lucullus had done a fair bit of damage to Mithradates already, and whom Sulla had trounced before) or he made things worse before he had help in fixing stuff (as in Spain, where Sertorius whupped him before worked with Metellus Pius). And in atleast one case he just straight up stole credit, when he claimed he defeated Spartacus after Crassus crushed the revolt.Besides the kid was calling himself Magnus after having done very little. His other nickname at the time \\"child butcher\\" was probably more appropriate. He was definitely all ego. And a puppet to conservative interests in his dotage. Which is why the comparison to Trump is apt.Caesar was a lot of things, but his credentials on trying to do right by the people of Rome were inarguable. Even before his dictatorship, his laws tended to be relatively balanced. Yes he favored his allies. But he also passed laws that were good for ordinary Romans. And then there were things like his calendar reforms which are arguably just plain reforms that Rome badly needed. Trump and the Cons come nowhere close to the sort of good Caesar was trying to do.

No questions asked.But those of us with concerns about his candidacy, about how he was going to perceived in the district had it pointed out to us that he was a fighter, a populist.   \\nNobody cared about the various issues that came up and were heightened by the 'macho' persona he cultivated, or so we were told. (And to his credit, I want to emphasise that *Bryce* handled every single one of these as well as possibly could be handled.)But, he got defeated; with Ann Roe, now incoming rep for District 44, doing better overall in 2022.     None of these make Bryce a horrible person, a horrible candidate, or signify that we should never run populists who run off their common appeal.    \\nJust like, one would expect, we should understand the inverse is true, too; sometimes, candidates who are conventional, or have a more quiet character are a better fit for their district or area.   Many, *many* people wrote of Katie Hobbs, and she is one of the best governors we've got in a sea of good governors, right now.But I think, even more than potentially glomming on to a candidate and then *abandoning* them to move on to the next, the above is a problem because it also damages people on our side trying to run on their own brand, including very machismo-oriented candidates.  I can think of a lot more 'plucky outsiders' who were destroyed in elections, and often left by the wayside.   \\nThey fought hard, maybe not how I would have chosen to fight or represent myself, but with dignity nonetheless.   And the things they advocated for are often moved past; what matters more (fitting the post) were the *vibes* they brought, of disgruntled and angry folk.     \\nThe same people who tend to worship the vibes?   \\nMight not necessarily share the *goals* or *actions* that you, I, *or the candidates embracing a more masculine-coded campaign* might.     \\nThey are just as likely to support an Avenatti with no fixed principles or morals in common because he seems 'tough' and 'masc,' over someone -  \\nLike Randy Bryce, who has and had plans and goals in mind.So, you can end up having candidates who lose, not because they were bad candidates; sometimes, you *just lose.*   \\nNo matter how good you are as a person, no matter your campaign, no matter your persona and demeanour.   \\nYou are left alone, people abandon you quickly, and they move on to the next outsider because the 'problem,' the 'one quick fix' -  \\nWas that we didn't run a masculine-coded enough candidate, not yet.Naturally, there are no quick fixes, and I cannot repeat this enough -  \\nMy electoral life is littered with the bones of these kinds of candidates.    \\nQuite a few of whom I've supported and done volunteering for, but who failed to match what a more conventional candidate would or did.    Which doesn't reflect on them, but is often forgotten in the drive to find an easy way to win.There's more, too; a lot more.   \\nAll of which takes time to explain, and unfortunately that's part of the problem.    \\nI can't condense any of this; you can't either, most likely.   \\nSaying 'assuming that candidates running on punchy machismo do better ignores results and harms both them and other people in our camp' is one thing; explaining how our voters don't even respond the same way to the same messaging is another.   Pointing out how in areas where we - just recently - campaigned did much better, nobody wants to hear that after a defeat.   \\nBut I have always felt leadership doesn't begin when you win, or even when you have to face a loss.   \\nIt's when you've put everything you have into campaigns, and understand that sometimes that *isn't enough,* but that you have to move on.Anyway, could go on about this for way too long.1\\\\. Antoninus Pious - haha, alright, sorry, thought a bit of light-heartedness was in order...   \\nBarack Obama is a great example of someone who alternated between what we'd gender as masculine and feminine traits in his speaking.   \\nHe is, and remains, one of the best orators we have - and we have a lot of amazing speakers.   \\nBut he's also a great example, because you can clearly see by following his political trajectory where our voters, and swing voters didn't respond well to one or both approach.   Needing to offload 'angry' and 'masculine' rhetoric on Joe, because it would be perceived 'worse' coming from a man like Barack Obama - \\nIs entirely it's own Table Talk, most like.  \\nAnd when Obama was speaking neutrally, a lot of critics used that to try to weaken and demean not only him, but the party.  Some of us may remember how the media, always our steadfast friends, referred to his visits abroad as an 'apology tour.'2\\\\. Repeating what I said above, I think the problem is that voters often don't know what vibes voters go for.  \\nThe energy Kamala raised was genuine; it is very difficult if not possible to fake that level of enthusiasm.  \\nBut statistically speaking, a decent chunk of the voters present at events either stayed at home or switched sides.   \\nEven if it's only one-in-one-hundred, that's one person in every hundred who felt deeply in tune with the vibes, and then was convinced by -  Well, in Romania just recently, the more monstrous presidential primary winner basically ran on being an anti-candidate.  \\nEverything's bad, you have the right to do whatever, hurt whomever. \\nMany human beings can swap from positions of care, or thoughtful aggression towards the right causes, to absolute madness and cruelty.  Disassociating our portion of those people from the worst of these excesses is going to be hard. Something I think that's on all of our minds.3\\\\.

They harken back to the glory days of Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson having control of a compliant Congress. All these men had to do was Use The Bully Pulpit and voila! Congress obeys, laws are passed! Somehow people forget all about Eleanor Roosevelt, and how she was both against the internment of Japanese Americans in WWII (apparently that was one of the final nails in the coffin of the Roosevelt marriage), FDR felt that Eleanor was going to antagonize the Dixiecrats he needed to pass the New Deal with her annoying insistence that Lynching Black People Is Bad Mmmkay and telling the Senators to do something about it. (Eleanor Roosevelt was so far ahead of her time she had windburn.)In addition to the coding (Ill return to it when Ive formulated my thoughts better) it helps to have a coalition. Or to be able to work across the aisle. For various reasons - mostly the demise of the Dixiecrat, a good thing, and the disappearance of earmarks, which was legislated with all good intentions but backfired spectacularly - we dont have those kind of coalitions that used to be able to get work done. Nancy Pelosi, out of all the Speakers we have had, was the one who could actually make those coalitions happen.

Locked in an elongated orbit around the sun, this celestial wanderer approaches Earth once every 3,600 years. From its surface came the **Annunaki**, a race whose intervention forever altered the destiny of humankind.--- **Arrival: The Founding of Eridu**The Annunaki arrived on Earth in desperation. Their home, Nibiru, faced catastrophic environmental collapse, and their survival depended on Earths abundant resources, particularly gold. Gold, with its unique properties, could stabilize Nibirus atmosphere and restore balance to their world.Their arrival marked the dawn of a new age. They established **Eridu**, their first city, in the fertile lands between the Tigris and Euphrates riversa cradle of life. Yet, even with their advanced technology, the labor of mining was grueling. Discontent brewed among the Annunaki workers, pushing the high council to consider a bold solution: **create a new species** to share the burden.--- **The Experiment: Humanitys Genesis**The task fell to **Enki**, the wise and compassionate scientist, and his sister **Ninhursag**, the master geneticist. They saw potential in Earths primitive homininsbeings teeming with untapped possibilities.We shall craft beings in our image, Enki proposed. They will share in our labor and our legacy.Ninhursag, cautious but intrigued, replied, We must ensure their loyalty. Too much freedom could bring rebellion.Through meticulous genetic splicing, they merged Annunaki DNA with that of Homo erectus, creating the first human prototype**Adamu**. Early experiments failed, but their perseverance led to the birth of **Adapa**, the first of the **Lullu**humanitys ancestors.--- **The Rise of the Lullu**The Lullu were resilient and adaptable. They tilled the soil, mined gold, and constructed monumental structures. Towering **ziggurats**, erected in reverence to the Annunaki, served as energy hubsbridges between Earth and the heavens.As humanity flourished, so did their curiosity. Enki, seeing their potential, shared forbidden knowledge: writing, astronomy, and agriculture.They must thrive, Enki argued. For they carry a part of us.But **Enlil**, Enkis pragmatic elder brother, saw this as a grave mistake. They are tools, not kin, he declared. Knowledge will only breed defiance.--- **Conflict: The Great Divide**Empowered by Enkis teachings, the Lullu began questioning their servitude. Small uprisings erupted, shaking the foundations of Annunaki rule. Enlil, alarmed, called for drastic measures.The humans must be reset, he proclaimed. Their defiance threatens our mission.The council, weary of unrest, approved **a great flood** to cleanse the Earth. But Enki, unable to forsake his creations, secretly defied them.--- **The Great Flood**As storms gathered and oceans swelled, Enki sought out **Ziusudra**, a wise and virtuous man. In whispered tones, he warned, Build a vessel. Gather your kin and the seeds of life. A deluge approaches, but you must endure.When the floodwaters consumed the Earth, Ziusudras ark carried the remnants of humanity to safety. The world they emerged into was desolate, but hope endured.--- **Departure and Legacy**The flood fractured the Annunaki. Many, led by Enlil, returned to Nibiru, vowing never to interfere with Earth again. Yet Enki, burdened by love for humanity, chose to remain. Wandering the Earth, he became a figure of legenda teacher cloaked in myth.Under his guidance, humanity rebuilt. The ziggurats became temples of knowledge, and Annunaki technology, hidden beneath the sands of time, continued to shape civilizations. Across cultures, their story transformed into myths of gods who created and guided humanity.--- **Nibirus Return and Humanitys Future**Every 3,600 years, Nibirus orbit brings it near Earth. Ancient texts speak of cataclysmic events tied to its passingfloods, earthquakes, and the rise and fall of empires. As humanity peers deeper into the cosmos, we edge closer to rediscovering our origins and confronting the eternal question:Are we alone, or are we the heirs to a legacy written in the stars?","title":"Most of the Population will definitely fall for it: They will DEMAND to be protected by a \\"World Government\\""},{"text":"Just found out that my dads \\"vaccine side effects\\" from his 2nd Pfizer shot, including: dizziness/loss of balance and extreme chronic fatigue/brain fog, were actually a silent heart attack.

I was talking to the PMC/MSNBC crowd the other day and this topic came up. They were bragging on how with Bluesky they could control what they heard by blocking anything they didnt want to hear. Its all about controlling what they hear, see, and read. That is anti-science and anti-truth IMO, and thats not good.\\n \\n I finally heard enough, and made a huge mistake. I told them by going to a platform (or whatever) is like the digital equivalent of stuffing you head up your rear end. Oh boy, that didnt go over well. I asked why not take the information we have (no matter where it comes from or what it is C science or whatever) and throw it on the table and have an adult conversation about this in the search for the truth.Those are clearly better arguments than what liberals are offering. That person critical of liberals for their echo chamber is clearly offering a better argument. Whether you want to pretend otherwise is another matter. How could anyone objective see the liberal as having the better argument in the above passage, when the liberal sees the ability to not see Opposing points of view as good? Donald Trump supporters are some of the dumbest motherfuckers in the nation.You can't expect to treat people with contempt and expect their support. You can't say \\"I have your best interests at heart, but I think your are an idiot\\". There were perfectly valid reasons to go for Trump. Let me give an example:https://lesleopold.substack.com/p/the-revenge-of-the-deplorables For me, the symbolic turning point was the Harris campaigns pathetic response to the John Deere companys announcement about shipping 1,000 jobs from the Midwest to Mexico.  Trump jumped on it right away, saying that if Deere made that move he would slap a 200-percent tariff on all its imports from Mexico. If I were a soon-to-be-replaced Deere worker, that would have gotten my attention.\\n \\n The Harris campaign responded as well, but not in a way that would convince workers that she really cared about their jobs. The campaign sent billionaire Mark Cuban to the press to claim such a tariff would be insanity.   He and the campaign said not one word about the jobs that would soon be lost. Trump promised to intervene. Harris promised nothing.\\n \\n The sad part is that the Biden-Harris campaign could have at least tried. They had the power of the entire federal government. They could have cajoled and bullied, waved carrots and sticks. In short, they could have easily made a visible public effort to prevent the export of those good-paying jobs by a highly profitable corporation that was spending billions of dollars on stock buybacks to enrich Wall Street and its CEO.  Here was a chance to defend jobs against overt greed.  Instead, they essentially told working people that Harris wasnt willing to fight for those jobs.Do you have any idea how devastating being laid off is in a rural community where there are limited job opportunities? Trump, whatever his other flaws, at least pretended to care about those workers. Kamala couldn't even be bothered to do that.Also, food for thought - in your ideal platform, would this type of critique of Biden and Harris even be allowed?  The person I linked is an old school economic left wing writer. Not a Trump fan.","title":"The emergence of BlueSky is due to the liberals looking for an echo-chamber and their declining debate skills"},{"text":"I think you're hitting at something that's not often talked about, that in the political area being too strict on your own morals and values can actually be a detriment to your country.

I propose that people don't care much about policy.  Or experience.  Or the candidate's life story - in and of itself, anyway.  Or even their character.  My source for all this is Donald Trump being elected twice, but we can all think of other examples.  So, what do the people crave?*Vibes.*A vibe is *\\"a distinctive feeling or quality capable of being sensed.\\"* (Yes, it's in the dictionary now).  And voters, they can sense the kind of leader they want!  Just look at any video of a Democrat making a stirring speech, and I promise you'll see at least one '[this Dem] for President!' comment.  But most of those commenters couldn't tell you one fact about that Dem.  It's all vibes.  They like the feeling they get from that person.So vibes are pretty important.  But they can be a vector for anti-woman bias. And this will be an uncomfortable one because I'm not just ragging on the dipshits in the GOP.  On the subject of vibes, we've got to take a good look at ourselves.**Good vibes only?  Well...**So, what are the vibes voters want?  People will give all sorts of answers to this question - but, as with most things, you get the best answers when you're not directly asking the question.  How many times have you seen quotes or article titles similar to these real examples?* \\"Democrats have tied both hands behind their backs in the sake of bipartisanship, but Republicans have just used the chance to stab them in the gut while Democrats look on shocked. Instead of looking like fighters fighting the good fight, Democrats looks incompetent, weak, and like it is just a performance. Ive seen the Dems capitulate, go high, try to do the right thing, etc and just get kicked in the teeth\\"Wow, that's a lot of violent metaphors for politics, which is generally a non-contact sport.* \\"Ocasio-Cortez DESTROYS Meghan McCain live on air, gets huge ovation\\"There are lots of videos like this - AOC is a fixture of them, but so are lots of other Dems.* \\"How Democrats Fought Dirty and Won. They finally campaigned like Republicans.\\"  Actually, just Google \\"Democrats need to fight\\" or \\"Democrats need to fight dirty\\" and look at the results.  Note the general tone and the metaphors used.* 'Avenatti insisted on tough tactics, telling the cheering audience: I believe that our party, the Democratic party, must be a party that fights fire with fire and warned that for too long the party has had a tendency to bring nail clippers to a gunfight.'Astute observers will note that the quote is usually 'bring a knife to a gun fight', and ask what Mr. Avenatti meant by 'nail clippers'.  More astute observers will note that the crowd, presumably Democrats, was cheering at this.I could go on, but a quick way to get lots of praise is to demand a leader who will FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT, throw out the rules, and figuratively (I hope) murder the opposition.  But the people do *not* want someone who's timid, gentle, reaches out, and uses nail clippers.Let's dig a bit deeper.**Cracking the code**The words people use when talking politics aren't accidental.  They reveal what we value in our leaders.  To understand this, you need to understand gender-coded language.[Gender coding](https://www.simplypsychology.org/gender-codes.html) is the idea that certain traits and behaviors are viewed as male or female.  For example, being strong, tough, and decisive are generally male-coded traits, while being kind, inclusive, and thoughtful are generally female-coded traits.  Yes, it's based on stereotypes.  But stereotypes are extremely powerful, and even if they're bullshit, they heavily influence our thoughts.Those descriptions that get the people excited - fight fire with fire, kick 'em in the teeth, don't play by the rules, and destroy the opposition?  Male-coded as hell.Those descriptions the people hate - timid, passive, going high (when they go low)?  Female-coded as hell.\\"But wait, didn't you give an example of AOC DESTROYING someone?\\"  Yes, but it's not the gender of the person that matters here.  It's the gender they're coded with.  A woman can do male-coded actions and win accolades (sometimes, it's complicated, and it doesn't go so well if she DESTROYS a man with status in the system).  But men who exhibit female-coded traits?  Yeah, that's a one-way ticket to losing the respect of others, especially in politics.The point is: **often times, \\"vibes\\" is just another way of saying \\"male-coded behaviors\\".** Voters want someone who'll act like a MAN, and destroy the enemy in a MANLY way.  And we all know that this was basically the whole point of Trump for the GOP...but guys, all those examples I gave earlier were from people on our side.  We've got to talk about this.**So what?  What's wrong with male-coded behavior?**By itself, nothing.  It's important sometimes.  But if it's the only way you do politics, you're going to fail, and you're going to get to some ugly places.Think of your average political comment section.  When a Republican government passes a terrible law, what's the response? *\\"Why don't Democrats do something?  Why won't they just get tough?\\"*  Well, because getting tough doesn't stop a law when you don't have the votes, and you know it.  You can scream at and insult Ron DeSantis all you like, but it doesn't change the political process.  You can make a hundred big speeches, but it won't stop the process.  You can ignore the rules...until the courts smack you down and the bad things happen anyway, with you looking even dumber.  Same when Dems want to pass a law - you can't just grab a holdout and scream in his face until he votes the right way.  Adult relationships don't work like that.  But sometimes, a true warrior has a better way.  As long as you're the biggest, toughest badass on Capitol Hill.  And I'm not talking about the big, bald, bearded dude from Steeltown, or the former linebacker from Dallas.  [I'm talking about the five-foot-four old lady from San Francisco.](https://time.com/5832330/nancy-pelosi-obamacare/)I know, it's a long article, but if you want to see how to blend male-coded and female-coded leadership, Nancy Pelosi is the master.  She knew when to negotiate, when to compromise, when to empathize, and when to say \\"cut the bullshit\\".  And she's the reason half of you have health insurance today.  She convinced a lot of Democrats to sacrifice their careers for this bill.  In other words, she accomplished what a thousand tough-talking speeches and well-placed burns never could.**So what do we do?**Again, male-coded traits aren't bad in and of themselves.  But when we only value them, and discount female-coded traits, we cause a lot of damage.We ignore people who'd be strong candidates and leaders.  We alienate the growing number of voters who don't like the hypermasculinity of so many political spaces.  And we shut out the people who actually get things done.  If you volunteer, you know what I mean - try and remember the last phonebank you did that wasn't at least 50% women over the age of 60.  Not a lot of DESTROYING going on in those phonebanks, but you should thank them for those election wins you enjoy seeing every Tuesday night.Take some time to think about this.  Do you think male-coded traits are better?  If so, be honest with yourself.  You can't just turn it off.  But you can notice yourself making those judgments, and question them.  And from there, they get less powerful.  And then you can gain more respect for more people, and be a part of a movement that includes everyone.  Then we can win the gunfight, whether it's with fire or nail clippers.  (I don't know what that means, either, but I like the vibe of it!)**Questions to consider**1. Think of a leader you really admire.  How did they use male-coded and female-coded traits in their leadership?2. Are there any other 'vibes' that voters seem to go for?  Do you think these are male- or female-coded traits?3. Any other thoughts?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 25, 2024"},{"text":"Just pick the guy who can get the billionaires on our side.

They are concerned that they may not be able to access the care they need or make the best choices for their health.Before the election, Planned Parenthoods four health centers in New Hampshire booked an average of 34 appointments each week for long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as?[intrauterine devices (IUDs)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/09/metro/iud-birth-control-hormonal-procedure/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), according to the organization. In the first week after the election, they booked 62 appointments, an increase of 82 percent.Demand for such appointments nearly doubled across the three northern New England states, according to Planned Parenthood data. There have also been more adult patients reaching out to talk about potential changes to the availability of gender-affirming care, as President-elect Donald J. Trump prepares to take office again.A spokesperson for the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts said there was a similar post-election increase in requests for IUDs in the Bay State, as well as a number of existing patients interested in having their implants replaced sooner than previously planned.Whats happening in this corner of the country reflects trends Planned Parenthood has seen nationwide, and the latest uptick echoes what providers witnessed after Trumps victory in 2016 and the US Supreme Courts 2022 overturning of federal abortion protections secured by Roe v. Wade, according to the organization.Democrats spoke often about reproductive health care while campaigning against Trump, and they highlighted his ties to those involved in the Heritage Foundations Project 2025, a blueprint for conservative leadership during Trumps second term.The incoming president has sought to distance himself from Project 2025, and?[there is some daylight](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/aug/20/how-accurate-are-warnings-by-democrats-kamala-harr/)?between what he said he would do and what Project 2025 says should be done. While the project says the federal government should reject the idea that abortion is health care, for example, Trump has vowed to veto any federal abortion ban. While the project recommends that the Food and Drug Administration reverse its approval of mifepristone, a medication used in abortion, or impose tighter restrictions, Trump has said he wont block [the abortion pill](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/28/trump-abortion-pill-pregnancy-debate).

It's less apparent when the values are shared like \\"Murder is bad\\" but you can't get from objective fact to action. You need to want something, to value something.2) There's no objective source of values based purely on science or observable fact. Lot of people like to think their values are objectively true, both from religious or secular perspective. But you can't empirically measure \\"the correct moral values\\". It's inherently a subjective issue.3) The moral values of religion are historic formalizations of moral thought, but ultimately they came from the same kinds of places all of our values come from. Moral intuitions and traditions mostly informed by our biological and cultural history. You could formalize them in terms of a million philosophical, anthropological or psychological systems but they're all coming from similar places.So that gets us to- when someone says something like \\"I support policy X because my religion says it's the right thing to do\\" it isn't really very different from someone saying \\"I support policy X because it's the right thing to do\\".Now in practice, when we tend to TALK about religion informing policy decisions, we're often talking about values where that religion conflicts with the values of those outside of it. But at it's core that's not really different from any other policy where the values driving it conflict with values others have. And other than policies which explicitly impact religions directly, most of the same conflicts can and do come from other sources.Christians don't have a monopoly on homophobia. Governments which were aggressively secular have often persecuted gay people just as terribly.Clashes of values are different than disagreement on facts, even though they tend to overlap. But religious value differences aren't inherently different than secular value differences. In many places at many times in history, people have found the moral inspiration for policies you probably like based on their religion.","title":"CMV: Politicians who vote against policies on religious grounds are no different to those who use pseudoscience to justify their stances."},{"text":"Maybe he should test his methods in red states first, where he will certainly get more support.
