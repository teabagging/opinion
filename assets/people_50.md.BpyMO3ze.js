Yanno, like all the videos of poll workers suspiciously covering every possible area where someone outside might take a peek at what's happening inside right as poll workers get the boot so the poll workers could close up shop for the night. or watch the countless videos of poll workers, mailmen or other govt officials throwing out ballots, ripping up or shredding ballots, even lighting ballots on fire while they record themselves giggling as they monologue on how awful X canidate is. just the simple fact that a state like California legally prevents a voter from even voluntarily showing ID to vote SCREAMS massive fraud - as Joe Rogan said about 100 times during his podcasts last week... what other reason is there to not require identification? other than making cheating possible. the entire election \\"your vote counts!\\" gimmick is complete theater to begin with imo. the real rulers of our reality would NEVER leave it up to chance, even if the US President is merely a puppet they control. this cycle made it super obvious that the canidates are selected for us and they always just happen to align on all the REAL major issues (support Israel, support Ukraine, don't talk about elite/govt child trafficking, don't legitimately investigate obvious criminals who've been in govt positions for 5 or 6 decades straight, or alternate between govt official and employee of the industries they were just in charge of regulating) - just like when Trump last won, instead of \\"drain the swamp\\" he immediately filled his Cabinet with mushbrain psychopaths from the Obama, Clinton and Bush administrations (HE LITERALLY HIRED JOHN BOLTON FOR GOODNESS SAKE!) or how Trump shamelessly pushed the mRNA gene therapy under a \\"vaccine\\" costume and TO THIS DAY has yet to admit the vaccine is 100% bullshit and deadly, even lying to us that he was completely manipulated and had NO idea (yeahhhh, right.)Anyone with a brain who's lived through multiple administrations can plainly see... despite all the campaigning bullshit the candidates spin endlessly.... nothing critical EVER changes. Clinton, Bush and Obama all just coincidentally waged the same wars against the same \\"axis of evil\\" - Iraq, Syria, Libya, Aghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Yemen, etc. Even mr. \\"no new wars!\\" Trump didn't utilize the power he had to immediately cease our drug smuggling or whatever the point of Afghanistan was. No one ever audits the Government's spending or dares even utter anything about the Federal Reserve or our debt-slavery economy. Trump threatened NATO and the UN so they'd cover their fair share..... and didn't utter a single peep about the creepy way we endlessly do Israel's bidding like a do-boy or. No President from either party ever bothers to look into why so many \\"public servants\\" on limited salaries somehow manage to increase their net worth 10-50x while \\"serving\\" in Congress or other high lvl positions. Shit, not a single peep about Epstein or all the psychotic, LITERAL EVIL, anti-humanity activities carried out in secret by our intelligence agencies, including regularly breaking the law to target Americans in America.this election was more one-sided, but if elections were 100% legit...why don't we EVER see a *true* landslide? How has California never voted 60/40 in favor of a Demonrat? Why doesn't Florida or Texas, red to the core, ever vote Republican 5 or 10 to 1? Just like polling for the last year.... they always seem to coincidentally wind up with merely 1-5 points difference... seriously? ALWAYS? EVERY. SINGLE. POLL? As the internet has taught us, many times people voting for a thing will hive-mind support the ironic or meme option in overwhelming numbers.... yet it never happens in US elections? Why haven't we had a dominating write-in victory by Ass-y McShitTits or something else 4chan-y? If any of this actually mattered, the elites ruling over us would NEVER even give us an opportunity to potentially throw them a curve ball. Out of the literal tens of millions of Americans that could end up running for President throughout America's history.... how does ONE family tree just magically happen to produce almost every single elected President...? Even more strange, the vast majority of (western) world leaders all just magically branch off the same family tree? So many of them literally groomed for their position of power since childhood.... I'm sure there's nothing to say that should be a statistical impossibility..Trump is sooooo \\"outside the system\\" and a \\"rogue populist\\" who does what the people want...! Like... pardon Julian Assange...? Or idk, even something so painfully obvious and simple like say.... firing Fauci when he was blatantly lying and propaghandizing ad-nausem during his daily covid pressers, while pushing a literal mRNA gene therapy that ALTERS YOUR DNA and was NEVER tested on human beings and in ALL animal testing, the shots had catastrophic results?Or idk.... you're only the PRESIDENT... I'm sure there's literally nothing Trump could have done to prevent tyrannical state leaders from using the full extent of their power to punish evil terroristic Americans for daring to *gasp* walk their dog outside, totally alone? THANKS FOR KILLING GRANDMA YOU SELFISH PRICK! Meanwhile those same tyrants were caught repeatedly literally laughing and making fun of us for obeying the same foolish rules they never followed. We knew exactly what covid was from the word GO - Alex Jones, love or hate him, literally gave the game plan before the first peep about \\"corona virus\\" appeared in America... and the pandemic followed that script to the letter.... at any point, if nothing else, Trump could have gotten in front of a live mic and explained the same things Alex Jones did, taken directly from the papers and speeches of the very same demons carrying out the pandemic. If you have to pick trash or garbage, I guess Trump is the best of the most terrible options.... but you're only foolin yourself if you think things will truly change or improve, he may take us down a different route... but you can bet your ass we'll end up in the exact same place Kamala or Biden or any other puppet will take us. Trump isn't going to tear apart the CIA or FBI down to the framework, he isn't going to thoroughly investigate our many corrupt politicans, he isn't going to 100% end Ukraine and Israel \\"aide\\" ASAP and he isn't going anywhere near our debt based banking system, the FED or the many shadowy wealthy dynasties that have controlled society from the shadows for literal centuries at this point.But hey! At least with Trump, things will certainly be infinitely more entertaining while we're racing down the dead end tracks on our way to WW3 or some other catastrophe the elites seemingly anticipate happening at some point between 2025-2030, for which they're actively preparing for and not uttering a single word of warning to the plebian masses (which would help explain why the *Deagle Report* estimated the US and all Western nations populations suddenly dropping by ~70 percent without any explanation next year - https://seemorerocks.substack.com/p/is-the-deagel-reports-2025-depopulation )ENJOY THE SHOW!!","title":"Tonights results make me wonder if in fact the 2020 election was stolen"},{"text":"Lol.

A. They need to actually reconnect with the voting public. This is evident in a lot of places. Trump used propaganda yes, but it was really how spread out it was. His face was everywhere, he had rallies all the time. The people he wanted in office faces were everywhere. Media about him was literally everywhere. The Democratic Party, as much as it sickens me to say, should take a page out of that book. Send out things by mail to get your voters engaged. Hold events so that your people think their voices are heard. B. They need to get rid of the bad image that the Republicans have given them. Yes, a lot of people can say they changed how they were voting after Trump's last attempt, but it clearly didn't change enough people's minds. That combined with the smear campaign, our party leader being constantly seen as an aging relic and lackluster performances from our elected officials, has lead to a sort of bad image. They need to do more things to better their image and get people to think of them as a genuine second party again, instead of this bs \\"them vs. us\\" mindset that's been going on since 2012C. We need a strong party leader, and actual candidates. Kamala Harris did well in many respects, but the fact that her campaign was shorter then most ever are definitely did not help in this regard. We should not have put Biden up as a candidate this time around, or honestly the previous time. A little controversial, but double that for Hillary Clinton as well.D. Weak leadership. Our leaders need to grow a spine and fight back against all of this stuff that's been thrown at them. The Republican Party is strong because it is united, and it has leadership that is willing to fight with numbers to get what they want. The Democratic party has had a lot of infighting as of late, and does not put out a steady message. See Tim Walz saying the Electoral College needed to be disbanded, and then the campaign having him retract that statement ASAP.To continue on with point D, I think we need to take these next four years and strengthen and unite our party. Once we do that, we find someone who is a capable leader, and ready him or her to run for president. Make him or her the public face of the party so that the public recognizes them. do work to actually improve the middle class, and blue collar workers lives. If we can do that, I think we could finally have a Golden Age of the Democratic party.","title":"How do we get back on track?"},{"text":"The message just didnt resonate well enough w/ the masses &amp; most importantly didnt motivate enough supporters to the polls.

Not that they should be entitled and given what they want, etc, but that they've seemingly been caught between a (valid, but then overly generalized) indictment of toxic masculinity on the left, and an acceptance of said actual toxic masculinity on the right.Women's rights are absolutely crucial, and as the father of a daughter, I mourn what I'm seeing. At the same time, I think there is a degree to which the conversations have become exclusionary to young men, and that might even be valid in the abstract, but which has left them no place. The right wing manosphere welcomes them, and gains another convert.I don't think the answer is to give up on women's rights or to give these men more privileges, but I think there is a very real void of positive masculinity and a place for these young men on the left that let's them be both accepted and positive parts of groups. Unfortunately, the toxic version of these things are also easier, it's so much easier to be entitled and then to simply be angry when you don't get what you want, so I don't know what the answer really looks like here, but I think this is a key aspect of the right wing propaganda machine you're describing.To be sure, there are others (it's not all just young people nor men who get sucked in after all) but this seems like such a strong funnel.I have a son as well as a daughter, and I ponder and worry about this because I want to protect them both from these phenomena.","title":"Democrats feel 2016 all over again in Harris-Trump battle"},{"text":"This is what the mods allow in this sub","title":"Kamala has a chance!

Europe (and the EU) is a unstable conglomerate of protectionist, dove states that lives under America like those toxic \\"welfare queens\\" tv programmes. New business is non-existent. They are outcompeted by most the world. Their armies exist largely on paper. Not one of them has the intelligence or bravery to do anything when a threat emerges.Poland and the UK are arguably the only states in Europe that stand a chance (UK for it's economy, Poland for it's \\"I hate Russia\\" stance\\"). Every other nation in Europe will succumb to Salami tactics, foreign interference and general malaise of not being the one to cause \\"aggression\\" by standing up for themselves.As much as Putin and other authoritarian leaders are morally wrong in their actions, I've come to the realisation that none of that truly matters. From the moment we hit our ancestors over the head with rocks, the Right of Conquest has been one of the main laws that govern our species. The only reason America is so powerful is that it uses it's muscle to get what it wants. It would seem that muscle is losing to brains.Democracy was an experiment and it has failed.

We won't have the final numbers for a few weeks, but it seems clear overall turnout was down considerably. Trump might get close to his 2020 vote count, but Harris lost a ton of Biden voters. Racism and sexism is probably partially a factor, but honestly I think many will agree that Harris wasn't great at articulation of the administration's achievements or defending areas that haven't gone as well. I think she improved in speaking compared to her 2020 primary campaign, but that's not a high bar to be better than. For perspective IMHO Harris isn't even in the same ballpark as Obama whereas delivering effective speeches. It isn't necessarily that voters won't vote for a non white candidate, Obama proved that many will, but that you need to be effective an explaining things. Harris was never great at that.","title":"Trump likely to win popular vote by at least 1%"},{"text":"Obviously, this was the work of racists and sexists...","title":"Trump wins Pennsylvania!"},{"text":"Revenge is at hand.","title":"Vote Trump...For Peanut..."},{"text":"Dems just wasted 14 billion to get rinsed by baron trump and a squirrel ","title":"Trump has accepted his loss and called Queen Kamala our lovely future 48th President!"},{"text":"He won.

Great it took you 9 years to make a concept? Outsourcing our production was a devastating blow to our economyFirst of all, you clearly dont understand how competitive advantage works. Secondly, we bring manufacturing back to America, where are we going to get the workers to work in these factories? People cant even stay af Amazon, theres an insane turn over rate, let alone make a T-Shirt. America is at 5% unemployment rate. America is not good at producing clothing and other cheaply made items. Look at Tesla as a great example, most of it is made and assembled by robots, not humans. Also 3 CEOs have already said theyre just going to pass the tariff cost onto the consumer and their competitors will do the same. Do you know how much an American made polo cost? $75. You can get that polo for less than $30 at some stores. Now polos all cost $65-70. So guess what happens? Hardly anyone buys polos because they cant afford it, then guess what the company does? They dont order anymore and manufacturing produces very few products because the demand is low. Manufacturing lays everyone off and so does the retail company. Congratulations youve brought back American manufacturing where nobody can afford the products and since nobody can afford it, nobody is buying it, and because nobody is buying it, they stop making it, since no product is being made people arent getting paid, people arent being paid, they arent spending money, no money is spent no economic circulation is happening, were in a recession. her economic plan would end America.You realize over 20 Nobel prize winning economists signed off on Harris plan. These people do analysis on the economy for a living and have won Nobel prizes for it. You think youre smarter than them? Theyve studied thousands of hours in economics and you think you just know better than them. Theyre called experts for a reason. You dont tell LeBron James how he should play basketball. Were already in a recessionWere actually not in a recession. S&amp;P 500 is near all time highs, weve had 2.4/3% GDP growth in the last 2 quarters but keep talking like you actual know and understand anything. Just because you feel like were in a recession, does not mean were in a recession. We will be in a recession and trust me youll hear about it. Trump businesses vs stock hoardingThe argument isnt whether he hired people or not, its on the face value of his business practices and production. He has lost several business so those employees didnt stay for very long. Trump steaks, Trump vodka, Trump board game. People were all hired to create those businesses and let go shortly after it was dissolved. Its almost like discussing whether an Athlete is good or bad at this sport and youre basically saying well at least hes entertaining, like yeah but his team sucks, they never win anything and the fans dont really spend money on team merchandise because they suck.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"Biden and Harris have left American hostages in Gaza for over a year and done nothing to get them back.","title":"Congratulations to Trump, first candidate to win the election 3 times"},{"text":"Congrats now keep covering yourself in shit XD","title":"The race tilts towards Trump - can Harris still win? - BBC News"},{"text":"Wait until you find out that the 20-30million number was made up just to win the election","title":"what will be the first item on trumps agenda?"},{"text":"Aged like milk!!","title":"Kamala has a chance!

I'm just pointing out that if you asked the people claiming that there's a genocide whether the population of Gaza has been growing or shrinking during this conflict, you can bet they'd all be wrong about that basic fact.As bad as this war has been, most of the people I hear talk about it (including in this thread) are wildly underestimating how much worse things could be, in part because they have been misinformed about how bad things have been so far.","title":"Trump appears close to victory, promising to reshape the United States and its relationship with Israel"},{"text":"Hopefully Dems realize Israel isn't an ally to the United States but just Republicans.","title":"Netanyahu and Orban lead congratulations to Trump"},{"text":"It feels good to be unburdened by what has been..","title":"Anyone else just feeling a relief?"},{"text":"What policies caused this, and what trump policies will end this?

Trump has Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Let's not forget a major aspect of this.Donald Trump didn't just clean up in the Electoral College (or will, when the remaining states are officially called).  It's not just that Kamala Harris is a woman.  Yes, there are eerie similarities to 2016, with both of his opponents being women and getting over 300 electoral votes both times.  But to say that the reasons for Trump winning both times being that the Democrats ran women is missing the fact that the electorate blamed Democrats (not the women that ran for the presidency) for the direction the country was going in.  Before we blame this on Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris, ask yourself what other Democrat would have won in 2016 and 2024, all other things being equal.  This is not much different from 2008, when voters blamed George W. Bush, and no Republican (even if John McCain picked a better running mate than Sarah Palin) would've won.  Quite frankly, the incumbent party is what was blamed all four times (2008, 2016, 2020, and 2024).Also, it wasn't just Kamala Harris that lost (or will soon officially lose). The Republicans mopped the floor in the Senate races.  This was a repudiation of Democrats overall.  The Democrats still do have a chance of narrowly winning control of the House (that's still up in the air), and that will be crucial.  But it still won't stop Trump and the Republicans from advancing their agenda via executive order and in the Senate (confirming judges and Supreme Court justices), it will only stop most legislation from being passed (at least without significant compromises from Republicans).The Democrats lost, quite frankly, because voters thought that the country is moving in the wrong direction.  It doesn't matter what the current inflation and economic numbers are, it's what voters perceived them to be.Hillary Clinton was criticized after the 2016 election for not campaigning enough in the most critical battleground states, and for making missteps during her campaign.  Kamala Harris was different on both counts, she made appearance after appearance in battleground states in the days leading up to Election Day, and made no major blunders in her campaign.  The results weren't any different.I proudly voted for Kamala Harris and am liberal in my politics.  I am despondent right now.  But I have to be fair and call it like it is.Finally, let's also not mince words: Trump may end up winning the popular vote, something I never thought was possible.  If he does, that means that literally, a majority of the voters preferred him.  That speaks volumes.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"LOL that won't happen.

I am prepared to be attacked but I think this is the truth Dems need to come to terms with and I will fight to keep making the party I identify with better.I think fundamentally Trump won in 2016 and 2024 in the same basic way. He found a group who largely were not voting, largely felt hopeless and felt honestly correctly in my opinion that neither party cared about them. Then he went to them where they were and said worry not I am here for you. I care about you. And just that was enough. In 2016 that was blue collar workers in the Midwest who have watched their towns destroyed by globalization and opioids. He met them where they were by holding rallies in their towns. Places that hadnt seen a presidential candidate in years. In this election it was young men. And he met them online on various podcasters , twitch streamers and of course again his rallies.Now look I dont want to say young men necessarily have it worse than x or y group. It is objectively pretty fucking dim for them for a lot of reasons though. Whether its suicide rates, highschool and college graduation rates, struggles to find a partner , and poor job prospects and a future. These are of course all connected and I deeply feel them myself. I see them in the people I work with at my company and others. And the response I see from Dems and my liberal friends is often lacking. At worst it blames the men for their own troubles and at best its says you need to vote to care about this other groups issue.Now to be clear I did in fact vote for Harris because I do care about other issues and didnt think Trump has any plan to actually help. But this clearly is not a good electoral argument.What Im worried about is that Dems will simply decide that it was only sexism and never run a women again. Dems cant blame this on voters . It , the party , needs to actually and think about how to appeal to groups it either took for granted or just assumed would never vote.","title":"Republicans capture Senate majority"},{"text":"You mean the BLM rioting, right?","title":"Trump official won.

You people will do anything to prevent a women prez huh..."},{"text":"Im post the real answer here and as many places as I can. I am prepared to be attacked but I think this is the truth Dems need to come to terms with and I will fight to keep making the party I identify with better.  I think fundamentally Trump won in 2016 and 2024 in the same basic way. He found a group who largely were not voting, largely felt hopeless and felt honestly correctly in my opinion that neither party cared about them. Then he went to them where they were and said worry not I am here for you. I care about you. And just that was enough. In 2016 that was blue collar workers in the Midwest who have watched their towns destroyed by globalization and opioids. He met them where they were by holding rallies in their towns. Places that hadnt seen a presidential candidate in years. In this election it was young men. And he met them online on various podcasters , twitch streamers and of course again his rallies. Now look I dont want to say young men necessarily have it worse than x or y group. It is objectively pretty fucking dim for them for a lot of reasons though. Whether its suicide rates, highschool and college graduation rates, struggles to find a partner , and poor job prospects and a future. These are of course all connected and I deeply feel them myself. I see them in the people I work with at my company and others. And the response I see from Dems and my liberal friends is often lacking. At worst it blames the men for their own troubles and at best its says you need to vote to care about this other groups issue. Now to be clear I did in fact vote for Harris because I do care about other issues and didnt think Trump has any plan to actually help. But this clearly is not a good electoral argument. What Im worried about is that Dems will simply decide that it was only sexism and never run a women again. Dems cant blame this on voters . It , the party , needs to actually and think about how to appeal to groups it either took for granted or just assumed would never vote.","title":"Donald Trump to Win Pennsylvania, Fox News Projects"},{"text":"When will they run an actual progressive populist?

Most ICs are decent people and don't treat others wrongly. It's the hiring managers who should have to deal with this. So making everyone fill out some fake \\"how they helped the company's DEI goals\\" every performance review is absurd. Not to mention many companies are giving bonuses to managers for hiring women over men. The way to fix any perceived imbalance is to get more women in STEM classes, not give leniency in skills or amount of work performed for one set of the population.Plus look at trying to get a job as a fresh grad these days. Apply to 200 places and nothing, while companies give out as many jobs as possible to H1Bs that they can deport if they don't do as told. And then companies lie about looking for local candidates first. And in tech companies Asians now dominate and are the majority, not the minority. Asian managers hiring *only* Asians. that's not diversity and an insult to the local population. Our immigration laws need reform as they only benefit corporations, not citizens. Canada is just as fed up with the drastic influx they can't really deal with in a fair manner for everyone. And Canada is the H1B loophole to import more than the quotas allow in the US.

Outsourcing our production was a devastating blow to our economy and self-sufficiency. Like it or not, but there is no such thing as fair competition with literal slavery such as China.[tariffs] will put most Americans into an economic hardship and America as a whole into a recession if he imposes tariffsSome prices will rise, yes. But bringing productivity back here is a massive boon that will outweigh that cost in time.We are already in a recession.Theyve looked at Donald Trumps inherited net worth and ultimately determined he wouldve been richer if he just put his money into an index fund instead of trying to go into business, so hes a horrible businessmanCan't jump straight to that conclusion, unfortunately. Business regulations are utterly absurd and obscenely expensive.Also, how many jobs would he have created if he simply invested it? The guy single-handedly shifted industries. Would you prefer that for president or a stock hoarder?[Trump] wants to give police qualified immunity so they can shoot at you if they feel even slightly scared.They already have qualified immunity and no he doesn't want what you claim.Yet people still voted for him.Turns out most people aren't terminally online redditors.

Biden very publicly announced that his VP would be a woman long before choosing one. She's literally a diversity hire.Id say a fair amount of men dont want a women leading their country.Women rarely lead anything successfully.Theyd rather vote for a convicted felon than a woman with a real economic plan.Better a convicted felon than an unconvicted felon.Also, did you even *read* her economic plan?

It doesn't matter whether George Floyd was a boyscout or an asshole, simply by virtue of him being human, we're inherently more suspect. We don't know all the facts, but maybe he was a bad dude, maybe he was guilty, maybe he was innocent in this case but had done bad things previously, maybe he was innocent but just a complete asshole. (I don't mean to suggest any of that was true of George Floyd; rather, any of those could be true of *any* human whom we don't personally know.)And so, there is an inherent suspicion that maybe some part of what happened to him might not have been entirely unjustified. (Again, not saying that *was* the case, but that is the subconscious analysis that I think we make when judging *any* unknown human.)But Peanut...   was a squirrel. He definitely *could not* have done anything bad because he was not sapient. All he did was sleep, and cuddle, and bury almonds in his owner's pillow, and do tricks for treats, and just be a generally happy little friend.For a creature meeting that description to be violently executed by the government in his own home for no reason sickens us to our core in a way that no tragedy an adult human stranger faces ever could, because we know, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that Peanut *could not* - not just probably did not, but literally could not - have deserved it.","title":"Peanut the Squirrel (RIP) makes Fascist MAGA Republicans finally care about victims of police violence"},{"text":"The Dems had better fucking contest this instead of rolling over.","title":"Donald J.

Zelensky gets assasinated because the administration leaked his whereabouts; Taiwan potentially gets abandoned as an appeasement to China and Netanyahu gets a free pass to do whatever he wants in Palestine and Lebanon. The Gaza Strip is effectively over and the West Bank will be targeted next. 2. Because people bought into the why cant we spend that aid money here quip, we will cease sending old equipment overseas and using the cash to replace it with updated weapons and tech produced by American defense contractors located throughout the US - this will culminate in layoffs at companies like Lockheed Martin and even companies like Oshkosh corp as contracts will dry up reducing the need for workers. 3. If the tariffs on all imports thing happens, Europe will employ their retaliatory plan thats been in the works for like a year. The ramifications will be immense on the economy and on peoples wallets. Even a 10% tariff will have immense impacts on groceries and electronics, as we rely on fertilizer imports due to our limited potash resources. We will be the ones paying it and the retaliatory actions of others will only compound the costs as producers and suppliers pass the additional costs down to us - the consumers. 4. Rising bubbles with property and health insurance and rural healthcare will go unresolved. Rural healthcare and health insurance are at the brink because of shifting demographics and a population that is getting older and sicker. Property insurance is struggling due to hurricanes and wildfires with most major companies pulling out of Florida and now parts of the west coast, with many of the remaining companies being ill equipped to handle disasters. The downstream impact has been rising insurance costs for everyone and this issue is going to hit a boiling point within the next 2-3 years. 5. If Paul Ryans tax plan, signed by Trump, is any indication, any income tax cuts are only going to be temporary and at the expense of a higher deficit while simultaneously resulting in fewer (and worsening) services. Tax credits and discounts will be cut or reduced like last time - namely the PMI and local tax deductions while taxes are incrementally increased on the lower brackets over the span of a few years. If I recall, the lowest bracket expanded from 9% to 11% after about 3 years, with various cuts expiring for the higher, middle tier brackets while the upper brackets saw their cuts increase and then become permanent. Ideas already proposed, like no taxes on tips and overtime, will reduce the amount of OASDI taxes meaning fewer funds for social security and Medicare. This will probably prompt congress, if fully controlled by the GOP to cut these programs at the expense of the elderly and the disabled. Given that most boomers are not even remotely close to being prepared for retirement, while many others are relying on shaky pensions, the impacts will be immense and will take a toll on younger generations who have may have to support their parents and their own children simultaneously. This new standard may even make generational households a common thing in the US, resulting in fewer children which is a common problem in much of the first world and one that has a lot of sociologists and economists worried about the future. 6. Education and teachers will continue to be attacked. I dont foresee the department of education being cut as suggested, but the long term result and divide between the rich and the poor will be a combination of education and networking. The top will embrace a form of doublespeak, telling the bottom not to trust their kids schools nor teachers while simultaneously sending their own kids to the best schools available. The end result will be that the educated will herd the ignorant as a true elite and those aware of this will arguably have an easier time rising to the top if they can sacrifice all notions of empathy, prior to profiting off of the stupid, both directly and indirectly.","title":"Donald Trump wins 2024 presidential election, defying the odds again"},{"text":"Hope it's the tarrifs and bring America to its knees","title":"what will be the first item on trumps agenda?"},{"text":"This isn't about becoming more positionless, it's about removing conflicting positions that scare off voters from entering the tent because no one wants to be near crazies.Go onto leftist subs like the deprogram, top posts today were saying how they couldn't wait for trump to lose so that American capitalism would collapse and western democracy would fall.

Trump got lucky in 2016 by hedging his bet on 2 states, campaigning in mostly those states, and it paid off. Him winning in 2016 had nothing to do with her gender. Pure luck. Kamala was just a bad pick overall and the campaign was run poorly. Democrats didn't even vote for her - she was selected and forced to be the nominee. Her brief campaign was not focused enough on the economy. While voters care about social and reproductive freedom, they care harder about being able to afford groceries and surviving. Trump was smart this cycle and pinned the bad economy on Kamala (even though it was the pandemic that caused inflation). He made the economy his #1 talking point. Kamala's campaign made the economy her #299 talking point. Bad choice. She needed to do more to assuage the populations fears, and come up with a solid plan on how she was going to fix the economy. She never came up with anything substantial.\\nDemocrats had this shit figured out 32 years ago. Bill Clinton? Hello. \\"It's the economy, stupid.\\" - Carville.

And among minority communities, the belief that the police aren't going to help them is stronger than any other group.It sounds harsh, but spending massive amounts of political capital on banning AR-15s because they kill about 400 people a year on average is extremely unproductive.

States that want to resist will probably be able to do so, states that don't are already going the way Trump will want them to go anyway. I expect **rampant inflation** from policies like tariffs, deportations, threats to the federal reserve, etc. I legit fear if the worst idiots end up in charge the end goal is to intently trash the economy so hard they can peg the dollar to crypto. If the Fed is allowed to operate normally, which is the best case scenario, there will be a massive recession because they to have to hike interest rates. Gaza is **fucked**, I hope the Uncommitted Movement is happy because they're getting their genocide. I wouldn't be surprised if it starts before Trump even takes office. Ukraine might cling on depending on what Republicans in Congress do, but they are in deep trouble. I doubt there will be a rise in a Chinese world order though, I think their economy will collapse as the US economy falters. I fear they will make neighbors a scapegoat and start a hot war. The ACA is getting cut down. They've promised that for too long, if Republicans fail to gut it it's too much failure to deliver on their promises.I wonder about student loan borrowers. The SAVE plan is dead, but I have to wonder if the lawsuits pushing to end all loan repayment plans will prevail. If people suddenly have to pay more on loans, that will be political poison for Trump and Republicans so they may back off.I think the people who will be hurt the most will be blue collar workers in red states, farmers, seniors on social security, and gig/transient workers everywhere. However, I do expect political retribution against states like California and substantial financial burden on the states that give up federal funds to resist Trump policies, so it's not like people in blue states will be hunky dory.As for \\"the end of democracy\\" and dismantling the federal government, I have to hope that Trump won't care once he's pardoned himself of any past or future crime.","title":"2025 Predictions"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|IQBk8kjeueJW3DLiNJ|downsized)","title":"Vice President Harris will not talk tonight"},{"text":"Trump could make human sacrifices out on the front lawn of the White House every single day and as long as everyone's immediate human needs are met, he would be the President for Life. **What you are really fighting is basic human selfishness to take care of oneself before anyone else.**Please don't shoot the messenger, I don't like him either.","title":"Former and future president Donald J.

We find that the US import tariffs were almost completely passed through into US domestic prices in 2018, so that the entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers up to now, with no impact so far on the prices received by foreign exporters. The deleterious impacts of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in 2018 have been largely in line with what one might have predicted on the basis of a simple supply and demand framework.

Remember, this is the GOP thst argued against real-time fact checking in debates. So what ends up happening is that the Republicans isolate and indoctrinate a large portion of the population, democratic political leaders are too afraid to do anything that brings consequences because they fear the backlash from the right media machine (which only emboldens and makes the right media stronger), and then the democratic base gets frustrated and contributes to the division by taking out their frustrations on both Republican politicians and voters. The number of times people have mentioned Republican voters as morons or uneducated tonight is off the charts.  That was not the response to take. As for fixing it, there's no fixing it. The Republican long game has completely come to fruition with the sweep that happened tonight and it's the tipping point of no return. Remember when Trump had officers fire rubber bullets on BLM protesters so he could have some faux religious photo op? Get ready for that with every protest as soon as he's in office and fully expect real bullets to replace the rubber ones before his first year in office is over.

Hoping beyond hope and buying into your own propaganda thinking she could actually win, even by a landslide. Now it's the night of the election and you're sitting in your cuck cave in defeat knowing everything you did in the last 4 years was for absolutely nothing.

They use data to stoke populism and outrage, pushing simple, emotional messages that resonate more than any carefully thought-out plan ever could.Meanwhile, candidates with real, good-faith plans are at a disadvantage. Concrete, detailed ideas dont get the same media traction as sweeping, emotional slogans like well rebuild this country.

He always had a very deliberately intelligently crafted persona that's just a little high brow, but comes off as warm and personable, less like a skin suit wearing politician and more like a regular human being. Albeit his had a definitely intentional vibe of like, wise movie character who gives advise to the protagonist at a random laundry mat vibe to it.Trump has a more \\"guy at the bar who didn't take his pills\\" lean which is probably authentic.\\nAnyway shit I went too verbose on that alreadyThat's why he appeals to his base, he's conservative Obama, seriously. It's not that hard to see if you understand conservatives and shift your pov into their shoes tbh.\\nNow as to why he won. People wanted and change and Harris was not a sufficiently large break from the Biden campaign. If a Democrat had gone through a relax primary and we'd gotten someone other than Harris I think that would have made the difference. Intentionally distincing from Biden might have done it too.Harris had like 2 concrete policy positions, just agreed with conservative lies on our border issues, and used Biden's achievements for everything else. It didn't play well.\\nConservatives having a long term dedicated and successful plan to radicalize young men with billions of dollars supporting it over decades and democrats having literary fucking nothing on the flip side didn't help.\\nEdit: my post covid aphasia fucked me up on this post hut I'm too tired to fix it.","title":"Trump win Pennsylvania!

In particular all the talk about rounding up certain groups of people into camps was just bizarrely off the wall compared to the actual positions discussed and supported by conservative politicians. Similarly there are many conservatives who would go off the rails rambling on about how liberal politicians were \\"communists\\" and forcible indoctrination of children, both of which are equally wild and untruthful characterizations of actual policy positions.Political literacy is at an all-time low it would appear, with regards to the average person both knowing and understanding the position opposite their own.","title":"Your 47th President: Donald J.

And not only in terms of Pennsylvania. Hes a famously a moderate. So that would have signalled to the American people that she is not the San Francisco liberal that Trump said she was, but she went with someone actually to her left Minnesota, Ms Li told Fox News.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-showing-early-signs-of-winning-election/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-showing-early-signs-of-winning-election/)","title":"Donald Trump declares victory as early results point to landslide"},{"text":"Better send the ghouls","title":"Kamala 2032 will demolish trump out of the waters.
