Projecting deterrence next door is just naturally cheaper than projecting that same level of deterrence from across the ocean. A lot of US defense spending is also not geared towards Europe.

Historically, periods of heightened global tension have often led to increased military expenditures. Furthermore, it's worth considering that the original purpose of NATO was not only to reduce individual defense burdens but also to provide collective security. In this context, a significant increase in defense spending might be a necessary evil to ensure the alliance's continued relevance and effectiveness.Europe isn't going to have the luxury of spending the money after a conflict starts to stop it.

While President Joe Biden is not exerting himself to help get a deal during his last month in office, the biggest victim of this weeks funding fight is almost surely Trumps agenda.Even before Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance followed billionaire supporter Elon Musk by delivering a last-minute blow to a bipartisan government funding deal, it was clear that Republicans decision to negotiate over only three months of funding would be damaging. That length of a short-term spending bill will force the GOP to juggle federal spending alongside Trumps other priorities.And no matter what length of a funding bill eventually passes, Democrats will have leverage when it expires, on funding and the debt limit.

Chevron is *huge*.  303 is bigger than you expect, it paints with a broad brush, slap dash.  Dobbs is peculiar in that it demonstrates the politicization of the court.    The case with the praying football coach irks me because the judgement ruling is a naked no sell of the fact pattern.  The presidential immunity case feels really dangerous.   If you're a constitution 1st, individual 2nd, etc, the POTUS immunity extent gives extraordinary power to the federal executive,  which seems inconsistent with your hierarchical preferences.   That ruling jumped POTUS waaaaay up your chart.  I don't understand why you think the appointment process is unresponsive to jurisprudence? Or how it's undemocratic?Fair.  My communication bad.  My argument about jurisprudence should have been consequent of lifetime appointment.   If a Judge does bad judgment, there isn't reasonable friction remedy.  Impeachment is technically a remedy,  but it's too high friction.   And for democratic, again,  bad communication,  it's lifetime, mostly.   A judge is appointed by potus, confirmed by senate.   A quick side eye at the dissolution or abrogation  of Statesmanship, now politicized.  But it's lifetime.   How many voters voted in a Judge that was doffed 30 some years ago?  That Judge is still there,  most voters didn't vote for that Judge, that Judge is beyond democracy. We seem to agree more or less on term limits.  High fives!  While I would certainly appreciate the input of the magical time traveling FFs, 18 years seems like a good balance of immediacy and legacy.  I think the vetting of judges is wanting,  it's weird that an individual who will wield tremendous power for how ever many years, can be publicly vetted in a month, or whatever. ...I think my main point again is the structural meta.  If something is built, the US, using the framing elements, the pillars, including very much the constitution, and if it's flawed *but it can't be fixed*, you can't just keep building on it.   If there are cracks,  and they're propagating, that's an issue.Either there's renovation, or it'll collapse.   (There are plenty of other criticisms I have beyond the constitution and SCOTUS,   but SCOTUS is a pretty big deal, and we got Angel Hernandez on the crew.  Rules about balls and strikes don't matter if it's lifetime appointment Angel Hernandez)","title":"CMV: Special Counsel Jack Smith voluntarily dismissing the Trump indictments after the election was a mistake and a dereliction of his Constitutional duty"},{"text":"If my nan had wheels shed be a bike.

Much too late and barely loud enough to be reported on. But again, a redeeming fact. If he'd done it on day one, and continuously, and if he'd pressed it, and if the press had been willing to report it, Democrats might have won another term. Since 1968 they've run away from the New Deal. They ran away from Obama Care as soon as they passed it. They may have been willing to impeach Nixon but we'll never know. They let Reagan and Bush Jr. get away with appalling crimes agains their office and against the American people. They let Wall Street get away scott free after 2008. Dominion's case against Fox was begun instantly and settled in two years. The man appointed by Democrats to run the DOJ slow-played all the federal cases against Trump and he'll get away with all of his crimes. Every one.

If they are departing en masse, then that should quell the arguments, though the US will see an economic effect (beyond any philosophical debate).  Also many are going offline.

You are not uniquely immune to propaganda.The only way to be a \\"centrist\\" in a two party system like ours is to not have principals. Are you pro choice or pro life? For progressive taxes or flat taxes? Welfare spending or lower spending? If you do not come out on either side with these issues then you lack principals. And yes you can come out on the right for some issues and left on others, but there are certain staple principles that really decide what side you come out on. Your principals have to have priority. If you're pro choice but also into fiscal conservatism, you have to decide which issue is more important to you. And imo if fiscal conservatism is more important to you than a woman's right to choose, sorry but by all accounts you are right wing. Centrism isn't a position. It's a lack of position. It's political saving face because you are too afraid to commit to beliefs, principals and priority among your principals. If you want I can list 10 issues where I come out on the right wing side of the aisle, but I am no centrist. I am a liberal, a progressive, and a Democrat. My principals dictate opposition to white Christian nationalists and corporate oligarchs higher than other political priorities. If you do not oppose white Christian nationalists and corporate oligarchs with your vote then from my perspective you are right wing. Now I acknowledge that other people are going to have different perspectives but my point is that centrism is not a position. It's a way of hiding your true position because you are too cowardly to admit it to yourself or defend it from assault by others. In my opinion if you do not actively oppose white Christian nationalism you are a bad person. You deserve to answer for refusing to oppose them. \\"Centrism\\" is not a get out of jail free card. You cannot say \\"well I don't like what Democrats are doing on issue xyz therefore I don't know who to vote for.\\" If you are voting for Republicans over Democrats then you are telling me that there are other principals that you hold higher than opposing white Christian nationalism. And in my opinion that makes you right wing. This is why \\"centrism\\" is a psyop. It allows you to privately hold right wing beliefs that oppose the basic social decency that is demanded by the left.","title":"CMV: Special Counsel Jack Smith voluntarily dismissing the Trump indictments after the election was a mistake and a dereliction of his Constitutional duty"},{"text":"\\\\#EveryAccusationIsAConfession","title":"Major Trump donors who complained of immigrant invasion used Mexican workers illegally, sources allege"},{"text":"Right, because in 200 years the people making the rules didn't imagine that the voters would be so stupid as to be tricked by a liar and a cheat.They were more concerned with making sure the government couldn't exclude someone by bringing false charges.

I'm probably most displeased with the absence of abortion and trans issues in their considerations, though I'm not surprised. I've always wanted to see more contributions from libertarian feminists in Cato. I think that would be a positive influence for how those issues are mulled over there. Maybe someday.https://preview.redd.it/5i4ihu76018e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca50d14e4c9aaba53711335418a7fbb59ef4924dThey're right. Price gouging is good in those scenarios, public opinion be damned. Now Cato probably isn't so hot about addressing those who miss out on affording those resources, but it's addressable within this sub's approach. Bans on gouging or not, we would want a govt emergency service that gets necessities to those who can't obtain them in a disaster scenario.I say it's better to let prices do their thing because it leads to allocative efficiency, since suppliers will work to provide more goods to take advantage of the higher price in that scenario. Yes, that means that those who can't afford that price will not be able to buy, but we can then cover the gaps with FEMA and the like. In the opposite scenario, a price ceiling that kicks in for emergencies will lead to perhaps a more \\"fair\\" distribution of goods based on who gets in line first instead of who is able to pay, but it still ends with a shortage of goods. We still have to use emergency services to get food and water to people in that case, and will likely have to spend even more money on them to make up for the slack left by constrained market supply.Just some food for thought.

While extreme wealth inequality can raise concerns about fairness and opportunity, many of societys biggest challengessuch as inadequate education systems, lagging healthcare infrastructure, or environmental degradationoften have root causes not solely driven by the presence of ultra-rich individuals. Structural inefficiencies in public policy, regulatory frameworks that fail to adapt, and deep-seated historical inequities all play significant roles in creating and sustaining large-scale problems.Additionally, the ultra-wealthy represent a relatively small subset of the population, and their individual spending or investment choices may not have as direct an impact on day-to-day life as public sentiment suggests. For example, the argument that billionaires hoard wealth often overlooks the fact that much of their net worth is tied up in companies or investments that, at least in principle, support economic growth, innovation, and employment. While theres debate over whether such growth always benefits the broader population, its not necessarily true that these substantial fortunes are simply sitting idle.Another point in this vein is that because the ultra wealthy is a small population they dont consume very much relative to their wealth. If their wealth was seized and distributed it would (a) lose tons of value because it isnt cash and (b) be very inflationary as everyone simultaneously increases their consumption Moreover, wealth concentration has been a feature of economic systems throughout history, and its direct impact on contemporary problems is not always as straightforward as it seems. In some cases, the ultra-wealthy champion philanthropic initiatives, fund research and development in critical industries, and drive technological progress. Its uncertain whether curtailing their individual fortunesthough perhaps warranted for reasons of fairness or fiscal resource allocationwould automatically solve systemic social issues. Many problems, like wage stagnation or the high cost of housing, involve complex market dynamics, outdated policies, or limited affordable solutions rather than just the presence of ultra-rich individuals.In essence, while it is entirely reasonable to criticize the effects of extreme wealth inequality and consider reforms (including tax adjustments or stricter antitrust measures), its not obvious that the ultra-wealthy, as a group, should be seen as the singular or central cause of most pressing modern problems. Other structural factorspolitical gridlock, outdated policy frameworks, globalizations uneven effects, and the rapid pace of technological changelikely play equally, if not more, significant roles.Thus, it seems very reasonable that people with very different social preferences would not ben agreement on going after the ultra wealthy.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"And here i thought they were ready to kiss president trelons ring?","title":"Young Republicans Gather, Ready to Make America Vengeful Again"},{"text":"Leaders need to fear the american people, not the other way around.

Past a certain point, dollars are just gold stars you receive from society for running big companies.Going from $0 to $10M makes a huge difference on your consumption. Going from $10M to $20M? Less so. Theres only so many meals you can eat in a day.This might sound like an insignificant detail. But then consider the whole notion of taxing the ultra wealthy to pay for everyone else. Does a few less dollars in Bezos bank account magically imply theres more goods Amazon can deliver to the average person?The money sitting in wealthy peoples accounts or tied up in financial assets isnt buying anything. Meanwhile, any income we give to everyone else (ordinary people) has to actually buy groceries and gas.The truth is that if we implemented a UBI tomorrow, and we funded it by taxing rich people or if we funded it by literally printing the money, the effect would be exactly the same. Either the economy could respond to the UBI by producing more goodsavoiding inflationor it couldnt. Because theres only so many resources to go around.Im saying: counterintuitively, taxing the rich is an entirely psychological benefit. It makes people feel more equal but thats all it really does. Marginal propensity to consume is already a kind of stealth limit on rich people hogging all the resources from the rest of us.Meanwhile, income in everyone elses hands is a huge material benefit and a huge real draw on resources. More spending power to people meaningfully increases their consumption and meaningfully increases the draw on available resources.From here theres only one logical question. How much consumer spending is too much? How many goods can the economy actually produce? If we lift the UBI, we can find out. We can increase peoples incomes until we discover the limits of total productivity.In other words, Left and Right should be united not on trimming the incomes of the 1% but boosting the incomes of the 99%.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"All for abolishing it.

These people arent hiding anymore, theyre openly calling for authoritarian policies, purges, and even violence. And were just letting it happen. This is the point where history screams at us: RESIST!Weve seen this movie before. If you dont recognize it, crack open a history book,?or just read testimony from anyone who survived 1930s Germany or Mussolinis Italy. Theyll tell you: it didnt start with concentration camps, it started with apathy.The question isnt, Is this fascism? The question is, What are we doing to stop it?

If Republicans suddenly embrace the current inflation rate, media will change their narrative from \\"prices are still high and people are feeling it\\" to \\"prices increases are back to normal and people are feeling better\\".Corporate media makes a lot more money when Republicans are in power, particularly one that generates so much controversy. The other major factor is, as mentioned above, Republican views on the economy are entirely dependent on who's in office, and are well-conditioned to dismiss evidence in favor of memes in their echo chambers. Views from everyone else are far less dependent on that. There's a large contingent of Democratic voters who are always negative on the economy, viewing it through income disparity and many living paycheck to paycheck don't see many positives. So collectively, that also influences media narratives to cover Republican presidents positively and Democratic presidents negatively.","title":"The latest U.S. GDP report card suggests Trump is about to inherit a healthy American economy before making sweeping changes to it"},{"text":"Can someone explain this to me:Ultimately the only way someone can *make* you pay your debts is by using force.

Where should the buck stop otherwise?I'm troubled by a few things here. /1  SCOTUS doesn't have a particularly good track record with interpretation of the Constitution.  Given the inconsistency of rulings, the inconsistent arguments given in rulings, and the gaps between purported judicial philosophy and the arguments,  I think SCOTUS has not demonstrated that the institution is up to the task of arbitrating the Constitution I think you have a bias where you only pay attention to controversial rulings. The court is consistent on the majority of law./2  the process of SCOTUS appointment is simultaneously abstract and unresponsive to jurisprudence or democratic ideals.  Lifetime appointments has not demonstrated that Judges are insulated from political interests while simultaneously insulating them from accountability.   While I agree lifetime appointments are a failed control on political interest, I don't understand why you think the appointment process is unresponsive to jurisprudence? Or how it's undemocratic?/3  the process by which cases are heard by SCOTUS is too long, non transparent, and biased.  There's plenty of history where legislation is passed where it's apparent that the legislation is unconstitutional but it can take years before a law is struck down.  Or not, sometimes struck down PDQ.  Who knows what secret the shadow docket holds?  And entities with deep pockets, including private organizations or State interests are unduly privileged in spamming the courts seeking an outcome.Totally agree. One of the biggest problems is that many unconstitutional laws are kept from being challenged by only being used to charge unsavory characters or to be dumped in a boat full of charges to someone who will plea out.

It simplifies a rather complex process and makes it much easier to understand.  However, I'd like to offer some clarifications and commentary.**What Your Analogy Gets Right:Spending vs. Paying the Bill:*Your central pointthat the debt ceiling is not about giving the government permission to spend new money, but rather about allowing the government to pay for spending that has already been authorizedis essentially correct. Congress approves budgets and authorizes expenditures first. Once that spending has been set in law, the Treasury is obligated to pay the resulting bills. The debt ceiling then comes into play as a separate statutory cap on how much the Treasury can borrow to fulfill those already-approved obligations.In that sense, refusing to raise the debt ceiling after having approved spending is like buying groceries on a credit card and then later refusing to pay the credit card bill, even though you deliberately chose to incur those charges.*Historical Routine Nature of Raising the Ceiling:*Historically, raising the debt ceiling has been a routine and non-controversial measure. It wasnt until around the 2010s that raising the ceiling became a contentious political bargaining chip, introducing the real possibility of default as leverage in negotiations.**Where I Think the Analogy Oversimplifies or Misses Nuance:\\"Debt Ceiling as the Agreed-Upon Balance\\" vs. \\"Credit Limit\\":*In your analogy, you say the agreed-upon credit card balance (like $2,000) is the debt ceiling, not the credit limit. In reality, the debt ceiling functions more like an artificial credit limit that Congress imposes on the Treasury. The U.S. Treasurys ability to borrow is not limited by credit markets (it can generally borrow much more at low interest rates due to the U.S. governments economic standing) but is artificially restricted by law. In a household analogy, it would be as if the parents themselves created a rule saying, \\"We will never let our credit card balance exceed X,\\" even though the credit card company would let them borrow more. Its not just a number to pay the current months billsits a statutory cap on total outstanding debt.*Congress vs. Executive Decision-Making:*The analogy frames the suspension of the debt ceiling as handing over full decision-making to \\"Mom,\\" implying no checks on spending. In reality, even when the debt ceiling is suspended, all spending must still be enacted by Congress through the appropriations process. A suspended or higher ceiling doesnt grant the Executive Branch unilateral authority to spend unlimited amounts; it simply allows the Treasury to issue debt as needed to cover the costs of legislation already passed by Congress.*Attributions to Specific Individuals (Trump and Musk):*The mention of Trump and Musk pushing for no checks on spending doesnt accurately reflect mainstream policy proposals. While some have called for eliminating the debt ceiling as a recurring crisis point (including fiscal conservatives, liberals, and various economists who view the process as unnecessary theater), thats not the same as endorsing unlimited, unconstrained spending.

The clerk from the previous congress, Kevin McCumber, summons the incoming representatives, and then runs the process of voting for their Speaker.  They can't do any other business until they elect a Speaker, who then swears them in, and then they go about adopting rules and then can operate.  Without this happening, there is effectively no serving House of Representatives.On Jan 6, there's supposed to be a joint session of congress, where the Speaker of the House is required to invite the Senate into their chamber, and the VP (Harris) oversees the certification of the electoral college.  While this is mostly a ceremonial process, it can't happen if there is no serving House of Representatives.  This means, according to the 20th amendment, there is no president-elect (nor vice president-elect).Now, on Jan 20, Biden's term is done.  He can't just stay in as president.  But, everything I'm reading says that in the case of no president-elect (and no VP-elect), the rules of succession come into play when Biden's term ends.  Since there's no VP-elect, it falls next to the Speaker of the House, which doesn't exist, so it then falls to the president pro-tempore of the Senate.  Since the Senate has \\"standing\\" rules and always has at least 66 Senators who were already sworn in (though all 100 should be sworn in on the 3rd because the Senate operates continuously) it can swear in its new members and elect president pro-tempore, which presumptively would be Senator John Thune.","title":"Mike Johnsons Speakership Has Crashed and Burned"},{"text":"They pretty much have to get every Republican in the House on board to elect a speaker with only R votes.

Maybe a better example would be Charles Manson? To my knowledge, he never actually killed anyone but used his influence and charisma to get others to do it for him. I think most would agree a substantial punitive response is warranted for someone like that, regardless of which side of the left / right spectrum you sit on.Your definition makes no account from people not showing up or producing what they agreed to produce etc. It's not at all clear how a \\"fair\\" wage for a part-time is even definable, given that it can't meet all your needs. Or how workers in some place and fields are far more scarce at any moment than other workers, and how one would address such shortages without market prices. Presumably some central planner deftly reallocates workers throughout the land.I'm framing most of my points from an high-level, ethical perspective rather than an economic one. I'm not doing that to try to soapbox or sound superior, it's just how I think about these issues. I guess my answer to the question of 'extra value' would be along the lines of: if your business idea doesn't generate enough wealth to pay your workers a living wage, then maybe it is not a sufficiently valuable idea. This may even encourage innovation.By the way, you may not realize it, but your definition is close cousin to the \\"surplus value\\" idea, where all profit is deemed theft from the workers (but strangely, losses need never be reimbursed by the workers). Both definitions require defining value in an exchange beyond those doing the exchanging. But exchange value is inherently subjective, as judged by the parties to the trade. None of our business.Well I guess I would (at least try) to distinguish my points by saying that they could fit within the framework of a free market, all it requires the establishment of a set of common values. If we fundamentally believed that paying a living wage to all workers was just part of the cost of doing business then there is no need to start appealing to flawed communist ideologies.","title":"CMV: Tariffs actually (politically) progressive"},{"text":"No, the rich are always making the decisions instead of politicians.

Following Covid credit debt among Americans skyrocketed, home refinancing that got hammered by interest rate changes have been utterly devastating.

Sorry, I thought bullying typically involved physical altercations, at least that's what I endured.  Yes, there are lesser things best termed under \\"talking shit\\", but not identical with bullying.At a personal level, where by punishment we mean *only* the exercise of our voluntary discretion, say by speaking out against, discrediting, and disassociation/ostracizing the \\"bully\\", then of course we should do this kind of thing and not accept poor behavior.I contantly see moving of the goalposts on the left, especially with the known meaning of words, to be applied much more expansively than in the past, to gain the moral authority of a great violation of human behavior over a lesser one.   The actual value is determined by the practical outcome for the workers. If it results in them having their basic needs attended to, without needing to work excessive hours or in inhumane conditions, I would say that is the baseline of 'fair'. That's not exchange value, which is people making a deal, peacefully.  If what you offer as a worker isn't sufficient to tempt someone to pay you what you want or you deem to need, then you won't get that without violence.  Your definition makes no account from people not showing up or producing what they agreed to produce etc.  It's not at all clear how a \\"fair\\" wage for a part-time is even definable, given that it can't meet all your needs.  Or how workers in some place and fields are far more scarce at any moment than other workers, and how one would address such shortages without market prices.  Presumably some central planner deftly reallocates workers throughout the land.  Economic activity must somehow be coordinated.  Markets are a decentralized way.   \\"Fairness\\" requires centralization, at least of your standards, and people may not violate those standards.  I don't see it as ever fair for me to apply my personal standards to what deals another must never accept.  Who am I to interfere with someone who wishes to sacrifice pay to work in their desired profession (instead of working retail or schlepping lumber on a job site) or with desired people.  Life is full of critical tradeoffs.   And who am I to ban actual employment for an ex-con who wants to improve himself but no one would ever willingly pay the going rate offered to non-ex-cons?  People make serious errors of judgement, and are rightly less valuable on the job market after.  But that does not mean zero value.  Your standards would like make whole classes of people unemployable.  Just like the minimum wage.By the way, you may not realize it, but your definition is close cousin to the \\"surplus value\\" idea, where all profit is deemed theft from the workers (but strangely, losses need never be reimbursed by the workers).  Both definitions require defining value in an exchange beyond those doing the exchanging.  But exchange value is inherently subjective, as judged by the parties to the trade.  None of our business.","title":"CMV: Tariffs actually (politically) progressive"},{"text":"True Canada is going through a lot itself currently!","title":"Whats something youre excited about with Trumps presidency and something youre worried about?"},{"text":"I don't see why \\"trolling\\" necessarily means it isn't true.  \\nSomething can be true and can also be used as a way to mock or insult somebody.  \\nYou can make somebody with a true statement and also enjoy an antagonized reaction.","title":"Dems Troll Trump by Saying Elon Is in Charge"},{"text":"Trumps lack of a robotic politicians filter is certainly refreshing ??","title":"Whats something youre excited about with Trumps presidency and something youre worried about?"},{"text":"I'm excited about lower taxes and deregulation, it could boost the economy.

Gingrich frequently questioned the patriotism of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States.

We can use your example of a \\"degenerate spender\\" or whatever to understand what the debt ceiling really is. This gentleman has decided to rack up more spending than he makes in income, mostly because he has purposefully limited his income to please his bosses (tax cuts that largely create the deficit in the first place). The spender has good credit because he is known to pay his bills on time so he can take out loans at a low interest rates and takes advantage of this fact to cover the rest of his costs, to balance his budget. So where the debt ceiling comes in is an artificial threat to not pay his bills that he's already obligated to pay, including his loans. If he was ever to go through with this threat the interest rate of further loans would skyrocket increasing the amount he would have to spend enormously. The spender (congress) knows this so he never actually goes through with this threat, but every year he puts on an impressive theater for his bosses, and sometimes the display is so impressive that our credit rating actually decreases slightly anyway, costing all of us money. The spender could ask his bosses for more money (tax increases) or cut discretionary spending (not SS or Medicare), or grow his business (economic growth by itself can partly resolve deficits as it did under Clinton), but the debt ceiling does none of this.

Some of the most oppressive regimes were run by so-called leftists in the name of the people. Take the Soviet Union for example, great idea in theory, horribly oppressive in practice.

This is what you wanted, America. Eat it.","title":"Poll: Much of the public disapproves of Elon Musks role on Trumps team"},{"text":"OK, you seem to be arguing for constitutional supremacy.I'm troubled by a few things here. /1  SCOTUS doesn't have a particularly good track record with interpretation of the Constitution.  Given the inconsistency of rulings, the inconsistent arguments given in rulings, and the gaps between purported judicial philosophy and the arguments,  I think SCOTUS has not demonstrated that the institution is up to the task of arbitrating the Constitution /2  the process of SCOTUS appointment is simultaneously abstract and unresponsive to jurisprudence or democratic ideals.  Lifetime appointments has not demonstrated that Judges are insulated from political interests while simultaneously insulating them from accountability.   /3  the process by which cases are heard by SCOTUS is too long, non transparent, and biased.  There's plenty of history where legislation is passed where it's apparent that the legislation is unconstitutional but it can take years before a law is struck down.  Or not, sometimes struck down PDQ.  Who knows what secret the shadow docket holds?  And entities with deep pockets, including private organizations or State interests are unduly privileged in spamming the courts seeking an outcome. /4 vagueness in the constitution is not a feature.   If a particular wrinkle was written vaguely,  cases and rulings inevitably sharpen the definition and import.   So while an ammendment (say) is vague, the reality is the ruling case specifics, all the previous cases in the vicinity, and whatever downstream norms are developed.  Instead of being easy to understand,  it's ridiculously labyrinthine and reflexive,  requiring abstract and tenuous connections on top of abstract and tenuous decisions,  and so on.   If your hope was \\"to be understood by a regular citizen\\", it's obvious that it's a capital F fail.  And!   That's presuming of course that Stare Decisis is a principle.  But it's a vague principle!   It matters until it doesn't.   If it's convenient. ...So, a word about power.  I hope you found some of my criticisms resonant,  they aren't particularly novel nor controversial.   The problem is,  whatever distortions exist, if those distortions result in an imbalance of power, and if they power benefits the arbitrators of the system, you're screwed.Anyways,  Hi!  I'm Canadian!  (Sorry).  And because we have a different system, Westminster, we have our own entrenched systemic deficits which can serve as an example,  which will help depoliticize any excitable Americans.   Hopefully! We've got parliament, and we've got the House of Commons,  kind of equivalent to the House.  We've got a Senate too, although ours is very different in practice.   It's a lifetime appointment by the plurality party,  not direct election.  Ostensibly the senate can (and occasionally does) veto legislation.   It's frequently lauded as \\"the house of sober second thought\\", trustworthy and noteworthy statesmen and women, free of the tempest of political winds du jour.Yeah,  well, about that.   The Senate used to be called the House of Lords.  Like, the aristocrats, people with castles and estates and shit.  Lifetime appointment, naturally.   And they can reign in the uppity \\"people\\" trying to be democratic.  OK, but that was back in the day.   And I'm meant to talk about entrenchment of power.What happens today is it's a dumping ground of patronage and levered as a cushy cover for premium insiders.  There have been senators who used the title, the salary, the extensive perks, and just became fundraisers and political operatives, highly coordinating with whatever party.It would take pretty heavy government surgery to excise this tumor, but the legislative capital to kill the cancer,  ehhh, too expensive,  better is just to fill vacancies with their own preferred flunkies, and kick the can down the road.My own biases are obvious.   But I hope I explained sufficiently that you can see it's nigh nigh impossible to expect a positive change because it requires a party to damage their own agency to fix it.(Quickie side note, Canada's Supreme Court is no where near as controversial as SCOTUS.  I think the difference is political cultural norms in this area.  Thank God CSC is boring and kinda normal)Anyways,  \\"fixing\\" scotus and the constitution in the US isn't possible anytime soon.

Think of it in terms of power. The ownership of massive wealth grants a person incredible power, power that they can exert over you, a business, the government, or our entire society if they have enough of it. Whether or not you think it affects you, it does. And there is little to nothing any of us can do to effectively challenge that power if and when it negatively affects us or our community.What if a company decides to start polluting your Iand because it saves them money? What if a billionaire buys up your local factory and shuts it down because it's a competitor? What if your job is cut a few years from now because a robot is invented that saves executives a few bucks and they'd rather pocket the difference they save by not paying you anymore?Because they own things, because they have access to huge amounts of capital, they can do all this, they can ruin lives and loot our country, and it's all fully legal. And if it isn't legal they just spend millions of dollars legally bribing politicians until it becomes legal. This class of people is filthy rich and more powerful than any of us will ever be, because on some spreadsheets on Wall Street or corporate headquarters, there are big numbers next to their names. Not because they work hard or earned it or deserve it or were chosen by the people.The point is that that sort of power shouldn't exist. It's bad for our entire country and for the world. I'm okay with people being rich, I think some people work hard for their money. But being well compensated as an inventor or artist or athlete or skilled professional isn't the same as manipulating the entire economy to serve you and extract as much money as possible from hundreds of millions of other people, consequences be damned.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Except that President Musk owns the platform this would trend on and it wouldnt serve his interest.The absolute horseshit that he pretended to care about free speech","title":"Colbert Embarrasses Trump for Bowing to President Elon"},{"text":"Dumb question but if it happens will the government shut down be midnight going into Friday Dec 20.

Its absurd. Its a farce that theres a poll at all.","title":"Poll: Much of the public disapproves of Elon Musks role on Trumps team"},{"text":"This post is already a few days old by the time I got here, but let me try.THESIS:**Your position is actually still too mild,** as it acknowledges retaliation for only the \\"exceptionally horrible\\". I would say **most people aren't nearly violent enough against *any* evil**. Smaller evils included.STEP I. REDUCING SUBJECTIVITYTrying to draw the line between \\"exceptionally horrible situations\\" and not-as-bad situations raises the question of what determines something as \\"exceptionally horrible\\".I know people would say it's subjective, but for the sake of trying to argue your case as far as we could get it, we'll go with a definition that removes **ommission bias**: \\"true evil\\" or \\"exceptionally horrible\\" evil is evil that is:- meaningless\\n- *practically* unhelpful, and \\n- avoidable. To apply this definition, we can see how rape meets all three criteria, child molestation meets all three criteria, but manslaughter for revenge--does not meet the first criterion and therefore less evil.Even though, unlike the other two, manslaughter does not allow for *any* chance of the recipient of evil at *any* quality of life to subsist after harm is enacted, and would be considered by Kantianism as inherently more evil, with omission bias removed, it is actually a lot less evil.But here's the thing: even if this definition reduces subjectivity and aligns all sorts of evil into a line, how do we determine the **cut-off**?STEP II. FINDING(?) A CUT-OFFWouldn't it be better, instead of this black-and-white model, we acknowledge it as a spectrum of gray, and acknowledge proportionate* retaliation all throughout the spectrum of evil** as valid, even for smaller evils like annoying your sibling for no reason? Assuming that squirting glue on their chair is not already retaliation for something they did last week, annoying your sibling is meaningless, practucally unhelpful, and avoidable. Small evil, yet still entitles the recipient to retaliation.STEP III. ON THE CYCLE OF RETALIATIONOf course, the keyword here is *proportionate* retaliation. Someone in the comments mentioned the **fundamental attribution error** as an argument *against* retaliation, but I present it here as an argument *for* it. Pre-empting your fundamental attribution error creates a feedback loop.If we hone our skills at gauging how proportionate retaliation is starting from an early age, then by the time we are capable of systemic harm as adults (we gain positions of authority, legal privileges granted to our age, etc.) we would already have a solid habit of being careful.**Because any *excess or disproportionate* harm we cause is *no longer* retaliation,** the excess *converts* into *unnecessary avoidable harm* and entitles the other to their turn at retaliating. And because we don't want that, because we just want it to end, we will do our best to ensure it is always *proportionate* so that our turn is last.How do we do ensure our turn is last? Instead of suppressing our capacity for harm of any size, not honing the muscle that lets us calibrate it, we instead get very *attuned* with it...in a way more visceral than thinking about abstract morals.- We recognize our capacity to do harm instead of underestimating it. - If we underestimate it, our recipient will make us feel it.**It is no longer how you feel vs. how your victim feels.**When retaliation is swift and transparent, we associate the two. It's as close as we could get as feeling our victim's pain without having to be selfless. We don't need to be selfless to understand pain. **Through receiving retaliation, we literally feel it as our own pain.**SYNTHESIS:The issue with retaliating only against bigger evils:- It does not create an **internal attunement between how we feel vs. how the recipient of our harm feels.**Evil people who want something will always think they're willing to pay the price for it, until they get surprised someone actually takes up their right to retaliation. But since the evil-person-with-a-goal already went that far, they don't see the retaliation as a reaction to something they did. They see the retaliation as a hindrance, and their wave at squashing retaliation as the reaction.They don't *feel* themselves as the instigator they are.They are not *attuned* because they got away with so many smaller evils before. They didn't feel pain when the other gets hurt, because non-retaliation shielded them from that.**If retaliation only happens for only the biggest evils, then it is already too late to create that attunement.**My point here *isn't* that EVERYONE needs the risk of people retaliating against them, just for them to not do evil. Some people are more empathetic than others, even if they can get away with being bad. My point here is that retaliation creates attunement within THE UNEMPATHETIC PEOPLE WHO, for whatever reason at all, NEED IT. And you offset that need by starting small.Inspirations for these thoughts: learned cognitive empathy, Satanic retaliation, and Satanic non-instigation.","title":"CMV: Most people aren't nearly violent enough against true evil"},{"text":"Oh they've all been at the same Eyes Wide Shut parties","title":"Musk joins Bezos and Trump dinner at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"We can hope, though a lot of these fools are of the \\"Look what you made me do!!\\" persuasion...","title":"As 'Republican Shutdown' Nears, Dems Say 'Hell No' to Trump-Backed Spending Bill | \\n\\"They're cutting healthcare to kids because Elon gets his money from defense contracts so they'll never touch the military budget,\\" said Rep.

Strategist, immaculate exacting.She is the goddess of heroes. Only the great and mighty have a chance to catch her demanding eyes. Athena doesnt listen when my heart aches with fury, when I am begging for justice. So I turn to Ares. Ares gives hope and strength to the righteous. He inspires the rebellious. When Athena is deaf to our pleas, Ares embraces us. With his anger, I revolt against injustice. With his resilience, I fight against despair. With his strength, I hold onto my ideals even on the brink of madness. He might not be reasonable, wise, or cautious. But he does not forsake us.

Yeah that's the entire point. If you can establish a system that effectively and fairly determines between unpreventable and reasonably preventable illnesses then there's argument to not include the latter but generally one point of human society is to say \\"Hey kid born with autoimmune issue, you still deserve to be treated even if your parents are poor\\". That's part of why people really despise insurance denials as a concept, they can have some usage as a resource rationing tool but at the end of the day people are rather sympathetic beings to at least *some* degree and they don't like seeing innocents suffering that much.Cato really loves their \\"but the private industry/charity will just do it instead\\" when it comes to things like welfare and health but given that charity is failing to fill in the gaps *as is* (despite the job being made easier), it's hard to see that happen easily without any government coordination to get past the multipolar trap issue.","title":"CATO's Freedom in the 50 States: Positions of Orthodox American Libertarians"},{"text":"Trump is leading nothing.","title":"Trump team affirms hes leader of GOP amid President Musk barbs"},{"text":"Correct.

The jury did find that Trump raped her. Saying \\"he was found liable for rape\\" is true semantically; it's just not true in the legal sense, due to NY state's narrow definition of \\"rape.\\" That's why Trump's countersuit was thrown out - the judge actually said that \\"the jury found that Trump raped her.\\"I think the most likely explanation is that GS was just talking about it like a normal person would. Trump was found liable for forcibly digitally penetrating her, which is rape, so he was found liable for rape in that sense. That being said, journalists should be precise, especially with legal stuff.It's also possible that he genuinely thought he was found liable for rape in the legal sense, although that seems unlikely.I think the odds that he was lying are virtually zero. He knows how litigious Trump is and he could have made him sound way worse without opening himself up to a lawsuit.*\\"Both the judge and the jury found that Trump raped her. He forcibly and digitally penetrated her. He is on tape admitting to this kind of behavior.\\"*That's accurate and sounds way worse. So it just wouldn't make sense to lie. He's a complete scumbag and is not above lying, but there was just no incentive for him to do so.Nancy Mace tried to say he was incorrect but he kept talking over her and insisting he was right.She didn't correct him the first few times. She just said \\"it was a civil court.\\" After she corrected him once, I think he said it one more time. It was a pretty heated exchange so I think it's reasonable to assume it just didn't register.It's kind of like all the conspiracy theories during Covid. Are pharmaceutical companies evil? Yes.

A lot of Republican congresspeople are in districts that won't tolerate fucking them over too hard - hell even a Republican can replace another Republican. And if there's anything a GOPer loves is their own power. We're about to see a congress that can't afford more than one vote defection. Until they fill the seats that are being vacated - at which point it will be \\"can't afford more than two\\" that's a lot of power in the hands of a member of the house. All it takes is that person doing the simple math that they are the one in power not the unelected billionaire immigrant.","title":"These 38 Republicans voted against the Trump-backed spending bill"},{"text":"Hope that app notified his kid about it.","title":"38 House Republicans Give Trump the Finger in Shutdown Vote.

It's just that a lot of people ~Identify~ as Republican and so vote accordingly. Others care so much about a specific issue the right supports (banning abortion, gay marriage, etc.) that it's worth giving up that other stuff.Personally, I think the left should focus way less on equity concerns and way more on workers' rights. I think the past ~3 elections have made it clear that Americans just aren't voting on the basis of equality. It should be part of policy, but it shouldn't be what politicians are campaigning on. It isn't what gets votes.Yes, I care about women and gay people and such. ...But I care more about everybody--including them--being able to pay the bills and not suffer massively at work.EDIT: The automod removed this for mentioning people who deal with dysphoria involving their gender identity, so I edited that out.
