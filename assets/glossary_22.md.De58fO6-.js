Practically the SCOTUS really doesnt act like congress where they have clear party affiliation. Chief Justice Roberts has sided with liberal judges many times, and sometimes even Justice Barrett or Justice Kavanaugh. Also, this EO seems to violate 14th amendment so blatantly that I expect a lawsuit to follow soon and federal court to issue a restraining order on acting this EO before SCOTUS has decided. It would also be very hard for SCOTUS to actually grant this EO based on 14th amendment I suppose. The 14th amendment says:All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.The key is subject to the jurisdiction thereof. Now the illegal aliens may be a grey area, but legal aliens like students or temporary workers are explicitly told to obey US laws when entering US legally. If overturned, does this mean that they dont need to pay taxes or following any laws in US? Does this mean that US citizens can violate their rights without facing consequences? This would be a massively consequential action for SCOTUS if they grant the EO. Thus I am still hopeful that SCOTUS will deny this EO, at least partly for the legal aliens.","title":"Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"San Francisco becomes Saint Francis","title":"Trump signs executive order withdrawing from the World Health Organization"},{"text":"Thanks.

Reporters were clear with the populace about what was going on in concentration camps and to the Jews, but most Americans didn't care because it was so far away. The Allies were concerned the US would enter the war on the sire of the Axis, FDR was afraid of a coup if people realised how much aid he'd given the Allies, and there were marches literally tens of thousands strong to support the Nazis and celebrate their invasion of Poland. It wasn't until Japan declared war and Germany followed that things began to change. It took US troops and reporters seeing first hand what was going on to really shift attitudes.The great lie came in the aftermath of the war, with Hollywood and your education system selling the idea that the US had always opposed the Nazis because they were ashamed of supporting some of the greatest monsters in history.  And the world simply let you do it because it was more important to have the US on side. Just like it was more important to allow the myth of the clean Wehrmacht or Rommel to perpetuate and save face.Pointing this out gets you shouted and downvoted into oblivion, because for generations the US has been taught, and has believed, that they were the good guys and always opposed the bad guys.Meanwhile, the upswing in US facism has coincided directly with the WWII generation dying off.

They can launch investigations into enforcement activities of agencies, effectively dredging up any past decisions made by individuals they want to penalize.\\n* Chilling Effect: Making everyone aware that if they are not aligned with the new powers in the White House, they could be investigated.In other words, a good-faith anti-weaponization measure could easily become an even bigger weapon itselfthreatening or intimidating career employees into compliance under the threat of legal scrutiny.Security Clearance BacklogsStated Goal: Resolving the backlog of clearance applications.\\nUnderlying Aim:* Hand-Picking Loyalists: By granting expedited Top Secret/SCI clearances to a pool of individuals chosen by White House Counsel, the administration can ensure immediate infiltration of the highest, most sensitive areas of government with their own operativesloyal to them.\\n* Exclusion of Enemies: Conversely, if certain people do not receive interim clearance, that effectively bars them from critical roles, sidelining them before they can become problematic.\\n* Threat of Revocation: The White House Counsel can revoke these interim clearances at will, instilling fear in staff: stay on the right side, or risk being stripped of clearance and marginalized.Restricting Birthright CitizenshipStated Goal: Restricting automatic citizenship for children born to certain categories of non-citizen parents.\\nUnderlying Aim:* Appeasing a Vengeful Base: If the administration campaigned on harsh immigration stancesand specifically targeted communities perceived as opposed to themthis serves as a signal of follow-through on punishing those groups.\\n* Diverting Attention &amp; Stoking Division: Introducing a legally dubious measure might also be about rallying support among hardline factions, while sowing discord and fear among immigrant communities.\\n* Scapegoating: By portraying entire groups as less deserving, they shift blame and animus away from other political controversies.Revoking Security Clearances of Former OfficialsStated Goal: Punishing those who allegedly leveraged intelligence credentials for partisan politics (particularly in 2020).\\nLikely Underlying Aim (if spiteful):* Public Humiliation and Payback: Targeting high-profile former officials (like CIA directors or John Bolton) who either publicly opposed them or who are otherwise symbolically tied to the prior administration.\\n* Intimidating Future Critics: Sending a message that speaking outespecially if you have intelligence credentialsmay get you stripped of your clearance (which is often crucial for post-government work).From a spiteful administrations viewpoint, this is not just about correcting the record but about punishing prominent figures and discouraging any others from breaking rank in the future.\\nReinstating Schedule F (Renamed Schedule Policy/Career)Stated Goal: Increasing accountability of policy-influencing federal employees.\\nUnderlying Aim:* Purging Dissenters: This classification lets the administration quickly fire or reassign civil servants who arent fully aligned. Because these roles are policy-influencing, the threshold for firing becomes looser under the new schedule.\\n* Consolidation of Power: Politicizing civil service positions means that career experts who might raise concerns or question dubious orders can be removed without the usual procedural protections.\\n* Partisan Entrenchment: Filling policy-adjacent jobs with ultra-loyal figures, ensuring any future administration will have trouble reversing course (or at least leaving them an embedded, politicized bureaucracy).Blanket Clemency for January 6 OffendersStated Goal: Righting a grave national injustice by granting pardons/commutations to those convicted of offenses related to the Capitol riot.\\nUnderlying Aim:* Rewarding Supporters &amp; Encouraging Future Loyalty: Essentially telling people, If you stand with useven to the point of riotwe will protect you later.\\n* Establishing a Narrative: Portraying the justice systems response to January 6 as political persecution undermines any real accountability for violent or seditious acts.\\n* Spite Toward Opponents: In effect, it also serves as one more poke at the old administrations DOJ, painting them as biased while letting the new administrations political allies off the hook.","title":"Trump Frees Thugs Who Beat Cops With Weapons on Jan. 6 | The president signed an order granting a complete and unconditional pardon for about 1,500 Capitol rioters"},{"text":"Yes, but I dont think modern day POTUS or SCOTUS care about that lol","title":"Discussion Thread: President-Elect Trump's First Day in Office, Part 2"},{"text":"So, he usually makes the right move but you still dont like him?

It's construction, agriculture, and hospitality jobs. Manufacturing, mining, professional services, retail.  Just in construction, agriculture, and hospitality alone,  that accounts for almost 3 million workers.  Nearly 14% of all construction and 13% of agriculture is worked by illegals.And the thing is, they aren't making minimum wage (but yes, let's only go after the workers and not the employers shirking labor laws).  That's the reason why they're so heavily relied upon, because it allows their employers to cut costs.  If you now force these sectors to backfill positions now at minimum wage, it's either going to 1.) directly affect the cost that consumers pay for those services to augment the rising cost of labor or 2.) shutter businesses because they can't afford and/or can't find workers.  This is where trickle down actually works, because those issues in production will mean you'll pay more for construction, more for travel, more for food and clothes, manufactured good, pro services, and more in taxes.  Again, when businesses are still struggling with labor shortages, what person is going to want those jobs?Expect employment numbers to go up as well.  When low income families need to work, they often turn to migrants for child care.  Deporting them means more of these workers will choose not to enter the workforce now, driving people out of employment and reducing household incomes.By the way, by just booting them with no clear path to legalization, we also lose (on top of eveything else) the $100 billion dollars in taxes, SS and Medicare contributions that migrants contribute each year to the economy.  But yes, let's dole up the red meat to boost his fixation with approval ratings.  He and his friends are billionaires, they'll somehow get through this.

The D party gets away with it because the average voter in that district just hits the big D button every voting cycle. That means that the average voter in that district is happy with the current process. And even after AOC was elected, recently Nancy Pelosi acted to prevent her from getting a committee position which would have given her power to push a progressive agenda within the party.Don't vote for that party.And first-past-the-post voting makes it virtually impossible for a third party to gain any real political power.I have seen this exact line, with this exact word usage countless times before. You want a parliamentary system because you somehow think its better even with examples all across europe that would argue otherwise. Say it with your chest, don't try and hide it.  It's an overly-simplistic to blame the voters when the system is structured in a way which protects incumbents, and incentivizes those incumbents to align their interests with donors and special interests more so than the will of the people.Most people don't vote. of those who do most just hit R all or D all. It is entirely the fault of the voter and the older I get the less viable I see universal suffrage being.

For instance after AOC was elected, they created a policy to black-list any political consultant working on a campaign to primary against an incumbent Democrat, making it career suicide.And even after AOC was elected, recently Nancy Pelosi acted to prevent her from getting a committee position which would have given her power to push a progressive agenda within the party.And first-past-the-post voting makes it virtually impossible for a third party to gain any real political power.It's an overly-simplistic to blame the voters when the system is structured in a way which protects incumbents, and incentivizes those incumbents to align their interests with donors and special interests more so than the will of the people.","title":"CMV: The fact the TikTok ban was signed into law shows the US is not functioning as a democracy"},{"text":"Attempting to end birthright citizenship by EO when it's in the constitution is a pretty big one.","title":"Discussion Thread: President-Elect Trump's First Day in Office, Part 2"},{"text":"Tbh, we were already too late to stay within the co2 budget to remain at &lt;1.5C of warming.

They represent us to make hard choices, not be a mouth peice for the mob.At times, our Representative must go against the popular choices for the security or safety of the country.  If they do this often enough,  they should be removed through the electoral process.  Or if the action is too egregious, through recall. Our system is only \\"broken\\" so far as people don't care enough to know the voting history or values of their Representative.  They hit the R or the D and the seats almost never change.

Before I left my last company our productivity exploded due to WFH.  Not having to deal with our project manager constantly checking in, or wanting us to stop what we are doing and try this way instead because he read an article about it being good, allowed me, and most of the rest of our team, to finish 5 days of work in 3-4 days.  Being able to just grab a couple people and make a quick group call and just work it out without having to deal with red tape of management was fantastic.  Having more energy because I got to sleep an hour longer and not be drained sitting in traffic was great for productivity. Unfortunately that boost in production got that useless manager promoted but nothing is perfect.I left that company about 2 years ago but I still remember how great that WFH experience was and how it basically changed my entire outlook on both WFH and the usefulness of management.","title":"Trump Orders Federal Employees to Return to the Office Full-Time"},{"text":"I look forward to the 5-4 ruling overturning Wong Kim Ark and making racism great again this summer! /s","title":"ACLU sues over Trump order aimed at ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"She got some balls.. thats for sure","title":"Jan 6 rioter Pamela Hemphill says she will refuse Trumps pardon"},{"text":"Um, yes and that was unexpected?

Im just going to focus on one part that is think is wrong and that you should revise.The claim that people who are trying to hide the truth or to cover up a lie often have trouble retelling a sequence of events, whereas people telling the truth will have a coherent narrative that stays the same over time is wrong. And this is an especially important point in SA cases because inconsistencies in storytelling are often used to discredit victims.Memory is fallible, and research in cognitive psychology (my field) suggests that human memory is reconstructive, not a perfect recording that is accessed later like a paper document or hard drive file. Memories can be influenced by various factors, including stress, suggestion, and the passage of time. Even truthful individuals can and often do have inconsistencies in their recollections, especially when trying to remember painful events from years or decades ago. Secondly theres the research on trauma. SA is often deeply traumatic to people, and trauma impacts memory significantly because its a survival response. Victims of SA can experience fragmented memories, emotional flashbacks, and difficulty recalling events in chronological order. These inconsistencies should not be interpreted as signs of deception. Also, just recalling and recounting a traumatic event is a highly stressful thing to do because your body goes back into a survival mode as if it were happening again  and imagine trying to remember something while your life is being threatened  like a guy pointing a gun at your head and asking you what you ate on a specific day three years ago. It will mess with your memory for sure. Now consider someone being interrogated about their account and asked to give minute and graphic details about it. Being fair has to account for all this, so its tricky. However the best way to approach SA, like most crimes and problems, is before they occur. We need to educate people and raise expectations about what consent is, whats acceptable and not, and how to communicate, so they dont cross lines that should never be crossed and then claim they did nothing wrong. We also need to be more supportive and accepting of people who say theyve been violated, so they feel they can come forward more easily. Ultimately we shouldnt just be settling this legally and through policy, but through a change in the way we behave. That may sound utopian but its not  culture changes and its the most effective long term way to reduce SA on a large scale, even though there may always be some individual cases.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Okay see you in the camps, they wont spare you either.

The same Lords that are often appointed by PM?True, but not by one PM, but by several over many decades, so there's a good balance there.

Government is the group of 15 core cabinet ministers + 150 or so more junior ministers which is usually made up by MPs. The 15 core group get their powers from the Royal prerogative, and so (technically) they're acting on behalf of the Monarch. The Monarch specifically does not have the power to abolish Parliament. [Indeed there was a neat case recently which asserted that the Government using its power to effectively pause Parliament was unlawful - \\"that a decision to prorogue (i.e. suspend) (or advise the monarch to prorogue) will be unlawful if the prorogation has the effect of frustrating or preventing, without reasonable justification, the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions as a legislature and as the body responsible for the supervision of the executive.\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_prorogation_controversy)I would say the US and UK systems are \\"different\\" and leave it at that?

The only thing that changed is Snowden can't enter the US.","title":"Libertarian Party Chairwoman reveals that Trump will pardon Ross Ulbricht"},{"text":"American. No Ph.D., but been around politics.It will take more time to explain than I will be able to put in here. But I will try to hint at some directions you would like research if you want answers. First, the media is quite divided in US, and European broadcasting and large newspapers tend to cite or use Dem siding sources,  like New York Times. This makes the picture tilted in Europe. \\nSomething of the same as with the polling before elections. A lot of, really a substantial number of, Trump voters would not answer a pollster at all. They don't trust the polling nor the news sources the results are published in. This explains some of the problems pollsters have had.Second \\"it's the economy stupid\\". Economy should not be understood at the national or statistical level, but as how a person making his/her shopping FEELS about the prices. They have gone up a lot. Even if the US economy is strong and done remarkably, especially compared to EU, this is not what is driving how people vote. It's exactly the same as with crime. The feeling of insecurity in your neighbourhood and the actual statistical crime rate are two very different things, unfortunately.Third, Americans are not more stupid than the average EU citizen.  Perhaps fewer holding a degree from college,  but that doesn't prove people are stupid. It tells more about the educational system and especially about how studies are financed. How can people vote for Fidez in Hungary, AfD in Germany, Law and justice in Poland, and so on.. \\nMost voters all over the globe like quick fixes, clear yes-no choices, and \\"change.\\"  There is no need for proof or causality. Any correlation, even totally made up ones usually works. Correlation is not causality, might be a lesson in statistics classes at universities, but it's exactly how populist politics works, especially if there can be a identified \\"enemy\\". \\nTrump is delivering easy fixes, clear enemies, just like other populist politicians.Fourth the Anglo-Saxon tradition in politics has led to two party systems.  Both in US and UK. This leavs voters two choices when discontent with the current administration,  vote for the other party or not vote at all. Conservatives vs Labour or Republicans vs Democrats.  I would argue almost all voters disagree with a lot of things the party they vote for, but find it more appealing than the other option. There certainly are long time Republicans that do not like the MAGA Trump movement,  but never ever would vote for the Democrats. At stake is not only the president, but much more, yes some might have voted for other things on their ballot but not the top candidate. That is however rare, I would guess quite a lot of Regan, Bush, Pence Republicans voted for Trump holding their noses.Fifth listen to Andreessen for example on this NYT podcast. Matter of Opinion: How Democrats Drove Silicon Valley Into Trumps Arms\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/opinion/how-democrats-drove-silicon-valley-into-trumps-arms.html\\nThe Tech business leaders have all sided with Trump, I don't know to what extent Twitter, Facebook,  Amazon (Washington Post) in the end affected voting,  or how the TikTok users reasoned. But if you are dependent ( irrespective if it is for your income or because you are addicted to social media) on these there was one clear candidate to vote for.There are a lot more reasons, I didn't even start on immigration, trade, oil and automotive industries...\\nThe point being, how any given individual voted is influenced by much more than is easily understood, and almost in all elections globally in 2024 the incumbent candidate lost, as in the US. The Democrats did a poor job with the change from Biden to Harris. Kind of \\"too little too late\\". My opinion is Harris as a candidate did a decent campaign, given the circumstances. All this is not in defence of the personal qualities of Trump, of which I am aware, there are an unexceptionally wide range of opinions on.","title":"Can someone explain to a European what is going on over there?"},{"text":"Jingle Bell!

Case in point: [Elon Musk ripped off Twitter investors for $150 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/technology/sec-elon-musk-securities-violations.html).SEC Chair Gary Gensler has revealed Musk's wrongdoing and securities violations in conjunction with the Twitter acquisition. The SEC case is strong and has well-documented Musk's failure to make legally required disclosures.The SEC filing states that in buying Twitter in 2022, Elon Musk violated securities laws by amassing a large stock position in the social media company without filing the proper notification. The complaint said Musk waited 11 days before filing the required disclosure with the S.E.C.The regulatory filings are required so investors in the marketplace can monitor the moves of large investors and potential takeover bids. Because Mr. Musk did not disclose his position, he was able to continue buying Twitter stock at an artificially low price, the SEC said in its lawsuit.The move allowed him \\\\[Elon Musk\\\\] to underpay by at least $150 million for the additional shares before he belatedly disclosed his stake, the lawsuit continued.Musk's failure to comply with SEC disclosure law also harmed investors who would have been able to sell their shares at higher prices had Musks involvement been publicly known, the agency said. Former Twitter shareholders have also sued Mr. Musk, accusing him of fraud in a case related to his belated disclosure of his stake in Twitter.Martha Stewart was put in prison on obstruction of justice charges in conjunction with alleged securities violations.

My childs healthcare costs are $0. This year I spent $1,500 on appointments and medication for my family. As my insurance cost is based on my income as a percentage, it will increase as I earn more. My overall costs after tax returns is about $2,500 for the year. My income was about $56,000. About 4.5% of my income.I think 15 years ago I was paying $80 a week for health insurance and then doctors visits cost me $100-200 per visit. My medication was around $100 a month. My healthcare costs were about $6,500 a year on an income of about $30,000. About 21.5% of my income.

For example on lack of toughness on crime that progressives push that impact voters in urban areas, which probably had an effect on Philly and Detroit and Milwaukee turnout crashing which led to Trump (barely) winning their states. Sadly, immigration looks lost now though I have a feeling the deportations being extreme and publicized might change the tune there (though we shall see if the media even reports on it this time around). But that doesn't mean and shouldn't mean throwing away all the socially liberal stances that the base will support Dems for. Like I get the vibe a lot want Democrats to just straight up stop running at all on abortion rights as an issue post this election, which to me would be stupid especially when future Republican candidates in 2026 and 2028 wouldn't be able to get away with supporting (or doing) unpopular things based on certain issues like Trump would. That and stepping back on trans rights just because of how one campaign weaponized it in one election. Don't go overboard in suddenly not supporting that due to one campaign, take an actual step back and analyze and find ways to not allow it to weaponize your campaign but don't use that as an excuse to stop supporting or minimizing supporting a cause your base supports. I think another comment below said it best: run on your policies being policies that support personal freedom and personal liberties. It'd be the one ideal way to fight back the \\"Dems support being the uppity and anti-fun\\" party which Trump and this current Republican apparatus was able to push, at least with young men. The Dems had the right idea on that with abortion rights, they just ran into the one Republican candidate who had teflon effect when it came to being attacked on abortion rights and other issues. 2026 Republican candidates for midterm and 2028 Republican Presidential candidates won't have that luxury (especially DeSantis or Kemp).

No doubt *some* people may throw something out there to try to make themselves look better. But I also have little doubt that being jaded from those experiences might make it seem like the numbers are much higher than they are. While you are referring to criminals- Im referring to the general population. Statistics show that a woman even coming in to report a rape or assault is likely around 2-4 percent. This is a high estimate.Some studies have found it to be a smaller statistic. And statistics dont focus on criminals as the only numbers- perhaps if we looked at a report of a specific subtype of reports we would find different numbers.In general- not a lot of women want to go through the backlash following the report a rape.So we are looking at a small group of 2 percent of women who do come in to report their assault or rape. From those women- from statistics taken from data of different countries and different regions- the average percent of false reports seems to sit in the range of. 2- 4 percent.I was not saying criminals wouldnt falsely accuse someone or even that women never falsely accuse anyoneIm saying that overall- I do not believe there are a large number of women falsely reporting rape.But I also want to note that these statistics werent pulled out of nowhere. There was data analysis done, there was consideration for what constitutes a false report.Aside from that, victims merely retracting their statements or withdrawing charges are often registered as false claims when there are a great deal of reasons that victims would do so. Sometimes this includes threats, or the intense pressure of what going forward with charges can entail. It sucks to hear that there are manipulative people using rape as a game. While it disgusts me to think of it, Ive no doubt they exist. I still believe the data and I still support my statement as a whole.I also linked a study discussing the assessment that police officers struggle to identify rape as true or false- I could imagine having seen women falsely accuse would likely affect an officers future belief that women who bring up rape while theyre also being accused of other crimes to be in fact lying. Perhaps not all of them are.Some of the consequences of rape for victims include PTSD and substance abuse- which often can come with risky behaviors as a result.Im not saying that your friend is intentionally skewing the numbers, but I would also note that anecdotal evidence is not truly evidence. Yes, studies can be flawed, but overall we see a range between 4% and 10% as the average. This is still including data that includes withdrawn cases. When studies were further altered to change the data as proven false cases that number drops down to the 2-4 percent that I continue to note.https://evawintl.org/best_practice_faqs/false-reports-percentage/https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdfhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077801210387747?utm_source=chatgpt.comhttps://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/gap-or-chasm-attrition-reported-rape-cases?utm_source=chatgpt.comhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-79968-7_12?fromPaywallRec=true","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Brilliant! \\"And by Easter...

Most of the time, these posts just get more clicks from people who already agree with them, and they might even make some folks on the other side feel more confident in their views.But here's the thing: even if it doesn't directly sway voters, these posts are doing a few things behind the scenes. For one, they're keeping people informedespecially those who are already active in trying to make changes. They also help create a sense of community among like-minded individuals, which is super important for staying motivated.Plus, there's something to be said about raising awareness. When more people talk about an issue online, it can push it into the mainstream conversation, making it harder for leaders to ignore. It's not just about winning votes; it's about shaping the narrative and putting pressure on those in power. But here's where it gets tricky: relying solely on outrage posts isn't enough. Sure, they get people fired up, but what happens next? There needs to be more than just complaining onlinelike actually getting involved in local politics or supporting candidates who stand for the things you care about. And don't forget about those social media algorithms! They kind of herd us into bubbles where we only see content that matches our views. So even if you're posting something important, it might not reach the people who need to hear it most. All in all, while social media outrage has its place, it's just one piece of a bigger puzzle. To really make a difference, we need to pair online activism with real-world actions and smarter strategies to break through those bubbles.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"(Destroying the constitution of) America First","title":"Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"I hope you're being sarcastic.","title":"Trump announces US withdrawal from World Health Organization"},{"text":"And if its an official actthen he can","title":"Trump issues an executive order to suspend the US TikTok ban.

Its from They Thought They Were Free by Milton Mayer, describing the average Germans during Nazi Germany https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.htmIn particular, your line about being called an alarmist made me think of these lines:You see, my colleague went on, one doesnt see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You dont want to act, or even talk, alone; you dont want to go out of your way to make trouble. Why not?Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, everyone is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, Its not so bad or Youre seeing things or Youre an alarmist.And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you cant prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you dont know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent toto what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. Thats the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shockedif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in 43 had come immediately after the German Firm stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in 33. But of course this isnt the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying Jewish swine, collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live inyour nation, your peopleis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.","title":"Elon Musk draws outrage over 'odd-looking salute' at Trump inauguration celebration"},{"text":"Oh man I can only hope the new DOJ brings the full weight of the law and justice down.

He shut down travel for non-Americans from China. He continued to allow Americans to fly back and forth from China,  including from Wuhan, for several more weeks. By April, over 400,000 people had flown to the United States from China after Trump's alleged shut down, with no health detection or quarantine measures in place. . Trump allowed 400,000 people to travel from China to the United States, without any attempt at testing or quarantine, after his alleged shutdown of travel from China. That traffic absolutely contributed to the spread of this virus within the United States. There are people who have alleged that the virus is engineered, but there is no evidence of that. China announced this mysterious disease to the world within a few days of first starting to figure it out for themselves, pronounced evidence of human transmission within less than a day of receiving that evidence themselves, and published the sequence of the virus within 2 weeks - which became the information enabling us to start developing tests for the virus starting from that day. Were they forthcoming? Not particularly. But they didn't hide anything critical, and nothing they did or didn't do affected our appalling lack of adequate response.
