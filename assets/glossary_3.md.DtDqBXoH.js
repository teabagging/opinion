An example, say 0 women believe they could be a CEO because all examples are men and it's looked at as a job only men are fit to do. That means you've artificially constrained the CEO labor market to just half of your population, excluding many that were more innately talented for the job at birth. It's basically trade openness / relative comparative advantage reasoning, but for labor. And this is not just ceo's: it's every single job that is stereotyped to any degree whatsoever. \\n\\nAddressing that would lead to a less artificially constrained so more efficient labor market equilibrium in general. Which would benefit society.

It's just another example of how Republicans go to great lengths to identify scapegoats and \\"radical leftist\\" boogeymen that act as distractions from the actual inequities that they are trying desperately to preserve. \\n\\nAnother day, another enemy, another reason to escalate their culture wars and appeal to their voter's grievances and prejudices.\\n\\nAnd what's particularly frustrating is how hypocritical this is considering that Republicans are pushing the talking point that hirings should be \\"merit\\" based. But if federal jobs were granted strictly on merit alone, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place.\\n\\nWhile it's apparent to anyone who can see through this deception, that it's conservatives who are actually obsessed with race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and so on. And made obvious by all the \\"woke culture\\" histrionics, the anti-immigrant fervor, all of the conspiracy theories and hysteria centered around the persecution of white people and Christians, the degradation of the \\"nuclear family,\\" the widespread panic around groomers and pedophiles, the threat of transgender bathrooms and athletes, too many POCs and LGBTQ protagonists in library books, critical race theory, and the list goes on.\\n\\nAnd it's made even more apparent by the fact that these efforts are steeped in the right's culture wars. I mean, Republicans have dragged almost every issue into this culture war battleground. And again, these are issues that Republicans try to present as ubiquitous and inescapable, relying on misinformation and propaganda to scare their voters into believing it, which is all too easy considering it's just a matter of pandering to their worst impulses, their hate, their discriminatory attitudes and preconceptions about others.\\n\\nThat being said, let's look a little more closely at this claim from Republicans that \\"merit\\" is their greatest qualification for hiring people.\\n\\nTrump and his MAGA coalition have been gradually implementing an agenda that critics are warning will lead to a \\"crisis of incompetence at every level of government.\\"\\n\\nReminder, these actions are coming from the guy who is immensely unqualified himself in almost every way for his current position.\\n\\nAnd what's most baffling about this, is how Trump's measure of whether you're qualified for a job within his administration depends entirely on your level of loyalty to him, and how much money, political power and influence you can bring to his presidency and campaign.\\n\\nTrump's administration is expected to be the richest in US history, and soon to be filled with a bunch of rich sycophants scarred by their many conflicts of interest, and whose qualifications fall short at just about every mark.\\n\\nMind you, Trump left the second row at his inauguration open for a line up of VIP billionaires who are literally some of the richest men in the world. Populism my ass.\\n\\nThese billionaires, corporate cronies, ultra wealthy advocates, big tech and finance \\"bros,\\" and rich media moguls who have the backing of special interests, right wing \\"think tanks\\" and dark money groups, have been meeting with Trump in private to bend the knee, assuring him that they will be in lockstep with his next administration.\\n\\nThis kind of favoritism, rampant cronyism, legacy based staffing, nepotism,  \\"jobs for the boys\\" mindset, and power to appoint based on anything but actual merit and genuine qualifications for the position at hand, all of these things are precisely why Americans have questioned inequitable hiring practices in the first place. It's almost cruelly ironic.\\n\\nWhile none of this takes into account the Trump/MAGA agenda that's already underway, and as outlined by Project 2025, to enact a \\"federal hiring plan\\" through executive orders, unitary executive privileges, broad immunities for the president, and efforts from Republicans to consolidate power...\\n\\nAn agenda that we know is setting out to erode the independence of most government agencies, strip civil servants of their protections, and then install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for nonpartisan, knowledgeable staff whose job security didn't previously depend on their level of allegiance to the president and the party agenda.\\n\\n\\"DEI\\" is just another Boogeyman, another scapegoat that Republicans have been using to distract their mindless voters from the actual inequities they're perpetuating.\\n\\nAnd keep in mind, this is all while Trump and his allies are trying to revoke protections for people who are discriminated against based on their gender and sexual orientation.\\n\\nInstead, they're effectively keeping these fanatics fixated on the culture wars and all of this DEI bullshit, effortlessly convincing them that it's some widespread \\"problem\\" because the whole thing appeals to their intolerance and their victimhood. It's textbook really. It's actually gotten to the point where these chronically aggrieved conservatives believe that every liberal person of color in a position of power, especially a position that has the authority to hold Trump accountable, is some unqualified, \\"DEI\\" hire. It's almost like history is repeating itself here.\\n\\nAnd this campaign against DEI is so effective because it indulges these conservative's fears, their prejudices towards out-groups, and all of their cynical frustrations surrounding their feelings of being \\"lesser than\\" because they view equity and equality as a threat to *their* superiority, *their* country, *their* race and religion, *their* culture, and even their white, Christian hegemony.","title":"Trump Shuts Down Diversity Programs Across Government"},{"text":"How much BS is reddit propaganda trying to push in the last day?..this much!..","title":"We had class consciousness for a total of one minute"},{"text":"It's pretty jarring, yeah.","title":"Trump defends pardons for rioters and suggests Proud Boys could have place in politics"},{"text":"Unfortunately, Its illegal.

Biden just commuted the death penalty of 37/40 federal death row inmates. The 3/40 who remained committed particularly egregious crimes and IIRC their executions aren't expected to take place within the next 4 years, meaning another administration after Trump will have a chance to commute their death sentences.

I understand why, the intention is to reduce the exposure, traffic and revenue to the platform- but revenue is the bottom line and an adblocker is just as effective, if not even more so if it has cross-site cookie blocking. I think the blanket ban is still very ideologically driven and reactionary. There are two reasons why I disagree, and think that a more nuanced implementation of banning content related to Elon would be a better solution:\\n\\nDespite the cultural shift of Twitter from left to right of the political spectrum since Elon's acquisition, there are still hundreds of thousands of conventional users there and thousands of businesses and high quality information outlets that make use of Twitter/X. By issuing blanket bans on Reddit communities, we put at risk SMBs, restrict information sharing (Think OSINT, public bodies, et al) and unintentionally deplatform other individuals and organizations who otherwise provide conventional viewpoints and accurate information. I understand that this information can usually be sourced from elsewhere, but not in all instances.\\n\\nThis is more of the same stuff that has led to the extreme polarization that we've seen within society. I reference what I said earlier, that this is ideological. It's up to each Reddit community to make the determination as to whether to allow content from other sites. However this is a reactionary stance in almost all instances. Censoring opinions we find disgusting ideologically in my view is more harmful than allowing them to exist - by banning contrarian opinions and extremist views, they don't go away or stop existing, they find echo chambers and continue to fester, finding more underhanded ways to spread their own views and spread harm. There are countless examples where we have seen this happen from the incel community to /pol/.\\n\\nMy view is this:?It is up to each individual to take responsibility for how they engage with content online. We cannot rely on blanket bans or broad censorship to solve the deeper societal issues that allow abhorrent views to take root and spread. Instead, we should focus on equipping individuals with the tools and critical thinking skills necessary to recognize, counter, and challenge harmful ideologies when they encounter them.\\n\\nBanning things outright risks creating echo chambers where only agreeable viewpoints are shared, which can stifle meaningful discourse and understanding. While it may feel like a way to take a moral stand, it inadvertently strengthens the resolve of those holding extremist views by validating their belief that they are being unfairly silenced. This only drives these ideas underground.\\n\\nIt's also crucial to engage with and understand the extreme viewpoints we disagree withnot to legitimize them, but to know how to counteract them effectively. By understanding \\"the enemy,\\" so to speak, we can better dismantle their arguments and create strategies that address the root causes of their ideologies, whether they stem from misinformation, fear, or socioeconomic factors.\\n\\nUltimately, fostering open dialogue and encouraging individuals to take ownership of their engagement with content creates a more informed, resilient societyone that actively counters harmful narratives rather than passively ignoring them or pushing them out of sight.\\n\\nAs for the traffic and revenue drop, it's probably completely inconsequential for a billionaire who knows how valuable owning a social media platform is as a political tool.","title":"CMV: Subreddits should not ban Twitter/X links out of solidarity"},{"text":"100% predictable.

His first administration was a proof of concept that sufficient dancing from crisis to crisis could keep his opponents off balance, and now he uses it in his speeches, and insists upon turning off fact-checking to aid the process.

But if I had to pick top contenders today, I would say Marco Rubio and JD Vance are solid options for Trump's blessing in 2028.","title":"Question for Trump supporters?"},{"text":"Shes 71 and retired.

They used Facebooks own tools to sow doubt about the severity of the pandemics threat and the safety of authorities main weapon to combat it.\\n\\n&gt; The Covid-19 mess in particular strikes at the heart of Facebooks problem: its users create the content, but their comments, posts and videos are hard to control, given how Facebook built and runs its platform, in ways that are fundamentally different from a company shaping its product or a publisher curating stories. Even when he set a goal, the chief executive couldnt steer the platform as he wanted.\\n\\nThey literally met with White House officials like Fauci to try to figure it out, they offered free ad credits to promote real covid health information, changed its ranking to reduce views of health misinfo...etc. They literally wrote canned, correct vaccine info and asked users if they wanted to post that at the end of their vaccine related posts. There is some legitimate critique of their moderation system using automated review rather than manual, but on this topic, the issue was on the scale of hundreds of millions of posts by anti-vaccine activists.\\n\\nHow could they have done better?
