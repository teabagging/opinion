Things that also fall under the umbrella of Ukraine aid include the financing of increased U.S. military presence in Europe, intelligence operations vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia, support of European states that have also been affected by Russias war, and every other activity in any way related to Russias war in Ukraine. The majority of weapons and munitions the U.S. government has sent to Ukraine are pulled from Americas own stockpiles using presidential drawdowns, since this program allows for the quickest delivery.

He lost all the money from the businesses his father handed him and banks kept giving him money. In his real estate business, he didnt create shit he bought in on deals to stick his name on. Any of the other deals for non real estate like his steaks, airline, vodka, even university were all basically licensing deals and he fucked them up.  His books all ghostwritten fake drivel.

The number of jobs \\"created\\" jumped and Biden's employment numbers went way up. Of course, the myth here is that people weren't working at all and were staying home with their government checks.

This argument is deeply flawed and ignores the broader context of the global economic situation. While its true that the stock market crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the Great Depression, the causes were multifaceted and cannot be pinned solely on Coolidges administration.The reality is that Coolidge left office with a strong economy, a balanced budget, and a reduced national debt. The speculative bubble in the stock market was not a direct result of his policies but rather of the widespread exuberance and lack of regulation in certain financial marketsa phenomenon that had been building for years and which was exacerbated by factors beyond Coolidge's control.Moreover, it was the policy responses to the crash, particularly under President Hoover, that contributed to the severity and duration of the Depression. Hoovers protectionist trade policies, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, and his interventions in the economy, which were contrary to Coolidges principles, significantly worsened the situation. These actions, combined with global economic instability, played a far more critical role in the onset of the Great Depression than anything Coolidge did or did not do.","title":"Appreciation post: America's greatest president?"},{"text":"Trump is good for business.
