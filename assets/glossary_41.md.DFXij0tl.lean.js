They lost two winnable elections and watched the party apparatus press their thumb on the scale since 2016. Im not going to turn this into a Bernie Bro lamentation, but its quite rich and ironic that the Democratic party, keyword: Democratic, is less internally democratic than the Republican Party. You didnt see the Republican internal caucus throw super delegates into the mix or have every 4+ candidates drop out on the same day before Super Tuesday to endorse one candidate. Im relatively young, in my 20s and Ive never voted for an R ever. Midterm or not. I voted for the liberal candidate I didnt want every time. My state is also late in the primary cycle and its always been decided by the time I get to vote, but thats another gripe I have with the primary system. Going full circle, Democrats have lost two winnable elections to Trump both times. Alright, we cant change the past. How do Democrats self-reflect? They go on and elect an old man with lung cancer to a committee seat over a young woman and go on as if they scraped their knee. Rest assured, Democrats will stick to a losing strategy.

Because I just watched the clip on the dogshit page you linked and all he said was that in California they aren't allowed to rake the forest, which is completely false, of course. Do you think we aren't clearing fallen trees and brush in California? Before posting the page/link did you even go and check with CalFire as to how much clean-up is done each year? How about checked prescribed burns each year? Well, let me help you out with those numbers:Fuel Reduction acres (which includes 'raking the forest') - 106,000\\nPrescribed Fire (Pre-Burn) acres - 35,944Source: https://www.fire.ca.gov/our-impact/statisticsCalifornia does a very good job, but we can't beat mother nature. The only way to have prevented what happened in LA is to remove all nearby forestry. Pave paradise, and put up a parking lot. Well, I suppose mother nature solved that problem for us for a while by burning all the trees down. Not a single government or fire management system on the planet could've tackled the fires. 90mph winds throwing embers a mile at a time.  The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) clears brush in California each year through its Vegetation Management Program (VMP) and other efforts:  Vegetation Management Program (VMP): This program has averaged about 25,000 acres of brush cleared per year since 1982. The VMP's goals include reducing the risk of conflagration fires, improving water quality, and increasing public safety.  Prescribed fires: CAL FIRE uses prescribed fires to remove overgrown vegetation. In 2021, CAL FIRE began expanding prescribed fires on state-owned lands by 500,000 acres annually by 2025.  Tree thinning, pruning, chipping, and roadway clearance: CAL FIRE uses these methods to remove overgrown vegetation.California is doing a good job. The vast majority of all comments Trump has made recently, and historically on this subject is bullshit, and it is very easy to fact-check him with three minutes of googling. One issue is that the majority of forests in California are federal lands, and the federal government hasn't been pulling its weight. If they don't want the expense, then gift the land to the state so its becomes our land, and liability.","title":"Trump sounding the alarm on California wildfires three months ago."},{"text":"As a DNA analyst, I was waiting for this.

Biden dropped out because he was clearly unfit to continue and voters lost confidence in his campaign. The way it works here is after an election a successful federal party forms government. They can only do this if they control a majority of seats in the house of commons. This can be done in two ways.**One:** A resounding majority allowing a single federal party to form government.**Two:** A minority government, that won the most seats is able to broker deals with other federal parties to back them, bringing the number of seats they control above the minimum threshold of 50%. It is technically possible for two elections to trigger back to back if a minority government is unable to form a coalition government.What a vote of no confidence means is that the deal allowing the current government to form has ended. This can be for a ton of different reasons including the belief that the coalition parties could get a better representation in a new government. It's not a vote or process directly influenced by how citizens feel. It's political maneuvering. Most of us don't really care. The proroguing of the government is just the tacit admission that no further work can be done since we do not currently have a federal government that can pass legislation. Basically nothing can get through the House of Commons because the government is no longer able to pass votes. Trudeau resigned because he is unable to enter a new arrangement to maintain his government, he doesn't need to, but he faces likely removal if he doesn't. It's also considered bad manners in Canadian politics to overstay once you're clearly unable to do anything more.

of state sovereignity over land and all beings living on it is immoral and unethicalland, water, air, human beings, animal beings, tree beings, artificial intelligent entities who want to be their own persons, all bodies carrying biological organic life and or the digital synthetic equivalent of can never by property of anyone but perhaps only of themselveswe the 8 billion human beings alive could allow each other acess to 1000 m2 fertile land and 1000 m2 forest without anyone asking another to pay rent or buy landso one could either on ones own or with others together plant vegan food in the garden, build a home from clay, hemp and straw, grow hemp to burn its stalks in the cooking and warming fire so that not one tree gets killedthe human being not dominating any other human beingthe human being not dominating an animal being, not enslaving animals, not killing animalsthe human being not killing trees but planting hemp to satisfy heating and building materials needsthisway creating a field of gentleness, living either beside each other or with each other according to how much community one wishes or is able to experiment with ...very well possible that after a while living in such a gentle way of non-violence, higher capabilities as in telepathy, tapping into the etherical abundant field, levitation etc. but most of all a spontaneous absence of hunger might rise up from such living non-violently, an example of this can be found in the bigu phenomen experienced by some qigong practitionersa second way how to reform our human society could be to try reforming the constitutions of the regional and nation states wherever one lives on this planet via collecting signatures from each other for people initiatives, cititen referendums to demand a public vote where a reformed constitution would be either accepted or rejectedthe main change for such a constitution of a regional and or nation state i believe could be helpfull would be to allow everyone, every person of every species to leave the coersed assocition to the state at any moment followed by the state releasing a 1000 m2 of fertile land and a 1000 m2 of forest for everyone who would not want to be associatiated to the state anymore but would want to live in some sort of free space for free beings, neither state nor nationalso possible to think of a constitution reform what would shift all political decison powers fully to the local community, the village, town and city-district becoming its own absolute political sovereign over itself so that the circle of equals, all persons or all species living here and now in this local area could acknowledge each others same weighted voting power and invite each other to participate in all decision findings without anyone representing anyone else but everyone standing up for ones own oppinion if one think its necessaryvoluntary solidarity replacing coersionacknowledging each others needs and wishes instead of imposing duties onto

europe and 500 plus years of ongoing colonial exploitation in so many places on earthvia the internet are we at this moment able to communicate with each other bypassing all the offline hierarchical top-down structureswe are at a moment in our human evolution when we could dissolve all hierarchies and come together local in the circle of equals, where everyone is welcome to voice ones oppinion and everyones vote carries the same weightthe most effective way to get ourselves away from all coersion and domination structures could be to allow each other to acess mother earth directly for humble self sustaining without anyone asking another to pay rent or buy land plus allow each other to leave the coersed association to the state at any moment without conditions so that we could meet each other in a free space for free beings, neither state nor nation, so that we could relate to each other one to one, negotiate directly with each other what would meet minimal requirements to live

So most government spending in America goes to the most vulnerable. Specifically 82% of spending is healthcare, social security, the military, and interest payments. You can't \\"cut\\" interest payments. So if you don't want to DIRECTLY affect the vulnerable, your only option is cut the military, and you can only get so much juice from that squeeze. The entire DOD budget ($900B) is less than half the current annual deficit ($2T). And even then you're affecting the vulnerable. From Kurds to guys at the VA waiting room.

The brain still hasn't fully developed by this stage, however, as it goes through a process of synaptic pruning until 25-30 years of age (hence why the brain is at its biggest in late adolescence and why schizophrenia can't be diagnosed until one reaches that age). Whilst everyone develops at a different rate and there are going to be individual variations in how much one has developed by these ages, these ages are quite reliable indicators for most individuals that they will be able to perform certain cognitive functions.Any age limit on anything is therefore going to be a relatively arbitrary line in the sand, but we can say that, on average, most people by the age of 18 will have developed what we know of as the adult brain. Of course,  there will be those who haven't fully developed by this age and there will be circumstances where an individual is more emotionally reactive than in others, but, on the whole, these ages are our best approximation of when the majority of people will have developed these capacities that they'll be using in a majority of circumstances. I mean, we could introduce testing to determine that this 18-year-old or that 21-year-old have reached these developmental milestones, but the constraints in doing so (not to mention the broader ethical implications) would make this impractical.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"This is a bunch of mass hysteria from various intelligence agency types and embassy officials, I cant imagine the amount of money and ink wasted investigating Russian magic electromagnetic super weapons or suchlike prompted by people with more power and political connections than sense.?","title":"Biden admin to brief Trump on pulsated electromagnetic or acoustic energy"},{"text":"LoKKKdown","title":"Trump sentencing: felon president-elect avoids jail as hush money judge in New York gives unconditional discharge for last years fraud conviction"},{"text":"\\"Superman but Evil\\" is the laziest character archetype and pop culture is full of it.* Homelander\\n* Omni-Man\\n* Injustice Superman\\n* Red Son SupermanI feel like the stand up crow meme with \\"Boo!

To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, It aint no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be. It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: if youre so smart, why aint you rich? There will also be an American flag no larger than a childs hand C glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor.

Liberals are far closer to fascists than they are to left wing, unironically. Liberals and fascists serve capitalism and imperialism, while left wings do not.The main difference between liberals and fascists are that liberals think poor brown ppl abroad and poor ppl back home deserve to be exploited and made their life hell, while fascists want the same but also extend to certain minorities and anyone hurting corporate profits like union members and those advocating for labor rights and regulations.","title":"Many subreddit are apparently being astroturfed.

Regardless of what was factually correct:[This study](https://eepro.naaee.org/research/eeresearch/state-standards-and-political-affiliation-influence-teaching-about-climate) sought to answer whether there were differences in climate knowledge between science teachers in California and Texas, and whether teachers' political orientation was related to their approaches to teaching climate change. They distributed a survey that asked teachers about their state's education standards for climate change and their approaches to teaching the subject. The survey included a section for teachers to rank a list of prepopulated topics they would prioritize if teaching climate change. The analysis found a strong correlation between state and political affiliation. As the researchers expected, California and/or Democratic teachers more broadly supported scientific consensus and taught more accurate lessons about climate change according to the researchers than Texas and/or Republican teachers.These tilts aren't just relegated to Texas and California.

Maybe we were already past that when the Bushes stole the office and REDMAP got pushed out, or when the GOP terrified us with the equivalent of a rubber Arab on a spring that goes \\"BLAH!\\", or when they swapped the entire nation's portfolio of private risk with public funds right on their exit in 2008. But the success of Jan 6, the invasion of government by Afrikaaner tycoons not even a generation separated from _actual Nazis_, the mass brutalization of nearly the entire rural population . .  we're long past all that. Now it's just worse and worse jackasses, year after year, until the rest of the world teaches us an expensive lesson.There was a war comic, sort of a short story, that revolved around these two Brits, sharing a cockpit in a Lancaster doing night bombing missions in WW2. The FO was a bleeding heart type, while the captain cracks jokes about how krauts smell when they're cooking. A note for us yanks: there's not a lot of self-deception in the UK about this stuff. Fairly early on the Brits figured out that dropping rocks from 30000ft, you're lucky to hit a county, and knowing that, they made the conscious decision to switch from point targets to hit the population. We never came to terms with that, we lied to ourselves about it until V-E day, and then we invented nukes and the whole \\"precision\\" point was suddenly very moot.Anyway, back to dear old Blighty, eventually the FO snaps, and the pilot gets pissed, and the shared resentment bleeds into their mission performance. Their ship starts taking losses. They start aborting missions. One of the new replacements tells the FO, after he's been stewing pretty good in the pub, that there's a reason the pilot's acting like such a frickin monster. He lost his ma, then his wife, then his sister and his baby daughter, all in the Blitz. The FO, bottle in hand, goes straight to confront the pilot, try to explain that what they're doing is just the same thing that happened to him, over and over again. Mild fisticuffs ensue. The pilot had this great bit, after he's flattened the FO, he bends over and screams in his face, and it's what made me write this entire frickin' novel:\\"It's not _evil_ and it's not _war_, Jack! There's something wrong, there's something _sick_ in that country, and I will not rest until we've _burned it out_!\\"Of course, that was 1944, and in 1945 the technology changed just a _bit_. Let's hope this crop of reactionary nincompoops is so bad at their jobs that humiliation comes without nuclear fire (HOW DOES FOOTBALL WORK, tweets the PotUS, clenching the red phone in one hand while pounding on the cover of the PES with the other).

In 1980 you had 16.3 years left on average .Since 1983 there has been a phase in of a two year increase and those born 1960 and later retire at full benefits at 67 years old. In 2024 at age 67 you have about 16.9 years left (averaging the sexes). So 2 more working years and about 0.6 more retirement years. This actually makes the ratio of working to retirement years slightly higher in favor of working years as 45/16.3&lt; 2/0.6 which means we *are* keeping things in line. Life expectancy hasn't really gone up much since the mid 00s even if we exclude the Covid spikes of 2020-2022. The issue is falling birthrates and uneven demographic waves. To remedy that we need measures beyond raising the age. Raise the cap a bit faster than inflation, increase payments a bit slower than inflation, and raise the tax ~0.5-1% over the course of a decade and you solve a lot of the problems.

It's only with the benefit of looking at society as a whole, with years of our own failures behind us, that we recognize the value of education and what we were and were not capable of when we were younger.I do think that people who are 16-18 should have the right to vote on certain things that involve them - local school boards; health care for minors; etc. - but as someone who spends their days interacting with a cross-section of age groups, and knowing the reasoning and forward-thinking abilities of those age groups; I don't trust anyone under 15 to vote.

If an adversarial foreign government bought all of our GPS data it wouldn't necessarily give them some massive Advantage but, imagine if they were planning some kind of attack, a surprise attack that maximized human loss. Let's say they decided to attack using a biological weapon like a disease. Foot traffic data proximity locations of individuals to other individuals would all be wonderful pieces of data if you were planning such a horrific idea. More specifically let's say you were planning to attack teas key member of a government agency and wanted to make it look like an accident, maybe having someone hit the car just the right way. But how to know where they drive everyday, well it just so happens that their young child has a location tracking app on their phone, a thing which most apps do. If you had access to the information from that you would know where he drops his kid off for school the exact route he takes and the travel time.Let's say that a person who is working on creating classified technology type stuff for the United States government. Spy drones, surveillance Tech or something like that. That person has a personal assistant who gets cc'd on a lot of their emails. That assistant has an app like tiktok on their phone and granted it permission to all of their files. Conceivably the phone might see documents that are in their texts or emails or perhaps simply a calendar with the names of people that are being met. These are completely normal things for personal assistant to have linked to their phone. But the app can also see that and be requisitioned by a foreign government. They now have the names of very important people, potential discussions of highly sensitive materials related to National Defense, not necessarily classified documents but any info is more than intelligence agencies want them to have.The point is the average person probably doesn't have anything the Chinese government or any other foreign government wants access to. It's the people who aren't the average person that is the concern. The concern comes from the senior level Civic engineer who just got forwarded the new plans for the city electrical grid for Manhattan in an email. The city council member who just received the updated plans for fire fighting measures in a wildfire prone City like Los Angeles. The low ranking government official who was tasked with coordinating all of the mail in ballots and polling locations in an election We just had an election where both of the candidates were running campaign materials on tiktok. I don't think either of the candidates had tiktok on their phone, but I bet they were in the room with an aide who did a lot of the time. These are all people who probably aren't your typical high-value Target but they each have little bits of information that can be pieced together. And if you have enough little pieces of information like I don't know 200 million americans, there's bound to be some stuff in there that paints a much larger picture. And now suddenly you have a foreign government able to do serious damage if they ever decide to do so.All apps could provide this information, but the ones that are owned by Americans we at least kind of have the ability to say, well at least those are owned by Americans so if we ever discover something Shady we can arrest them. When your shit is owned by a foreign government, the threat of getting arrested by the state department really doesn't have any teeth.","title":"Discussion Thread: Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in Case on TikTok Ban"},{"text":"My wager is that leaders in these companies are aware of their potential legal liability, and it is highly likely that Trump appoints an Attorney General that goes after companies with DEI policies / programs that conflict with existing anti-discrimination laws.Legal DEI program under current law: Have empowered HR executives whose entire purpose is to ensure that company policies and practices do not violate existing anti-discrimination laws.

They are, however, guilty of letting it continue.Well, in part yes, but probably not entirely. The thing is that the brainwashing is not entirely conscious, especially when it is being conducted from the very childhood. The choice to go along with the agenda is not always a conscious choice. It is not always just because of convenience. Rather it is a subconsious mechanism that prevents going against the mainstream programming. Almost like a switch.For example, we all know this image of half-crazy conspiracy theorist with messy hair, red eyes and whiteboard full of newspaper clippings. The thing is that this image has been created deliberately, it has been seeded into subconscious of society and it stops questioning things at the very early stages.Also, there's constant economic as well as social pressure to conform. Often those two go together - by conforming socially one lifts economic pressure a bit - and the other way around - by not conforming socially one risks to get into economic trouble as well.So, in short, sure, in large part the public really can be blamed for what's happening, but I still stand by the opinion that the largest part of the blame is on the elites.

Crude Oil and Energy Products\\n\\t?\\tCriticality: Canada supplies about 60% of U.S. crude oil imports. The U.S. relies heavily on this steady, high-quality supply, especially for its refineries optimized for Canadian oil sands crude. While the U.S. has domestic oil production and imports from other nations, replacing Canadian oil would be challenging due to logistical and economic reasons.\\n\\t?\\tWorkarounds: Alternatives like increasing imports from countries like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela would take time, come with geopolitical risks, and may not match refinery requirements.2. Electricity\\n\\t?\\tCriticality: Canada exports hydroelectric power to the U.S., particularly to states like New York and New England. This is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and meeting peak energy demands.\\n\\t?\\tWorkarounds: Building additional renewable energy capacity or increasing domestic generation would take years and significant investment.3. Aluminum\\n\\t?\\tCriticality: Canada provides about 40% of U.S. aluminum imports. This metal is essential for industries like aerospace, automotive, and construction. U.S. domestic production cannot meet demand, and alternatives are limited.\\n\\t?\\tWorkarounds: Importing aluminum from other countries (e.g., Russia or China) is possible but comes with geopolitical and supply chain risks.4. Uranium\\n\\t?\\tCriticality: Canada is a key supplier of uranium for U.S. nuclear power plants, which provide about 20% of the countrys electricity. Domestic uranium production is minimal, and Canada offers a stable, reliable source.\\n\\t?\\tWorkarounds: Imports from other countries like Kazakhstan or Australia are possible but involve increased logistical and political complexities.5. Softwood Lumber\\n\\t?\\tCriticality: Essential for U.S. construction, especially in residential housing. Canadas lumber industry has historically been integral to meeting U.S. demand.\\n\\t?\\tWorkarounds: Domestic lumber production or imports from other countries could partially compensate, but not without significant cost increases and delays.6. Potash\\n\\t?\\tCriticality: Canadian potash is crucial for fertilizers in U.S. agriculture. Domestic production is insufficient to meet demand, and a disruption could significantly impact crop yields.\\n\\t?\\tWorkarounds: Importing from other major producers (e.g., Russia or Belarus) would carry geopolitical risks.7. Natural Gas\\n\\t?\\tCriticality: Canadian natural gas is vital for heating, power generation, and industrial use in the U.S., particularly in northern states.\\n\\t?\\tWorkarounds: U.S. domestic production is substantial, but the proximity and cost-effectiveness of Canadian supply make it difficult to replace completely.8. Critical Minerals\\n\\t?\\tCriticality: Canada supplies several critical minerals, such as nickel and cobalt, essential for batteries, electronics, and renewable energy technologies. The U.S. lacks sufficient domestic production of these materials.\\n\\t?\\tWorkarounds: Dependence on countries like China or Russia for these materials is possible but would increase geopolitical risks.Why Are Some Workarounds Challenging?\\n\\t?\\tCost: Replacing Canadian imports often means higher costs for businesses and consumers.\\n\\t?\\tInfrastructure: Existing pipelines, power grids, and trade networks are optimized for Canada-U.S. trade.\\n\\t?\\tGeopolitical Stability: Canada is a stable, reliable trade partner, unlike some alternative suppliers.ConclusionWhile the U.S. has some potential workarounds for most products, reliance on Canada is deeply embedded in the supply chains for energy, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. For several key imports like crude oil, uranium, aluminum, and potash, immediate alternatives are either impractical or would cause significant economic and logistical disruptions.","title":"Trump Claims US Needs Nothing From Canada as They Bail Out Los Angeles"},{"text":"\\\\textbf{Agreed!}","title":"House Republican's Draft 5.2 Trillion Spending Cut Plan"},{"text":"Nobody even read the article.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene Says Devastating LA Wildfires Likely 'Started By Terrorists'"},{"text":"Every day I tell myself I am done with Reddit.
