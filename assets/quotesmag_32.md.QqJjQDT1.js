Also remember that   Ukraine was restrained from targeting Russian inland with those missilesThe comment below talks about Russia not using their full capacity but that's not true either.

These missiles can only be guided by US military satellites and controlled from US military with coordinates input by US Military. These are not assets than can be controlled by Ukraine. So, this means that actual US intelligence and soldiers will need to be doing all of the controlling, targeting, and guiding of the missiles to their targets. So, let's say you have a missile strike far into Russia, let's say even a city like Moscow. The only way that would be possible was because the USA literally did everything but pick the target.The problem here though is that the US Intelligence is basically working overtime providing targets to Ukraine, so any target Ukraine has for attack is almost assuredly thanks to Big Brother USA who has all the satellites and intelligence to give them the targets. This is no different than the USA launching missiles into Russia at this point. This is the absolute biggest escalation of the war so far, and there is no \\"Oh, Ukraine is picking the targets. We didn't do this\\" excuses anymore.This is marching us closer and closer to WW3. This might actually be the closest we have ever been in the history of our world to WW3 as this is a larger escalation than has ever existed even during the Cold War, and the media is downplaying, or showing it as a strength move by Biden.

He decided to go to Jonestown on a fact-finding mission. He addressed the members of the Peoples Temple the night of Nov. 17.Ryan had wanted to bring then Congressman from Indiana Dan Quayle, the future vice president, with him. Flynn says Quayles baby may have saved his life.He encouraged Dan Quayle to go down because he knew the temple had an Indiana connection and Quayles life was basically saved by his daughter, who was born around Thanksgiving of 1988.The next day Ryan was ready to leave. But, he was taking several people with him who wanted to leave the Temple. When they got to the air strip at Port Kaituma, several men were waiting on them. The men were Peoples Temple security. They ambushed the group and killed Ryan, one of the people leaving the temple, and three journalists. One of those journalists was Bob Brown, who caught some of the murder on tape as he fell with his camera.Later that day Jones convinced 918 people to take a combination of chemicals.The adults took injections.

Given how it seems both western and Russian intelligence communities wildly overestimated how easy invading Ukraine would be, the possibility of other actors directly intervening in the conflict against Russia was probably the only risk that Russia feared, and Biden actively removed that possibility from Russia's risk calculus.Keep in mind that all Russia really did to prepare the country for the invasion was staging these (impressively low effort) propaganda stunts about Ukrainian actions against the \\"separatists.\\" If Russia thought the risks of a full-scale invasion were too great, it would have been able to use that very propaganda to instead keep focus upon its frozen conflict in the Donbas. It only brought out any sort of broader justifications for the rest of Ukraine *after* invading, and even then there was a ton of hedging with the \\"Special Military Operation,\\" the closest thing to a casus belli given initially being just a bad history paper, and Russian state media's peculiar initial aversion to covering the conflict, and even the lack of mobilization after the war began. While I will acknowledge that part of the reasoning for being so secretive about the war prior including the lack of expected mobilization was probably about maintaining the element of surprise against Kyiv (essentially, Russia's op-sec of keeping even most of its rank-and-file soldiers in the dark about the military exercises actually being staging for the invasion worked to convince a lot of the Ukrainian intelligence community that these particular military exercises were just posturing because who would launch an invasion without telling a lot of the soldiers who were about to fight it? Zapp Brannigan?), that plus the initial weird aversion of even acknowledging the war in Russian state media and hesistance to do any mobilization after the war began do not fit with the idea and indicate that there was greater purpose.I contend that the most credible explanation for a greater purpose is that, even with Biden ruling out intervention initially, there was a serious fear in Russia's risk calculus of escalation against Russia as the invasion becoming real may provoke various NATO leaders, including Biden, into an interventionist stance in the conflict. This behavior was a strong indication that Moscow was still disuadable by military intervention and would be prepared to cut its losses and was already prepared to do so in a manner that would minimize the loss of face. By keeping everything vague from its casus belli to the use of the \\"Special Military Operation\\" to not doing mobilization and thus limiting the amount of Russians directly exposed to the conflict to its media not covering the conflict initially, Moscow had the freedom to control the narrative domestically by delaying the decision about what the narrative of the SMO was going to be after it became apparent what the war was going to be. Moscow was so thoroughly hedging the war that it was effectively engaging in the Texas Sharpshooter fallacy about what the SMO was.If no intervention happened and it went off without a hitch, \\"The special military operation was a clever ploy to topple the Zelensky Nazi regime that caught NATO-off guard and has been warmly received by our Ukrainian brothers freed from genocide.\\" In the unexpected event that it did not go smoothly but there was no NATO intervention, then you got what happened in real life where, \\"The special military operation is a war that is fought against the entirety of NATO to free Ukraine from the genocidal Zelensky regime, yet Russia advances still and will outlast fickle American leadership.\\" If intervention did happen, then they still likely had a cope they could have probably used which would have likely been something to the effect of, \\"In a master ploy of deception, our 'military exercise' tricked NATO into revealing Kiev's true colors as an American puppet regime which they aggressively fought for, and our brave military kept NATO forces at bay in the Kiev front while we actually committed to the true objective of the special military operation of defending the Donbas separatists against the genocidal Zelensky regime.\\"","title":"Biden lifts ban on Ukraine using US arms to strike inside Russia -"},{"text":"Old man still thinks its the fuckin Soviets on the other end of the phone.

He notably pushed the student debt forgiveness and a lot of his other policies were significantly to the left of where ANY president has been since the 1980s.  But a lot of the leadership in the Democratic Party are scared to death of appearing TOO liberal, so the line was watered down to a \\"more of the same\\" answer so that people could mistakenly believe that we will CONTINUE to have a moderate administration, when it really hasn't been that case the entire time Biden has been in office.Which then begs the question - why do we just assume Biden is moderate and not swinging far to the left if that's not what's happening at all?  The answer there being that the Democratic Party leadership is partly correct - news media has not painted Bidens liberal policies in a good light if they give it any light at all.  We have all basically just been ignoring how far left Bidens administration has run and now instead of getting \\"more of the same\\" we will be swinging hard-right and tanking the economy, societal standards, common decency, and everything else we know and love about this country.Sad times, and obviously Trump and his ilk are terrible terrible people, but it's so frustrating that Democrats decided they needed to cut themselves down YET AGAIN when they've done everything we could realistically expect them to do with the cards they've been dealt, Bidens administration has been pretty damn good if you go back and look at it's track record, and now we are just washing all that down the drain.","title":"\\"The Democrats lost this election because they ignored the justified anger of working class America and became the defenders of a rigged economy and political system.\\" -\\nBernie Sanders"},{"text":"The tweet in this screenshot is a response to AOC calling for party leadership to move on from Obama-era leaders.

Consider:1. The renewable transition and the electrification of transportation and other sectors is well underway, with significant momentum behind it. There is lots and lots of money being made right now on this and there are very powerful interests that have no intention of slowing down. Solar and wind power are everywhere (even Texas is building it like crazy), batteries are taking over the electric grid, and auto manufacturers are rapidly transitioning to EV manufacturing (also EVs are cool and sexy, people *really* like them). None of this is gonna change just because Trump picked an idiot oil industry crony to run DOE.\\n2. The US is not the entire world. And the rest of the world is very serious about renewable energy and decarbonization. Many developed countries have already achieved decoupling between CO2 emissions and GDP growth, and smaller developing countries are skipping the fossil fuel phase entirely and jumping straight to renewables. Not much Trump can do about that.\\n3. I know he promised to \\"drill baby drill\\", but, uh, *we're already doing that*. The US is currently producing more oil than it ever has in its entire history - I believe more than *any* country has ever produced in history. I suppose it's possible for us to produce more, but oil companies don't just drill for fun; they do it so they can sell it. Oil is a global market, and global demand has peaked. It's only going down from here. Nobody wants to spend money extracting a resource unless they can sell it for a profit, and as oil demand falls, excessive drilling will not be profitable. You can drill more, but you can't manufacture demand. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying another Trump term will be great for the environment. I'm sure there will be loosening of regulations resulting in more environmental damage, and he'll probably interfere with renewable energy development in various ways.But in the grand scheme of things, this train ain't stopping. We've already made enough progress to cut expected warming by the end of the century in half, avoiding the apocalyptic scenarios predicted 10 or 15 years ago. And that progress is accelerating rapidly.

It used to be the party of no wars in freedom of speech and now its the party of take freedom of speech away and go to war. People just werent going for that anymore as is evidenced by the landslide win. So thats not really up for debate and I will not debate you on that, the people have spoken. All I can tell you is that if there is some type of catastrophe that cannot be handled when people begin to lose confidence, then the pendulum will swing over to the left. If the Democrats can get their message in a more appointed NonWolk direction and focus on the issues that really affect people versus identity politics and get back to your core and stop Succumbing to Big corporate interest through the media, etc. I think the media that youve sadly been brainwashed with like CNN or MSNBC are going to fall by the wayside, because people are too smart to listen to their lies and rhetoric. But lets say in 2036 you can get your messaging on point and focus on more moderate positions, then you would definitely have a chance to win.","title":"CMV: Republicans will continue to win both the Presidency and Senate continually till 2036."},{"text":"I still firmly believe Mary Peltola can pull off the win in Alaska.

Russia bought 50k NK soldiers and is throwing them right into the meat grinder. They are suffering something like 1300 casualties per day. Russia has lost a chunk of their own territory to Ukrainian forces. Russia just slashed the promised payoffs to soldiers injured in battle from 3M rubles to anywhere from 100k to 1M rubles. Why?  Because payouts to injured soldiers has hit 6% of their budget. Stretching a 3 day war to 3 years makes those promised bonuses cost more than expected. Russian promises to make foreigners citizens after a short period of military service have been adjusted. While they are supposedly still going to get citizenship, they are not allowed to leave the military at the end of their contract. And if they leave anyway, they arent going to get that citizenship. Same thing for then volunteers from prisons. They have served their contracts, but arent granted leave. If they quit, they go back to prison. They now have to serve until the war ends. Russia put out job postings around the world that listed non military openings on military bases. Until the people show up and are shipped to the front lines. While Ukraine has been largely forced to just play defense, you cant just look at lines of control as Russia placed a lot of their command and control and supply chain outside Ukranian borders. Yet Ukraine has become very adept as striking inside Russia using their own weapons (mostly drones). They have effectively beaten the Russias Black Sea navy without any real navy of their own. While Ukraine has been brutalized and is also struggling with manpower and munitions, it isnt suffering to the same extent as Russia. Russias decades of decay and crumbling from corruption and kleptocracy has been shown in quite stark terms. Russia has had to resort to makeshift tanks that are just trucks with metal plates strapped onto them. They have lost most of their tanks and have had to literally pull Soviet era tanks out of museums and junk yards to try to backfill losses.

From the economic perspective, tariffs are bad, and doing them for economic purposes isn't goodThere can be narrower use cases, like climate, where the tariffs aren't being used for economic nationalism, not being used to boost the home country's workers over foreign labor, but are instead just being used for pushing the world to come to more of an accord on important matters of keeping the climate livable for humanity. With that use case, the intention isn't to give domestic emissions an advantage over foreign emissions, it's just to put domestic and foreign emissions on an equal playing field to drive them both down. That's still tariffs, but is a very different use case than the common populist argument for tariffsThere's also arguments for tariffs as a form of sanctions, which again isn't an economic populist argument as opposed to a matter of foreign policy.

Beyond that, they are seriously depleted on soldiers. What they are getting now are untrained civilians with maybe two weeks of training. They have pulled from the provinces they dont care about and are hoping to use these people to deplete the Ukranian munitions.

Despite inveighing against endless wars, Trump massively escalated the countrys existing wars in multiple theaters, leading to skyrocketing casualties. In Afghanistan, he substantially upped the amount of airstrikes, leading to a 330 percent increase in civilian deaths. In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the devastating Saudi-led war against the Houthis. According to the United Kingdoms Bureau of Investigative Journalism, there were 2,243 drone strikes in just the first two years of Trumps presidency, compared with 1,878 in the entire eight years of the Obama administration.Trump also came very close to tweeting the country into a nuclear war with North Korea in late 2017 and early 2018, a completely self-inflicted incident that seems to have been bizarrely memory-holed.In 2018, Trump bowed to Washingtons neoconservative hawks and withdrew from a working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in Iran scaling up both its provocative activities in the region and its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks, should it decide to do so. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it wouldve taken Iran at least a year.

Trump actually managed a record high turn out for himself and republicans.  This time they nearly swept the whole damn government away from them. Harris lost votes from dems, yeah, but it wasnt the leftist votes she lost, per se, that cost her the election, or cost the party so many seats around the country. The dems may have still lost big, including the presidency, even if Harris lost far fewer votes relative to the 2020 numbers. The dems efforts to speak to center right people wasnt the issue. The issue was that the dems werent telling those people on the center right what they really needed to hear. And those people didnt buy it. Heres why. 1. They needed as many votes as possible to account for the worst case scenario that Trump had a turnout that was at least as good or better than his 2020 amount to ensure he didnt win. They werent able to get all those votes, but there are a lot of factors to consider about why that is. \\nI find it highly unlikely that a single group of people on the left who are notorious for never showing up to vote anyways were the determinative factor here. One only needs to see how good Trumps numbers were in rural areas that tend to have few left leaning voters to see that. He crushed it among his core constituency while Harris trended very poorly in her expected high turnout areas. Granted, in a lot of the places that is true, Biden still lost handily to Trump in 2020, but he did better than Harris did this year, because in many of these counties, Harris got very few or sometimes zero votes. This probably contributed a lot to her losing the popular vote in the swing states where it was more right. That is not me blaming leftists by the way, its just an observation. I think the democrats did make mistakes too, but I attribute them differently. I think the economy, the media environment, the mistake of letting Biden run, and Trumps inflated popularity are some of the bulk of factors that affected things this time around. There was no single block of voters on the left of the aisle that is to blame for not showing up considering how bad the loss was nationwide. I know plenty of leftists who did say they wouldnt support either candidate, personally, but I still believe there are just far more people who are center right, moderate, or center left active voters combined, than the total number of registered voters who are leftists in this country. Even discarding all the registered people in those groups who did sit out this election or refused to vote for a candidate on the top of the ballot, there are probably more people who voted this election than there are leftists who both to even be registered to vote, period. Many leftists who dont vote also arent registered, to be fair. 2. Im not saying that more of them arent out there who *could* have voted for dems this election and didnt. Im just saying in terms of the actual results, the groups that have the most impact are disproportionately these groups of voters I mentioned. Even if, on a national politics level, much of the partisan affiliations that they align with seem more extreme than ever, many of these people in the centers views are vastly more complex than people generally assume. These are the people who split the ticket between Trump and democratic governors in the swing states and handed Trump a huge victory in those areas. Look at NC. The new blue governor of this very, very purple state got more votes than either presidential candidate, and more votes than Trump by the same margin that Trump beat Harris. The blue governor got more votes than Harris by twice the margin Trump beat her on. Admittedly, he was running against Mark Robinson, so thats to be expected somewhat, but still. Some of these people were willing to refuse Robinson and actively vote against him , but still either voted for Trump, or refused to vote for either candidate. Theres a lot of people like that around the country right now, and most of them are not leftists. Its not even close. 3. Combined with the stronger than expected support for Trump in many key democratic areas even, it seems even more plausible that Harris simply lost some of her likely voters, either to Trump or to apathy, in cities that have a strong population of republicans and independents. It is very likely that many of those who didnt show up for Harris, could have been right-leaning, center, or center left people. Many of whom may have sat out the election because they didnt have a candidate that they really felt comfortable voting for. A good chunk of people who feel that way are leftists, also, Ill grant you that, but I think that people tend to overestimate how many leftists actually vote in any election. A good deal of only really show up if you pander to them directly, in my view, and even then only a minority of them get off their ass to go vote. Based on the sentiments about the economy and the general rejection of the dems economic messaging, it fits the overall takeaway that many others have had: the Dems lost due to a failure to assuage concerns about inflation. Considering that to be the case, I also find it unlikely that a group of people who tend to have consistently negative attitudes towards most of our economic system as a whole, already, would have been willing to vote for Harris even if she had run a very populist agenda, because these people almost always think it is never good enough. Even when things move in that direction every now and then, a lot of these people dont come out to vote if they disagree with the slightest thing about it. It is almost always the case, throughout our long history of voting in this country, that it when the middle of the country shifts to the left or right, there are big shifts in the overall electorate.I agree with you that the Democrats effort to appeal to centrist or center right voters failed to achieve the desired results but I dont think it was a mistake to try. I also dont think it was such a mistake that it cost her the election by driving away many leftists who would have voted for her. I just think they really hurt their chances with people by keeping Biden in the race so long, letting that whole nightmare happen in the first place. I do think Harris did a good job all around salvaging the race, all things considered, even if her ploy to steal votes away from Trump with moderates failed. But that aside, she ran a good campaign, and I think her popular policy platform and its general appeal would have won her the election under different circumstances.","title":"Democrats and the Case of Mistaken Identity Politics"},{"text":"What does he have to lose?","title":"Biden allows Ukraine to use US arms to strike inside Russia"},{"text":"Were on year three of Russia being months from collapse.

They simply must recognize that several planks of their platform are thoroughly rotten.Identity politics is over. No one wants it. Latinos and blacks don't even want it, as witnessed by the fact that they moved to Trump in record numbers. Trump got a majority of Latino men nationwide, and in some counties he got a majority of Latino men and women, even with all that he has said about immigrants from Latin America over the yearslike that they're poisoning the blood of our people, which is straight out of Mein Kampf. A comedian called Puerto Rico a pile of garbage at a Trump rally, and the entire democratic machine, and all of liberal media, seized upon it, as though a nuclear bomb had just vaporized an American city, and no one cared.Identity politics is dead, and we have to bury it.There's one species of identity politics that had an enormous effect on this election, and most Democrats don't seem to realize it: Around half a percent of American adults identify as transgender or non-binarythat's 1 in 200 people.  And yet the activism around this identity has deranged our politics for as long as Trump has been in politics. One lesson that I would be quick to draw from this election is that Americans aren't really fond of seeing biological men punch women in the face at the Olympics.1 And if that sounds like transphobia to youyou're the problem. Political equality, which we should want for everyone, does not mean that trans women are women.Trans women are people and should have all the political freedom of people. But to say that they are womenand that making any distinction between them and biological women, for any purpose, is a thought crime and an act of bigotrythat is the precept of a new religion. And it is a religion that most Americans want nothing to do with.I want to be very clear about this: I have no doubt that there are real cases of gender dysphoria, and we should want to give such people all the help they need to feel comfortable in their own bodies and in society. How we think about this, and how we understand it scientifically, is still in flux. But there are four-year-olds who, apropos of nothing, claim to be in the wrong bodyfor instance, they were born a boy, but they insist that they're really girlsand they never waver from this. It's pretty obvious in those cases that something is going on neurologically, or hormonallyat the core of their beingand that it is not a matter of them having been influenced by the culture. But, conversely, there now seem to be countless examples where the possibility of social contagion is obvious. Where, due to the influence of trans activists on our institutions, these kids are effectively in a cult, being brainwashed by a new orthodoxy.  These are radically different cases, and we shouldnt be bullied into considering them to be the same.I've spoken to many Democrats in recent years, and over the course of this election, and a shocking percentage of them imagine that all the controversy about trans rights and gender identity in kids is just a product of right-wing bigotryand that its a non-issue, politically. Whereas it is obvious that, for millions of Americans, it might as well have been the only issue in this election. Not because they are transphobic assholes, but because they simply do not accept the new metaphysics, and even new biology, mandated by trans activists and the institutions that they have successfully bullied and captured. And it's important to say that not all trans people agree with what these activists say and do.Having the thought police suddenly proscribe the use of the term woman, and demanding that we speak instead of birthing person, or menstruators, or people with ovaries, or some other Orwellian construction designed to test everyone's patience and sanity the sight of people being deplatformed on social media or fired from universities for merely stating that there are two biological sexesI actually know a professor who lost her job at Harvard over this witnessing an epidemic of gender confusion spread through our schools, when people with their own eyes could see that this was a social contagion being encouraged by the schools themselvesthe ultimate fruition of which, in many cases, is irreversible medical procedures We've got an epidemic of teenage girls wanting double mastectomiesand some are actually getting them, based on ideas being spread on TikTokand any parent who resists this trend gets demonized and, under certain conditions, could lose custody of their kids?Congratulations, Democrats.

So, to return to my hobby horse, I think there are some lessons that the Democrats really must absorb from what is undeniably a total political defeat. They simply must recognize that several planks of their platform are thoroughly rotten. Identity politics is over. No one wants it. Latinos and blacks don't even want it, as witnessed by the fact that they moved to Trump in record numbers. Trump got a majority of Latino men nationwide, and in some counties he got a majority of Latino men and women, even with all that he has said about immigrants from Latin America over the yearslike that they're poisoning the blood of our people, which is straight out of Mein Kampf. A comedian called Puerto Rico a pile of garbage at a Trump rally, and the entire democratic machine, and all of liberal media, seized upon it, as though a nuclear bomb had just vaporized an American city, and no one cared.Identity politics is dead, and we have to bury it. There's one species of identity politics that had an enormous effect on this election, and most Democrats don't seem to realize it: Around half a percent of American adults identify as transgender or non-binarythat's 1 in 200 people.  And yet the activism around this identity has deranged our politics for as long as Trump has been in politics. One lesson that I would be quick to draw from this election is that Americans aren't really fond of seeing biological men punch women in the face at the Olympics.1 And if that sounds like transphobia to youyou're the problem. Political equality, which we should want for everyone, does not mean that trans women are women.Trans women are people and should have all the political freedom of people. But to say that they are womenand that making any distinction between them and biological women, for any purpose, is a thought crime and an act of bigotrythat is the precept of a new religion. And it is a religion that most Americans want nothing to do with.I want to be very clear about this: I have no doubt that there are real cases of gender dysphoria, and we should want to give such people all the help they need to feel comfortable in their own bodies and in society. How we think about this, and how we understand it scientifically, is still in flux. But there are four-year-olds who, apropos of nothing, claim to be in the wrong bodyfor instance, they were born a boy, but they insist that they're really girlsand they never waver from this. It's pretty obvious in those cases that something is going on neurologically, or hormonallyat the core of their beingand that it is not a matter of them having been influenced by the culture. But, conversely, there now seem to be countless examples where the possibility of social contagion is obvious. Where, due to the influence of trans activists on our institutions, these kids are effectively in a cult, being brainwashed by a new orthodoxy.  These are radically different cases, and we shouldnt be bullied into considering them to be the same.I've spoken to many Democrats in recent years, and over the course of this election, and a shocking percentage of them imagine that all the controversy about trans rights and gender identity in kids is just a product of right-wing bigotryand that its a non-issue, politically. Whereas it is obvious that, for millions of Americans, it might as well have been the only issue in this election. Not because they are transphobic assholes, but because they simply do not accept the new metaphysics, and even new biology, mandated by trans activists and the institutions that they have successfully bullied and captured. And it's important to say that not all trans people agree with what these activists say and do.Having the thought police suddenly proscribe the use of the term woman, and demanding that we speak instead of birthing person, or menstruators, or people with ovaries, or some other Orwellian construction designed to test everyone's patience and sanity the sight of people being deplatformed on social media or fired from universities for merely stating that there are two biological sexesI actually know a professor who lost her job at Harvard over this witnessing an epidemic of gender confusion spread through our schools, when people with their own eyes could see that this was a social contagion being encouraged by the schools themselvesthe ultimate fruition of which, in many cases, is irreversible medical procedures We've got an epidemic of teenage girls wanting double mastectomiesand some are actually getting them, based on ideas being spread on TikTokand any parent who resists this trend gets demonized and, under certain conditions, could lose custody of their kids?

He did it in his first term, I wasn't thrilled, but these decisions aren't made in a vacuum. But I digress. What Adam Smith found in his inquiry was that people in a nation free to engage in mutually beneficial exchange did much better efficiently allocating resources than nations where the government imposed tariffs to direct the economy. But tariffs arent the only means a government has to pervert economic incentives. Taxing different industries at different rates, or providing economic incentives for certain industries are methods that are just as effective(harmful) as tariffs. So if you're coming out against the idea of tariffs, you must also be against the \\"Green New Deal\\", carbon credits, and all taxes on businesses because they regressively affect the poorest end consumers.

Trump's \\"us or the EU\\" rhetoric seems to have made everyone (including Starmer) edge a couple steps closer to the EU. Which *does* make sense. The UK still does more trade with the 27 EU countries than the US. The US might be the largest *single* country, but *overall* if you add all 27 EU countries, it's higher, closer, and much more stable than the US under Trump.And Brexit, for better or worse, seems to have made continental parties really shut up about the prospect. Even right-wingers such as the AfD in Germany have grown suspiciously quiet about it. And for good reason. Between all of that, Starmer and Macron already promising to continue supporting Ukraine \\"as long as possible\\", most potential German coalition possibilities having at least *one* pro-Ukraine party, and Trump being 79, I think we can be positive that the EU and UK can ride this out together.If there is one silver lining to all of this, it's that both Putin and Trump are in their 70's (or nearly 80's) and time always gets their due. And no, the people who come *after* them might not be much better, but it provides a small chance for change. A power vacuum always does.The only thing we need to be *really* cautious about in the next decade is continued Russian election meddling switching from the US to UK and the wider EU.

In the long term perhaps, but I'm also sympathetic to the Whig view of history. Firstly, there is nothing stopping executives and shareholders to be racist themselves and therefore blind to efficiency. Secondly, short-term backlash by a minority can have an impact. Remember Disney as a media company pushing LGBT representation? Well, they intervened in the creation of Inside Out 2 to make Riley look \\"less gay\\" and blocked an episode of Moon Girl and Devil dinosaur because it revealed that a character was trans. This is not a change in the creators, but an adaptation to the perceived market.2. In the context of the 60s, racism was a lot more widespread and socially accepted. I'm sure I don't need to tell you what happened with those public pools. Even if racists weren't/aren't a majority of the total population, if they are concentrated they can still impact large sections of the economy.

Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.  \\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century  \\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. Youve already done this, havent you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.  \\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of our institutions unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions dont protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.  \\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.  \\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of terrorism and extremism. Be alive to the fatal notions of exception and emergency. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.  \\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Dont fall for it.  \\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Dont use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps The Power of the Powerless by Vclav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes?aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.  \\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.  \\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.  \\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.  \\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.  \\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.  \\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.  \\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.  \\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.  \\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.  \\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.  \\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.  \\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)  \\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.  \\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.  \\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.  \\n?

I don't even disagree with him on the actual issue, but this is an issue that impacts less than 5% of the public. Democrats lost because for 30 years, they've abandoned the working class. They've pursued free trade agreements like NAFTA, which have decimated the working class and cozied up to big donors and Wall Street. Kamala even had a Wall Street approved campaign. Instead of actually looking at why working people are abandoning the Democratic party, he's explaining the results by saying trans issues were the reason Democrats lost. Shifting right on trans issues won't hurt the donor class and economic royalists, which have destroyed this nation. Actually taking on power and standing up for the working class does take courage. And it's the right thing to do. Moulton believes that Democrats should shift right on these issues and continue to run a corporate friendly party. That's not going to change the results.","title":"Detailed Analysis of Progressive Options for 2028"},{"text":"This has to be one of the dumbest ideas Ive seen in recent times.

I saw him on TV many decades ago.  His thesis was that in olden times men had a much larger role in their sons' lives.  Most men were craftsmen or farmers, and worked from home.  A son learned his father's trade by example -- every day was \\"take your son to work day\\".  Along with a trade, a son learned what it meant to be a man.  Starting in the 19th Century, most men went off to work in factories and mines, and sons were left at home to be raised by their mothers.  Later they went to school, to be taught mostly by women.  Without the constant presence of a father, sons did not learn first-hand what it meant to be a man, leaving a gap in their psyches.It's an interesting argument.  I don't buy it, but I was raised more by women than by men, though dad did spend a lot of time with me.

More recently, Jack Smiths recent legal actions and the temporary (1 year) New York State law passed to enable virtually anyone to file charges against anyone for actions (even from years ago), are examples of how the justice system has been weaponized to target political opponents, particularly Trump.

Russian troops are killing, maiming, torturing, and raping Ukrainians. Russia has killed over 80,000 Ukrainians. Russia is banning Ukrainian language and trying to destroy Ukrainian culture. The Russian government has taken over 100,000 Ukrainian children from their parents, against their will, and sent them to Russia with no intention of returning them to their parents. The childrens names are changed so their parents cannot find them. Russia has put thousands of Ukrainians in camps where they are abused, starved, and killed. Russian airstrikes intentionally target civilians and infrastructure. Russian war crimes are not isolated incidents, the war crimes are approved by Putin. The Russian government does not punish troops who commit war crimes. Russian police arrest and torture Russians who protest the war. Russian media promotes war and denies war crimes. Russian media promotes genocide by calling for the end of Ukrainian identity and the assimilation of Ukrainians into Russia. The United States should send humanitarian aid and military aid to Ukraine so Ukrainians can defend themselves from Russia. Military aid to Ukraine has prevented Russia from occupying more Ukrainian territory. The United States can afford to help Ukraine because less than 1% of the federal budget has been spent on Ukraine. Sanctions against Russia should be toughened and strictly enforced.

It greatly increases the cost of the war for Russia. Had this been done 2 years ago they might have a peace deal already, and that would in turn relieve a lot of food inflation as Ukraine came online fully for their various grain crops. The idea that wed give Ukraine some cutting edge stuff Russia lacks counters to, then tie it off with kid gloves that allow Russia to just move depots back a few miles more is bizarre. A common thread in U.S.-Russian relations is Russian leaders assess our presidents as men, and if they think they are weak, push. When presented evidence to the contrary, they make deals. See Cuban missile crisis - started when they thought Kennedy was a pansy because of his terrible decision making in bay of pigs and also an in person meeting where he didnt seem confident, ended when he stopped acting weak. This may be no different. We let them get inside our head (or Bidens handlers heads) on myriad red lines none of which have mattered. Putin sees weakness so he keeps going. Its maybe not the most popular opinion on the right these days, but despite the naysayers like sacks, weve dramatically scaled artillery production domestically way ahead of schedule, and it keeps speeding up. When Ukraine is flush with relatively cheap anti air missiles and artillery shells, Russia makes no progress and Ukraine does. When they arent, Russia outshoots them and makes progress. The war can be simplified almost to those terms. Deep strike missiles disrupt  Russian supply chain of artillery shells severely denying them this advantage. In any case we need to wrap this up and focus on other problems. If Russia thinks Trump wont give up, a deal will probably happen very quickly in my opinion.","title":"Fox News: Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia: report"},{"text":"True.

This is the same tone deaf shit as managers thinking pizza parties and casual Fridays are a good substitute for a livable wage! I voted Harris because I understand the bigger picture because I pay attention to politics. The average person doesn't. The average person doesn't care about the plight of people half a world away when they're struggling to pay their rent. The average person doesn't care about LGBTQ rights when they're having to figure out how to feed their kid. Do I think Trump will somehow magically lower all these prices? Fuck no. We're going to have more profiteering than ever out of companies like Kellogg and Nestle. Someone like Trump is more likely to lower minimum wage or do away with it entirely. And that's not even going in to tariffs. Trump is not going to be good for the average person but he convinced him he would be, while Harris and Biden before her didn't. The Dems had 4 years to deal with Trump. They had 4 years to see that he was punished under the law that he broke openly, willfully and happily hundreds of times. And they slow-walked the entire thing and now he won't get so much as a slap on the wrist.The Dems had 4 years to inspire this country, to convince the people, to show that they were really working for the people. And they failed to do that. They failed to inspire this country. They failed to show the average person on the streets they were better off than they were under Trump.

This [article is a good summary of the whole effort to produce planes in the US in WW2](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-300000-airplanes-in), but to make it short most of the final assembly happened in newly produced factories built as expansions of existing aircraft manufacturers with car factories mainly taking on smaller parts (and this being in a time when aircraft used internal combustion engines, though twenty times more powerful, much more intensively used and much lighter), and even then they very much struggled with the vast difference in tolerances and materials used:When Ford built a facility to manufacture Pratt &amp; Whitney engines at its Rouge plant, its existing tools were only suitable for 10% of the tools needed; the other 90% had to be built new.That's basically an entirely new factory's worth of tooling, not including the fact that they had to remake essentially all of the drawings from scratch (because they were made with experienced workers in mind who didn't need them for a lot of things and wouldn't always write down changes) and hire thousands of new workers, with a lot more inspectors than before. And, again, this is for a facility making essentially same kind of things Ford already made (internal combustion engines). Even for other things that's generally how most conversions happened, in fact - strip out everything that was there and build a new factory inside the same building (conversions using existing tooling mainly ended up for very simple things like compasses). Sure, that's worth something, but building a big boxy building quickly isn't the hardest of tasks for modern construction, making specialised machinery and training a workforce is.","title":"Did you know that succ disorder affects a growing number of r/neoliberal users?"},{"text":"Why would I want to learn about Hitler, when Trump is clearly worse than him!","title":"We voted for Trump in a democratic election, you idiots keep blindly making up random trash about him and were supposed to vote for you after that?

Many of the largest donors in the county all made an alarming swing towards Trump this time around. All of the top mega donors used to be a pretty mixed bag. These people are all billionaires, but lately that group of people has been siding very strongly with Trump and getting very invested in helping him return to office. Some were firmly Republican donors, others were firmly Democrats, and another good chunk was bipartisan donors who tended to have mixed views and were optimistic about helping both sides achieve mutual goals. No more. Now, out of the top ten mega donors in the country, only 2 of them supported the dems at all this cycle. The rest spent massive amount of money on Trump. All that is a huge deal on top of the very big issue with how the media handles Trump and sanewashes the GOP. I think that explains a lot of why the Democrats have been acting the way they did since Biden took office. They knew the media was a major problem that made it very difficult for them to combat the GOPs schemes. Not to mention they still really seem to have no idea how to deal with the cesspool that is social media. And on top of all that, they could see how much appeal the right was angling for with billionaires, and they knew there was a really good chance that they would get horribly outspent. They were afraid. Terrified. Horrified, at the concept that many of these billionaires were running straight into the arms of Trump, and I think in many ways that fear kept them distracted from recognizing just how badly their party needed to change and play hardball with aggressive media coverage and campaigns, and a populist agenda of their own to counter what was happening on the right.","title":"Democrats, reeling from election losses, cast blame on each other"},{"text":"But is was cute then... yes, turns out she wasn't really acting.","title":"Family Ties Star Justine Bateman Says Trump Victory Removed Suffocating Cloud on Free Speech: We Went 1984 on Ourselves Under Biden"},{"text":" but what weve seen in practice from the democrats/left-leaning over the last 4 years is far closer to the authoritarianism youre worried about (which was nothing like the 4 years before when Trump was in office).\\nlol, wut..... ?","title":"Family Ties Star Justine Bateman Says Trump Victory Removed Suffocating Cloud on Free Speech: We Went 1984 on Ourselves Under Biden"},{"text":"Good.

Democratic insiders thought people would vote for Kamala Harris, even if they didnt like her, to get rid of Trump. But more people ended up voting for Trump, even though many didnt like him, because they liked the Democratic Party less.I have often talked about how my dad stayed up all night on the night Harry Truman was elected because he was so excited. And my brother stayed up all night the first time Trump was elected because he was so excited. And I felt that Democrats would never recover that kind of excitement until they could figure out why they had turned off so many working-class voters over the decades, and why they had developed such disdain toward their once loyal base.Democratic candidates have often been avatars of elitism  Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and second-term Barack Obama. The party embraced a worldview of hyper-political correctness, condescension and cancellation, and it supported diversity statements for job applicants and faculty lounge terminology like Latinx, and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color). This alienated half the country, or more. And the chaos and antisemitism at many college campuses certainly didnt help.When the woke police come at you, Rahm Emanuel told me, you dont even get your Miranda rights read to you. There were a lot of Democrats barking, people who dont represent anybody, he said, and the leadership of the party was intimidated.Donald Trump played to the irritation of many Americans disgusted at being regarded as insensitive for talking the way theyd always talked. At rallies, he referred to women as beautiful and then pretended to admonish himself, saying hed get in trouble for using that word. Hed also call women darling and joke that he had to be careful because his political career could be at risk.One thing that makes Democrats great is that they unabashedly support groups that have suffered from inequality. But they have to begin avoiding extreme policies that alienate many Americans who would otherwise be drawn to the party.Democrats learned the hard way in this election that mothers care both about abortion rights and having their daughters compete fairly and safely on the playing field.A revealing chart that ran in The Financial Times showed that white progressives hold views far to the left of the minorities they champion. White progressives think at higher rates than Hispanic and Black Americans that racism is built into our society. Many more Black and Hispanic Americans surveyed, compared with white progressives, responded that America is the greatest country in the world.Gobsmacked Democrats have reacted to the wipeout in different ways. Some think Kamala did not court the left enough, touting trans rights and repudiating Israel.Other Democrats feel the opposite, calling on the party to reimagine itself. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a vulnerable Democrat in a red congressional district in Washington, narrowly held her seat. The 36-year-old mother of a toddler and owner of an auto shop told The Timess Annie Karni that Democratic condescension has to go. Theres not one weird trick thats going to fix the Democratic Party, she said. It is going to take parents of young kids, people in rural communities, people in the trades running for office and being taken seriously.Representative Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the party needs rebranding. Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone, he said. I have two little girls. I dont want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat Im supposed to be afraid to say that.On CNN, the Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky said that Democrats did not know how to talk to normal Americans. Addressing Latinos as Latinx to be politically correct makes them think that we dont even live on the same planet as they do, she said. When we are too afraid to say that Hey, college kids, if youre trashing a campus of Columbia University because you arent happy about some sort of policy and youre taking over a university and youre trashing it and preventing other students from learning, that that is unacceptable. But were so worried about alienating one or another cohort in our coalition that we dont know what to say.Kamala, a Democratic lawmaker told me, made the colossal mistake of running a billion-dollar campaign with celebrities like Beyonc when many of the struggling working-class voters she wanted couldnt even afford a ticket to a Beyonc concert, much less a down payment on a home. I dont think the average person said, Kamala Harris gets what Im going through, this Democrat said.Kamala, who sprinted to the left in her 2020 Democratic primary campaign, tried to move toward the center for this election, making sure to say shed shoot an intruder with her Glock. But it sounded tinny. The Trump campaigns most successful ad showed Kamala favoring tax-funded gender surgery for prisoners. Bill Clinton warned in vain that she should rebut it.James Carville gave Kamala credit for not leaning into her gender and ethnicity. But he said the party had become enamored of identitarianism  a word he uses because he wont say woke  radiating the repellent idea that identity is more important than humanity.We could never wash off the stench of it, he said, calling defund the police the three stupidest words in the English language.

Very few people who said this had even watch a full debate or interview involving her. Instead they watched carefully edited and manipulated TikTok clips on their social media feeds.

But nonetheless, it is an extreme problem that is only going to get worse. Bradbury had Fahrenheit 451 only half right.

This is not a problem that we will probably face in our lifetimes unless there is a flashpoint that kicks it off. Consider the case of Russia or North Korea; it has been show repeatedly that state actors are capable of drawing upon incredibly amounts of resources; far in excess of what most predictors would guess, because of their ability to draw *from the state*. This was first shown by Napoleon during the first wars of the coalition, where a nation that was fully mobilized was capable of fighting nearly the rest of Europe combined to a standstill. Egypt probably will, at some point, implode if left without intervention, but the resources available for the Egyptian government are much deeper than it would first seem. The US Government, for example, is up to its eyeballs in debt  it owes several times the net worth of Africa combined, and yet nobody has really seriously considered the possibility that the US government will implode due to debt. It would be the same with Egypt: a state, when properly motivated, is capable of mobilizing enormous amounts of resources to maintain itself through various methods, like selling off bonds, taking on debt, drawing from supernational coalitions, printing more money, and outright seizing assets as it deems necessary. The actual value of a sovereign state is immense, and it can leverage its own net worth several times over via various mechanisms before it starts to reach the point of insolvency. Who is going to stop them? Nobody else has sovereignty over Egyptian soil. That is the purpose of a state. So no, I doubt very much we will see the nation of Egypt implode due to famine alone during our lifetimes. There may be other factors at play that cause it  the Arab Spring was a good example, but in every case it was a combination of political factors that food insecurity helped exacerbate. For Egypt to fall into the same stateless situation were seeing in Palestine, Syria or Yemen due to famine, wed have to see major movements happen  things striking at the core of Egyptian nationhood, which would make it more difficult to undertake these emergency measures. Certainly it will not be an issue for likely the next 2 decades at the earliest. Ultimately, a nation exists because of the collective belief of the people that live there, because that is what allows a nation to call upon the resources that it does. If for some reason everyone in the US simultaneously decided that we were no longer a nation, then it would be so. But because we all collectively believe that the US is a large, powerful, and stable nation, the US has the ability to essentially swim in its own debt. Its a delicate balancing act, and thats why its so dangerous to nations to have highly radical voices on the political front, because they strike at the core of what allows a nation to exist.In the case of Egyptian food insecurity, one need look no further than North Korea. The people there, on average, subsist in a condition that is marginally worse than that of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. But because of the loyalty of the people to the idea of the government, and especially the loyalty of the military to the government, they continue to soldier through horrendous conditions while their Great Leader flies around the world to hobnob at state dinners.","title":"CMV: Egypt will collapse, and it will trigger the largest refugee crisis in human history"},{"text":"I mean these people are annoying/delusional/insufferable to varying extents but mostly they just believe stuff and think they need to parrot due to news social media etc. A lot of them would likely be completely different people in the absence of this conditioning and I dont wish actual fascist persecution (what they think trump is in their magic paranoia land) on them.","title":"We voted for Trump in a democratic election, you idiots keep blindly making up random trash about him and were supposed to vote for you after that?

Ive given up all chance at inner peace. Ive made my mind a sunless space. I share my dreams with ghosts. I wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago from which theres only one conclusion, Im damned for what I do. My anger, my ego, my unwillingness to yield, my eagerness to fight, theyve set me on a path from which there is no escape. I yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost and by the time I looked down there was no longer any ground beneath my feet. What is my sacrifice? Im condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone elses future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know Ill never see. And the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror or an audience or the light of gratitude. So what do I sacrifice? Everything!(For those curious about the image choice, its from this scene in the Star Wars show *Andor*)I think saying liberalism is the rebellion is a little cringe, and I dont agree that America is now illiberal  for as bad as Trump is, well still likely have free and fair elections (since those are largely controlled by the states). 2026 will be the litmus test for if democracy can persist during Trumps second term, and I think it will. But it would be overly optimistic to not admit that things are *bad*. Like, really fucking bad. And frankly, it feels like it may never get better in my lifetime. Im a youngster, but Im honestly not sure if well ever get back to where we were in the 90s within my lifetime. But I dont want that to demotivate me either, and it shouldnt demotivate you because humanity and America have been in far worse spots. Progress for the human race has always been an uphill battle, and we often face setbacks, but I think history shows that good is only ever guaranteed to lose when good stops fighting. Of course this isnt Star Wars and were not suddenly gonna be having stupid space battles, but the small things  voting, volunteering, donating, and just being a good person who practices what you preach for in society  can make change, even if it is painfully slow. When I was born, gay marriage wasnt even legal and the bipartisan consensus was against gay marriage, and now the vast majority in even conservative states support it. Peoples minds can change, and it can happen faster than youd think.

However, when you stop advancing forward, then you need to ask what/if has happened. So let me use Obamacare as an example. Political reality hit hard during the passgae of the ACA. A single payer system couldn't be passed at that time (cough Joe Liberman cough cough) The right distorted and lied to high heaven about Obamacarws effects for the next year, leading to blowouts in 10 and 12 and 14 at the congressional level. Do we not remember Obama famous saying about a pen and phone. Since the ACA, there has been no meaningful effort to expand past the ACA. In fact, a single payer system has been demonized despite loads of evidence from other countries about the effectiveness of such a system. Hell, we only were able to get Medicare drug negations this past year. 16 years post the passage of the ACA with 2 democratic presidencies (including one with the trifecta). Much of this blockage has not come from the on the ground party but throttled at the top level of the party that sets the agenda. If I were to guess, this is primarily due to 2 reasons. 1) Cooperate influence withing the party and \\n2) The natural tendency of dems to move rightward in response to GOP's attacks. Regardless of whether the party This situation has replayed numerous accross multiple issues. Student loans. Well, there has been a crisis over the past 30 years with only bandaid solutions offered. The left should have been excoriating both universities for their ridiculous pricing schemes and the GOP over blocking relief. Instead, we got some EO and promises that where over turned at the SC level. Notice here that I'm not saying loan forgiveness, but attacking the root of the problem.Climate. 1000% the Investments in the infrastructure and chips acts where needed and thankful for. However, this has been an issue for what 20-30 years? So why did it take so long to be addressed? Housing. Kamala had some great proposals sure, but there was no mention that the root of the issues was because too much power rests at the community level when it is some to building. That was not addressed at all and still isn't being addressed or really even talked about at the national level. I could go on. It just seems like we have a small progress stall for 20-30 years while letting folks slip further and further behind. We need a responsive government that can address modern-day needs in a reasonable time frame. This isn't going to come from he right. So, it needs to come from the left and the DNC in particular. But the DNC tends to favor small bandaid solutions.This is not a critique of making incrimental progress or \\"making perfect the enemy of the good.\\" At the end of the progress is slow.

He told a local NPR station that his party was out of touch with the views of most Americans. In an interview with The New York Times, he got more specific about where the lefts ideology is out of step with much of the country. I have two little girls, Moulton said. I dont want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat Im supposed to be afraid to say that. While progressives may want to smear Moulton as a hate-monger, his comments on transgender athletes in girls and womens sports align with the vast majority of the country. Moulton said on CNN his party is often too focused on how it can cancel people rather than actually having debates about issues that Americans care about.It's one of the reasons so many voters turned away from Democrats this election. They were sick of being called racist, transphobic or sexist simply for having views that differed from the far left. Issues related to transgender young people demand debate, not name-calling that shuts down conversation. Trump made this and other gender issues a big part of his campaign, and it paid off for him.The country is nearly evenly divided between states that are trying to limit medical gender-affirming care for transgender children and those that encourage a broad range of treatments and procedures. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a related case this term.Progressives like to say that the science is on their side. Yet, recent studies highlight that there is still a lot unknown about the long-term consequences of gender hormones and surgeries in young people. That research also shows that caution is warranted. In October, The New York Times revealed that Johanna Olson-Kennedy, a doctor and proponent of gender treatment for adolescents, has purposely avoided releasing results of a study on puberty blockers. The study, which began in 2015, tracked the effects of puberty blockers (drugs that prevent the natural changes that occur during puberty) in 95 children over the course of two years. Olson-Kennedy didnt get the results she had expected. The puberty blockers did not lead to mental health improvements, according to her research. Youd think that would be valuable information to have, especially because nearly $10 million in federal taxpayer dollars have fueled the broader research. Olson-Kennedys excuse? She didnt want her work to be weaponized by opponents. It is a scandal of epic proportions, and a perfect example of why so many Americans have lost trust in our public health institutions, Kelsey Bolar, senior policy analyst at the Independent Womens Forum, told me. Bolar has worked closely with young people who regret the transgender treatments they received and has helped share their stories, including what happened to Cristina Hineman, who is suing Planned Parenthood for giving her testosterone at 18. Clearly, the science isnt settled. On this and other important issues facing the country, Democrats should heed Congressman Moultons advice: Weve got to have these debates ... and we start by listening to Americans.https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/11/14/trump-seth-moulton-trans-athletes-democrats/76228989007/","title":"Detailed Analysis of Progressive Options for 2028"},{"text":"Iirc the whole org is a complete mess ?and they laid off like half their staff last year.?","title":"Its time to clean up shop: Justice Democrats vow primary challenges against establishment Dems"},{"text":"jfc - how hard was that.

The comment I was replying to was basically saying they're actively what's wrong with Democratic media and so we should totally write it off, and I just don't see what so flawed about what they're doing that we can't listen to what they have to say. Admittedly not a Rogan listener, but I thought a major criticism of him was that he didn't really push back against people he had on his show. I think they can identify flaws that the overall ecosystem needs to solve without themselves being the ones/the individual media show to solve it. Maybe their show would be better if they pushed back more vs. maybe that would just make it more a bubble for people that think like them/they wouldn't get those guests on in the first place.","title":"Why Democrats Media Problem is Deeper than Liberal Joe Rogan - Offline with Jon Favreau ft.

And I don't think the majority of protesters, whether they're marching for BLM or for Palestinians, are supporting these things. Again, you're taking a small group of people and framing them as the entire progressive left. I'm pretty sure most people in this sub probably are asking \\"can we get healthcare please?\\" and not about how we can support more DEI policies.I'll take your point on the specific things you said just for fun. I'm not a supporter of DEI or reparations or racial or identity-based politics. That being said, I think you have a huge issue in the criminal justice system and in policing where Black men, primarily, are treated worse and sentenced longer than a White man would be for the same crime. That's an outcome that's not fair and not even representative of the actual crime or threat people pose. I think the solution is to get down to the roots of crime. And that's a lack of economic opportunities. All around the world, when young men see a lack of economic opportunity or hope, they turn to crime, terrorism, gang violence, drugs, etc. In the US, we even see the growth of these men turning to figures like Andrew Tate. The solution is to actually improve the economic fortunes and opportunities of people. And that's across all racial lines. That's for a poor Black teen in Baltimore and a poor white teen in Appalachia. These people feel left behind and abandoned by the system. Change the system to improve their fortunes. Make college more affordable. Make housing more affordable. Make healthcare more affordable. Have more technical programs. Create jobs in the renewable energy industry. Create more infrastructure jobs, most of which go to groups that Democrats have lost, not because of preferential hiring, but because these are jobs people will work. Support workers and unions. There's probably more, but centering your politics around economic populism is more inclusive and a winning message.","title":"Detailed Analysis of Progressive Options for 2028"},{"text":"All of this...ALL OF THIS...overlooking the fact that they had a terrible, unlikable and unskilled candidate and absolutely HORRIBLE policy positions.","title":"'It's a blood bath': Inside the White House blame game as backstabbing staffers and score-settling pundits rock a Democratic Party in crisis"},{"text":"As a poll watcher I questioned everything starting at 5:30amif I wasnt there who knows the money business that would have occurred","title":"Nearly 75 million people still voted for Kamala Harris."},{"text":"this is just confirmation bias?? because it happens to you its every single lgbt person? you missed my whole point of the comment. its not a right vs. left issue. its a poor vs. rich and you have also been swindled from it.","title":"Is it the propaganda that has made the left so filled with HATE?
