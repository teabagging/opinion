This hinges mostly on the trust that is placed by the right in companies and individual vs government and its politicians. I deeply distrust companies, because their entire reason for existing is to make profit. The welbeing of people is not the end goal of companies, just the interest of becoming bigger and earning more money. Governments are elected by the people in democratic systems (or at least they should be) and are dependent on the wellbeing of the populace for their reelections (in a perfect world that is). I want governments to force companies to consider the wellbeing of people by placing restrictions on how much they can pollute, how they treat their workers and to force them to contribute to society by paying taxes. These companies are not our friend.Now Musk. He is big money personified. He is the embodiment of greed. He want more, always more. He will never be satiated. You simply can't become this level of rich without that characteristic. In the past he seemed to quench his greed in projects that advance technologies that adress large scale crises (like electric cars), but he has dropped all pretense. He has been supporting all parties in the western world that support loosening restrictions on big tech and deregulating the checks and balances that keep monopolies at bay. He is done with the money business, he is in the power business now. He buys his way into the US government and feels untouchable. Noone should have this amount of power. Absolute power will corrupt absolutely. It is truly frightening that he can make a gesture that has been adopted by the most evil regime to ever exist in the Western world and people will defend him for it. You can not deny that him doing the gesture twice and not denying that he did means he has become untouchable. Imagine AOC doing the same thing. It would be political suicide since the left would hold her accountable for it. The right doesn't, they point straight at us that we shouldn't make a big deal out of this. This is fed by (social) media which is owned by those who benefit from enabling this behaviour. They are trying to pit us against each other to distract us from their own powermongering. I really want to ask you to reconsider and also condemning the salute, if only to let him know he is not above the power of the people. He is already above the law in a lot of ways, he shouldn't be this powerful.I've not even talked about the censorship on X and how the other tech giants are paving the way for the unchecked influence on our most used communication channels. Russia is very easily able to influence elections because of the lack of checks and balances in our communication systems. Desinformation is rampant and what truth is gets more distorted every day. Science used to be able to state a truth, backed up by evidence, and it would be believed. That has been eroded to simply believing something and have that be the defenition of truth.Truth is, he made a gesture used by the Nazis. Regardless of what he meant by it, he is a media trained celebrity who know exactly what making that gesture means. He did it regardless. I am really scared by that.","title":"CMV: Reddit Is Closer to Nazi-Like Authoritarianism Than Musk"},{"text":"First of all, thank you for explaining your viewpoints clear and concise without too much emotion. I think it's always worth debating these issues with someone that is able to articulate their viewpoint like this.To start off, I think that the problems you describe are very dependent on how these things are framed in the media and what type of underlying ideology lies beneath it. I'll try to give my view on these things from the 'other side'. I'll say that I'm mostly economically and culturally left and progressive and am mostly supporting of the issues that you have with Reddit. I'll respond to the individual issues you adress and go into the salute that Musk made at the end.First of all, you open with the abortion argument and how Reddit is mostly pro-choice. I'm assuming you are Christian and consider the moment of conception directly after fertilisation. This is a very difficult one, because my interpretation when something is considered a life is different than yours. I'm very adamant that life starts with consciousness and it is very clear from or scientific knowledge that this is not the case in early pregnancy. The foetus is stlil so small that is hasn't formed anything resembling a person yet. I do not think this qualifies as human life. This means that if you do and you want to ban abortion due to your belief, you are forcing me to believe the same thing as you. This means you take away my ideological freedom to conform to yours. The other side of the argument doesn't do this, it leaves this up to the individual. That we disagree on whether a foetus is alive in early pregnancy is a very difficult thing to disagree on, because I understand that you feel the need to combat something that is in your eyes a heinous crime. I feel the need to push back against your beliefs because I feel threatened in my freedom of belief. I truly believe that choice is the key difference here. If you believe that abortion is murder, please don't have an abortion! I simply ask that in return that you try to empathise with someone that got raped, or is carrying a foetus with obvious genetic defects for example, that you carry something that is not alive, but will most likely ruin your life. That person will want to protect themselves and abort that pregnancy before the tiny speck of cells becomes a person.About COVID and lockdowns/vaccinations. I supported the lockdowns and was even disappointed that vaccinations weren't more strongly incentivised than they were. I was living with my girlfriend with Cystic Fibrosis and she was at risk of dying due to the virus. My grandma died of actual COVIC because a nurse in her home went on holiday and didn't socially distance. I can make a case that by not taking it seriously enough, that nurse killed my grandma. We have laws in place to restrict reckless behaviours to protect the people that are at risk of being harmed by that recklessness. The lockdowns were no different. It was protecting the weaker members of society from those that wouldn't be affected as much and didn't care about them. I had a hellish three years filled with fear of bringing home the grim reaper because of someone that 'didn't believe in COVID' and it would take my girlfriend along as it did my grandma. If that is wrong in your eyes, I consider you selfish.About the illegal migration and Reddit supporting open borders. This is not something that the average person on the left side of the argument sees as black and white as you try to portray here. I am, as a leftist, also against unchecked immigration. Sweden is a prime example on how this isn't a viable way to deal with immigration. What I do support is treating people humanely. The way that conservatives (around the globe, I'm Dutch and these are also hot topics here) try to talk about this subject is to lump together every immigrant and assumes that they are detrimental to society. They have come to take and not give and our mooching of our hard-earned prosperity. I disagree with that sentiment and want to judge someone on an individual level. This means that it's not ethical to racially profile, to generalize and to condemn entire cultures. This will mean that immigration can get uncomfortable, since there will be bad apples, but it's a price I'm willing to pay and I believe our prosperity can shoulder.

In 2016, if Joe Rogan represented the political views of the average American man, let alone the average white American man, Trump would have lost the election in a landslide. But already at the time, a lot of people on the left were saying that he was too far right to be allowed a platform. That *preceded* his shift to the right. More and more people on the left started refusing to associate with him. And when a political viewpoint is filtered out of someone's social bubble, they tend not to incorporate it into their own outlook. People on the left don't *have* the power to decide whether anyone gets a platform or not. Neither do people on the right. When I was younger, people on the left used to be pretty aligned in thinking that neither political wing had the *right* to do that either. People of any political affiliation have the power to selectively avoid associating with certain people, but that doesn't mean those people don't have a platform, it just means that people with differing viewpoints are exposed to each other less. I don't think that's a positive social trend to agitate for, but when we push for deplatforming, that's what we get.","title":"cmv: Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are dangerous and do not deserve to have the platform they have.

Lockdowns and mandates forced compliance without allowing for choice, or without evidence a particular person was sick and thus dangerous, which is where the overreach comes in.With immigration, Reddit supports open borders without fully considering the rights and safety of domestic populations. Theres a balance between compassion and security, and Reddit tends to lean towards policies that infringe on the rights of those already in the country.On Reddits content moderation, its not just about imperfect rules, its about the platform silencing dissenting voices. While its not violence, suppressing speech is still a form of control. The real issue is how these actions mirror authoritarian tendencies, even if theyre not as overt as Nazi tactics.

They are naive, fragile and inauthentic leaders of a cult."},{"text":"\\nYour critique of Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman touches on several points that are commonly debated in discussions about influential podcasters:\\nPlatform Responsibility:\\n * Joe Rogan: You argue that his large platform necessitates a responsibility to ensure balanced discourse. Critics often point out that while Rogan does host a variety of guests, the selection might lean towards those who entertain or align with his personal views rather than providing a rigorously balanced debate. However, others defend this by emphasizing the entertainment aspect of his show, suggesting its not meant to be the definitive source on any topic but rather a catalyst for discussion.\\n * Lex Fridman: Your view of Fridman as naive and narcissistic reflects a perspective that sees his approach as more about personal branding than substantive contribution. His style, which includes long, thoughtful monologues, is seen by some as genuine introspection, but by others, like you, as self-indulgent or lacking depth. His interview with Zelenskyy, for instance, might be seen as an attempt to engage in significant global issues, but the execution might not meet everyones expectations for journalistic rigor.\\nCultural Impact:\\n * Both have been accused of stoking culture wars, particularly through discussions that might inadvertently or deliberately echo far-right sentiments. However, their defenders might argue that they provide a platform for voices that feel marginalized by mainstream media, potentially offering a counter-narrative to what they perceive as excessive political correctness or censorship.\\nUsefulness and Cult Following:\\n * Utility: Rogan and Fridman are useful in that they:\\n   * Engage Audiences: They draw large audiences to topics they might not otherwise explore, potentially broadening listeners perspectives.\\n   * Encourage Debate: Even if the debate isnt always balanced, its there, which can lead to public discourse and personal research.\\n   * Accessibility: They make complex or niche subjects more accessible by discussing them in a conversational, often humorous manner.\\n * Cult Accusations: The term cult might be hyperbolic, but it speaks to the loyalty and sometimes uncritical acceptance of their views by fans. This can be seen as both a strength (community, engagement) and a weakness (echo chamber effects).\\nDeserving Their Platform:\\n * This is subjective. In a free market of ideas, theyve earned their platform through popularity, which in turn reflects public interest. Critics might argue they should use this platform more judiciously, while supporters might say their success is proof of their relevance and the publics desire for their content.\\nConclusion:\\nUltimately, the existence of figures like Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman underscores the importance of free press and free markets in a democratic society. Their platforms, regardless of personal opinions on their content, facilitate a diversity of voices which is crucial for a healthy discourse. While theres a need for responsibility in broadcasting, the freedom to choose what and how to discuss topics should be protected. The vibrancy of democracy relies on this unfiltered exchange of ideas, where even controversial or divisive views can be aired, critiqued, and debated, leading to a more informed and engaged public.","title":"cmv: Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are dangerous and do not deserve to have the platform they have.

Abortion, for example, is not a simple opinion but the deliberate ending of a human life. Im not saying its right or wrong, but its definitely an act that takes away someones fundamental right to live. When you support a policy that actively removes that right, its hard to pretend it doesnt have a real impact. And thats what I mean when I point out the contradictions. There are policies on Reddit that back these actions, but theyre somehow overlooked or even celebrated.Regarding Musks alleged Nazi salute, I dont think we can just dismiss it as intellectually bankrupt because of what we believe it should have meant. Sure, the gesture has historical significance, but we have to look at the context. People are assuming intent without considering the full picture. Even if it was a poor choice of gesture, we should be focused on what actually matters. He promoted no violence, oppression, or hate. And he certainly didn't take someone's rights. In contrast, I think Reddits collective support for policies that increase government control and infringe on personal freedoms shows a deeper, more dangerous tendency toward authoritarianism. So yes, Im pointing out that the real issue here is the hypocrisy of Reddits focus on symbolism while ignoring the more harmful, concrete actions they support.

I know it sounds dumb, but once you get over that hump, it's often easier. Set a timer for 5 minutes, start the task and by the time the timer is up, you may feel better\\n2. I find lists really helpful. Sometimes it is too overwhelming or I don't know where to start, so I made lists of all the tasks I need to do, big or small. Then you can pick and easy one, do that, and get going on something. Visualizing the tasks like that is helpful for me.\\n3. Pomodoro technique, which is something I have tried to do more, sorta related to the first thing. Basically, it's 25 minutes 'on', total focus, and 5 minutes 'off' where you can relax. I do think it's all sort of personal though, and your specific stresses/ways of thinking about things impact what works best for you","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Because if suicide is respected and accepted, then people do it more. You shouldn't need to be convinced of that, it's fundamental logic up there with a person that has 3 apples has more apples then a person with no apples. Things that are accepted, become commonplace. If someone commits suicide and gains respect, then every other teenager that is having respect doubts or insecurity starts commiting suicide. Anyone that thinks that suicide should be encouraged either doesn't have kids, or is an embarrassment of a parent.You say there is a difference between accepting/respecting and encouraging it, I disagree strongly. It is not posaible to have kids friends commiting suicide, coming home to discuss it with there parents and the conversation being \\"Sally killed herself, nothing wrong with that, it really shows how in control of her life she was\\" and not have any additional suicides from that.","title":"CMV: Suicide should be respected and accepted as a valid choice within society"},{"text":"bird flu pandemic speedrun any%","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"fast food restaurants are sending specops teams to capture this man","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Ok, if it were to go that route then a lawyer could also argue you that from the point of mental decline all pardons and clemency are null and void.","title":"President Trump Issues a Warning to Joe Biden: He Didnt Give Himself a Pardon"},{"text":"Sadly we have to hand it to the b*lds, he is correct","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":" It must be a simple life being an adult with the mentality of a 13 year old troll.Unironically it must be kind of amazing.

Having some societal pushback can balance this out. If you're truly hellbent on doing it, it won't really matter to you. If you're in doubt, having that pushback can prevent you from tipping over.Getting angry at them is just the wrong approach anyways, regardless of societal views. The only 'valid' reason you might be angry is disappointment, but that's only really valid if the person in question is a loved one. In this case, I think back to my own personal experience with my uncle who offed himself because of workplace bullying, leaving behind a wife and 2 (adult) kids.Therefore why I say suicide should be accepted and respected as a valid choice in society. Also Im not accusing you of doing that necessarily with regards to imposing that value judgement but hopefully you understand my perspective.I think it's a matter of 'compromise' or nuance here. If someone decided to commit suicide, their choice should be respected, but we should discourage it as much as possible. It has to be a last resort. I don't want it to be more accessible so people that can (realistically) be helped choose to forego that help in their emotional state.I think we can draw some parallels with the abortion and euthanasia debate. I live in Western Europe where both are legal. Make it accessible if needed, but avoid it if at all possible.","title":"CMV: Suicide should be respected and accepted as a valid choice within society"},{"text":"Scotus can also backtrack and claim hes not immune for XYZ reasons.

This feels to me like a flawed understanding of authoritarianism.?I also think that youre grossly underestimating the power of symbols. Symbols exist to represent ideologies, ideas, and philosophies. If someone paints the Nazi symbol in front of their house, its only natural to make the assumption that that is where their beliefs lie. Likewise, if someone has an American flag outside their home, people make assumptions that their core values are patriotism. Even in the best case scenario where Musk did not actually mean to do the Nazi salute twice, or didnt realize it, it is at best grossly irresponsible. I dont understand how its everyone elses fault for misinterpreting and not his fault for evoking a genocidal regime. You cant blame others for taking what people do at face value.?Furthermore, I think you need to interrogate the inconsistencies within your own belief system.

It is an oversimplification of these hiring processes to say that these things should be given to someone with the numbers who match the most. Not to say you should ignore qualifications, especially if youd ignore an underqualified white person, but favor and underqualified person color. But just looking at the numbers doesnt tell the story.If instead of taking the top candidates who all had the highest scores instead, you took the top candidates from each school that applied youd inevitably have some students who had lower scores. A student with a 32 ACT could arbitrarily be considered and a student with a 23 ACT but when looking at the broader picture both students were valedictorian of their school. Both engaged in community service both wrote pretty good essays. One student was from historically disadvantaged place and another from a wealthy area. The wealthy student had more access to study resources that allow them to get a higher grade. If I know that the student who had the lower score was the best student in their geographical area, and did things to the best of their ability given their resources, is it right to throw that student out of the applicant pool after Ive taken into account all these factors?Yeah, you might be thinking omg but what about the student with a 32? They are still eligible to be in the school. They are ranked amongst their peers so if they are the highest ranked amongst their school they will be picked in universities will decide on top students from each school to pick. Race is sometimes used as a proxy for economic indicators because of the historic connection, but a child who is black from a Country Day school with lower scores usually will not be given favor over a poor white child who is the best in their school. Asians in the United States are not inherently just smarter than the rest of us. Historically the United States specifically against accepting (immigrants) Asian people who did not have a masters degree level of education. Not bachelors, masters. To immigrate and to have that level of qualification is a proxy for wealth. Genuinely, should we ignore Appalachian white students suffering from generational poverty and favor of Asian students simply based off of a hard number would we know we put those white students in the position to be poor? And this just addresses DEI programs who will accept lower qualifications for some. There are programs who simply make it a point to hire people from underrepresented communities (who are equally qualified ) to fight unconscious bias. The book outliers talks about this a bit, but theres nothing to say that students who benefit from affirmative action will not go onto have similar economic outcomes as their peers. Clearly they are hard-working enough to capitalize on this boon. If solely judged by an arbitrary number then they wouldve been limited based off of the status of their birth no matter how hard they worked. That does not match the American dreams ideal. Also, I get the anti DEI because you dont feel like you can benefit and its not fair. But the concept of a meritocracy with no adjustment being fair is not based in fact especially when it comes to job hiring. I understand that these things hurt peoples feelings but in the same vein people will grossly overstep when not educated about diversity. We can always change the way we do things or think more holistically about the emotional or economic impacts to white people, but as of now theres no studies that show that a white person will have negative economic outcomes based off of this. And hurt feelings is  idk its an issue but not the point. If anything trainings should be updated to let people know that blatant racism and discrimination against white people is not tolerated. But throwing all the good away and fucking over people whom you know had systemic disadvantages until one and a half generations ago is just selfish. If you would allow these same students and workers to suffer from x % less call backs because of their race, or hostile work environment because of the race, just because that is whats most fair then you are adopting a system that you know benefits you and washing your hands of culpability.","title":"CMV: DEI is (Almost) Always a Fundamentally Poor Idea"},{"text":"Reddit situation is crazyhttps://preview.redd.it/abpqhjh1vqee1.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ce9c16c5586087c6d15cca715508b85e81900aa","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Guessing they were out of crayons ?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The Radical Republicans who wrote the 14th Amendment never explicitly intended it to apply to illegals anchor babies; they merely intended to formally enshrine the dream of a nation whose very soil bestowed the guarantee of freedom to all humanity in the most universal sense, regardless of race or circumstance, for all time.

Many historians, political scholar, Nazi experts, etc. have already spoken out about this and it isn't even a debate since there is absolutely zero room for doubt! Also, Musk's views and actions show that he also stands behind Nazi ideology. Same with Trump. People have been warning about about this for years, unfortunately it's hard to reason with cult members because there cognitive dissonance is stronger than reason (yes, it's also clear that MAGA is a political cult, just like the Nazis were).There is absolutely nothing extreme about spreading awareness and calling out a Nazi like Elon Musk. It's actually the most politically moderate thing a person could do.Also, abortions are not a violation of human rights but actually backed by human rights because they do not apply for unborn life, however, access to abortion is a human right. The anti-Covid measures also were not against human rights because within human rights, limiting personal freedom is justified in situations of lethal danger for the population which was definitely, beyond doubt, the case during the pandemic. The vaccines were tested before application and turned out safe. Not 100% safe but that would be impossible. They were extremely safe, and proved to be highly effective in preventing the spread of the disease, saving countless lifes and ending the pandemic. The data is very clear! Ending a dangerous pandemic is a net benefit for freedom, so the anti-Covid measures actually increased freedom in the long term.","title":"CMV: Reddit Is Closer to Nazi-Like Authoritarianism Than Musk"},{"text":"Reddit doesn't support killing babies enough!

Reddit overwhelmingly supported the forced vaccinations and lockdowns that were pushed on people. These measures restricted freedoms and bodily autonomy, yet the majority of Reddit was all in on them. If we're talking about trampling on individual rights, whats more oppressive than a government forcibly injecting you or locking you in your home? Thats authoritarianism, and Reddit backed it. In fact, during the pandemic, the platform even supported the censorship of people who dared to talk about potential side effects of vaccines. This kind of censorship is more akin to the control the Nazis had over media, manipulating information to serve their agenda.No one believes in absolute freedom. Hence why taxes, road laws, FDA laws, and prisons exist. If the situation is dire enough then temporary measures to stop the death of millions may very well be justified. I suspect that if every person in a research lab in Chicago right now was infected with a sure kill virus you would support locking down that research lab and maybe more of Chicago rather than giving people freedom to kill millions more by moving around further yes? That's not authoritarian in any way that could be recognized. Temporary measures for the safety of millions. Now to be fair I think the whole blocking all links to X is stupid and pointless. But I disagree heavily with the idea that gestures are pointless. It creates a level of acceptability. It makes it so that this idea is no longer in the fringes and someone who has an ear to the President seems to support this. My entire annoyance with it is simple. It's not that he did it that mainly annoys me but his reaction post fact. He knows how it looks but rather than vehemently deny that he wants to not lay it out. \\"Hey guys, did a thing, realize it looks bad, not my intention, Neo-Nazis cheering me go fuck yourselves.\\" That's it. Had he done that I'd have immediately stopped caring. Now does he owe me or anyone else this? No. But the fact he'd rather fight over this than lay it out flat that is wasn't his intention seems too dumb to me.

Protecting someones right to make decisions about their body isnt comparable to eliminating freedoms for entire groups.COVID policies like lockdowns were intrusive but temporary measures to protect public health, not acts of authoritarian oppression. Whats the alternative? just let a pandemic run wild? Similarly, immigration policies that balance compassion and security arent about taking away rights but honoring humanitarian values.And Reddits content moderation? Sure, its imperfect, but comparing it to Nazi control doesnt really hold. Nazis violently silenced dissent, while Reddit is a private platform with community rules. Criticizing bias is fair, but calling it Nazi-like downplays what real authoritarianism is.I get being concerned about overreach, but equating abortion rights, pandemic responses, or Reddits moderation with Nazi-like authoritarianism doesnt add up.","title":"CMV: Reddit Is Closer to Nazi-Like Authoritarianism Than Musk"},{"text":"1.

It is also completely unfalsifiable, so once labelled as mentally disordered, a person has no recourse by which to overturn this judgement. So the reasoning here is a bit circular.I think that if restrictions on suicide were temporary and designed only to make sure that the choice was a reflection of the person's genuine values; then that would be one thing. However, the system is set up to ensure that nobody, at any stage, can have legal access to reliable and humane suicide methods. And instead of being assessed on a case by case basis; anyone who has ever experienced thoughts of suicide, at any time, for any reason, is lumped in with the \\"mentally ill\\" stereotype of someone who is mentally unsound and incapable of handling their own affairs and therefore subjected to the same demeaning, paternalistic and coercive restrictions as those who may genuinely fit the stereotype. The oft-cited \\"90%\\" statistic that you have presented ignores the number of people who go on to reattempt (and fail); and the data is not sufficiently granular to demonstrate the reasons why people don't later go on to die by suicide. For example, in many cases, it may be because of the fact that suicide is incredibly risky (as evidenced by the failed attempt) and the individual may be afraid to try again. As far as I'm aware, it doesn't take into account the people who died of other types of death of despair, such as drinking themselves to death. Or cases where a person is too severely disabled by an attempt in order to make a further attempt, let alone a successful one. Whenever this data is presented in the context of a defence of suicide prevention; it is invariably assumed that every one of the people who didn't go on to eventually die by suicide went on to find a positive desire to live. Even if it is only a small minority of people who would actually have a persistent desire to die; it is unfair to take suicide completely off the table for these people by blanket prohibition of access to reliable and humane means; as opposed to a reasonable compromise which deters impulsive attempts but allows a pathway for those who have a settled desire to die. Such as a waiting period before being legally free to access reliable methods.","title":"CMV: Suicide should be respected and accepted as a valid choice within society"},{"text":"Cant taste vanilla, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg anymore..breaks my heart.","title":"What's something you're never gonna be able to do after the covid pandemic?"},{"text":"You just did.

See point 2. Can a decentralized govt stop a large gang from overtaking them without centralizing itself? The libertarian motto that i think best simplifies the ideology is \\"government only exists to protect your freedoms\\". Look no further than the constitution. The founding fathers tried very hard to make this happen. Small government always falls apart as soon as they're allowed to debase the money.  Article 1, Section 10 of the constitution says \\"no state shall make any Thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\\".  As soon as we started ignoring that, the government now has the authority to debase it's money. Once this happens it has unlimited power to expand itself beyond the will of the people. Want to create a new agency like the NSA to spy on everyone? They no longer have to physically collect these taxes to fund the agency, they just debase the money supply and do whatever they want.

The difference lies in that I don't believe this effect occurs in large groups with minimal interaction between individuals. It occurs in small groups with a lot of interaction between individuals, like a team in a workplace as opposed to a giant ocean of strangers.Types of rewardI know about the different kinds of reward in the brain, but I'm afraid to say that some of the points you make about this are off base. For instance, the two systems do not exist in isolation of one another. You're spot on in how you characterise addiction as dopamine without other forms of reward such as seratonin, which we get when we achieve something that makes us feel good about ourselves. Where you go wrong is where you talk about the dopamine reward being replaced by these other forms. That's not the case. Healthy rewarding behaviours involve dopaminergic reward alongside seratonergic satisfaction and other things like oxytocin. Dopamine is part of this. It's only a bad thing when it becomes divorced from higher meaning, such as... when you're utterly alone... or in a giant mob without accountability or more importantly responsibility. \\nSocial conditioningWhile it has some merit, I also think that your point about society conditioning people to pursue dopamine exclusive addictive reward is an oversimplification. This form of reward is the DEFAULT state that socialisation programs us out of when we have to learn to play with others. Every young child has to overcome this challenge precisely because their default state is I want what I want now - \\"give me milk\\", \\"give me toy\\". I do however think thay there is a grain of truth to your point in that our society has devolved into a culture of self-centered hedonistic pleasure seeking. Where  I think you've gone wrong in your thinking is that you're attributing that to society, while I see it as a natural result of the breakdown of society. That said, as with any failing immune system, there are parasites speeding up this process, such as businesses using dark psychology in advertising. Anyway, what I'm saying is that I mostly disagree with this point, although there is a grain of truth to it.The right, or rather, duty to make responsible decisionsI'm not saying we don't deserve to make decisions on our own. People get to do that in their own lives because we don't live in a totalitarian state where the government watches your every move and word. I'm saying that the best decisions at the national (rather than personal level) are made by leaders selected for competence, with reputations to manage, rather than people of average competence, with no reputational stake in things going well in the long run. This will lead to short term focussed (dopaminergic) decision making in addition to the expertise problem, which is a pretty killer combination if you ask me. People make responsible decisions in their own lives, but not as a large anonymous group for the reasons I've outlined. Yes people need to take responsibility, but in their actual lives!!! That's where true responsibility lies, except for the rare exceptionally intelligent and competent person working within a system refined over many millenia to rule over a larger number of people than the natural tribe of 250 that our brains are wired for.","title":"CMV: Direct Democracy is the governing solution for equality, ecological survival and prosperity"},{"text":"Its plausible to argue that if suicide wasnt seen as such a bad thing people may be more open to discussions about it that could lead to some people deciding they dont want to end it all.Quite the opposite.

People take suicidal feelings seriously.There are people that would approach those situations very poorly, but I don't think that's an issue with the societal view on suicide but rather people just having a poor understanding of what causes such thoughts and feelings to begin with.There isnt really anything good or bad about it either way it is just a state of neutrality meaning no benefit or negative is really incurred as a result of you dying.In an of itself, yes.

Any government or non-governmental agency that tracks suicides will have statistics showing that deaths by suicide are far lower than attempts.[Heres the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control) summary](https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html) which is one of the main agencies in the US that tracks this. This one shows its around 3%.Heres a [research article](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/1/e20161420/52498/Suicide-and-Suicide-Attempts-in-Adolescents) which notes that the rate of attempted to completed suicides among adolescents is 50:1 to 100:1 (2% to 1%). However it also notes girls attempts more and die less than boys. Many estimates show girls at 200:1 as a result. You note that some people may regret not dying by suicide, and thats true, but for each such person there are dozens if not a hundred, who survived and choose to live. So again I think we need to look at numbers and speak about the vast majority of cases, not only a minority. If you look into the causes of suicide, a lot of cases are a fight with a partner or parent or something like thatin the heat of the moment, they kill themselves. This is also a similarly prevalent cause of homicide.To be truly absurd, we could say that if we respect a persons wish to die we should assist them in their suicide in such cases. And while this works for very specific cases like physician assisted suicide, it would be strange to think we should help adolescents or teenagers kill themselves when theyre upset about something and feel like they want to die.","title":"CMV: Suicide should be respected and accepted as a valid choice within society"},{"text":"I donated for the first time ever a couple days ago when Elmo was going on about them","title":"Google is straight up erasing Biden"},{"text":"Not upset enough to try again?","title":"CMV: Suicide should be respected and accepted as a valid choice within society"},{"text":"Im sorry to keep picking on you, but your comment is just so funny.

You might have a better argument if you said it should be *allowed.* But respected? Accepted? No. Pretty much on every layer of society there are reasons not to do that. But let's look at your arguments. First you want to argue that there is moral superiority to do as one wishes with one's own body. Sure. But you have to take into account that suicide *does* affect other people. If the collateral damage is of no concern to you, you need to also be free speech absolutist, for example. It is your body, you get to say/write whatever. If you can come up with examples why that might hurt others and you shouldn't be allowed to say those things then the same applies here. Even doubly so, while you cannot turn back time and take back words said, you can at least try to mend things. You don't get to do that with suicide.   \\nThe other part is the entitlement angle. I actually agree with the first part part of it. It is incredibly selfish to ask, nay, *demand* others to continue their miserable existence no matter their own wishes so that you won't have to feel bad about their death. Yes, people absolutely should give a shit about people when they are alive and not just when they die, that is a good point. But you are missing the other side of the coin. The person committing the suicide is doing the same. They are disregarding every other people in their lives and how they feel. This is the same moral failing on both sides, you not caring how another person feels. I'm sure you'd have some moral issues if in life a person would say: \\"yeah I'm about to do something that will greatly benefit me but be immense detriment to people around me.\\" This is the same with suicide, you are doing the exact same thing but, again, with no chance to clean up your mess. It is final and in that sense even more selfish than many acts you could commit living that fit such description, you are playing pigeon chess. These reasons (and several others ranging from economic to general societal stability) should make it clear why society has a good reason to discourage such behavior. I don't think you've provided any moral superiority but even if you did and it was best for the individual it is massively disruptive for society. Therefore there is no reason for the society to treat suicide as a solution but rather it would be better to treat is as undesired path, as it now. If you as an individual are allowed to argue for \\"immediately best for me\\" we should allow society the same.","title":"CMV: Suicide should be respected and accepted as a valid choice within society"},{"text":"And ask questions.

If you steal 500$ of stuff, and get caught, equal punishment and fairness would be 500$ fine. But you instead get a way larger fine, possible jail time depending on the method of acquisition and additional costs that are disproptionate. This is because the fine, has nothing to do with righting wrongs or returning the status quo, it's a deterrent for the rest of society to make the next person less likely.If someone kills someone else, they don't get capital punishment immediately after. It would be only fair would it not? Instead they get kept in jails. This makes getting caught a less punishing thought, so people don't start immediately going into final stands when the cops corner them.You see these in every area, even stuff like homosexuality. During times of high mortality and death, anything that reduces human reproduction becomes societally frowned upon, and then when human survival rates increase and resource generation is high, things that impact reproduction rates are no longer frowned upon.So something societal reaction, has nothing to do with the individual or fairness, it's about its impact on society. Destignatizing suicide on the societal level, makes it easier to do and encourages people to do it. My child, who is not suicidal, could be swayed or convinced to it if his friends did it and they were respected. Society does not care about the people that actually commit suicide being comfortable or respected in those final moments, society cares about making it as hard as possible for the next person to do it.

It's such a weird liberal American fantasy that Europe is this left wing paradise where the Democrats are the equivalent of Right Wing European parties. Europe is leaning increasingly to the right and even the far right. Europe has right wing parties that are much further right the US Republicans. Many of my friends in Europe are fans of Trump and are hoping that they can elect leaders over here with similar policies.   \\n  \\nSure, Europe has been historically more socialist than the US. But many people in Europe (especially outside of big cities and especially outside of Northern Europe) are very socially conservative. There is a strong and growing right-wing and far-right presence here, with reactionary policies on both fiscal and social issues. I've actually mentioned to European friends this idea that the US Democrats would be considered Right Wing here and they laugh at it.

But Ive seen this from both left and right. In any given subreddit it seems to be just one side that does this, not both.

These words are completely overloaded with meaning, that it is very unclear what each person means.In my opinion we should avoid words with these extreme levels of ambiguity and instead prefer more decisive vocabulary.And if not we should give a short definition for our perspective on particular words. Just as I've done with the word \\"liberal\\". Don't just assume everyone has the same understanding of these words as you do.

Intoxication and severe psychiatric issues are also common features. Derail most imminent suicide attempts for even a short time, and most people just abandon them. People who survive suicide attempts report regret at having made the attempt and most don't go on to commit suicide.A surprising number of people on Reddit seem to have this very intellectualised idea of suicide. They seem to think it's a rational conclusion reached as a result of thoughtful reflection and contemplation. A choice for poets and philosophers. When it occurs in reality, suicide is a lot more like driving off into the night while steaming drunk, because you feel like some guy was disrespecting you at the club.

When we have Harris and Biden saying \\"We have the strongest economy. best ever. Look at the job market! Lowest unemployment is years\\" while the American people are struggling to pay their bills and watching everyone in their life get laid off or downsized, having Trump say \\"Look at the shit economy\\" is a good way to sway them. All Harris had to say was \\"Trump's policies hurt us. Shit is bad because people like Musk, Bezos, and everyone. They profit while you suffer; those people are supporting Trump. People blame the immigrant workers for stealing the jobs but who're the ones hiring them? Why don't we talk about them? Why not blame the greedy CEOs taking advantage of desperate people? That's the fault of Harris's communication, not the American voters.\\n2. Harris specifically said \\"Israel has a right to defend itself and we will support that\\". When people asked her about Israel and the decades-long issue of occupation in Gaza, she smirked and said \\"I'm talking now\\". \\n3. She did ignore the issues. Say what you will about Trump but he went on podcasts to appeal to the common man and talked about shit that makes sense to them. Meanwhile Harris spent most of her campaign only talking on traditional media that people over 60 watch. She only appeared on one podcast just before election where she spent the majority of time talking about women's rights, which, while important, kind of doesn't help when people are asking about the economy. Do you know how many news outlets and popular podcasts tried to get an interview with ANYONE from her campaign and were told no?\\n4. She invited the Cheney's and other former Republicans to speak for her! She was literally trying to appeal to Republicans by using Republicans to vouch for her while dems were saying \\"The fuck!? How bout you talk about the economy!\\n5. Trump courted the youth. He went on fucking Joe Rogan and Adrian Ross's podcast. Yea they're shitty people but he used their massive platform to appeal to their audience. Meanwhile Harris went on the View and talked to a bunch of 60 year olds who primarily bitch about young people.Yes, people fucked us by voting for Trump but don't act like Harris did anything to appeal to them. You literally said that people shouldn't need to be convinced to not vote for American Hitler while Harris spent the debate laughing at Trump saying \\"Go listen to this speeches.

She was forced to either embrace all of Biden's positions, even the unpopular ones, or oppose them and look like a hypocrite for being part of the Biden administration in the first place.  At the same time, Biden was her actual boss, which puts her in a conflict of interest if she has to choose between fulfilling her duties as VP, and advocating for the policies that she thinks are best for the American public.Harris put in a serious effort and may have even won if things played out differently, but in the end she also made some huge unforced errors of her own, like avoiding interviews, and here we are.","title":"Former Obama staffers urge Democrats to stop speaking like a 'press release,' learn 'normal people language'"},{"text":"Who is going to get away with it?

First let me preface by saying, as I see it, DEI is just a rebranding of \\"affirmative action\\", which is important because it should be evaluated over a longer term than we've been calling it DEI.1) The problems with AA/DEI are concrete, specific, visceral, and anecdotal. You can point to specific people who these systems screwed over, specific contracts that are working inefficiently, high budget and/or low quality because of its convoluted market meddling. But the benefits of it are fuzzy, abstract, probabilistic, and statistical. No minority business wants to say \\"we only got the job because of AA/DEI\\". That can mean either having to look at the ugly reality of a bigoted society, or on the other side, admitting that you're not good enough and didn't actually deserve it. Both are unpleasant. So our view of the effects of these programs is going to skew more negative than they actually are.2) Probably there were times and places when AA/DEI really were needed. Maybe that time still includes now, maybe it doesn't. Success ultimately means ending these programs. But because of the difficulty of accurately assessing the true need of these programs, it's hard to say when they should stop. There won't be a magic day in which all bigotry is ended and now we don't need it anymore. Instead the scales tip slowly toward the negatives outweighing the positives. And even if we were to somehow objectively correctly determine that these programs are now a net loss and should end, there will still be some cases of people who justifiable needed it and will be thrown into a prejudiced system, and that sucks.","title":"CMV: DEI is (Almost) Always a Fundamentally Poor Idea"},{"text":"That's not true at all, Jon Lovvit was very consistent that he thinks Biden should not run/should drop out.

You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backwardreversing cause and effect. I call these the \\"wet streets cause rain\\" stories. Paper's full of them.In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I'd point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all. But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn't.

You're the one jumping to conclusions. I was simply asking a question and NOT inferring that OP in any way supported that position. Government was simply the most prominent example of an authority that came to mind.The only real assertion I made relating to 'solutions' was that it would likely need to come from an authority, which you seemed to affirm considering your suggestions were based on utilizing the authority of government to set forth guidelines or educational tools.I don't think government should be the ones to be defining truth, creating guidelines or developing educational tools *on socially controversial issues* as it's a double edged sword. The next administration with different ideological views could easily weaponize something like this the other way and provide complete opposite guidelines. Do you really want the trump administration creating guidelines defining sex and gender and using these definitions to 'fact check' opposing views? I'm sure they could find a few 'experts' to reference and base their guidance off of too!The Sex/Gender EO signed recently is a perfect example. Where one administration may support a broad view of sex and gender, and create guidelines based on one definition, another administration, such as the current Trump one can reverse it with a narrow (or even totally incoherent) definition and use the authority of government to proliferate it. It's too easily abused on issues that are still socially fraught.","title":"cmv: Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are dangerous and do not deserve to have the platform they have.

If one Joe Rogan disappears, five others will crop up, because it's not a difficult thing to do (but very lucrative), so you can bet that not very intellectually honest entertainers will quickly fill this market niche.

When Trump lost in 2020, there was no large, consolidated, majority supported \\"Alt-right or nothing\\" movement, some people shifted more to the right, some people shifted more to the left, but there was no concrete plan to radicalize moderates, near-moderates, or moderate-right wingers into being alt-right or nothing. The same cannot be said for the left, and that is exactly what OP does with point #4.Just because someone does not smear Liberal talking points, does not make them an evil alt-right winger. Liberals online, and the media *love* to push this narrative though. Literally, people without strong opinions for either side are now being labelled as alt-right pawns. It's just crazy conspiracy with dangerous narratives that is leading to Liberals creating their own echo chamber (Twitter/X banning is a great example of this).As a Democracy, even if you disagree and hate someones opinion because they're disagreeing with you, it absolutely does not mean you should label them as terrible people and censor them.Lex Fridman is pro-choice, pro-DEI in workplaces where performance does not cost lives, pro-social programs, supporter of climate change, believes in reasonable gun control, pro-universal healthcare, pro-immigration, pro-religious freedom, supporter of freedom in sexual orientation, supporter of same-sex marriage. 10 years ago, Lex would be considered a *very progressive Liberal*, yet somehow, many American Liberals have painted him as an alt-right ideological terrorist. This is a perfect example of how Liberals are suppressing anyone that challenges their beliefs.If everyone that disagrees with you is a bad person, you're either a divine being, or you completely fail to understand the core tenets of Western Civilization.For disclosure, I'm not pro or anti either party, but rather pointing out a severe and dangerous flaw relevant to this conversation.","title":"cmv: Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are dangerous and do not deserve to have the platform they have.

He had gone to war to save the Republic, in his mind. After decades of political strife he had himself appointed dictator until the crisis was over. He crushed his enemies and rewrote the laws of the Republic to ensure that radicals and partisans wouldn't be able to break the system again. And when he was done rewriting the laws, he gave up power and retired, content with a job well done.But the only real lesson anyone learned was that, now, you could seize power and reshape the Republic however you wanted. And so people like Julius Caesar didn't learn to follow the new rules Sula had written.

What I dont like with Rogan is that he promotes the modern idea heavily pushed by social media that every opinion has equal merit (especially if its based on hunches and goes against accepted knowledge). This idea sound fine in theory, but in retrospect has been causing our society to drift back towards tribalism, dogma and intolerance and rejection of scientific knowledge (i.e. knowledge derived from making actual measurements to verify ideas rather than gut feeling and pure thought).

Seldon develops a plan to mitigate this dark age to 1000 years. The trilogy overviews his successors efforts to enact his vision. This work exemplifies some of the best features of science fiction: it can serve as a playground for the scientific/technological ideas constructed by the author. However the prose and characters are simple, more serving as vehicles for Asimov to present his ideas.\\n2. *Dune* by Frank Herbert. Power in the galactic empire is finely balanced between the emperor, the noble houses, arcane guilds who oversee the empire's critical functions (e.g., space travel), all of which depends upon the psychedelic drug, the spice Melange. The spice increases life span, enhances vitality, and can gift prescience, the latter of which is critical for space travel. We follow our antihero, noble Paul Atreides, as he comes of age in this viper's nest of political intrigue. The prose is better than the Foundation Trilogy, has a rich setting, mixing in ideas of environmentalism, colonialism, and religion.Both of these series heavily inspired subsequent science fiction: you can see the fingerprints of these stories all over Star Wars.There are plenty of other sci fi novels that can serve as good staring points for you, including the *Neuromancer* (the progenitor of the cyberpunk genre); *The Road* (written by one of the greatest American novelists of all time, Cormac McCarthy, a father and son must survive in a post-apocalyptic world; beautiful prose, incredibly sad); or even the *Hyperion Cantos* (you need not have read the Canterbury tales to enjoy this story).Modern series that I haven't read, but have heard are excellent, include *The Expanse* and *The Three Body Problem*.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"They are going to make up some bs about everyone.

While this is true, it is really downplaying everything we know about psychology. Social influence, cognitive bias, motivated reasoning, etc are all big factors influencing our beliefs.It is naive to expect every person will fact check every important topic they hear, especially as time moves on and it feels like everybody is expected to have a stance on all topics. Not to derail, but we all need more acceptance and comfort saying or hearing \\"I don't know.\\"Listeners know Rogan is more likely to bring on somebody who agrees with him. They trust Rogan, since they choose his show over other media. Therefore, they trust what guests say on some level. I'd also argue Rogan himself is agreeing to more misinformation these days, so listeners don't really have to bridge that gap anymore. The amount of conviction in what they hear needs to be aligned with that idea that Rogan is (self-proclaimed) ignorant, but that seems to not be happening. I have no data to back that up, but just listening to friends, family, or even browsing his comment sections it seems obvious they are accepting what they hear as truth.And if you think \\"well, no big deal, we just have some misinformed people\\" then I would say our beliefs inform our actions which in turn affect others. Accepting this is basically saying we are cool with moving backwards or we don't care about society at large.Edit to add: Fridman wasn't just giving pushback to Zelenskyy. He was literally asking why he won't forgive Putin or make major concessions for peace without acknowledging Putin is the aggressor who started the conflict.

SCOTUS interfered.And that's not even talking about the other stuff he got charged with, which should have also made him at least politically unviable.There's only two ways to repeal an amendment to the Constitution. One by having a constitutional convention which hasn't happened since 1776. And the other more realistic way is it to be proposed and approved by 2/3 of the House and Senate. After that, it needs to be ratified by 3/4ths of the States. That is never going to happen. Trump will never get that kind of support.No offence, but you're talking like someone whose entire understanding of US politics comes from a high school civics course rather than actually paying attention to real world events.He doesn't need a constitutional amendment. All he needs is for there to be no majority in Congress or SCOTUS and no AG willing to intervene, and for a plurality of voters in the correct swing states to think the price of eggs is more important than upholding the constitution (and honestly, even that last one is debatable when you can run all the electioneering schemes you want without anyone willing to stop you.

But if you want to make money selling to people who wear a size 8, you need to make clothing that looks good on them. Hence, you need to hire people that dont look like the people you currently have.That same principle applies to any business or organization.

This is the exact same approach Im familiar with. The only difference is perhaps the size of the company - but this point is salient.Let me also challenge you a bit about this with simplified numbers. There are 100k jobs of a certain profession, and 4k black candidates of that major. If your company is 1k people, to get to full representation, maybe you interview 10k people, and make sure to pack the applicant pool with black candidates - so you essentially screen 1/4 of the entire pool (1k). Ultimately you want to get to something like 100 black employees.Of the 100k jobs in this scenario, they consist of about 100 companies of your size (1k). If they all want to get to 100 black employees each theyd need to hire in total 10k black employees. But there are only 4k of this major.So whats the net effect of DEI? The companies who devote the most DEi resources get to horde a bigger fraction of the shallow pool of black applicants. The net number of black employees in this field remains the same.Societally this isnt actually doing _anything_.

They may get moldy sometimes but overall its a bit alarmist to view anything as permanent in American politics. Every two years you see some editorial that [insert party] that did well in [election] are only a decade away from turning the country into a one party state. That hasnt happened because as annoying and horrible as political parties may be at changing during certain times, they are primarily in the business of winning elections.They adapt, they change. Sometimes they make terrible decisions, I will concede that (2016 Dems, 2022 GOP, 2012 GOP, and the 2010 Dems come to mind). But the Democratic Party is in the business of winning elections. The current DNC leadership is imperfect  no one is perfect. But no matter who becomes chair they will try to win. Politics isnt like a video game or a sport where one team can self sabotage.But I do agree that we need a new strategy going forward and we are at risk. We definitely need to peer under the hood and figure out why the engine that delivered Obama isnt working like it used to. We do need to answer for our lack of progress on long sought reforms like healthcare and the minimum wage. But the answer should be proactive and nuanced.[insert policy I like] is not gonna fix the party. No, there are messaging changes that we need to make but they shouldnt be applied universally. For example, Virginia is a moderate, suburban liberal state. If Spanberger in her campaign suddenly went hard into progressive rhetoric it would be a disaster. The problem isnt the progressive rhetoric itself, it is the context. A politician with a moderate reputation in a moderate state cannot win on someone elses platform.There will be fresh faces aplenty in the coming years. You forget that we have a deep bench, and while *you* may be familiar with someone like Gretchen Whitmer or Andy Beshear, the average low info voter outside of their states has no clue who they are.

Its written by a nobody and should be considered as such. Biden left the White House with an approval rating that was actually worse than Trumps in 2020. Rather than trying to distance herself, Kamala owned and even supported all the problems that runway inflation causes. Big mistake. Second, Kamala lost because her people refused to let her talk to people in ways that mattered. She should have been on Fox every week instead of her surrogates, knocking down Joe Rogans door for a weekly sit down, and finding real ways to communicate with the middle of the country. Instead, she refused to distance herself from Biden, stuck to a script that didnt connect with anyone outside of her silo, and somehow couldnt capitalize on one of the best debate performances in the modern era. Its not that Bidens admin paved the way for a Kamala loss, its that the party in its zeal to get rid of Biden failed miserably to read the room afterwards. In voting for Trump, people sent a very clear message about what they want: money in their pockets, safe borders and a reduction of big government that no longer suits their narrow needs. They didnt think that woke policies were gonna fix things. Kamala is to blame. Democrats are to blame. Legacy media is to blame. Dumb people thinking Trump will MAGA are to blame.

But having recurring themes in their content doesnt automatically mean theres a deliberate agenda at play. People naturally gravitate towards interests they understand and find compelling.Compare this to mainstream news channels: CNN, Fox, BBC, etc. all have themes and biases based on the people they hire and the audiences they cater to. The difference is that Rogan and Fridman arent pretending to be objective journaliststheyre conversationalists. If someone finds their worldview narrow, they are free to explore other perspectives.# 2. \\"Rogan doesnt debate properly and spreads misinformation\\"This criticism is common, but it misunderstands Rogans role. He is not a journalist or a trained debater; he is an entertainer and long-form interviewer. His approach is more about letting guests speak freely than grilling them with counterpoints. This is exactly why people from all backgrounds come on his showits a rare space where they wont be interrupted or pushed into gotcha moments.If misinformation arises (which it sometimes does), its important to remember that people can fact-check. The idea that audiences need Rogan to explicitly counter every claim assumes that listeners are passive sponges rather than critical thinkers.# 3. \\"Lex Fridman is a narcissist, naive, and cringey\\"Personal taste aside, Fridmans appeal is that he genuinely tries to be neutral. Is he naive? Maybe at times. But he isnt pushing an ideologyhe is exploring ideas. Thats why hell interview Noam Chomsky one day and Elon Musk the next. His overly philosophical tone isnt for everyone, but to say hes just riding coattails ignores the fact that he built his own following through years of effort.And regarding the Zelenskyy interviewpressing leaders on their positions is part of journalism. The idea that only proper journalists can ask tough questions is elitist. If a world leader cant handle pushback from a tech nerd, thats on them.# 4. \\"They contribute to culture war division more than 'wokeness'\\"This is a huge claim with little evidence. Rogan, if anything, often promotes moderate viewshes had people from all across the spectrum, from Bernie Sanders to Ben Shapiro. The culture war was in full swing long before Rogan was a major figure, and blaming him for division ignores the role of political pundits, social media algorithms, and mainstream media polarization.# 5. \\"They dont deserve their platform\\"Who gets to decide who \\"deserves\\" a platform? If millions of people voluntarily listen, that alone justifies their existence in the marketplace of ideas. Platforms arent handed outtheyre earned.If Rogan and Fridman were truly the dangerous cult leaders you describe, people wouldnt leave their sphere as easily as you did.

He argued that busing was a \\"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense.\\" Biden supported measures to limit federal funds for busing and collaborated with senators like Jesse Helms and Robert Byrd to restrict the federal government's ability to enforce school integration policies. He against busing integration in favor of housing one because putting a random kid at random neighborhood to a bus is fucking stupid and create racial rension and best way to integrate neighborhoods.And the context he was against mandate integration during time of heighten racial tension in favor of voluntary integration In 1994, Biden played a significant role in drafting and passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This legislation, which included provisions for increased funding for prisons and law enforcement, mandatory minimum sentences, and the \\"three strikes\\" rule, has been criticized for contributing to mass incarceration, particularly affecting minority communities.The same minority community told Biden to pass the bill as it was support by majority of black community including black caccus and BLACK populus...Even progressive back then support it because there was no study on effect of police on black community.Biden has historically supported free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). These agreements have been favored by many conservatives and business interests but have faced criticism from labor unions and progressive groups concerned about job losses and labor standards.Man we fucking reach the point that free trade is consider right wing then you might as well support Donald trump..Not even FDR support protectionist policy and literally go out of his way to end it because protectionist fucking suck. Not even left wing in Europe are against free trade. In fact biden try to uphold protextionist stance during his presidency is one of his biggest mistake as it make inflation worse. During his presidency, Biden has taken steps to strengthen border security and immigration enforcement. In February 2024, he supported a bipartisan immigration bill addressing the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, which included several conservative measures. Although the bill ultimately failed due to opposition from within the Republican Party, Biden's support for such measures indicates a willingness to adopt policies traditionally associated with right-wing perspectives.Yes. Casually ignore the fact he also expanded immigration program to allowed more immigrant into country.

We interface with our DEI team regularly and are always looking at how to increase diversity in our applicant pool.Note that I said \\"applicant pool,\\" not \\"employee population.\\"I think there is fundamental misunderstanding of how these programs are **supposed** to work. The point isn't to choose to hire someone because they're a POC -- it's to recognize that POCs have a different mentality when applying for jobs, and get on their level. For example, many studies have shown that black people are more likely to self-select out if they don't meet all the requirements for a job and won't even apply, where white people are more likely to shoot their shot, leading to a pool that skews white. The point of the DEI program is to go where POCs are -- as an example, HBCU alumni job boards, or offering the job description in Spanish -- so that they know they're welcome here and we specifically want them to apply. From there, it's all about qualifications. I won't lie -- I have had hiring managers who also fundamentally misunderstand how these programs should work, and they say things like \\"we'd like to hire a person of color,\\" and my job is to **shut that down immediately.** I will send them the people who are most qualified for the job, regardless of race, and make sure that when they reject candidates, they are providing solid feedback as to why (\\"not a culture fit\\" doesn't fly). The idea is that by increasing the diversity of the pool, we will naturally have a more diverse employee population. It's NOT about hiring someone because of the color of their skin, their gender, their pronouns or anything else at all.Now of course there are places that do it wrong. Harvard is a famous example, and I have no doubt that many colleges/universities are abusing DEI and giving the programs a bad name.

Notable examples include:1\\\\. Opposition to Mandatory Desegregation Busing:In the mid-1970s, as a U.S. Senator, Biden was a leading opponent of mandatory busing aimed at desegregating schools. He argued that busing was a \\"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense.\\" Biden supported measures to limit federal funds for busing and collaborated with senators like Jesse Helms and Robert Byrd to restrict the federal government's ability to enforce school integration policies. 2\\\\. Support for Tough-on-Crime Legislation:In 1994, Biden played a significant role in drafting and passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This legislation, which included provisions for increased funding for prisons and law enforcement, mandatory minimum sentences, and the \\"three strikes\\" rule, has been criticized for contributing to mass incarceration, particularly affecting minority communities.3\\\\. Advocacy for Free Trade Agreements:Biden has historically supported free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). These agreements have been favored by many conservatives and business interests but have faced criticism from labor unions and progressive groups concerned about job losses and labor standards.4\\\\. Support for the Iraq War:In 2002, Biden voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the use of military force in Iraq. This decision aligned with the Bush administration's policy and was supported by many conservatives at the time. However, it has since been a point of contention among progressives and has been re-evaluated in light of subsequent events.5\\\\. Expansion of Immigration Enforcement:During his presidency, Biden has taken steps to strengthen border security and immigration enforcement. In February 2024, he supported a bipartisan immigration bill addressing the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, which included several conservative measures. Although the bill ultimately failed due to opposition from within the Republican Party, Biden's support for such measures indicates a willingness to adopt policies traditionally associated with right-wing perspectives.","title":"Democrats are weak"},{"text":"That just seems like a great example of the negative DEI I spoke about.

It gives immunity to anyone within jis orbit. Thats the kind of precedent you set as a president. I understand he wanted to protect people from the trauma of prosecution, but I think it wouldve been better for the long term  of the USA polity if he wouldve let them try to prosecute innocent people rather than do this preemptive pardoning.

Let me break this down:Your free market argument assumes we're starting from a level playing field, which we aren't. I work in tech, and I've seen firsthand how \\"culture fit\\" interviews systematically filter out qualified candidates who don't match the existing demographic. The market isn't actually free when unconscious biases are baked into the system. if you allow a view to form that minorities are receiving opportunities not on merit, but on race alone, it undermines the entire racial groupThis argument falls apart when you look at actual data. Studies show that companies with diverse leadership outperform their competitors by 36% in profitability. These aren't charity cases - they're smart business decisions. The \\"horror stories\\" you've heard are just confirmation bias - nobody talks about the countless successful diverse hires because they're just... doing their jobs normally.I actually agree with your third point about systemic issues, but here's the thing: we can work on multiple solutions simultaneously. Waiting for educational reform to fix everything means losing out on an entire generation of talent. DEI initiatives are like a pressure release valve - they're not the whole solution, but they help prevent the system from completely stagnating while we work on deeper reforms.You mentioned Harvard's case, but consider this: without any DEI policies, we'd basically be saying that the current power structures, built on centuries of exclusion, should just... stay that way indefinitely. That's not free market - that's just preserving inherited advantage.The real question isn't whether DEI is perfect - it's whether the alternatives are actually better. So far, I haven't seen any better solutions for breaking up entrenched power structures while maintaining business performance.","title":"CMV: DEI is (Almost) Always a Fundamentally Poor Idea"},{"text":"They dont care.

Why does that only apply if the person you pick isnt a white male? It seems strange to me that the default assumption must be if you chose a black person for the position because you recognized that you have a deficit of black voices on your team, that person must not have been as qualified as potential white people you could have chosen. If you chose a woman for your team because you have a very off-kilter ratio of men to women in your organization, that necessitates that you have chosen not to give the position to a man that was more deserving.Why is it not a problem that the implication of choosing someone for a DEI reason must therefore mean the better candidate was the homogenous one?Can it not be the case that you are choosing from a selection of candidates that are relatively even in your consideration and so you make the choice to add a diversity of thought for life experience to your team by choosing someone who does not look like the rest of your team?","title":"CMV: DEI is (Almost) Always a Fundamentally Poor Idea"},{"text":"Are they Keebler elves?","title":"Lowlights of dementia Don's interview with wanna journalist Hannity!\\""},{"text":"Technically he has 34 convictions!","title":"How Hitler Dismantled a Democracy in 53 Days"},{"text":"He's either lying, or his brain is getting worse!

He responded as he invariably did when confronted with dissenting opinions or inconvenient truths: He ignored them and doubled down.  \\n  \\nThe January 31, 1933, **New York Times story on Hitlers appointment as chancellor was headlined Hitler Puts Aside Aim to Be Dictator.**  \\n  \\nOn Sunday morning, March 5, one week after the Reichstag fire, German voters went to the polls. No stranger election has perhaps ever been held in a civilized country, Frederick Birchall wrote that day in The New York Times. **Birchall expressed his dismay at the apparent willingness of Germans to submit to authoritarian rule when they had the opportunity for a democratic alternative. In any American or Anglo-Saxon community the response would be immediate and overwhelming, he wrote.**  \\n  \\nThat same Tuesday, March 21, an Article 48 decree was issued **amnestying National Socialists convicted of crimes, including murder, perpetrated in the battle for national renewal. Men convicted of treason were now national heroes.** The first concentration camp was opened that afternoon, in an old brewery near the town center of Oranienburg, just north of Berlin. The following day, the first group of detainees arrived at another concentration camp, in an abandoned munition plant outside the Bavarian town of Dachau.  \\n  \\nIn this historic hour, we German Social Democrats solemnly pledge ourselves to the principles of humanity and justice, of freedom and socialism, Wels said. **He chided Hitler for seeking to undermine the Weimar Republic, and for the hatred and divisiveness he had sowed.** Regardless of the evils Hitler intended to visit on the country, **Wels declared, the republics founding democratic values would endure.** No enabling act gives you the power to destroy ideas that are eternal and indestructible, he said.  \\nHitler rose. The nice theories that you, Herr Delegate, just proclaimed are words that have come a bit too late for world history, he began.

Instead, his presidency of empty gestures and moral failures has given us something far more dangerous: a reinvigorated Donald Trump armed with a popular mandate and a drive for retribution. In 1992, Donald Trump had a cameo in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Macaulay Culkins Kevin McCallister asks him for directions in the Plaza Hotel lobby, and Trump (who owned the hotel both on screen and in real life) tells him down the hall and to the left. The whole thing lasts seven seconds. According to director Chris Columbus, Trump bull[ied] his way into the movie, making the cameo a condition for filming inside the hotel. Trump hotly denies this. The real estate developer once known as the Donald has come a long way since 1992. Today hell start his second term as president under vastly more favorable circumstances than before. In 2016, he lost the popular vote. In 2024, he became the first Republican to win it since George W. Bush in 2004 and the first to win it when not running as an incumbent since George H. W. Bush in 1988. In 2016, he was the last survivor of a fiercely competitive primary. In 2024, he swatted away pretenders like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis without breaking a sweat. The man who once fought for a seven-second cameo has, to a remarkable extent, realigned American politics around his deeply odd personality. The potential consequences are terrifying. Trumps four years out of office have only solidified his followers loyalty and whetted his appetite for vengeance against political enemies. Meanwhile, the conservative Supreme Court supermajority (three of whose members Trump appointed) ruled last year that presidents enjoy emperor-like immunity from legal consequences for their actions in office. What hell do with this power is anyones guess. His habit of mixing genuine promises with whatever bizarre nonsense floats to the surface of his mind has left both supporters and enemies uncertain about his true intentions. Hes floated everything from revoking the broadcast licenses of unfair news networks to invading Mexico. As we stare down the barrel of whatevers coming in his second term, though, we should never forget how we got here.\\nWatching the Wheels Fall Off In early 2021, no one expected that Trump would again take the oath of office in 2025. After his increasingly bizarre attempts to stay in power after losing the 2020 election, culminating in the January 6th riot, he was widely seen as a disgraced figure who might become the first former president to land in prison. Joe Biden entered office buoyed by embarrassingly positive media coverage. His additions to Trumps temporary pandemic relief measures and promises of a Build Back Better agenda led to breathless coverage declaring him the second coming of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Today that feels like ancient history. Some welfare-state measures he promised during the election, like a public option for health insurance, were dropped the moment he entered office. Others fell to legislative wrangling with his partys conservative wing. Sometimes there may have been nothing Democratic leadership could do against their caucuss obstructionism. Other times, Biden and party leaders performed the political equivalent of a basketball player flopping after minimal contact. When Democrats had enough votes to push a $15 minimum wage through Senate reconciliation, for instance, they simply accepted the Senate parliamentarians nonbinding ruling that the measures budgetary impact was too incidental  despite having the power to override or replace her. His labor record was mostly a bright spot. His National Labor Relations Board appointees undid much of Trumps damage and issued numerous pro-union rulings. Even that comes with a massive asterisk  his disgraceful decision in late 2022 to break a railway strike by invoking the Railway Labor Act, a hideous piece of preCNew Deal union-busting legislation. When a descendant of the big Build Back Better legislative package that was originally sold as the New Deal 2.0 finally limped its way across the finish line, it was missing all of the exciting social democratic measures that had originally been floated. There was no universal pre-K, no paid family and medical leave, no free community college. As his increasingly pointless presidency dragged on, Biden even talked about these things less and less. More than anything else, the Inflation Reduction Act that was eventually passed was a grab bag of tax credits. There was some infrastructure spending, but very little actually got built. Meanwhile, the temporary expansions of the welfare state during the COVID-19 pandemic lapsed. Few of the Biden cheerleaders in the media whod breathlessly noted that this assistance had cut child poverty in half in 2021 paused to run the numbers in the opposite direction when it all went away. Bidens cognitive decline (already widely commented on in 2020) was getting harder and harder to deny. Even as the Democratic Party acted to ensure he would be coronated for his reelection run without any opposition candidates getting a chance to make their case and build public support, the president could hardly open his mouth in public without raising serious questions about his competence to do the job. All of this would have been catastrophic even without Israels genocidal war against the population of Gaza. As it is, Biden has spent the fifteen months since the October 7 terrorist attacks providing Benjamin Netanyahu with an endless supply of bombs to drop on schools, hospitals, and refugee camps. Even as millions of Palestinian civilians were driven from their homes at gunpoint, Biden stood by the policy of unconditional support for Israels war. Universal pre-K? Free community college? Biden literally might not even remember that hed ever promised those things. But through all the months of social media feeds filling with videos of Israeli soldiers posing in the lingerie of Palestinian women theyd killed or driven from their homes and playing with their childrens toys, Biden never wavered. Even as it became universally obvious that Netanyahu had a strong preference for working with Donald Trump and was only too happy to tank Bidens reelection chances, Biden stood by his proxy. By the time he made his far-too-late decision to step aside and let his vice president (who could at least speak in complete sentences) be the Democratic nominee, his Gaza policy had earned him the deep hatred of many Democratic voters. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, passed on every opportunity to undo the damage. A recent poll showed that, among 2020 Biden voters who didnt cast their ballots for Harris in 2024, the single largest subgroup (29 percent) cited ending Israels violence in Gaza as the main factor affecting their vote, beating even the economy (cited by only 24 percent).\\nThe Bernie-Shaped Hole in Our Future As hard as it may be to remember five long years later, in January 2020, Bernie Sanders was winning the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. After he won all of the first three contests, Biden was only able to beat him when the rest of the centrist candidates dropped out and endorsed Biden, a last-ditch consolidation to stop what they regarded as the unacceptable outcome of a democratic socialist running away with the nomination. If Bernie had won the nomination race and become president, what would the last four years have looked like? Maddeningly, well never know. But watching Bernie today railing against Democrats for abandoning the working class (and constantly calling on Congress to spend not one more penny on funding Netanyahus criminal war in Gaza), its impossible not to be haunted by a vision of what could have been. Not so many years before Home Alone 2, another Hollywood sequel, Back to the Future Part II, featured an iconic scene where a white-haired scientist who looks a bit like Bernie Sanders (Christopher Lloyds Doc Brown) explains how time travel can be used to change the present by drawing branching timelines on a chalkboard. Sadly, in real life, whats done is done. The chalkboard that would represent American politics as it exists just has one line. We get to decide what happens next, though. As awful as the next four years of Trump may well be, American history isnt coming to an end. We dont have to accept alternating periods of rule by right-wing authoritarians and alternately pathetic and horrifyingly hawkish centrist Democrats. We can keep fighting for something better, and we damn well should.","title":"Bidens Bleak Presidency Was Always Going to End in Trump"},{"text":"Bernie is a political hack, and he's so damn good at hiding it that most people still think he's principled.

Millennia ago we figured out that we cant leave something as consequential as governing a nation to the people. Think of how easily both left and right are swayed by terrible ideas, compound that with an inability to properly process statistical and legal arguments, and leave people roughly ten minutes to understand and have a gut hunch on any given issue. You should be able to see why this is a terrible idea.Professional lawmakers and governors have full staffs to do research, outreach, and administrative tasks. Plus they have at their disposal access to industry experts to help make a decision. This does not scale if every single vote needs the same amount of care and awareness.Your main reason for holding your view is that direct democracy removes the possibility of voting against ones own interest. But actually voting for a representative is approximately doing that, at least for the big important issues.Your secondary point that laws get more streamlined seems wrong as well. Right now we hold a vote among a couple hundred congress people.

The current democrat party is a response to the right ward shift of the republican party that began before them.You also aren't recognizing that Trump in 2016, wasn't some kind of 4D strategy by Republicans. No one expected him to win the primary. The republican establishment lost the primary and then they got in line, when they realized they can use the guy to get an agenda they've wanted since Ronald Reagan. They purged everyone who objected.The last thing to understand is that Republican playbook two past decade has been to be a WASP's first party. Trump leaned into that.  This time they won some working class latino's/blacks, but I am not sure how long that will endure. There is somewhat of a backlash coming from DEI and what ever. But a bigger driver really is inflation than anything else. Incumbent parties did badly everywhere around the globe and right wing parties won around the globe. Trump lucked out by inheriting the best part of the Obama Recovery, so low information voters will equate him for being better at economics. Since he basically got to govern during a period of low inflation and when the economy finally looked better than it was prior to the 2008 financial crisis. Mean while Biden got to inherit the tail end of the over stimulated COVID economy, which enjoyed a good labor market boom, an asset price boom for anyone who is wealthy enough to have assets, and a whole lot of inflation for the 60 percent of the population that doesn't have meaningful assets.The democrats do have some problems, but I cannot stress how much of this election stems more from Kamala Harris as a presidential candidate. Lets face it: Black is not a political advantage, nor is a woman. Kamala wouldn't make a bad president, but the reality is she inspired no one and has no electoral advantages. People expect her to mobilize Obama's base. But Obama inspired people through his gifts as a orator (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2gRYvcl5Yg). This speech from 2002, is what essentially made Obama a presidential candidate:  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUV69LZbCNQ). He wasn't even in Washington then.Then add to that Kamala's message is she's not Trump. Like can you even come up for a campaign slogan for this person. What is the policy issue that a low information thinks they stand for?Don't give me her policy platform. Neera Tanden  wrote it, just like she writes every single centrist democrats policy platform. If someone doesn't know who Tanden is they don't have any real knowledge of democratic political machine.","title":"Dems need a strategy overhaul + sanity check?"},{"text":"You have to want to see the truth and most of Reddit doesn't.","title":"Reddit sitewide psyop spreads before our eyes to cut redditors' contact with wrongthink"},{"text":"LITEWALLLLYYYY HITTLLEERRRR?\\nAccurate, because most if left still has a problem saying their R's because of how young they are.?","title":"The left has learned nothing from the election whatsoever and nor has the media.

Here's a summary:# Leading Economic Indicators1. **The Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI)**: The LEI is designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle; it incorporates ten data points, such as manufacturing orders, stock prices, and housing permits2. The LEI increased by 0.5% in December 2016 after remaining flat in November.\\n2. **Consumer Confidence Index**: This index measures the level of consumer confidence in economic activity. In December 2016, it stood at 113.3, indicating high consumer confidence.# Economic Metrics1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 1.6% in 20164. This was a slight decrease from the 2.9% growth rate in 2015.\\n2. **Unemployment Rate**: By the end of 2016, the unemployment rate was 4.7%, down from 5.0% at the beginning of the year.\\n3. **Inflation Rate**: The inflation rate for 2016 was approximately 2.1%.\\n4. **Stock Market**: The S&amp;P 500 index ended 2016 with a gain of 9.5%.\\n5. **Average Hourly Earnings**: Average hourly earnings saw an increase of 2.9% over the year.# Additional Metrics* **Housing Market**: Home prices increased by 5.8% from the previous year4.\\n* **Corporate Profits**: After-tax corporate profits saw record highs3.\\n* **Trade Deficit**: The trade deficit widened as imports grew faster than exports1.These indicators collectively painted a picture of a steadily growing U.S. economy with strong consumer confidence, a healthy labor market, and some inflationary pressure.","title":"Why is it that Biden takes credit for anything good that happens while he's president, blames anything bad that happens on Trump, and yet when Trump was president in his first term, everything good that happened was a result of Obama?

I see him as a giant reflection of US politics and culture, not someone that exists in spite of it. Long before trump came around, the USA was obsessed with obnoxious people arguing on CNN/FOX, talking over each other, calling names, flinging shit, and just doing high school bully shit. Segments were short and the only thing that mattered was a good sound bites. We cultivated this puritanical culture of admonishing people and forcing them to go on apology tours and bow down before the masses and confess their sins to affirm their subservience. Reality TV exploded in popularity and the US gobbled down the mindless drama. Surely you accept that this was the culture that existed before Tump, so ask yourself - given that shape, what character traits would a person need to succeed in that kind of environment?Everyone tries to pretend that they don't like trump because he's not this idealistic image they have in their mind but the truth is, he's EXACTLY who they want, they're just mad he's not on their side. I mean for example look how the left acted over Hunter Biden...how many posts on reddit did you see that were along of lines of \\"damn, he sure seems like he'd be so much fun to party with!

That's why they are losing.Democrats are in bed with Wall Street. So too are the Republicans. Democrats are the war party. So too are the mainstream Republicans. The only reason why Trump is in power is because he challenged the Establishment. If Trump doesn't deliver anti-Establishment politics, his second term is going to be a failure. Americans have seen their living standards fall in the past few decades. They are sick of the Washington Establishment. The Republicans picked a anti-Establishment candidate in their Primary, much to the horror of their own party. The Democratic Establishment rigged their primaries against Sanders and could nothing to offer but the same old corrupt poltiics.From 2008, 12 of the past 16 years have been a Democrat. They don't have a good record to show for it. Until Democrats understand that, take responsibility for their own failures, and unless they take corrective action, there's going to be many more losses.","title":"Last time Dem Party libs blamed Russians for their failures; this time they're openly fantasizing over how badly anyone to their left will suffer under Trump.

Multiple times there were legal victories against the Nazis and their response was to continue on and challenge the state to stop them. The opposition had a choice between a civil war or a fascist dictatorship and they hesitated too long for civil war to be a viable option. Fact is once fascists are in power there is never a peaceful way to remove them. There is no peaceful outcome left. There will not be a non violent end to Trump's reign.

Reread the claims in your OP or first comments and if you need to change to a new set of claims to continue arguing for your position, you might want to consider acknowledging the change in view with a [delta](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=changemyview&amp;utm_content=t5_2w2s8) before proceeding.\\n- Ask questions and really try to understand the other side, rather than trying to prove why they are wrong.Please also take a moment to review our [Rule B](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_b) guidelines and _really_ ask yourself - am I exhibiting any of these behaviors? If so, see what you can do to get the discussion back on track.  Remember, the goal of CMV is to try and **understand** why others think differently than you do.","title":"CMV: Liberalism is inherently self-defeating"},{"text":"Its just Russian style misinformation.

When the US (and Mexico) tried that with Operation Condor in the 1970s, it just mean drug production spread further across Mexico.  The Merida Initiative failed and was abandoned by 2021For simplification, let's ignore the huge complications and diplomatic costs associated with attacking a neighbouring country and assume Mexico just acquisces and gives a carte-blanche.You'd need troops on the ground.  Lots of them; the enemy is now skilled in asymmetric warfare, will have support and sympathy from the local population (some pre-existing, some boosted by the simple act of US military 'invasion'), has military training from Mexican military defectors and will know the territory.  Think Afghanistan, but likely with even less local or government support (most people in the US, I'd wager, would similarly support local criminals over a foreign invader.On top of this, that enemy is mobile; they don't need to hold onto territory, they can just move south and work on alternate supply routes.  What is the US to do - occupy Mexico?  Launch air strikes across the whole country?And troops aren't able to shut down distribution networks.  They don't have police training in evidence gathering, investigation, tracing down routes etc.  Are they meant to arrest people?  Where do they hold and put them on trial?  Or is it summary executions?  How are troops meant to break up the networks that move around and hide the money across international bank accounts, too?Part of the reason to emphasize this won't work and would likely lead to a quagmire is to emphasize something else; warzones *increase* refugee flows, not decrease them.    In a worst case scenario it'd wholly destabilize much of Mexico.Maybe those people don't get through the border, but I think the TV images of woman and children en-masse outside the US border wall, maybe getting shot by soldiers (who are, again, not trained for this sort of thing) when trying to push through, would have signficiant political impact.

War tends to create instability and refugees.Additionally, the cartels aren't causing the migrations, so dealing with them ism a solution. It might change the dynamics of the migrations but that could easily be for the worse. Furthermore, the main source of power for the cartels is the flow of American weapons. There is zero propensity for Americans to address their gun proliferation issue as the legal protections for guns are too great and there won't be any potential to address that for generations. You ignore this problem.A safer Mexico would mean fewer people feeling the need to make the trip all the way to the U.S.You assume a massive ground war in Mexico makes anyone safer and that Mexico will accept these migrants and that the migrants would want to stay in  what's left of Mexico during or after a war that could be a multi-decade protracted insurgency.Forget the cartels as a solution to this problem. Stop the migrations before they have to even think about going to or through Mexico.

Mexico, like most nations, would strongly oppose this, as would its citizen population.historically, such actions have only increased anti-American sentiment, increased local violence, and destabilized regions further.regardless, the U.S. already has a long history of heavy-handed military interventions in Latin America (e.g., Panama, Nicaragua, Colombia).these interventions have frequently worsened violence and destabilization without achieving any of its goals or achieving long-term solutions.the war on drugs in Colombia, for example, heavily militarized the country but failed to eliminate drug trafficking or the cartels, they simply adapted.escalating the militarization of the region would only create more power vacuums and opportunities for cartels to exploit. furthermore, it risks entrenching the very dynamics that contribute to migration crises, as militarization often increases human rights abuses and civilian displacement.without addressing in-U.S. demand for drugs, military interventions and heavy-handed actions will continue to fail.as long as there is a lucrative illegal market for drugs in the U.S., cartels - or whatever their inevitable successors look like - will exist to supply it.this has been the repeated outcome, time and time and time again over the past half century+ of the drug war. legalization isnt a standalone solution, it disrupts cartels primary revenue source and allows governments to control and regulate the market.doing this would weakens cartels financially, and gives states the opportunity to shift resources from enforcement to public health.coupling legalization with targeted socioeconomic investments in cartel-influenced regions has been shown to reduce violence and illegal activity.TL;DR:direct military intervention would likely violate international law, destabilize Mexico further, and do nothing to address the U.S.s underlying demand for drugs. on the other hand, legalization would strike at the cartels finances, weaken their power, and allow for a redirection of resources toward meaningful and systemic solutions.i can provide sources to back up all of my assertions, if you would like.","title":"CMV: The best long-term solution to securing the U.S. southern border is to take direct action against the cartels."},{"text":"Do-nothing-democrats at it again.

The point is to tolerate a diversity of ideas, and allow them to propogate in the \\"free market\\" of ideas, and let good ones succeed and bad ones fail.  I.e., let the fascist speak at the university so we can deconstruct their arguments in a dialiectic debate.  There is nothing in the liberal ideology which advocates the tolerance of violence, so as far as i can tell there's no paradox there.I don't really understand your paradox of weakness is really.  A principal of darwinism is that the strong will survive and the weak will die.  That's not a socio-economics idea, that's just a rule of nature.  Liberalism as a political ideology allows maximum freedom, and therefore, allows darwinism to take place on it's own in the free market.  Having said that, liberalism as an ideology first incarnated in a WASP christian society in which the \\"blessed are the meek\\" was a key virtue.  I suppose you could say those two elements are a paradox, or you could say that they are two opposing forces which attempt to balance eachother.I think you're mixing up liberalism as a political philosophy and the cultural elements of the societies which have practiced it.  Liberalism could have just as easily emerged elsewhere, but it didn't, perhaps by circumstance... if you're examining American or western european societies, then in those cases the cultures themselves came along with certain normative elements, which would be different than the normative cultural elements, had liberalism emerged in say the buddhist east, or the islamic mid-east, or the iriquois...","title":"CMV: Liberalism is inherently self-defeating"},{"text":"The news is like watching incest happen","title":"Secret Contents of Biden's Personal Letter to Trump Revealed on X by Fox News Reporter"},{"text":"I dont know where we stand on the BLM rioters of 2020, but its time for the DOJ to take action against everyone who was arrested, bailed out, and never brought to trial.","title":"Democrat District Attorney Prepares State Charges Against Jan. 6ers Pardoned by Trump"},{"text":"Republicans..the party of Trump.","title":"Speaker Mike Johnson Says Hell Probe Bidens Pardons But Trump Freeing Jan 6.

The Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush administrations invested heavily in destabilizing democracies in central and south America. The ostensible reason was fear of communist influence in the region. Not insurgency, influence. We aided and enabled the overthrow of democratically elected governments, we funded, trained and supported death squads. One result of this is that today the region is littered with failed states that cannot police their own borders or curb rampant lawlessness or prevent powerful criminal organizations from corrupting government.2. Those failed states do not have the support of their people nor do they have a pool of experienced, trained, dedicated public servants from which to forge competent governments. We might eradicate a dozen or more cartels and they will be replaced, not with effective government and law enforcement but by other cartels. 3. Intervention in Vietnam was a failure, in part, because we partnered with a corrupt government in the south that did not have the support of the people and could not hope to carry it's own weight and whose leadership would not be distracted long enough from enriching themselves to do so. When Trump negotiated out withdrawal from Afghanistan we didn't even consult with the corrupt, ineffective government we ourselves had installed there. We hung them out to dry. We can certainly do local military intervention in Central America like we did in Vietnam and Afghanistan. There is a long list of defense contractors, worried about their revenue streams now that we're no longer draining ordinance stocks in the Middle East, who would benefit from the activity. It would also be a gold-mine for the present corrupt governments of those nations who'd  be able to demand cash both from the US as a valued partner in the War on Cartels (pick your favorite new branding slogan) but also continue to get money from their chosen cartel partners for protection. Unless there's a way to build strong, dedicated governments focused on bringing stability and prosperity to their citizens nothing we do is going to change the situation. You'd think that after the second half of the 20th century, we'd have learned the price of sloppy, carefree foreign intervention.","title":"CMV: The best long-term solution to securing the U.S. southern border is to take direct action against the cartels."},{"text":"Good luck finding a TT creator who doesn't have a snark sub.","title":"Reddit sitewide psyop spreads before our eyes to cut redditors' contact with wrongthink"},{"text":"Still cant figure out why differing opinions are so emotionally shattering.

But I don't think it can work, at least like that.  \\nThe state is just unable to be as effective as a private company in managing a business for many reasons, mainly lack of incentives and the problem of information (in order to get the information on what prices to place, how much to produce, etc. you need to operate exactly as a private entity, maximizing profits, so if the State were to try and manage a business optimally without use of force, it would just become a State-owned private company). This means we can't have the State act as a competitor without having him do exactly what the private sector already does.  \\nSo okay, let's accept a not-so-well run, state-owned company. I can understand (although not agree) with this in some cases, such as education and healthcare as you said, where quantity and accessibility can sometimes be more important than quality. But as a competitor? We could think that the state-provided product could be a kind of limit on how a much monopoly would be able to charge for products (if a business can produce at 20$ and the State can produce at 30$ and sells at  35$, then the business can't jack the price up indefinitely). Could this work? I think so, but in cases where monopolies really are so extreme that prices are jacked up farther than what a public company could be producing the same good, which are close to none, specially in sectors like healthcare and education which, when not intervened, are rather competitive.","title":"How involved the state can be in a libertarian economy?"},{"text":"I wonder if some ever think that.

A few mistakes in laws - even a single comma- can result in absurd situations going unpunished and this system of different unexperienced people drafting continuously new laws seems highly inefficient and very damaging. If your method to make people more rational - though that doesn't necessarily mean mutually supportive, one need not such a system. If everyone votes for their self interest, most of the big issues in the US will solve themselves: trade unions will be formed to get economic rights; the majority will vote for regulations helping them and punish politicians going too far in certain directions and they will donate to candidates who actually fight for their interest and with their wallet, there will be more politicians like Bernie Sanders.However, rationality is rare in the world. Humans are emotional creatures and it's close to impossible to make them think about their own gains and losses without the major cognitive biases. Plus, competition is the breeder for success. Ambition motivates far more than empathy and helps people justify the difficult choices necessary to keep things running. A leader pushed by ambition in a rational world will be rewarded by pandering to the majority and helping the country in the long run. A leader pushed by compassion will be a perpetual virtue signal without the teeth for real changes.","title":"CMV: Direct Democracy is the governing solution for equality, ecological survival and prosperity"},{"text":"Im just laughing at actual hate subs that revolve completely around Twitter/X to survive like BlackPeopleTwitter and WhitePeopleTwitter not joining in on this.
