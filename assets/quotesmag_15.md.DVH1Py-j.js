The very first in this chain, I think was Biden announcing he was going to have an African American female running mate, leading to a small pool of candidates for that role. He kind of made that comment off the cuff, probably without thinking it through, but once it was out, he couldn't take it back. So, of the small pool of choices, he chose Kamala Harris. Another bad decision, since she had low popularity to begin with and she's not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. Fast forward to 2023. Now would have been a good time for Biden to announce  he's not running for reelection so there could be a proper primary. Or it would have been a good time for the DNC to pull the stunt they did during the Summer and force Biden off the ticket. But nope, can't announce the president is mentally deficient, even if a lot of us can already see it. So the next misstep is waiting for Biden's first debate with Trump for it to become apparent his brains fried. It's too late for a regular primary and they just kind of throw Harris in. And then she makes her own mistakes during the campaign, like not having clear answers for obvious questions. Setting aside the administration's abysmal record, which is it's own series of missteps, at any part of the chain of these events, Dems could have taken the difficult option which would have paid off later, but instead went with the expedient option. And during the presidential race, all those expedient shortcuts finally caught up with them as they'd painted themselves into an ever smaller corner, so now the whole thing collapsed in on itself.","title":"Did the Democrats throw the Election?"},{"text":"There is the slim chance that the military will not answer that call.

India's elections are centrally run. Voting identity cards are provided free of charge unlike the US where IDs typically cost money and require you to proactively register. India also votes largely by voting machine. And finally India for the most part does not allow voting by mail. Instead of you are eligible for voting off-site you are visited by an electoral officer who records your vote on a voting machine. India restricts this eligibility however to seniors, physically disabled voters and in the last election to those with Covid.The US could have the same quick results if it committed to centrally run elections where the state goes out of its way to allow voters to vote. India for instance sets up polling booths high in the mountains and deep in swamps just to service isolated communities. Meanwhile in the US states like Texas try to limit entire counties to a single voting location. Similarly the US could take the effort to take the voting machines to voters who wish to vote at home. And like India could declare the day of in person voting to be a federal holiday. All of this would reduce the need to rely on ballots that come in through the postal network and would speed up counting.But it's Republicans who oppose most of these measures.","title":"Democrat Derek Tran unseats GOP Michelle Steel in razor-thin Orange County House race"},{"text":"I think even if AGI could reproduce near physical experience of a human body, there would still be huge demand for the real thing","title":"CMV: When AGI is here, the most valuable professions will be those that sells the human body (like prostitution)"},{"text":"It's been time since the gop ruined Obamas presidency but better late than never i guess","title":"Letter: Civility gets us nowhere.

Too many jobs and not enough people in some industries. The biggest issue amongst Americans is upward mobility. They want jobs that utilize their learned knowledge over physical capabilities.?Now, the people running these companies have a significant competitive disadvantage. First, the service or good is located within the country so it cant be outsourced. Second, there are technological gaps that make it difficult to innovate something. Third, other countries can produce it cheaper and ship it here.Lets look at construction, there is no device that can mobilize the way a human can. The construction happens within the country. You can build a house much cheaper in Mexico. So, this makes it tempting for both the immigrant and the employer to bring in that workforce.?I dont think we should be encouraging Americans to work these jobs because they arent technologically advanced. They also dont contribute to long term goals. If you look at China and India, they are economic giants simply because more people live there. If you look at European countries, theyve invested heavily in tech and STEM. China is moving towards more tech and they are quickly elevating so many people into the same quality of life as Europeans. But the US is falling back fast.

The Republican party, especially since 2008 or so and the rise of the Tea Party, has moved significantly to the right on that scale. All people are trying to say, really, is that there is a lot of room to the left in national US politics that is virtually untested at that level.\\nThe issue with thinking of this in more relativistic terms is that it makes it easy misrepresent the parties. In that system, when Trump or some other Republican refers to a fairly centerist Democrat as the far left, then they'd be correct; the center is pretty far to the left of them.

They're both to the left and the right of both depending on what you're talking about, because like every party that actually governs anywhere, their policies are a mish mash and not all derived from only two broad philosophical principles of economics. They're also to the left of the NDP on immigration, but also to the right of the NDP on immigration depending on your views on immigration and economics.

This means that Democrats are on track to flip two more House seats in California, which means Republicans will only have won 220 seats in the House, representing a net loss of 2 seats compared to the 2022 elections.

This tech is not new.","title":"Why these new Russian missiles are game-changers"},{"text":"I'd like to approach this from two different sides of the same point.First, using your example of the USSR. I don't know where you live, but I'm assuming it's not a former Soviet nation. You say that the main political party of the USSR was considered radical by the standard of most, but within the USSR was considered moderate. Imagine a scenario in which a party was voted to power which was somewhat more liberal than the main political party. As an international observer, if you heard reports that the USSR voted in a liberal administration, how would you perceive that? Would you think they were shifting away from extremism (by international standards) or just that they were still extreme, but very slightly less so? What if you heard similar news about some nation that you knew very little about, politically? My guess is that you'd be likely to apply a definition of the terms that were more widely accepted, rather than one as understood locally in that nation.Second, I grew up in a very rural conservative area. 60% of registered voters are democrat, yet this past election Trump received 79% of the county's votes. These numbers aren't unusual, and if anything I'd guess that the % of voters registered D has gone down since I was a kid there 20-30 years ago. When I've tried explaining this to others I'm usually met with confusion or \\"well they aren't really Democrats\\", etc. That's understandable, because no matter how their party affiliation or political leanings might compare to the others within the community, when compared to those at the state or national level the county is very conservative. Should I refer to the people in that area has generally left-leaning, though, based on their part affiliation and the fact that the majority are slightly more moderate than the 35% who are more strongly right-leaning? The orientation of a political party and how far left or right they are, is determined by the environment and sentiment of the country they exist in.Why country? Why not the state level? Or county? or City? Or household? Or why not the continental level or some other geographic or regional boundary? And who gets to make that determination? Why do you get to say it is determined by the environment and sentiment of the country they exist in? What if the people of my hometown think it should be based on the environment and sentiment of the county in which they exist (even though the population of the county is less than 1% of the state's population)?If discussing local (regardless of level) politics regarding something that has no broader impact then I can understand the desire to apply terminology as it applies to the local population only. However, we live in a global society in which most national, and many state, political decisions may have international impacts. Most of us live in an area with immigrants from all over the world and current (and future) tourists. Doesn't it make more sense to use more globally accepted standards when discussing politics, so that everyone can understand where those positions and policies fall within the broader political context? Furthermore, isn't it helpful to understand where we lie, politically, compared to the rest of the world? Back to your USSR example, do you think it would have been more beneficial for residents of the USSR to understand that even their \\"moderate\\" government was extreme? Or do you think it better for them to believe that what they were experiencing is what a truly moderate government actually looks like?","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"Thank you!

If you measured every policy on a liberal to authoritarian scale, then sure. But that's not what we do, and even that would break down on many policy issues, like criminal prohibitions on antisocial behaviour. Everyone's policy toward murder is pretty far into the authoritarian end of the spectrum for example. Nobody is liberal about murder. In actual practice policy is mostly just left/right coded and not based on first principles that necessarily align with more universally agreed upon left or right ideologies. Even if it were, there's all kinds of policy overlap with different motivations. Both the extreme end of the libertarian right and the Marxist left support totally open borders for example. But conversely a left of center labour party may support tight border controls because of labour protectionism. Whether these policies are left or right wing is largely arbitrary and a product of the cultural context. Who supports these policies, what are their other policies and what is their rational for them?

The bible KJV teaches us this world and society will only get darker and more Godless, even though God is always in control at the end of the day its up to the individual to serve God or not. We as christians are to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ where ever we go and live to serve God alone, as God provides us with His strength, mercy and ever loving grace. If God is for us who can be against us? (Romans 8:31) God is building a kingdom in heaven which is every believer in Christ and He wants as many saved by Jesus as possible so His children can live with Him in heaven for eternity. That is what God wants from us truly, a relationship with Him to experience and know the love He has for us, so that others can hear the good news through His children which is the gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord. The gospel literally saves lives, God makes it clear in His bible vengeance belongs to Him (Romans 12:19) God will destroy all evil once and for all on that great day of judgment. We dont need anyone to rise up because there isnt anyone who can except Jesus. Jesus Christ has already defeated sin and satan on that cross of calvary. Satan and his demons are headed to hell and he knows that. All we have to do is stay close to God by following the path He has for us everyones path is different, listen to the Holy Spirit which guides us into all truth, avoid traps sent by the devil because he will send traps as the devil wants as many in hell as possible. Never cease praying and always repent swiftly when needed.Luke 21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.","title":"9/11 is a inside job bush did 9/11 and osama bin laden did not"},{"text":"As far as the totalitarian approach, you need to go back to our countries history. Most regions were heavily dominated, even with 'church and state shall be separate' by religious groups. The puritans were the OG founders. There isnt a state within the US that doesnt have an occult following of some sect of christianity, whether it be catholics, mormons, baptists, and so on. Trump is definitely abusing those followings, but the church never had a TRUE stronghold like they have had in history's past in large parts of Europe, south america, and so on. Though they did have power and sway. Just not full power and control. And even under trump, they wont, becuase trump wants the power. But it only takes 'good men' (per the constitution) to refuse him. The founding fathers never expected things to get this corrupt, and hoped that 'good' would prevail. But they gave us the keys to fix it, but someone has to drive that bus. Even if it leads to a flaming wreck.The second to last part, both democrats and republicans are doing that in states they dominate. States like California and New York are just as gerrymandered as red states like Texas and Florida. And they do similar voter suppression.The last part, is just the flaw of democracy when you set it up based on the roman style with a congress and senate. Democracy is painfully slow and ineffective the moment you depend on other branches to be safeguards for other branches not abusing power. The deadlock is both a bug and a feature. Just be glad that we arent a republic, otherwise that deadlock would have happened decades ago. The last time votes were largely over 65% and 'unanimous', was WW2. All other votes that happen to date that are 'unanimous', only benefit the politicians and not the people. And why we've seen so much use of 'executive power' from presidents.the TLDR is both parties are corrupt. One is just less nice about it and the other lacks a backbone because they think they are better than 'us' and shouldn't stoop to lower lows. Both are out for themselves.

Let's say immigration.Now, let's label one end (on the left side) to be \\"Complete Open Borders\\" and let's label the other end (on the right side) to be \\"Completely Impermeable Borders\\".Now, reflect for a minute that there is no politician in the US that actually advocates either policy (regardless of how that politician may be painted by the other side). AOC wants the border to be more open than does Trump but AOC does not want to allow ANYONE to come in for any reason. (For example, I'm sure that she would oppose the entry of a known felon from a foreign country.) And Trump, conversely, does not want to prevent EVERY non-citizen from entering the country; he doesn't want to collapse the tourism sector or send every H1B employee home.So let's make lines on the paper indicating these policies. Necessarily, AOC will not be as far left as the Complete Open Borders and Trump will not be as far right as the Completely Impermeable Border. We can now make a box using the AOC and Trump lines as two of the lines of the box (and two others to connect them). Any view that sits outside of this box -- such as being more left of AOC or more right of Trump -- still exists, because we can imagine a person who wants to deport every non-US citizen, but nobody will vote for this person since we've already taken the two most extreme elected opinions.The box that we've created of all electable opinions is called the Overton Window.Of course, the window can shift. If we look at an issue like gay marriage, it would have been solidly outside of the Overton Window in 1950 -- as there was no elected politician in support of it -- but is clearly within the Overton Window now -- as there are many elected politicians in support of it.What u/FUCKMESAULGOODMAN is discussing is that views outside of the US Overton Window still exist in places outside of the US. For example, the North Korean position on immigration is to the right of Donald Trump; they don't allow any immigration except for specific issues/reasons certified at the highest levels of government.","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"My right to exist in public just like everyone else isn't up for debate.","title":"Emboldened by the Election, Ohio GOPers Push Through a Trans Bathroom Ban.

The Republicans advocate for a dog-eat-dog world where everyone is on their own and societal hierarchies are strictly enforced, with the rich at the top. They have also demonstrated an appetite for dictatorship.Do you think that there exists no position on the spectrum such that you can't stake out a position further to the left, and no position such that you can't stake out a position further on the right? We can argue about what the furthest left or right looks like in theory, but we have many examples from the real world to point to. We can identify Republicans as being further to the right than Pelosi-type liberals, and the latter as being further to the right than AOC-type liberals.Europe provides more examples. And when you take those examples into account, you see that the Democrats are not radically to the left as Republicans often claim. I mean, if the ACA was way too extreme as they say it is, then surely the countries with socialized medicine are hellholes, right? Except they're not. And that's important in these discussions. It's not that something like Medicare for All wouldn't work; Republicans just don't like it, because they want the far-right solution of letting everyone fend for themselves.They deliberately muddy the waters by claiming that what the Democrats want is at the opposite end of the spectrum. If they can successfully equate the two, which they have, then they can say, \\"Might as well go with our extreme approach as the Democrats' extreme approach,\\" which they have. Pointing out that no, the Democrats are not actually far left is the antidote.","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"This is not a real answer and it accomplishes nothing.

It names the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Food and Drug Administration, and FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf as defendants. In the filing, plaintiffs Mary Talley Bowden, Paul E. Marik, and Robert L. Apter argued that by publicly ordering health professionals and patients to avoid ivermectin, the FDA both acted outside of its authority and inhibited the doctors ability to practice medicine. Though the FDA has approved ivermectin to treat certain infections, the department has urged the public not to use the drug to treat COVID-19. Moreover, the filing continues, if the FDA is allowed to interfere with the practice of medicine now under cover of a pandemic, this interference will metastasize to other circumstances, destroying the carefully constructed statutory wall between federal and state regulatory powers, and between the FDA and the professional judgment of health professionals.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9062939/?fbclid=IwAR20n1DAmwtM5c-BH6YZf-CXUZJv0dBGGj6JuuGCz2Ml9_46oFGwJ-o8rOA#!po=24.2063https://boydengrayassociates.com/complaint-in-apter-v-hhs-no-322-cv-184-s-d-tx-june-2-2022-2/","title":"Why did the FDA try to block the study and use of Ivermectin for Covid?"},{"text":" Recently I took a friend with only a high school degree to lunch.

Yet, in reality, a ton of these accounts come from the same people who have more than one reddit, as well as Bots and B.S. Reddit really doesn't allow standard users who have only one account the same levels of free speech as those who have many accounts, and Reddit actually has become quite oppressive. You would have to match the other redditors' views of any thread you are on or prepare to be downvoted into oblivion. Whether reddit is responsible and part of the conspiracy doesn't even matter. It is really what reddit enables anybody to do. Make as many accounts as you want, maybe use multiple IPs if you want, and just create and frame any opinion you want. Really pretending things are popular and current, but actually just turns out to be AI and dead internet theory. Then, some people seem to use bots to block opinions they don't want. It doesn't even require politics or moderators. It just requires some sadistic nerds who hate free speech and want to be internet fascists.

So naturally, it makes reddit very vulnerable to socializing and politicizing concepts. If anyone believes they can, they will try to use tools to brainwash people. Reddit is just one more way.

They couldn't have a president ever do that again as America is their life line and net, so the blackmail rings began. Epstein is the iceberg.

The left believe all elections are a show, manipulated by the pentagon. Their belief is there is no such thing as a true democracy in an empire that underneath every empire posing as a republic is an actual militaristic rule. Which is true. Consider how the mainstream media sources are fed info and words by the pentagon and have people in their staff who legit work in military and own arms dealers. Yeah we have state run media, and the left is the only force opposed to militarism in the US. All the don't tread on me libertarians sold out to the state quicker than the leftist libertarians lol. For this reason when you see a war drum of a police state beating loud over the next years expect the \\"leftist conspiracy types\\" to be targeted heavily.

Use the Enlightenment as an example. Some scholarship says England didn't even have it, some say it occurred earlier and gradually there so by the time France or Germany was going through it there were no signs in England because they had already incorporated many of the ideas in their laws and policy approach. The truth? Pretty irrelevant really. But the comparison between England and the rest of western Europe happened because most views of politics is based on how much movement happens. Forward or backwards, you can only see movement when it...moves. So I think when people compare our parties to those in Europe it's looking at the relative movement in Europe and the relative lack in the US. It's not saying the left would be right or whatever, it's people trying to say that the US hasn't moved, and being progressive (as reddit generally is) they only see movement when it's progressive. The nuance would be if you aren't progressive. Since political movement is just as relative as physical, you could argue the US has moved (right) while Europe has stagnated (on the left). But nuance is the realm of genuine intellectual discourse, not what passes for it on the internet. So we're left with a simple look at something that is complicated even to experts. All you can really conclude is that the US and Europe are not in lockstep politically.","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"Guaranteed Trump manages to insult democrats and Biden in his inauguration speech.","title":"White House: Biden will attend Trump's inauguration in January"},{"text":"Why do these assholes always wait until they are being pushed out before they panic and finally decide to do something?","title":"Lawmakers call for progress on marijuana law before end of Biden administration"},{"text":"The concept of left and right is not only relative (someone is more right wing than someone), it also has absolute definitions.

That dynamic is for sure. But as you and I know, the monorail, which Seattleites voted for a half dozen times, got nixed when we finally got light rail. It didn't go to Ballard or West Seattle. And the fight to get it to Ballard and West Seattle is taking literally decades. And then where we did put light rail stops in the city, we didn't put any density next to them. They're next to a bunch of parking lots and golf courses.\\n \\n And consequently, housing is as expensive as ever. So, like, all of that, everything in that quote, Seattle just turned around and crapped on, which, by which I'm trying to get to a bigger point, which is: Half of this is like, \\"What's so great about rural areas? Screw those guys. Let's value our cities that we love.\\" But the other half is cities have kind of blown it. Like blue governance in cities in the past 20 years since the piece came out have blown it. They haven't built much transit. They really haven't built much housing. They are choking.\\n \\n These growth policies that you envisioned are getting choked by bureaucracy, red tape, historical memorial societies or whatever, NIMBY groups, interest groups, and even environmentalists. Everybody can slow everything down. So, blue city governance is a tangled failure, it looks like right now. And how do you think about this notion of urban pride and embracing urbanity when the examples we have before us are not super inspiring, at least in the U.S.?I note that you're saying absolutely nothing about the actual agenda, which is no surprise, because the original piece hastily notes that it's not particularly objectionable, blink and you'll miss it: What exactly abundance adherents believe varies, of course, but there are a number of broad precepts: building more housing, producing more energy, and fostering more technological innovation. None of these are objectionable goals; the differences with progressives arise, largely, in how to get there. Abundance starts from a growth above all mindset. The agendas advocates hate residential zoning lawswhich, contrary to what they frequently imply, is something they have in common with us and most progressivesbut also detest the National Environmental Protection Act, support fracking, oppose tenant protections, and are often deferential to the policy preferences of Big Tech.NEPA is [bad, actually](https://www.liberalcurrents.com/the-case-for-abolishing-the-national-environmental-policy-act/), support for fracking is hardly universal among the abundance faction, \\"tenant protections\\" like rent control are grossly counterproductive, and that last one is just guilt-by-association.Which is what the piece mostly is. \\"Hey, it may look like progressivism is a giant failure in the places where it holds power, but these people questioning it are _waves hands_ associated with bad people!\\" in a tenuous way. (Example: John Arnold saying [\\"Ive now been called the next Koch brother by the far left press and the next George Soros by the far right.\\"](https://x.com/JohnArnoldFndtn/status/975739451522605056) is \\"comparing himself to the Kochs\\". This is _ridiculous_.)On the gripping hand, the places with the biggest Republican gains in 2024 were deep-blue cities like New York and San Francisco. That is, in the places where people were most familiar with blue governance, they ran away from it the hardest. Blaming this on secret Republicans isn't a solution.This is a _bad article_. There are real problems--among other things, cities are horribly unaffordable, and everyone was angry about prices this year--and the _Prospect_ can't even bring itself to deny that the abundance faction is right about that. Neither you nor the _Prospect_ can bear to admit that they're right, you're just _very angry_ that they're not signaling opposition to Bad People hard enough.Do you think, maybe, that this attitude is part of why we're in this pickle?","title":"The Abundance Agenda: Neoliberalisms Rebrand | The new centrist push to regain control of the Democratic Party, with corporate money"},{"text":"\\"The orientation of a political party and how far left or right they are, is determined by the environment and sentiment of the country they exist in\\"  \\nMost of the time in your daily life, someone saying \\"Aksually Democrats aren't left\\" are not really contributing to the conversation as you live in the USA.

Prostate growth is heavily affected by androgens like testosterone. Since prostate cancers are usually just malfunctioning prostate cells, their growth is also heavily affected by testosterone.  The common mechanism I alluded to above is androgen receptor inhibition. If a drug makes your androgen receptors less sensitive to androgens, like testosterone, then prostate cancers have a harder time growing.  It's not a cure, but it's absolutely a widely used method to treat prostate cancer.  **Ivermectin is an androgen receptor inhibitor.**  Really. Look up everything I've written so far for yourself. Don't just trust a random Redditor.  As a side note, because testosterone is the primary androgen responsible for masculinizing traits in a human, people wishing to lessen their masculine traits (such as people undergoing male to female gender transition) are frequently prescribed androgen receptor inhibitors.  I was never much on the conspiracy theory that there are forces trying to 'feminize' Western men.

What happened in 2009 was this, so there was this pharma company GlaxoSmithKline that was close to bankruptcy but for some reason the swine flu \\"happened\\", authorities wanted to call a pandemic but not enough people ate up their shit. Either way GSK came in and say \\"Hey cool, guys you know we already have a vaccine against it right?\\" so officials \\"bought\\" the medicine from GSK that was labelled Pandemrix on masses, coincidentally rescuing GSK from going bankrupt. The US was also part but they received a different medicine, one that isn't from GSK, mainly european citizens received the stuff from GSK. During that *pandemic* officials announced that Pandemrix, so the stuff they gave europeans, wouldn't be available on the market anymore after the *pandemic* is over.Any alarm bells riging yet? Let's continue, so H1N1 hit, GSK came in claiming they have a vaccine for that but for some reason it's only available for a limited amount of time, specifically until the *pandemic* is over which makes me wonder, if they already had a vaccine that was thoroughly tested at that time, why remove it from the market after the 2009 incident?Fast forward to after the incident, european citizens are calling in on masses, for some reason they started suffering from narcolepsy, but why? Maybe caused by the swine flu? Nope, turns out Pandemrix has a high chance of causing narcolepsy.There's a documentary in german regarding the 2009 incident where they uncovered all this shit, the documentary is called: [Profiteure der Angst Das Gesch?ft mit der Schweinegrippe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKkQH6JO4n8)Translates to: Profiteers of Fear, The business with the swine fluThis was one of the reasons why I didn't take the jab but I'm not kidding, GSK being involved was absolutely not on my screen at the beginning but it should've been, if I would've known that I would've put in a lot more effort in spreading skepticism among the people. I'm not gonna tell someone to take something or not, but I will absolutely give them the information I have when I think this doesn't seem right and whenever GSK is involved, you gotta be insanely cautious.

There also is a non-relative meaning to certain political terms, that is theoretically relevant because of the legacy of Marxism and the labour movement, and is worth using. This is because political ideology can be coherency classified this way, and it is a useful classification because there are qualitative differences this classification makes clear. Canonically, the left comprises those who in some way want to overthrow or transcend capitalism. To the right of this are social democrats who want to substantially reform capitlaism along egalitarian lines, usually using the power of organised labour. Further to the right are liberals who are totally pro capitalist and not aligned with the labour movement but support some progressive reforms. The U.S. is exceptional because the nominally centre left party, the Democrats, has no social democratic tradition, it was never a reforming party of labour. Instead it has a liberal tradition, this is partially a result of the U.S. labour movement tending to be syndicalist and to be critical to the idea of forming a labour party. There is then really something special about the Democratic party, it has historically and not only recently been a party of the more progressive wing of business, it does not have a social democratic of socialist tradition, even of the most mild form. After social democratic parties of some form were formed across the majority of the industrialised world in the 19th and early 20th century, and most basic liberal reforms were achieved (for example curbing the power of the aristocracy and extending the franchise) liberal parties tended to be classed as parties of the centre, this is for example a useful classification of the Liberal Democrat party in the U.K., the now defunct Democrats party in Australia,  and various liberal parties in Europe.

Wikipedia's blurb on the matter, from a 1947 book by a Scottish sociologist, does a decent job summing up what people mean when they say \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" in politics:The right is always the party sector associated with the interests of the upper or dominant classes, the left the sector expressive of the lower economic or social classes, and the centre that of the middle classes. Historically this criterion seems acceptable. The conservative right has defended entrenched prerogatives, privileges and powers; the left has attacked them. The right has been more favorable to the aristocratic position, to the hierarchy of birth or of wealth; the left has fought for the equalization of advantage or of opportunity, for the claims of the less advantaged.In the United States, as well as almost all capitalist nations, the Overton window is very narrow, and currently quite far right on the overall spectrum. There is no significant leftist representation in the US government, aside from a few independent lawmakers (i.e. Bernie Sanders) who have to ally with the larger parties anyway to get anything done. Both the Republicans and Democrats represent and benefit the upper classes, neither makes significant effort towards class equity, and both strive primarily to maintain the political and financial status quo (the core tenet of [Conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism)) that keeps them in power.It's not so much \\"the left are not actually left because...somewhere in Europe\\", but rather that US Democrat party policies are not actually left because they are rooted in right-wing, conservative values. The comparison to European politics is simply to point out that Europe in general has a much *wider* Overton window. Europe as a whole is not actually too far left of the UScapitalism, hierarchy, and nationalism reign supreme throughout the western worldbut because they haven't fallen victim to two-party hegemony, like the US, they generally have much more diverse government representation, and leftist parties do hold some power.","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"The DNC doesnt have any interest in working class candidates unless theyre corruptible","title":"Bernie Sanders: We Need More Working-Class Candidates to Challenge Both Parties"},{"text":"It's also really hard to win swing states in future elections when you double-down on the tone deaf rhetoric and mismatched messaging that handed you a heaping pile of \\"chump\\" in the first place.DeLuSiOnAl.

Youre right in terms of the Overton window. Just because somethings mainstream in Europe doesnt mean its main stream here. Where Ill disagree, is often claiming something is mainstream not the point of the statement.When someone claims that a proposal is extreme they are often arguing that its infeasible or fundamentally destabilizing or only possible with a different type of population. By claiming a country with similar economic structures and cultural values has implemented a policy people are claiming that it would be feasible. Notice you dont have people saying that something is mainstream in Russia in that argument cause thats not a stable state that people identify with. Also note that the response is often that such and such a policy has these real or perceived issues in Europe (a criticism of feasibility). To be nerdy for a moment one of the most important things in politics is being able to imagine a future thats different enough to address problems but close enough to be worth working for. If I said my political goal was to remake the government in the style of Naboo from star wars that would not be seriously discussed because that is so infeasible it not really worth the energy of consideration. But if we want to discuss public hospitals, and its initially considered by my interlocutor to be infeasible it might be useful to point out that countries who share the uss capitalist values have public hospitals like Japan or that people who share the USa high quality of life have public hospitals like the Swiss.

What exactly abundance adherents believe varies, of course, but there are a number of broad precepts: building more housing, producing more energy, and fostering more technological innovation. None of these are objectionable goals; the differences with progressives arise, largely, in how to get there. Abundance starts from a growth above all mindset. The agendas advocates hate residential zoning lawswhich, contrary to what they frequently imply, is something they have in common with us and most progressivesbut also detest the National Environmental Protection Act, support fracking, oppose tenant protections, and are often deferential to the policy preferences of Big Tech.I don't have opinions on the NEPA and US-style tenant protections, because I'm not from the US and I have no idea about the details.

The unusual delay in signing the agreement after the Nov. 5 election had raised concerns among some critics about potential hiccups in government operations or conflicts of interest.This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power, Susie Wiles, Trumps chief of staff, said in a statement.Trump, a Republican, will take office on Jan. 20. His team had rejected entreaties from Democratic President Joe Bidens administration to quickly sign a memorandum of understanding and had objected to some elements of a traditional transition agreement, according to the White House.Under the agreement signed on Tuesday, Trumps team avoided signing a government ethics pledge, saying it has its own ethics plan that will meet the requirements for personnel to seamlessly move into the Trump administration.The separate ethics pledge was later posted to the General Services Administrations website. It included promises that transition team members will avoid conflicts of interests, will safeguard classified information and will disqualify themselves from involvement in any matter if they have engaged in lobbying on the issue in the previous 12 months.However, it did not include a pledge that Trump would avoid conflicts of interest or that he hold only non-conflicting assets, promises in the more standard agreement signed by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate.Trump has a stake valued at $3.76 billion in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which runs his Truth Social platform, as well as stakes in a cryptocurrency business, real estate properties and several foreign deals.The family real estate company, now run largely by Trumps son Eric, owns a portfolio of hotels, golf courses, resorts and New York City office space, retail operations and condominiums.The Trump pledge also did not include a promise to protect whistleblowers on his transition team, a promise in the Harris pledge.SECURITY CLEARANCESSeparately, the Trump transition team has not entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice to allow the FBI to conduct background checks of nominees, and it has not sent the FBI the names of prospective national security personnel who would have access to classified information.A White House official said while a Justice Department agreement has not been signed, progress has been made toward such an agreement.Circumventing background checks would buck a long-established norm in Washington, but the president has the final authority on whom he nominates and picks to conduct background checks.The transition said on Tuesday it already has existing security and information protections built in, which means we will not require additional government and bureaucratic oversight.Trumps team also broke from tradition and did not sign an agreement with the General Services Administration that would provide the use of office space. The team said it did not want to waste taxpayer money by using government offices.White House spokesperson Saloni Sharma said the Biden administration did not agree with the Trump teams decision to forgo signing some of the usual agreements but the White House would go ahead with the transition process to avoid more delays.Trumps team said his transition will use private funding instead of government money to pay for transition costs. The team said donors to the transition will be disclosed to the public.","title":"Trump team signs transition agreement with Biden White House after delays"},{"text":"If world leaders are willing to arrest Netanyahu they should be willing to arrest any war criminal","title":"US Complicity at a Crossroads: ICC Arrest Warrants Demand Accountability | Their entanglement in Israels war makes U.S. leaders vulnerable to legal accountability not just for aiding and abetting crimes, but for direct complicity in their commission."},{"text":"That assumes a rational electorate which isnt the case.

While it might not be the classiest thing slinging mud does have a huge advantage. That advantage being it generates an absurd amount of free advertising via causing coverage nonstop. To put it in perspective Harris was surging in the polls with the convention and Trump was getting little air time. That was when everyone was feeling like Harris had it in the bag. Then the next week Trump did/said something stupid and became the center of the media machine until.... well now. This has a twofold effect. First, since Trump was sucking up airtime (intentionally or not) that made it harder for the Harris team to get it's message across (as late  the Sunday before the election people on TV were saying she didn't have policies despite it being a Google search away). Second, Harris destroyed Trump in fundraising, but ads are expensive so by having all his terrible stuff also have his one liner policies attached the nonstop coverage was effectively free advertising (it was even better than free advertising since it wasn't during a commercial where people tune out or simply walk away/skip).Sure we don't need to stupe all the way to Trump's level, but being nice when the other person isn't will only cost us.

Maybe try stopping oppressing the disadvantaged minority.  Tears are a natural response to hate and discrimination.Secondly, you're really confusing the issues around trans girls in sports:The argument against trans girls in sports is one of ability. SRS has nothing to do with ability. Hormones do, but NOT in pre-pubescent children.  Also NOT in trans teens who are allowed to get on the puberty blockers they want and need, or on older adults who are on HRT. The argument has always been false when it comes to trans women's supposed advantage in sports, and their are medical studies showing this, but we don't even have to go there since this is apparently about pre-pubescent girls. And if your issue is sharing locker rooms, that's an entirely different discussion than the one the nation has been having on sports. Trans rights are still an issue, but also, there's no need to ban trans kids from sports to stop them from being in the locker room, so I have to call BS on this being the real reason for banning trans girls from sports entirely.","title":"Trans People Shouldnt Be Scapegoated for Democrats Failures"},{"text":"I think the examples that you listed are cases where 1 party has diminished  capacity to concent due to grooming (or brain washing in the case of cults)There for can't make informed choices in this  area.

The price gouging is just a theory of economists, but Republicans preached for years that if you raise wages, costs will go up, which was kind if a boogeyman for wage raises.

Destruction is the name of the game.","title":"Kamala Harris Gives Message to Supporters in First Remarks Since Concession"},{"text":"The main problem with your statment is the word \\"evil\\". The root causes of WW1 are based in nationalism and social darwinism. A staunch social darwinist might have the best intentions - yet be the cause for great destruction. Does that make him evil? I honestly dont care. I dont think its fruitful to apply current day moral to the past. Rather, we should ask \\"why did it happen\\".So, what actually did happen?Before WW1, there was a widespread believe that not every nation would keep existing. History was seen as a struggle between people, where only the strongest would survive. This led to a struggle for global influence, and ofc Germany (but also others) participated in this struggle.For Germany specificially, there was a strong sense that they were running out of time. Seeing both of their strong neighbours France and Russia as enemies, Russian industrialization in particular was seen as a threat. While the German army planning staff was optimistic for their prospect about a future war vs. either France or Russia, they thought that soon, a combined offensive of the two could not be held back. They wanted war, as soon as possible.In 1912, von Moltke (the younger) begged the Emperor to start the war - \\"the sooner, the better\\". The same guy also pressured Austrian diplomacy to escalte the war against serbia and called for total mobilization before Russian mobilization was confirmed.In the July Crisis that would eventually lead to WW1, there were many players of which some tried to save the peace, while some called for war. The issue was - nobody was willing to step back. Russia did not want to call off mobiliziation, as they wanted to be prepared for an eventual war against Germany. Austria did not want to let Serbia off the hook, even after they had given in to most of Austrian demands. Serbia did not want to let Austrian officials lead an investigation into the assasination.But in the end, it was Germany who invaded Belgium to attack France and made the regional conflict a continent-wide war.So, while I think it is useless to judge if Germany was \\"evil\\", I still think they have a bigger responsibility for the war than any other nation. Yes, others did not try to avoid war, or at least not hard enough. But Germany or rather, some people from the German gouvenrment tried to activly escalte a diplomatic conflict into a regional war, and then this regional war into a World War.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"Thanks for the info!

They were first to conduct unrestricted naval warfare with their subs. Belgium, naval shelling and sub actions here were all breaking treaties they had signed. They were first to use poison gas. They used collective punishment, execution of civilians, in Belgium and, I think, Russia and Serbia. They bargained for huge territorial gains in brest-litovsk. They gambled on the Zimmerman telegram, They doubled down on their victory against Russia to try and win outright with the German 1918 spring offensive.

The analysis shows Australian emissions are projected to be 42.6% below 2005 levels in 2030. The government has released the new numbers ahead of Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowens Thursday annual climate change statement to parliament. They show total net emissions are projected to be 3% below Australias 10-year planned carbon reduction budget. This means Australia would over-achieve the 2030 target on the budget basis. That compares to 1% above the budget projected last year, when measured using the baseline scenario. If additional measures the government is committed to are taken into account, such as the Future Made in Australia policy to support the development of hydrogen and the critical minerals industry, Australia would achieve a projected 42.7% emissions reduction on 2005 levels. This compares to a projection of 42% in the 2023 emissions projections and 40% in the 2022 emissions projections. Australia is on track to beat its emissions budget by 152 million tonnes over the 10 years to 2030. That would be equivalent to Australias entire electricity sectors emissions in 2024. The government has declined to say whether it will announce Australias emissions reduction target for 2035 before the election. It says it has to wait for advice from the Climate Change Authority. Bowen said of the latest figures: Our robust reforms and pragmatic policies are delivering what weve always said C Australias 43% target is ambitious but achievable. \\"The Coalition cant even name a 2030 target, let alone achieve it, he said. Meanwhile the government on Tuesday announced a review of the National Electricity Market (NEM). It will be conducted by a panel led by Tim Nelson, an associate professor of economics at Griffith University. The inquiry will examine the NEM wholesale market settings to ensure the market promotes investment in firmed renewable energy generation and storage capacity into the 2030s and beyond. This is vital as electricity demand grows and ageing coal fired power stations exit the system, a statement from Bowen said. As the proportion of renewables in the system expands, concern has increased about whether there will be enough firmed power in the system.!ping AUS&amp;ECO","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"if newsom were president we wouldve had a live beheading of trump from madison square garden","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Well its okay, no one expects trolls to have critical thinking skills after all &lt;3","title":"Trump Team Says Israel-Hezbollah Ceasefire deal Brokered by Biden is Actually Trumps Win"},{"text":"Russia has done multiple rounds of draft and even send prisoners to front line as part of their punishment.

Whether a person is gay, straight or bisexual which most studies have now concluded is present from birth can be compared to the \\"hardware\\" of the brain because it proceeds outside influence vs sexual behaviors like kinks which develop from exposure.Statistics show women who have undergone female genital mutilation as children are more likely to enforce female genital mutilation onto other young girls including their daughters.Foot binding started because of one king with a fetish but continued to exist for hundreds of years because of a combination of men finding it attractive and women bending themselves to please along with mother's and grandmother's who had suffered the same fate breaking and binding their daughters feet.A large number of slaves when freed \\"chose\\" to stay and serve their former owner without pay because it was all they ever knewPeople born into cults rarely leave, 90% of Amish choose to stay and women raised in polygamous environments statistically choose polygamous marriage I've known a lot of women who brag about how much they can endure and go without such as agreeing to sex acts they don't want, claiming they're okay with their husband or boyfriend cheating, that they \\"understand\\" when he's abusive. My brother who I don't talk to anymore used to beat his girlfriend but no matter how bad it got she always defended him and she had a strange combination of inferiority in every aspect of life except for the sense of superiority she had when it came to other women she felt weren't as selfless. Values and self esteem are formed by environment and when that environment normalizes and encourages abuse it is coercion not choice.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"Go to the gym.

Germany at the time were quite nationalistic, but the socialist democrats were also making gains. The socialist democrats were critical of the Kaiser and anti-royal sentiments were growing. In private the German hierarchy thought the war would entrench nationalism and kill any gains the socialist democrats had made, they also thought it would galvanise public support for the Kaiser. The reason Germany were viewed as evil, and the reason there were harsh punishments put in place at the end of the war were due to a few things. 1. They invaded Belgium. Thanks to the Treaty of London, Belgium had been internationally recognised as neutral for nearly 100 years. Invading a neutral country is as close to state terrorism that currently exists, I can't really put into words how badly viewed that is. It also dragged Britain into the war that cost a million lives. 2. Rape of Belgium, as the name suggests (official name btw), they did a lot of damage in Belgium. It is a series of war crimes committed by Germany in WW1 which included the mass murder of 24,000 Belgians, 35,000 injured and a further 120,000 people who were mass deported from Belgium and either used as forced labour or forced into military action for Germany where they were mostly used as cannon fodder. They destroyed industrial buildings creating 600,000 unemployed people, they sacked and looted cities, destroyed 25,000 homes and put up an electrified fence near the boarder with the Netherlands which killed another 3000 people who were trying to flee. They also denied the population of its basic needs including food and water. 3. Sham trials and mass executions, in both Belgium and France they would march into towns/cities, accuse people of harbouring fugitives or helping resistance efforts and with either no trial, or a sham trial, prisoners would be executed. A lot of the actions of the Germans in WW1 were kind of a practice run for WW2. Aside from the literal industrial death complexes, everything else was there. Mass murder, mass executions, internment, forced labour etc. You name it, aside from Bergen-Belsen/Auschwitz, there was a lot that was incredibly similar.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_Alliance_(1879)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Crisis","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"I had always learned that whoever gets their information out first controls the narrative, with the caveat that you also can't lie because it's gonna come back and make you look bad.

Germany's plan for the war - the Schlieffen Plan - was based on the assumption that Russia is slow to mobilize and Germany can defeat France before facing Russia. So if Russia starts to mobilize, you have to go to war or you already lost the war. Germany was in a constraint to strike first because of its geography and because of the unfortunate alliance system.Germany was not more or less evil than Russia, Austria or France.

This isnt a video game where you score points for every enemy dead you get. Victory is scored by what strategic goal you have achieved so, to look at who won, we must understand what each sides goal was, their reasons for war to begin with, and so on.Israels goals were as follows: Return the residents to the north and push Hezbollah to the north of the Litani, and stop them from further stockpiling their arms. To be fair, one can argue that the first goal was always going to be achieved, there was never a realistic endpoint where the northern residents were never free to return. They will return eventually. What *really* matters here is pushing Hezbollah north of the Litani and preventing their rearmament, which will change the balance of power in Lebanon massively. If Hezbollah moves north, Israel will have won the war strategically. If they find themselves incapble of rearming, Israel will ave won decisively. If Hezbollah fails to move north and for whatever reason, Israel drops the ball on forcing them, Hezbollah will have scored a pyrrhic victory. I say pyrrhic because fact is they lost every leader. They can be replaced of course, and they will be, but their victory would be defined as so costly, it might as well be a loss. There is absolutely no universe where Hezbollah scores a decisive victory.Hezbollahs goals were as follows. The stated goal was to support the Gaza front. Nasrallah, (Curse him) mustve said a million times now, they will not stop firing until a ceasefire with Gaza. They were slapped so hard, they were forced into conceding this. This stated goal is a failure. They lost. They did not support Gaza, they got themselves beaten up. The next goal was to keep the pressure on the north to scare the residents away. Once the residents return, they will have failed. In other words, the likeliest winner of this war is hands-down Israel. The only way Hezbollah wins a pyrrhic victory is if they stay south, Israel drops the ball on stopping them and everything returns to where it was before.In conclusion, my honest take? Israel won. Hands down.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I didn't know that. Can you tell me where you got this from? I'm interested.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"\\"Save us SWAPO.

First off, I honestly want to say *thank you.* I mean it, from the bottom of my heart. The opinions on this sub regarding this conflict has been very diverse with takes on both sides seeing upvotes depending on the context, but most everyone, on both sides, have been remarkably supportive of me, asking me to remain safe and asking me really good questions regarding the Lebanese political scene and its dynamic with Hezbollah. I appreciate this more than you know. It shows that this subreddit still, (unlike many other subs) still possesses basic human decency for both sides and that matters. Ive been asked a lot how Lebanese view this war and my answer is always the same- they are very diverse. You wont meet too many Lebanese who cheer for Israel, but youll meet many who blame Hezbollah entirely for this war and many who blame Israel entirely, and many things in between. Every Lebanese knows we are at war, and Israel is the one killing our countrymen, and we feel that. But while they are doing it, the fault lies with Hezbollah. The reason is that this is a very nuanced issue and it is 100% *impossible* to polarize this with black/white perspectives.I have also been asked why do you use X source? (X usually stands for Al Jazeera.) Ill explain my journey. At first, I believed I want a diversity of opinions. Naharnet is my go to news source, and it pretty much gives me news from both sides of the war. Haaretz was my Israeli source and has served me well (albeit with an obvious bias against Netanyahu). Then, I wanted a pro-Hezbollah source. But one that was not Al Manar or Mayadeen. (Because those two are so delusional, it makes Trump look awfully pragmatic.) At the beginning of the war, Al Jazeera was what most Lebanese watched to cover it. Al Jazeera was the best pro-Hezbollah source I could get. Why pro-Hezbollah? Because I wanted to get an idea of what they are saying too so my sources could be as diverse as possible. However, near the end of the war, a lot of Lebanese slowly moved away from Al Jazeera simply because the reality facing the country broke through the sheer copium that channel was on, plus a lot of it became less what happened and more analysis which I dont present as news. I moved away too, and used both Haaretz and Naharnet, ignoring Al Jazeera almost totally. If this war restarts, Al Jazeera will not be used often (maybe sometimes if I feel it may provide more context to something.)Below, I will give two companion points to this. My analysis on who won the war and the terms of the ceasefire. I'll ping everything below.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"How on earth is the lesson the Pod Save bros learned from this election is yeah we need more people like Hasan to be influential in the Democratic electorate?He didnt even support Harris!

Its EV market share is about a 10th of Chinas, and EVs account for less than 1 per cent of all cars in use. But sluggish EV sales do not necessarily spell bad news for battery makers. The rise of solar power could give them a new source of growth. Solar power has become the largest source of clean energy in Japan this year. Interest among households has been strong, with more than 3mn residential solar systems installed last year. Demand for a similar number of residential batteries should follow soon. Government measures, including Tokyo requiring all new homes built by large-scale homebuilders from 2025 to have solar panels, are expected to turbocharge sales starting next year. An even bigger boost is expected from virtual power plants, another area of government focus, that will provide further incentive to install residential batteries. Virtual power plants bring together a large number of interconnected home batteries which are linked through a cloud platform and controlled remotely. That allows operators to sell surplus energy from each of the home batteries during power demand spikes, which generates revenue for homeowners participating in the programme. Starting in fiscal 2026, the trade of this type of electricity stored in residential storage batteries will be facilitated in a dedicated market. Tesla has a head start here. It started building virtual power plant in Japan with its Powerwall batteries in 2021. It is positioned to benefit from a push into local retail chains by selling its home battery system through Yamada Denki, Japans largest electronics store chain, in a partnership with the chains operator Yamada Holdings. Yamada has about 1,000 stores nationwide that already sell residential solar systems. Teslas battery will be priced at $13,700, which includes installation costs, making it competitive with local rivals such as Panasonic.  During normal times, household power outages in Japan are extremely rare. But it is not unusual for earthquakes and other disasters to cause widespread outages. The Powerwall home battery, for example, stores 13.5 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is nearly equivalent to the daily power consumption of an average household. Local companies Toshiba, Itochu and Hitachi are among those betting on energy storage systems for growth. There is much potential in this relatively overlooked sector: the global battery energy storage market will reach as much as $150bn by 2030, estimates McKinsey. Falling prices of battery cells should help wider adoption of home batteries. As EV sales growth slows this year, energy storage will become increasingly important to the top lines of EV and battery makers.!ping ECO&amp;JAPAN","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"But why kill him?","title":"The CIA and KGB Both Tried to Blackmail This World Leader With Sex Tapes.
