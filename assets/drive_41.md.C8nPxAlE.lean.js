Some differ from each other. To paint everything as black or white is disingenuous. Some reluctantly vote Trump because they arent a fan of the Democrats policies.Yes, America before was heavily a European descended Christian country. Easter and Christmas were very popular and front center. Even buildings in New York City lit up their buildings with the cross during Easter of 1954. This unified culture helped establish trust between strangers and a well self regulated society. Thats what they want, a unified culture that promotes higher values and morals. Im generalizing but many see what we have today and think it pales in comparison to what it could be.For the all white cast, back then whites were far more numerous than they are now due to mass illegal and legal immigration. They represented what the majority of the country was then. Now we went to the other extreme when like 90% of advertisements we see is just black people, no Asian or blonde white guy. I exaggerated the number but people have become so fixated on representation that it became ironically racist and insulting. Lord of the Rings for example is a story inspired by European paganism and Christianity. Nobody cared it was an all white cast. It was beloved and still is to this day for many reasons. To say it isnt great because it doesnt have different ethnic groups as actors is just petty. MAGA Republicans dont want people to be check mark boxes or forced into private expressions of art in whatever form.Slurs arent nice to say, we get that but it isnt the end of the world if someone does say it. Again, we changed one extreme for another which annoyed people to the point of saying slurs even more just to get shock value from people. What people want is to go back to emotional security and maturity, with sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. Now we teach kids that theyre at the mercy of what others say. And to be honest, I miss the Call of Duty lobbies which was filled with so many slurs that it became comical and legendary in its own right. I still remember the riot shield video and laugh about it to this day.In regard to immigration, I feel personally strong about this. Im from Arizona and noticed how my home state changed for the worse when we let anybody in. Citizens became second to illegal migrants and the culture of my home becomes more foreign. I am a stranger in my own community when illegal migrants barge into shops so they can sell their tamales, blast their mariachi music in the middle of the night, refuse to learn English, and act like an entitled dick. Everything I said is from experience. I want to live in America, not South America. Citizens shouldnt also have to compete against illegal migrants for jobs, resources, housing, or space. MAGA Republicans understand this at different levels but the gist is the same. Many legal immigrants are also MAGA.Im upset Reddit keeps dumbing down everything just to make MAGA look bad as if there isnt some truth or validity to what they desire.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"And font forget  I HATE TAYLOR SWiFT!!!

Trump has them thinking mass deportation of immigrants is in their best interest so they don't care what happens to them; they're pro mass deportation.When judging past individuals I think it's fair to judge them based on an assessment of why they did something that we consider immoral.

I disagree and Trump is now complaining about the violent rhetoric of the left.I've never in my life condoned any act of violence ever, nor have I ever in anyway advocated for violence.  But I'll stand up to defend free speech, and if you don't understand the standards for protected speech in the US, look up the Brandenburg vs Ohio SCOTUS case. The state has a monopoly on violence but speech is protected and threats of violence have to be actionable and imminent to be considered illegal.My Jewish father in law believes that Israel is not commiting genocide, but believes that the chant used in antiwar rallies (\\"from the river to the sea...\\") is a genocidal chant. His opinion is bad, and like you he seeks to discredit a group as violent based on a chant at an anti government protest. I have no patience for that type of nonsense. Again, democrat rhetoric towards Trump is violent. It's protected speech. Are they stoking flames? Yeah. But they're allowed to.

There were no rights because man had not invented the concept &amp; more importantly man had not invented the institutions like courts &amp; law that enshrine &amp; enforce those rights.The only inherent law that predates those which man invented is *might makes right*. The first right was the divine right to rule.  What was right &amp; moral is what your betters told you to do. All those people we judge so harshly in history were born into an unjust world &amp; on average worked to make it more just, often along the only path that was possible. People will condemn history for a law that lets you take a slave &amp; beat them when the perverse reality is taking slaves was an established norm &amp; those ugly laws were passed to limit what people were doing, not empower them.The law didn't let people marry 10 year olds, it stopped people from marrying 9 year olds. Voting is nice coin to consider it's other side. *No one* could vote, then some people invented the idea &amp; coerced a bunch of poor people into fighting &amp; dying so powerful people could have the privilege. Those people took a step forward towards distributing power across a society. They established &amp; the institutions &amp; framework that allowed more &amp; more people suffrage with less and less political capital (i.e. blood), eventually it reached the point where just a vote was needed &amp; there was no one left to grant the vote.Are they oppressors &amp; villains because they didn't continue on into a utopia? Because they only dipped a toe into uncharted waters &amp; didn't do something that was impossible at the time which we haven't achieved either? Most of the people cast as villains never took away a right from anyone &amp; in truth did the opposite.TLDRPeople look at history backwards. We didn't fall from grace we dragged ourselves out of the muck &amp; mire without any guidance, assistance or a plan, just our good nature. If someone made the world they left a safer &amp; more just place than the world they were born into how can you justify condemning them? The proof of the pudding is in the tasting. If a bunch of abolitionists fell through a blackhole into 2024 they would be unforgivable racists &amp; bigots by today's standards.

You can think about it like computer code. Modern programmers do not code in 1s and 0s. They use programing languages which are composed of functions built upon functions built upon functions. Scripting works much the same way. It is easy to build a powershell script to automatically create user accounts from a spreadsheet. This is because the logic of PowerShell modules like \\"Add-ADUser\\" are pre-defined and well tested. I can just write some logic to iterate through each line of the spreadsheet and feed it to \\"Add-ADUser\\" as an input, and voila: the user accounts are created.Building something like that from the first principles of binary logic would be a life's work. You'd have to program your own OS, directory structures, programing language, ect from scratch. Philosophy is much the same way. A philosophical debate about religion is much easier if I can just cite the Kalam Cosmological argument rather than having to explain it to you from first principles.A 6 page philosophy paper full of dense references could be easily grasped by another academic philosopher. Meanwhile it would take an entire book to explain the same argument to lay people if starting from first principles.

Do moral facts exist?  I might be inclined to investigate that myself, but I also might just need to know what the current consensus, or at least dominant, view is, so that I can get on with whatever I was doing.

They had a lab that mostly just worked on the smells.  To do that they had to take incredibly sensitive nosed people and train their vocabulary otherwise people might have good ideas, but couldn't communicate them with others because their words for things were different than others.  It took years to get to the point of being able to be productive as a member of a team in the lab, so rigorous was the training process.  You didn't \\"learn to smell\\", you learned to _talk about smell_ and to do so in a way that facilitated rich and precise communication.You're just masturbating intellectually if you don't do the the work to see the context - and the shared context - of the knowledge in a field that _already exists_.  If you want to just \\"wax philosophical\\" then join debate or take an argumentation class.  But...philosophy is about the generation of new ideas and the creation of knew knowledge.  You can't do that without knowing _the current knowledge_ .  It's just _boring_ after you study philosophy to talk about philosophy with people who don't know the contemporary knowledge.  It's interesting _to them_ and everyone thinks they have interesting ideas of course.Socratic style discussion isn't \\"philosophy\\", it's a method of teaching.  It's a tool one may want to engage in philosophy, but it's got serious limitations.  You don't learn about current knowledge and thought on any topic via the socratic method - you first learn the basics.

Although they are old (from the time of the Ancient Greeks) they didn't evolve into their modern forms until the Enlightenment. If you look outside the West, ethics can be extremely different because the schools of thought are so different. It then becomes a case of do whether or not morals are relativistic. If they are, then you can't just judge against the time/era, you have to judge against the school of thought that they come from.Your argument is presented as a linear progression \\"bad ethics to good ethics\\" over time.

Usually, when doctors harvest eggs, they try to get a bunch. Then fertilization process fertilizes many eggs, that way you can have several viable embryos. Then you implant some of them to see if it's successful. If not, you implant more. Lots of women who do IVF need several rounds to have a successful pregnancy. Also, if they plan to conceive more than 1 child that way, it's nice to already have the embryos rather than having to go through everything again.All that to say, there's frequently leftover embryos when a couple tries IVF. After the couple is done having kids, those embryos get often destroyed (there's other ways you can deal with them, but ultimately lots get destroyed).Lots of pro-life people think that's basically genocide.

There was a time long ago when people carried guns without permits wherever they wanted. And open carry was a normal thing. That time devolved into the modern era and had a lul in which everyone needed a permit. We are now regaining some of that freedom. As an illustration in the \\"wild West\\". Post civil war era almost everyone walked around with a gun. And even leading up to prohibition we could own whatever we wanted in guns, including Tommy guns. That era is long past and now full auto has to be registered, with a tax stamp and you can't buy them new only existing stock basically. The problem is there is no single era that we can point too. Because conservatives want 1910 gun laws, modern equal rights, basically dont ask dont tell on sexuality. Schools with 1950s morals and education standards but the integration of today. That does not make the ideal any less valid. It just means it is a combination of different eras. And the ideas themselves are not incomparable they just have not existed together because of the flow of progress.

In other words, we need to make a distinction between knowing that people were a product of their time while still recognizing that these actions are wrong. The social norms of the time explain how people were capable of such immoral things...but it doesn't justify the evil in and of itself. We have to recognize if we are looking at the issue from a historical anthropology perspective or a philosophical perspective...but they are frequently conflated.This may seem like a minor distinction but it actually comes up a lot. One relevant example is statues of famous people... often times this idea of subjective morality is used to defend keeping statues of problematic people. Saying morals were different back then isn't a very compelling argument to keep up a statue of a conquistador in our contemporary life. Instead we shouldn't be afraid to criticize and question the ways we idolize them in the context of today (whether it be a statue, or a holiday, or whatever). Doing so kind of implies that their immorality can be ignored or excused. In other words, if the question is \\"is this person a good idol or example or someone we should celebrate today\\" we can confidently say no. The other reason you already touched on, which is that in a lot of cases \\"what was normal\\" was often far more controversial than we give credit. Saying \\"morals were different back then\\" may very well be simplifying or normalizing behavior that was not, in fact, moral even by historical standards. This is especially relevant with US slavery and yet that excuse is still used all the time. It's misleading more often than not.

So why on earth would I vote for someone I find unfit for office instead of someone who does seem to speak to most of what matters to me, and does so consistently, regardless of the odds of winning?It is better to vote for what you want and not get it than to vote for what you don't want and get it. --Eugene V.

First off, I have to say that when the IRS went after certain groups, shredded hard drives and lied about it to Congress, I did effectively nothing.  I made remarks on social media, but otherwise I did nothing and the IRS fully got away with what they did.TBH, I really don't know what I COULD have done.  Make T shirts and hats, talk about it on social media, write letters, make phone calls ??  What difference would that have made?-There was a lecture quite a while back where they were raising funds to have targeted lawsuits against the government.  In this case, the targeted lawsuit would serve a few purposes:1. flush out traps.  Vet people that are making claims because the Left will make false claims in order to bait people in so that they can discredit the entire Right.2. pick from the lawsuits the ones that have merit and go as hard as you can against whoever is at fault, like the government.This is the same concept as going after phone scammers that say things like \\"we are from Microsoft support\\" as they try to defraud you.  The key is that you understand their game.  It's all about filtering out 99.9% of the callers so that you can dupe the 0.1% of them.  So instead of hanging up, you keep them on the phone as long as you can.This costs them time and their model doesn't work if they have to spend 10X the resources in order to filter people out.With the targeted lawsuits, you go after government abuse and make it very expensive for the government to abuse the people.This idea came from the lecture where they found that it was very, very effective to go after the government or businesses because others would see that this path of abuse is too expensive.It's the same concept as putting people in jail for a crime.  When word get out that there's a 10X higher chance of getting caught and going to jail, all the sudden people start obeying the law more.I'm actually working on getting things togehter to do just this.I'm not saying I'm above others in the past, but I am doing something now.What others should be doing is looking for things like this that they can support.There's other people that are doing undercover videos to prove things about government abuse.  These can be very effective.What I want is a platform for regular people (like me) to be able to bring to the masses, proof of abuse and targeted lawsuits against the government.These things should be vetted so that we don't have people grifting off of others.  That's one of the things I want to do is have a lawyer ID the people making claims so that we know certain things are actually true...  and yes, I am the victim of government abuse and that's one of the reasons for wanting to do this.","title":"Woke Liberal Fascists are the real racists"},{"text":"Maybe he was aiming for a nearby school.

Most stories you know from the past are stories from the upper social classes. Lower social classes had a completely different morality. Lower classes didn't own slaves, lower classes didn't start wars, lower classes didn't participate in politics. When you say we're judging people from the past through the glasses of today, who are we talking about? I can guarantee you that Ghenghis Khan wasn't considered a moral person, not even by the Mongols own standards. However GK was powerful enough that he didn't have to care about the opinions of anyone, and no one could call him to court to answer for his crimes.The fundamentals of morality have always been exactly the same, we just intepreted them to fit our worldview. You can read the code by Hammurabi, or ancient buddhist or taoist texts, and you'll find the same kind of morality that we today have. What you're doing is excusing people for being lazy, for knowing better but saying \\"well no one is doing better, so why should I?\\".You'll never convince me that there was a time where people truly believed that ownership of another human was a moral thing, but they needed laborers and since there was no law or social penalty against slavery people just went along with it. Again, owning slaves was something for the upper classes, and they kept doing it because it was socially accepted where they lived. It doesn't mean that morality wasn't present, it was there, and it was correct, it's just that those people in those days couldn't be called to court to answer for their crimes.People knew that what they were doing was wrong, that's why they needed to go to church that often to \\"cleanse their sins\\". Only a true psychopath would not understand the difference between right or wrong, everyone else has a build-in morality meter.

Why are these assassins all such horrible aims? Why are they using an outdated assassination method? And what is the motivation? It seems like the only person who benefits from these attempts is donald trump because it allows him to rile up his base and make his opponents look desperate.But the democrats supposedly already rigged an election against him, so if that's true, why not just rig it again instead of killing him? If he had been killed, his political opponents would have been the prime suspects, so why would they do that knowing they would be the first to get investigated and risk losing all of their support? And if it's just random people trying to do this, how are they able to get into trumps vicinity so easily? Why is his security so bad? How come he didn't take extra precautions after the first \\"attempt\\"? To me, trump has the biggest motive and the most logical explanation is that trump is the one setting this all up and he will use these so called attempts to manipulate his base into another insurrection, but this time they'll bring their guns and then the government will declare martial law and take said guns which will likely throw the u.s. into a civil war, creating the perfect storm for taking American sovereignty and paving the way for a new world order under a one word government.","title":"The party that calls the Right \\"conspiracy theorists\\" are also saying Trump staged two assassination attempts"},{"text":"I think something needs to be done about companies, investors, and stockholders wanting to squeeze maximum profit out of everything at any and all costs - which usually means at the expense of people.

Supporting Trump would get you the same death threats, just from a different population of people. On top of that your entire career would be at risk because of your industry.That said, I completely agree about the social media statements. Its distasteful and not fitting of a public official.

In a joint video post on Instagram, the Grammy and Oscar-winning duo celebrated National Voter Registration Day by encouraging their followers to register, vote early and to vote for the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket. We are voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy, Eilish said. Finneas added, We cant let extremists control our lives, ours freedoms and our future. The only way to stop them and the dangerous Project 2025 agenda is to vote and elect Kamala Harris. Vote like your life depends on it, because it does, Eilish concluded. Eilish and Finneas are the latest music stars to throw their weight behind Harris in recent weeks. Perhaps the biggest celebrity endorsement for the Harris campaign came from Taylor Swift, who released a statement in support of Harris shortly after the first presidential debate between Harris and Donald Trump. Swift noted that Harris fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. Hillary Clinton recently gave an interview in which she spoke in support of celebrity endorsements during the election as fanbases need to be motivated to vote. Clinton said that Swift specifically brings an unusual impact to an endorsement. Her fanbase is so intense and incredibly influenced by her, Clinton explained. Shes a singer who charts the course of her life which they relate to as their own lives, but shes also someone who stood up to a guy who groped her and stood up to get her music back from someone she thought had illegitimately had taken it from her. She has demonstrated a resilience in taking control over her own life that sends a strong message. Im a huge admirer. I think [her endorsement] has real impact.","title":"Billie Eilish and Finneas Endorse Kamala Harris for President Because We Cant Let Extremists Control Our Lives, Our Freedoms and Our Future"},{"text":"Haha.

Describing January sixth as you do and even outright creating a false choice between \\"democracy\\" and Authoritarianism. The truth is America has specifically been leaning authoritarian by having Congress vote and pass expansion of executive branch authorities. They refuse to pass legislation that is not tied to defense spending and overall fail to govern. Since the 90s the Democrats sold out the middle class as they were the party of unions and pro government regulation. They joined hand in hand with the Republicans to give the flyover states and their middle class the middle finger. They then pretend to not know why they have lost their labor coalition. These communities deteriorated and were waved off as the \\"economy\\" was great except where it wasn't and there was mass population movement to cities and all of those families pushed their kids to college so they would have a good job since they knew the old trades were not doing well in their home states. This started the mismatch of skills and the skyrocketing of college tuition. Also there has been increasing consolidation of American corporations and corporate political spending. These politicians are far more responsive to corporations than they ever were to their constituents. This leaves a very sour taste in the mouth of the average American. There is also a high percentage of politicians with legal backgrounds and high end corporate lawyers who have a certain reputation leading to what we have now. An American populace who despise their own political apparatus and largely do not trust the institutions that for at least the last 30 years have been betraying them to corporate interests. So given most people hate both this explains how prior to trump the US had record low turn out for elections. Trump appears and does only two things: first acknowledges the American carnage of flyover states and second that yes it is rigged and I know that because I am one of them. Many see Trump as the only honest politician and use the devil I know methodology for their choice. Kamala has not been democratically nominated at any point in the process of becoming the Democratic nominee so who exactly is against democracy? She also has a history of flip flopping on issues which mean many people have no idea what she will do. All in all your take is grossly over simplified and insulting to millions of Americans so respectfully keep to your own country's politics and just be happy you are not a part of our current circus. The millions of Trump voters are not the caricatures you make them out to be as only one candidate has had attempts made on their life in spite of the rhetoric.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"It sounds like the dems are perfect for you.

Tariffs provide an incentive against domestic citizens and companies buying foreign goods at cheaper prices because tariffs increase the price of those goods, leading domestic companies and citizens to possibly choose domestic products more often. Theoretically, this drives up business for domestic companies by reducing the money sent out of the country. It would make goods more expensive, as do sales taxes, but this is not the only effect of a tariff. Tariffs also increase the profits of domestic companies and citizens who produce goods subject to the new tariffs. To boil it down to a sales tax on consumers is disingenuous. Sales taxes go only to the government first, which then decides how to allocate the money. Tariffs go to the government when consumers engage in the behavior the government is trying to disincentivize, but they go to American companies when they are effective. Sales taxes have a fundamentally different purpose and operate differently.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"I'm sorry, I think I may be having a brain fart because I can't follow your line of argumentation enough to be able to respond.","title":"CMV: Reddit mods should not be able to remove people's comments without informing them that they have been removed."},{"text":"Even if this were a democrat and an actual assassination attempt.

Gaza You're right, one party is slightly better on Gaza and it's the party that hasn't been genociding them for the last year, I have no illusion that the Republicans would stop the genocide, but the fact is is that the genocide has been completely and totally done by the Democrats with Republican support but the Republicans are not in power in the white house so the full blame rests on the Democrats for this. Trump has been mildly critical of Israel at least, acknowledging that they're losing the PR battle around the world. When he says that they should finish the job he means that they should just end it because it's causing a huge amount of backlash against Israel and the United States.

We are not at the pinnacle of human society.To assume the idea that morality \\"evolves\\" is already to assume in good measure that your view is true. There are ethicists who think morality is more like science, in that we don't so much create it or that it's something that develops alongside us but is something pre-existing us that we discover. This could most obviously be the case if e.g. the source of morality is some God or gods, but there are also other arguments out there. There are even arguments that don't necessarily rely on positing objective moral facts -- such as there some moral rules that it just always makes logical and rational sense to hold. Here's a simple and fairly uncontroversial one: the idea that murder is wrong exists in almost every society and time. What *counts* as a murder changes, but some prohibition against some subset of killing is present basically everywhere. Why? Well, civilized society can hardly get off the ground if we feel we can just kill whoever we want whenever we want. Logically, a moral rule against certain kinds of killing makes sense regardless of time or place.Assumption 2) people alive today who are judged as \\"good\\" based on current standards are, for the most part, genuinely doing their best to adhere to their own moral compass.I don't really see any reason to think this is true. What society judges is hardly a barometer for what is actually the case -- we only need to look at the moral esteem people like Harvey Weinstein were held in because he appeared to have the \\"right\\" views on most topics.Assumption 3) is is difficult or impossible to know how those standards will deviate from future ethical standards and/or apply ethical principals from outside of our own scope of understanding.One response to this is that it doesn't really make sense to try and think of ethical principles outside of our own scope of understanding. Morality is, arguably, meant to help *us* guide our behaviour, and so it may make sense to judge moral rules based on how they help us guide our behaviour (and, in conjunction with my response to assumption 1, these rules might be largely universal).","title":"CMV: \\"Morals were different back then.\\" Is actually a pretty good argument much of the time."},{"text":"Not sure the point of this.

I think the problem is we created so much wealth through neoliberalism that it distracted us from the basic principles that helped us generate all the wealth in the first place. In my view, the neoliberal policies during the time of the Bill Clinton administration had the most significant global economic impact and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.

But even if you're far left it's important to know what's going on so you don't become out-of-touch. Pop culture and left-wing politics have always been closely linked. A lot of left-wing stuff finds its way into popular culture from the margins and spreads from there. I'm not saying you have to keep up with every new artist/show/movie/book/etc, I'm just saying it's good to at least know names and what's popular. It's bad to be completely disconnected. If that's not you, then don't worry about it.Then there's the economic side of things, which might be why you're understandably alienated from modern pop culture. If you look at what's happened with the film industry, for example, you'll see that there's now a focus on acquiring IPs (think of the Marvel movies) and creating huge franchises rather taking risks on stand-alone films and stuff that's experimental or niche. Capitalism is wreaking havoc on creative industries, but most people wouldn't know it if they just look at box office or streaming numbers.

In silent removal, mods have the option to delete a comment or port without notifying the user.  There are legitimate reasons why silent removal might be appropriate:1). Post or comment hits spam filter. You dont want bots to learn how to bypass the spam filter.  Some legitimate users get sucked in to a spam filter, but the alternative is  a Reddit even more flooded with bots. 2). User has already had comments deleted and continues to engage.  Maybe it doesnt rise to the level of a ban, so the mods just delete the comment. 3). Judgement call of mods. I think this is the most important one. Mods need to be able to make judgement calls. They have very limited time and if they sense that a person is going to be a troll, retaliate against other users, or cause other problems on a sub, they might just delete.  Obviously this is open to bad judgement and even mods who are just lazy or whatever.  But Reddit is a big place. Users can find other subs. I would propose instead that Reddit requires all subs to include in their rules whether mods engage in silent deletion (and a brief explanation of when they do it) so that users can decide if they want to participate in the community.  I think that is the right balance of transparency while still giving mods tools to manage trolls.

So they charge black prole to make the difference Ex: if bread cost ten cents in 1940s on a salary of 20,000 a year  and then cost 11 cents on a salary of 40,000 thats a net economic improvement. Lets say for blacks it was 10,000 year for their salary . What Im saying is in the Deep South they charged my grandfather 18 cents for same bread , paid him  10,000  in 1950s . His salary stayed the same while the cost of bread went up artificially so that stores could get net profits . This was a huge problem with segregation that no one ever mentions . As time  went out capitalist realized they could raise prices faster on black stores with no recourse .

Keep in mind Gaza only has a population a little over 2 million people.So we see Russia trying to minimize civilian casualties, US just doesn't give a fuck, and Israel trying to go full Nazi.","title":"BREAKING: We won in Georgia!

Trump has made so many comments that mirror Fascist WWII Germany and Italy, while praising authoritarian leaders of Hungary (Turkey), NK, China, and Russia. He claims to have big plans for his term but refuses to explain any of them, only offering deflection and more fear speech. After 9 YEARS and 70 attempts to kill Obamacare, the only alternative he offers is \\"concepts of a plan\\". He constantly lies (over 30k lies told in just his 4 years in office), he denies any connection to P2025 despite ~30 people, former members of his administration and other people he's worked with over the years, contributing to this extreme and regressive plan. His own VP pick JD Vance wrote the forward for the book. And after being asked and informed about it by countless interviewers and average voters, for him to still say he knows nothing about it is either a bald-faced lie or an example of his complete ineptitude and inability to govern. He's directly caused his base to be riled up against so many who spoke out against him or otherwise shared a different opinion (or simply just for being brown and foreign), to the point of actual physical violence resulting in actual death and actual arrests. Let's not forget the time he called for the execution of the Central Park 5. He's ostensibly sold state secrets to foreign actors, conspired against the will of the American people to overturn a free and fair election, and publicly requested the Russians to interfere with that very same election. He's pulled the country out of international climate accords and signaling his intention to dissolve NATO. He refused to disavow the KKK and neo-Schmazi supporters and actually invited at least one to the white house for dinner. He's raped women and openly bragged about doing it. And this is the short list.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nIf you're going to do things that threaten democracy, then you should expect to be called a threat to democracy. We are absolutely allowed to call him out on it, despite those who support him being all sad about it.","title":"Youre Allowed to Call Trump a Threat to Democracy"},{"text":" \\"What video?\\" The OPs video in the original post. You targeted my argument but not the OPs post of misleading lies. Why is this? IOh, you want me to critique OP's video? Sure, but other people already did that and I've criticized it in other posts before, so I didn't feel like my criticism added much to the conversation at this point.It's a combination of inflammatory rhetoric and political speech stitched together to make it all seem inciteful. I don't see most of it as being \\"violent\\", but it is largely calling for civil unrest targeting Trump and the right. I personally think that democracy is supposed to have some degree of civil unrest and that freedom of speech is important, so I don't condemn it except that it's coming from corporate mouthpieces.  HOWEVER, I do largely think it's hypocritical to condemn Trump and the right for \\"violent rhetoric\\" when I don't see the \\"liberal\\" political establishment as any different. I did not cry because I had been falsely attributed characteristics though but if you just want fake outrage we can do that too.I set up a strawman that I used to generalize \\"people like you\\". I was not trying to twist your words, but I  was comparing your argument to others I see coming from Kamala supporters. I don't think my points were right wing, they're just critiques I have of some particular liberal tactics and talking points I've noticed. You're right that I have no idea if you personally are guilty of them and that really wasnt the intent of purpose of my argument. I have shown proof that Trump does his weave and this is part of his weave. You have not disproved this. If you think you have show me how you disproved this.Where is this \\"weave\\" talking point from? I hear this exact argument all over reddit and it's clever but definitely not a concept you thought up on your own.Ok, I've looked it up and it's how he's framed his ADHD style of communication where he gets distracted by tangents. He thinks it it like a curb your enthusiasm or Seinfeld episode, but his detractors see it as narcissistic rambling (which really aren't mutually exclusive). To disrupt the lives of immigrants? Are you asking me? Is that the obvious conclusion to you?

Also, spousal rape was a contradiction in terms.The MAGA right yearns for one, the other or both.

Project 2025 is a revision to that agenda tailored to a second Trump term. It would give the President unilateral powers, strip civil rights, worker protections, climate regulation, add religion into policy, outlaw porn and much more. The MFL has been around since 1980, Reagan implemented 60% of its recommendations, Trump 64% - proof. 70 Heritage Foundation alumni served in his administration or transition team. Project 2025 is quite extreme but with his obsession for revenge hell likely get past 2/3rds adoption.The Heritage Foundation already writes bills for Republicans to submit. Thats how there have been over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills submitted to states since January 1st, 2024. Theyre the ones writing these bills and getting the GOP to pass them. They were also the ones who wrote Texass pornography ID law that was passed. They have been behind abortion, contraception, and anti-drug laws, too. And Harrison Butker? They were the ones who sponsored him up on stage as Butker works with them frequently. And lets not also forget that The Heritage Foundation has frequent confrences that showers GOP politicians with lavish gifts while teaching them how to create right-wing propaganda and craft bills against LGBTQ+ people, abortion, and everything else.There is no might. It will happen. The Heritage Foundation controls the GOP.Theres always a right-winger trying to make people think Project 2025 is no big deal. No, its not just a think tank, its The Heritage Foundation. They have massive influence over right-wing politicians. Ronald Reagan took direction from them, and Donald Trump let them pick his administration. Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Scott Pruitt, and Jeff Sessions were some of the people they picked.Back in 2022, The Heritage Foundation completely reversed its position on helping Ukraine. Most Republicans followed suit. They have a lot of power and a lot of Republicans licking their boots. Its definitely something to worry about.\\nHere are all the connections between Project 2025 and Trump statements.Christian Nationalismhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/us/evangelicals-trump-christianity.htmlhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-hell-defend-christianity-from-radical-left-that-seek-to-tear-down-crosseshttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-end-church-restrictions-politics-1234728218/Canceling Climate Changehttps://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2022/03/21/on-fox-donald-trump-calls-climate-change-a-hoax-in-the-1920s-they-were-talking-about-global-freezing/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-climate-change-global-warming-b2459167.htmlhttps://www.npr.org/2020/09/14/912799501/i-don-t-think-science-knows-visiting-fires-trump-denies-climate-changeControl of the Federal Governmenthttps://newrepublic.com/post/174370/inside-trump-fascist-plan-control-federal-agencies-winshttps://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2019-04-23/trump-seeks-more-control-of-fed-sec-and-other-agencieshttps://thehill.com/policy/finance/324408-the-19-federal-agencies-trump-wants-to-eliminate/Use the DoJ and FBI to arrest critics and opponentshttps://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-has-threatened-dozens-of-times-to-use-the-government-to-target-political-enemies/Fire the Civil Servicehttps://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/0507/trump-biden-schedule-f-civil-servicehttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-plan-gut-civil-service-triggers-pushback-by-unions-democrats-2023-12-22/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/donald-trump-civil-servants-schedule-fReplace civil servants with loyalistshttps://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/03/distressing-republicans-eyeing-2024-race-support-plot-purge-federal-workershttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-civil-servants-plan-loyalists-b2132020.htmlhttps://www.project2025.org/personnel/Mass Deportationshttps://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/trump-immigration-what-matters/index.htmlhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-donald-trumps-2024-vow-deport-millions-migrants/story?id=110469177https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyxSA_udawkMake abortion illegalhttps://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/index.htmlhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/16/abortion-rights-line-if-trump-administration-gets-4-more-years/5779444002/https://apnews.com/article/health-donald-trump-ap-top-news-politics-election-2020-1210f9012eec9818b25ac9abad46b955Canceling transgender rightshttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-attacks-transgender-rights-video-1234671967/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/donald-trump-transgender-protections.htmlhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article277322158.html\\nCommenting this for visibility.

She seems like a normal person with a sense of humor and it's even more glaring when you watch what Trump says and does... he has a kind of sense of humor - but it's all meanness or grievances... he sometimes appears joyful, but it's always at someone else's expense... he *never* seems actually happy.

I've never been a fan of Donald Trump (even when he was just a celebrity businessman), and I consider myself a 2010-era liberal. I was a happy Obama-er, and a mega Bush-hater. The issue is that as politics began polarizing during Obama's second term, then exploded under Trump, and then further divided under Biden (not pointing fingers, only describing the *timeline* of political division), it became less and less acceptable for people to be *moderates*. The result? Because the direction of the public sentiment has been towards the left (and far-left social ideals), moderate liberals from as recent as 10 years ago have been pushed enough to the right that *some* of them are now considered \\"conservative\\" even though they *hate hate hate* oligarchies like the one Trump would bring about. It's just that as opposed to the oligarchy, they are even *more terrified* of a totalitarian central government. A lot of the MAGA crowd that I've met in the last year or so are surprisingly liberals who are terrified of losing their freedoms with a democrat-led, but still *authoritarian* government. These are liberals who no longer believe that democrats are still being *liberal.*The so-called \\"MAGA\\" movement is no longer reserved for people with the beliefs you outlined above. It now includes the bulk of those who want a return to an America with \\"1st-Obama-Term\\" assumptions:1. Freedom of Speech intact (without using \\"but not consequences\\" as a cop-out to enforce a conflict-theory sociological framework upon the populace). Jokes are allowed and people are allowed to laugh at them; if you are offended go away. There are no behaviors like collective shouting down/\\"cancelling\\" of others and trying to get people fired for their opinions, etc. For those of you who say, \\"Those are also protected speech,\\" You'd be simultaneously legally correct *and also* intellectually dishonest. The whole spirit and purpose of free speech is a mutual social contract to *further and continue* the **practice of disagreeing** in order to discover the mutually agreeable truth. It is a right that requires all parties to keep the avenues of conversation open without *interference*. Legality (and even constitutionality, to some extent) are *not the primary issues* here; it is the **social contract** at stake, one that abides by a \\"gentleman's agreement\\" to allow opinions to contend *directly* and equally without outside interference. The *purpose* of this is to ensure that the legitimacy of ideas is determined through social *mutuality*, not tyranny. Using arguments like collective social consequences that *technically* still abide by \\"Free Speech\\" but do not serve the *intended function* of free speech is *not honoring* the spirit and purpose of *Free Speech*. 2. Speaking of the social contract, they want one that still largely boils down to, \\"You do you, me do me; if me and you no agree, then we go separately\\" \\\\~ 3. INDIVIDUALISTIC SOCIETY, with no hints of collectivism in sight. I don't care if it's called socialism or communism or poor-people-unite-ism. They are all forms of collectivism, which is not (and should not) be the structure of American society/government. Each individual is the most fundamental *unit*, and each unit is equally free. We are a country of *individual citizens*, not groups. This *also* means we all agree to just take things at face value for most issues and solve them on a case-by-case basis, rather than trying to break society down into tiny, marginalized pieces to fit a victim/oppressor group axiomatic framework.4. A prosperous America that is still *America first*. Decreasing importation and increasing production. Instead of a unilateral push for *higher minimum wages,* a fight for *buying power* instead.

Not so much \\"Cold-War Patriotism,\\" but *at least* a patriotism that still believes in the same basic premise of an, \\"English Common Law,\\" John Locke-esque America.

Prior to that point, concepts like Constitutional Carry didn't need to exist, because carrying a firearm was just normal almost everywhere in the country.This is untrue:Under the gun rights view, open carry embodied the widely understood scope of an essential liberty. Therefore, their argument goes, good cause carry laws are inconsistent with the historical tradition of firearms regulation and thus constitutionally suspect.  [The problem for gun rights advocates is that they have produced virtually no evidence that this theory is true. There is no historical record supporting the claim that individuals at the Founding or the time of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment openly carried guns in populated areas during their day-to-day activities.15 Instead, the historical record shows that openly carrying firearms was not simply unusual, it was virtually unheard of in populated areas and would have been viewed as acceptable only in limited circumstances, when a person faced a particularized threat to themselves or their property.16 The norm for carry outside of the context of hunting or militia service was concealed  a decision necessitated by the strong social stigma attached to openly carrying arms. This was true in the South, where the carrying of concealed weapons was endemic even though nearly every Southern state specifically prohibited concealed carry.](https://lawreview.sf.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk15026/files/media/documents/55-5_Frassetto.pdf)Can you provide any history papers that support \\"carrying a firearm was just normal almost everywhere in the country.\\"Abortion - In the industrial era abortion existed, but was relatively uncommon. That's because it had a death rate for the mother of about 30%.You are no doubt ascribing a single type of medical procedure to any type of abortion; which includes the use of abortifacients.  Again, can you provide any sources on the historical practice of abortion?  Case in point; one of the Conservative Justices said in repealing Roe V Wade that \\"Abortion was not part of the original USA's Culture\\" despite the fact that, for example in Colonial USA under english law, anything done to induce an abortion prior to the Fetus \\"Quickening\\" was a ok.Conservatives just don't care about LGBT issues, really. Do whatever you want to any other adult you want, in your own bedroom.Excuse me, did you miss the entire period of USA where conservatives were against Gay Marriage?  Or are you saying Conservatives are only Ok with LGBT people as long as they keep their identity and sexuality hidden away in their bedrooms?Furthermore, look at a [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_laws_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Sodomy_laws_in_the_United_States.svg) where Sodomy is still on the books as being illegal.

What's interesting is this result lends credibility to the other polls in surrounding states.  In 2016 it was a huge outlier compared to those, and this year it isn't.  That suggests that the weighting for the swing state polls is likely not too far off.Of course the above is a string of assumptions built upon each other, but it's a reasonable string at least.  And, if true, it's not great news for Trump.  Here's my prediction for 2024, and I'll preface this by saying that this only holds true and everyone ignores this statement and votes like they're 5 points behind. Kamala is going to win, and it's not going to be close.   My reasoning is as follows.  Polls are weighted and sampled with the underlying assumption that turnout and the general composition of the electorate will be identical to the prior identical contest.  That's the starting point, and then weighting is added based on a series of reasonable assumptions.  You adjust for new people reaching voting age,  people dying,  demographic changes, and then make your best guess on what proportion of different groups of people will turn out.    That last one is the troublemaker.I do not believe that this will in any way be a normal turnout election.  The issues at hand are going to drive massive turnout of younger voters, but this will also be absolutely swamped by women voters.  If you look at the enthusiasm numbers for democrats vs republicans and male vs female and young vs old,  Kamala's now hitting Obama numbers.  That's not going to be accounted for in the polls, and I believe it's going to heavily skew results in favor of Harris in November.   Basically, look at every number in the current polling and add about 2% for her.   That doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of the electoral college, it's enough to be the difference between a nail biter and a blowout. Of course I could be wrong.  Hey, who knows, I probably am.  But the above is honestly how I feel.  I'm still going to vote as if the opposite of the above is true, and you should as well.

Especially rural/suburban whites that didn't really see people of color that much.What's funny is that socially, it was a white male dominated time, and economically it was it was a great time for the US. Lots of manufacturing jobs, big business booming, and the US was largely unaffected by WWII, as in assembly lines needed re-tooling, not rebuilding.  The interstate system was being built, social security was stood up, etc.  How was this accomplished?  Relatively high taxes. The 50s through the 70s saw the highest tax brackets as high as 90%+ and as \\"low\\" as 70%.  These higher taxes funded so much of what the current US right flank would call socialism.The 80s and Reagan saw the advent of trickle-down economics, which led to slashing of taxes across the board, but especially the higher tax brackets.  This was good in the short run but has been shown over time to be economically harmful to the country over time.  As money is just gobbled up by the rich CEOs of the US Oligarch class, and it hasn't really trickled down.  Taxes continue to be lowered over the years, and there are short-term improvements. UT there US a net long-term negative trend in the national deficit.Now, there are other issues at play, the bloated military budget, defense contractors becoming a key part of the economy, social security is becoming more expensive as people live longer and we keep cutting taxes, making it a greater strain on the budget, the affordable care act is very expensive to fund, but would ironically work better if it didn't have to subsidize private plans, and instead just became a tri-care style coverage. Tri-care proves that socialized medicine works pretty well. It's not perfect, but it's competing in a for-profit system.Tangents aside, the 50s were ironically great economically for all the reasons that the US right think are bad. The right has been bought by the rich and corporations to argue for corporate rights to improve profit margins as opposed to the people's welfare.Socially, there was never a time in the US that was great for non-white males.

When we vote by person, rather than by states, states no longer have *any* power. \\"California\\" has no power under the NPV at all. All power would be devolved to the people, for presidential election purposes. California has more *Republican* voters (6 million) than 30 states have *people*. California has more Republican voters than any other state, bar none. More than Florida, more than Texas. Why don't you think the 6 million California Republicans deserve to have their votes count toward the presidential winner? Texas has more Democratic voters than NY! The only states with more Democratic voters than Texas are California and Florida. Why should Texas Democrats not have their votes contribute to the presidential winner? Every single California Republican and Texas Democrat could stay home on Election Day and it wouldn't affect the presidential election at all. Not even by a single electoral vote. They could all switch parties, and that also wouldn't change the outcome in the least. It's absurd to defend a system where millions of voters could sit out, or even switch parties, and it would have zero effect on the outcome.The majority of Americans live in just nine states.First, so what? The government is of the people, by the people, and for the people. It is constituted by people, and exists to serve people. Why should we count anything other than people?Second, elections count votes, not people, and it would take winning 100% of the popular vote in the 12 largest states, and at least like 95% of the 13th state, to overwhelm the remaining states.Third, do you think there exists some presidential candidate who could win 100% in even a single state, let alone 12-13 of them, when those include CA, TX, FL, NY, PA, IL, OH, MI, NC, GA, etc? With the exception of DC, there is no state where either party can break even just 70% of the vote, let alone sweep it. Not in Wyoming or West Virginia, and not in Vermont or Massachusetts. If, by some miracle, such a candidate *did* exist, why shouldn't they be allowed to win when they can dominate the West Coast, Midwest, South, and East Coast?Every candidate would cater to California because it has the most people.Lol.In 2020, California only had 11% of the NPV. It's not possible to win the popular vote with only 11% when you leave the remaining 89% available to your opponent(s).Also, it doesn't matter where the most *people* are, or even where the most *voters* are, it matters where the most *persuadable voters* are. Are voters in California more persuadable than, say, voters in Texas? Or Florida? And does appealing to Californians potentially come with any downsides?Nope. I will give you an example. There is an ongoing fight in the West about water rights from the Colorado river. If we had just a popular vote, every candidate would favor California in that fight because it has the most people by a large margin.Nice.Now explain how this candidate, who pandered to Californians over water rights, gets legislation through Congress over the objections of the Representatives and Senators of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada, never mind the rest of the country.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":" The problem is always that it's so easy to notice and comment on bad news,Or in the case of the media, push bad news on purpose to create a narrative, by prognosticating what *might* happen rather than what *is* happening.

However, open carry was considered a right in every state, no permit or license needed. We even have court cases from the mid 1800s stating that the prohibition of all carry would be a violation. States didn't start prohibiting open carry until the 1900s, and even California didn't prohibit it until 1968. Vermont is unique only in that they didn't discern between open and concealed carry, instead considering all carry a right.Almost all of our gun laws aimed at restricting the average citizen's ability to keep and carry arms appeared in the 1900s. Some of today's restrictions were originally aimed only at minorities, especially black people, and are generally applied today. Back then nobody would have accepted such restrictions for law-abiding white people. Yes, the origin and history of gun control was openly racist, and it still retains some more covert racism.Until 2008, the second amendment wasnt even understood to protect an individuals right to own a gun.?It was. Remember the Dred Scott case? One of the reasons they decided black people couldn't be citizens was because if they were citizens they would have a long list of rights white people had, including free speech, free travel, and the right to \\"keep and carry arms wherever they went.\\" That's obviously individual.Our first federal 2nd Amendment case was Cruikshank in 1876. In it the federal government was prosecuting racists for violating the individual right to keep and bear arms of black people under the newly enacted Enforcement Act of 1870 (aimed at fighting the KKK), so the federal government certainly believed it was an individual right being violated. There was no militia context in the case. The Supreme Court stated that they have the individual right, pre-existing of the Constitution and only protected by it, but that it was up to the states to protect any right in the states.And if you think this context invalidates the 2nd Amendment, Cruikshank was a dual 1st and 2nd Amendment case, and they said the same thing about the right to peaceably assemble (which the racists had violated, and the government had prosecuted). Applying any Cruikshank logic to invalidate the 2nd Amendment also invalidates the assembly part of the 1st Amendment.The court ignored the 14th Amendment in several cases around this time to stop the civil rights laws being enforced, and this was one of them. This started getting fixed in 1926 for free speech. Cruikshank's \\"sorry, the feds can't protect a right\\" was overruled for freedom of assembly in 1937 and for the right to keep and bear arms in 2010, and of course it was overruled dozens more times for other rights, the latest in 2019 (excessive fines).Rather, it was understood to protect against a government monopoly on guns.?By protecting the individual right. The idea of the \\"collective\\" or \\"militia\\" right was very rarely espoused until 1942 (Cases v. US, 1st Cir), when a lower circuit court partially overruled the Supreme Court from below, calling it \\"outdated\\" only three years later. But this only started the basic idea, which wasn't finalized in the lower courts until 1971 (US v. Stevens, 6th Cir) and named the \\"collective right\\" in 1976 (US v. Warin, 6th Cir), both of which named Cases v. US as the controlling precedent. After these courts did this, other federal and state courts jumped on board, pretending it had always been that way.All Heller did was overrule that recent lower court judicial activism.All this fear mongering about how our gun rights are eroding just doesnt hold up to scrutiny. Our gun laws have loosened, and our gun culture has expanded, in recent decades.Guns used to be in the Sears Catalog, shipped right to you. Before 1934 you could buy a machine gun, a suppressor, or a short-barreled rifle or shotgun in any (fully unlicensed) store that decided to carry them, or by mail order. And you could even do that as a felon or domestic abuser. Until 1968 you could have a semi-automatic, magazine-fed, actual military surplus rifle (a true \\"weapon of war\\") delivered to your door without a background check. Guns also didn't need serial numbers then, and you could go to any other state to buy a handgun, while that is prohibited now. And then there was no federally required background check to buy a gun from a dealer until 1993. And now of course in many states you can't possess the most common type of rifle sold in the country, unthinkable back then.Even the constitutional concealed carry we have in most states now is simply allowing people to carry again like they used to before it started getting banned in the 1900s, although concealed now because open carry tends to scare modern people.Our gun laws have gotten a LOT tighter. There really is no disputing this. I only gave you a very brief overview of the restrictions that didn't used to be. There are many, many more.Edit: Nitpicks","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"Biden did not submit nomination papers before Aug 6th deadline.","title":"RFK Jrs name will remain on ballot in swing state Wisconsin, judge rules"},{"text":"It entirely depends on the industry.

Gun Rights and Culture: While its true that specific laws like \\"Constitutional carry\\" are relatively recent, the underlying principle of self-reliance and the right to bear arms is deeply rooted in American culture. The rights perspective is not necessarily based on the legal technicalities of gun laws but on a broader belief in personal responsibility, protection of liberty, and distrust of government overreach. This sentiment can be traced back to the Revolutionary War, where firearms symbolized resistance to tyranny. The desire to return to a time when Americans were more self-reliant, particularly in terms of personal defense, is not about a literal time period but about these long-standing cultural values.\\n2. Morality and Social Conservatism: The argument that abortion was historically legal does not negate the fact that for many, especially in religious communities, the moral fabric of society felt stronger in past decades. The desire for stricter family values, fewer divorces, and traditional gender roles reflects a longing for a time when society placed more emphasis on the nuclear family, discipline, and religious morals. Even if divorce or extramarital affairs occurred, they were less socially accepted, and for conservatives, this was seen as a time when there was more social cohesion and less public endorsement of moral relativism. So, the push to return to \\"traditional values\\" isnt necessarily about claiming that past eras were perfect, but that those values gave society a sense of order and stability.\\n3. LGBTQ Rights and Family Structure: It's important to understand that the conservative view on LGBTQ rights and family structures is not solely about oppressing or ignoring the existence of LGBTQ people but about the belief in a traditional family as the foundation of a healthy society. The expansion of LGBTQ rights and the redefining of marriage and family has, for many on the right, represented a shift away from what they see as the natural or ideal societal order. This isnt about erasing LGBTQ individuals but about resisting cultural shifts that challenge long-standing beliefs about marriage and family structures.\\n4. Race and Immigration: The argument that the MAGA movement longs for a \\"pure white America\\" is an oversimplification. Many conservatives express concern over illegal immigration not because of racial purity but because of the impact they perceive it has on jobs, wages, and social services. Additionally, their critique is often framed around concerns for national security and the rule of law. While there are certainly extreme elements within the movement that espouse racist ideologies, it would be unfair to paint the entirety of the right with the same brush. For many, the emphasis on controlling immigration is tied to a broader desire for national sovereignty and cultural preservation, not an erasure of minority groups.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"He didnt win the election that put him in the whitehouse without russian support so I still call him the United States first dictator.","title":"Youre Allowed to Call Trump a Threat to Democracy"},{"text":"Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.","title":"The Trump campaign released a list of quotes by people who have said Trump is a threat to American democracy.

That's super refreshing!Good point on assuming it's taken literally. It's an assumption based on the fact anecdote, so that's a valid criticism. I'd counter with, in the absence of empirical data, which I'm not aware of any, I went with circumstantial evidence to go with the most likely, which is a valid epistemological approach. If you are unable to use deductive logic, you use inductive logic. So, I take the anecdotes of Trump supporters' propensity to cosplay as old-timey Americans, figures of the past, and their statements that they wish they could rewind the clock, et cetera, as my best suggestion of their thinking.I then examine to see if there are enough anecdotes that can be used as counterfactuals. For example, do I hear even somewhat as often the statements of, \\"It's not meant to be taken as literal,\\" \\"We use rhetoric hyperbolically, but we actually only want the good and leave the bad,\\" et cetera. There are relatively no examples of this. So, if we're forced to come up with a conclusion that we can act upon (voting, public discourse, voter persuasion), the most logical one would be they do take it literally. And to your final point, the fact that they can't iterate the nuances of their beliefs on the subject doesn't necessarily mean they didn't take it literally. In fact, the most logically, historically, and psychologically consistent conclusion would be that they simply haven't examined their own beliefs, which is an empirically ubiquitous human trait that we know is at play, if not the only thing at play explaining this.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"It wasnt even an assassination attempt fuck magats are weird","title":"The Trump campaign released a list of quotes by people who have said Trump is a threat to American democracy.

Of course, this time never existed. A lot of the laws the right fear mongers about the left taking away are actually pretty new. Constitutional carry, or publicly carrying a gun without a permit, was only legal in one state, Vermont, just 20 years ago. This is not some right in our nations tradition. Its a right invented by the NRA in recent times, and theyve lobbied hard so that more than half our country now falls under state laws that protect it. Until 2008, the second amendment wasnt even understood to protect an individuals right to own a gun. Rather, it was understood to protect against a government monopoly on guns. This changed with DC v. Heller. All this fear mongering about how our gun rights are eroding just doesnt hold up to scrutiny. Our gun laws have loosened, and our gun culture has expanded, in recent decades. I'm just going to focus on this, since I'm much more familiar with it than the rest.I think you're too narrowly focusing on recent legislation/rulings, and missing the bigger picture.  If we go back to the 50s, the laws around firearms would be *significantly* looser.  We wouldn't have the Gun Control Act of '68 that established the FFL (Federal Firearms License) system, restricted interstate commerce of firearms, and adding a sporting cause for importing firearms.  We wouldn't have the Brady Bill in '93 that mandated background checks for all FFL firearm sales/transfers.  We wouldn't have other various import restrictions that prohibited the importation of firearms and ammunition commonly found in other countries.  We would never had the '94 Assault Weapon Ban, or any other assault weapon ban for that matter.  The phrase assault weapon wouldn't even exist.  Constitutional carry is newer because requiring a permit in the first place is too.  In California, the Mulford Act, which prohibited unpermitted carry, was passed in '67.  We wouldn't have the Gun Free School Zone Act, which obviously prohibited firearms in schools.  We wouldn't have the closing of the machine gun registry, which prohibited registering new machine guns, and caused machine gun prices to rise exponentially.  If we want to go back a little further, before '34, then there would be no National Firearms Act, and machine guns, silencers, and destructive devices would be unregulated.Outside of the '94-'04 AWB period, gun laws are more strict now than they've ever been (though this may vary somewhat at the state level).  If we went back, you would be able to browse ~~your Sears catalog~~ Amazon and have a gun shipped straight to your door with no background check ever needed, maybe even a machine gun depending how far back we went.  Heller, Bruen, or any other the other more recent rulings don't really matter, because there little to no restrictions on firearms to begin with.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"Its the fake Christians too","title":"Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump by 3 points in Pennsylvania survey"},{"text":"That's literally how it works, though.

For too long, we have kept silent about the obvious. C Joseph R. Biden, Jr. speaking at a Hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, June 20, 1990*-Today [September 12th], President Biden will deliver remarks at the White House to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), landmark bipartisan legislation that he wrote and championed as a U.S. Senator and has worked across the aisle to strengthen ever since. He will reflect on the significant progress we have made in reducing violence and supporting survivors as well as the work ahead to realize VAWAs promise of a nation where every woman and girl can live free from fear, free from violence, and free from abuse.Working to end gender-based violence has been a cornerstone of President Bidens and Vice President Harris careers. VAWA was the first comprehensive federal law to focus on preventing and addressing violence against women and to provide justice and support for survivors. The law transformed the nations response to gender-based violence by recognizing that domestic violence and sexual assault are not a private matter but rather a violation of fundamental rights and dignity. Between 1993 and 2022, annual domestic violence rates dropped by 67% and the rate of rapes and sexual assaults declined by 56%.In the three decades since the original VAWA was signed into law, President Biden has worked with survivors, advocates, experts, and Members of Congress of both parties to reauthorize and strengthen the law four times. As President, he signed into law the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022critical legislation that expands access to safety and support for survivors, increases prevention efforts, and establishes new federal protections against online harassment and abuse. The President and Vice President also secured the highest-ever funding levels to implement VAWA, and the Biden-Harris Administration has acted quickly to implement the laws new programs and protections.On the anniversary of VAWA new actions were announced (abridged list, more in press release):* Providing new funds to address gender-based violence and support survivors.\\n* Meeting the housing needs of survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.\\n* Addressing online harassment and abuse.\\n* Engaging the private sector to combat image-based sexual abuse.\\n* Supporting states in using federal funds to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.\\n* Strengthening enforcement of new provisions to narrow the boyfriend loophole.\\n* Disrupting the cycle of abuse by supporting youth exposed to domestic violence.The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to preventing and ending gender-based violence wherever it occurs. Because, as then-Vice President Biden made clear on the 20th anniversary of VAWA, even one case of gender-based violence is too many. The Administration will continue to take steps to realize VAWAs fundamental promise of a nation where every survivor of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking can access the safety, justice, and healing they need and live free from fear, free from violence, and free from abuse.(abridged list):**Implementing the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022**  \\nVAWA remains just as important today as it was when the law was first passed in 1994, and the Biden-Harris Administration is continuing to implement the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022s expanded protections and services, including for survivors from underserved and marginalized communities, as well as investments in prevention, and new protections against online harassment and abuse.* Protecting and supporting survivors of gender-based violence.\\n* Expanding access to justice and strengthening gender-based violence protections for Tribal communities.\\n* Supporting the housing needs of survivors.\\n* Promoting and strengthening prevention services and responses to stop violence before it occurs.\\n* Supporting survivors of online harassment and abuse.\\n* Strengthening protections for domestic violence survivors at risk of experiencing gun violence.\\n* Improving trauma-informed and victim-centered investigations and expanding pathways to justice for survivors.(abridged list):**Addressing Gender-Based Violence Beyond VAWA**\\nBuilding on the foundation of VAWA, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken numerous additional actions to address gender-based violence wherever it occursat home, at work, in the military, in schools, in communities, and online.* Addressing gun violence by domestic abusers.\\n* Implementing historic military justice reforms and supporting survivors.\\n* Investing in communities to support survivors and save lives.\\n* Keeping students safe and addressing campus sexual assault.\\n* Strengthening protections for survivors of sexual assault and harassment in the workplace.\\n* Supporting survivors in accessing housing, homeless assistance, and community services.\\n* Developing the first-ever U.S. National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence.\\n* Preventing and responding to online harassment and abuse in the U.S. and globally.\\n* Helping protect survivor privacy and economic security.\\n* Addressing gender-based violence in Native communities.\\n* Improving access to sexual assault forensic examinations.\\n* Combatting human trafficking and strengthening protections for noncitizen trafficking victims.(abridged list):Separately, the Department of Homeland Security adopted a victim-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally sensitive approach to protecting survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and human trafficking as well as other vulnerable victims. The Department of Homeland Security also finalized a rule to strengthen the integrity of the T nonimmigrant visa process, which enables certain noncitizen victims of human trafficking to remain in the U.S. for an initial period of up to four years, and ensure eligible victims of human trafficking can access protections and stabilizing benefits in a timely manner. Additionally, the Department established a process to conduct bona fide determinations and provide employment authorization and deferred action to noncitizen victims of crime, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, with pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status for those who met certain standards.* Investing in preventing and ending gender-based violence globally.\\n* Advancing justice and accountability for conflict-related sexual violence.-Related press releases:* [Proclamation on the 30th Anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/09/12/proclamation-on-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-violence-against-women-act/)* [Remarks by President Biden on the 30th Anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/09/13/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-violence-against-women-act/)* [Statement from Vice President Kamala Harris on the 30th Anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/13/statement-from-vice-president-kamala-harris-on-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-violence-against-women-act/)* [Biden-Harris Administration Commemorates 30th Anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act | Five federal agencies affirm continued commitment to implement housing provisions under the Violence Against Women Act](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_235)* [VAWA 30th Anniversary Brief: HHS Key Actions to End Gender-based Violence](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/09/13/vawa-30th-anniversary-brief-hhs-key-actions-end-gender-based-violence.html)* [Violence Against Women Act Celebrates 30th Anniversary](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/09/13/violence-against-women-act-celebrates-30th-anniversary)* [FCC Launches Lifeline Benefit for Domestic Violence Survivors](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-lifeline-benefit-domestic-violence-survivors)","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Commemorates the 30th Anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act and Strengthens Commitment to Ending Gender-Based Violence"},{"text":"look at Gallup poll on Democrats enthusiasm outweighs republican 78% - 64%[https://news.gallup.com/poll/649397/democrats-drive-surge-election-enthusiasm.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/649397/democrats-drive-surge-election-enthusiasm.aspx)","title":"Kamala Harris just got one of her best polls of the year"},{"text":"Ted Cruz ~~enters conversation~~ slithers away.","title":"JD Vance pushes lies about pet-eating migrants  then tells Dems to tone down their rhetoric"},{"text":"Ironically, BOTH shooters were Republican, lol.","title":"JD Vance pushes lies about pet-eating migrants  then tells Dems to tone down their rhetoric"},{"text":"fault? what, is it a sin to not know who she is?","title":"Billie Eilish and Finneas Endorse Kamala Harris for President Because We Cant Let Extremists Control Our Lives, Our Freedoms and Our Future"},{"text":"Agreed.

The smaller states would not have joined a union with the larger states if they didn't think they would be able to balance that out. There is nothing outdated about that. The small states still wouldn't like to be in a union in which they don't have a voice. The electoral college where you have \\"electors\\" who have to go to vote on a particular day after the election might be outdated but that isn't the thing you are arguing against, rather you are specifically arguing against vote weighing. You could in theory eliminate the outdated components of the electoral college while keeping the weight of the votes in the smaller states the same. If you live in one of the majority of states that are clearly red or blue, your vote in the presidential election counts less than if you live is a swing state because all the electoral votes goes to the winner of the state whether they won by 1 vote or 100,000 votes.This is true for all electoral districts though. If I'm in Canada and my district is solid by vote doesn't really matter either. The difference is that the electors are granted in statewide packages, but this too has a purpose, namely it means that winning a state with 51% is as good as winning it with 66%. This means that trying to too heavily placate voters in one state won't provide you any benefit, so you need to figure out ways to win in more states rather than get big numbers in a few states. The optimal strategy would be to win every state with 51% of the vote so you would need to be popular with some people in every state without alienating anybody in the other states such that you end up losing that other state. Sure you might by chance win some states with 70% of the vote, but that doesn't provide any benefit to your election chances. That state had already decided that it was willing to support you 20 points ago. If anything your problem is that some states are simply too big and others are too small, but the small states also think that this is a problem as well. You might say that this is undemocratic, but nobody ever told the big states that they HAD to grow their population by so much. If a state wants to democratically decide they prefer to remain small rather than build a giant city that should be possible without the state making that decision losing all its representation. The perfect representation you call for is basically encouraging states to try to stuff as many people as possible in order to increase their representation but people might say \\"stuffing as many people as possible into this state would be a bad way to live\\" because that doesn't sound that appealing. The current rules allow them to avoid stuffing as many people as possible into their state and not suffer as many consequences for prioritizing a smaller population over growing that population.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"\\"Pfft who cares about celebrity endorsements!?\\"\\n-conservatives coping with the fact they only have hulk hogan and other washed up unpopular people","title":"Billie Eilish and Finneas Endorse Kamala Harris for President Because We Cant Let Extremists Control Our Lives, Our Freedoms and Our Future"},{"text":"Brexit seemed dead too, until it wasnt?","title":"Bloc Qubcois win longtime Liberal seat and deliver stunning blow to Trudeau in Montreal byelection"},{"text":"People favor democratic policies but the electoral college makes it harder to enact them.","title":"'A long relay race': Hillary Clinton on passing the torch to Kamala Harris - Interview"},{"text":"I don't think any of the celebrity endorsements will have any impact.

Rhetoric, especially rhetoric that is being taken literally, is open to logical critique. That was the vast majority of Socrates' work. The idea is that, if you say something, you're responsible for it's implications and consequences. That's the whole point of public discourse, the basis of law, and morality. Additionally, you asserted that it isn't meant to be taken literally, but I have two counterpoints that invalidate that argument.1. You don't know that. You're using a fallacious epistemological concept we call \\"mind reading.\\" As far as we know that's just as likely to be true as not. The people who invented the slogan and those who adopted it have not spoken to any of us personally.2. Regardless of that fact, in logic, law, and moral philosophy, if the effect of a statement that you intended to be rhetorical is taken by a large enough group as literal, you are still held responsible for it as if it was a literal statement. For example, if you make a statement with no sense of irony, humor, or disingenuity, then repeatedly back that statement also with no sense of irony, humor or disingenuity on a public stage, you are responsible for it. Claiming it was rhetoric, which is still not a conclusion that is logical, would still do nothing to protect you from OP's criticism.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"It's not similar at all.

The incentives for 3rd party labs to get more contracts, isn't to the extent of manipulating data, as that is serious jail time. (She said look up Insys as an example) but more so as in making sure the drug sponsor has everything they need to make sure their trials run smoothly, efficent, with no setbacks/surprises costing more money. It is a business, so think of how a private company would treat their biggest customer vs joe schmo. That being said with it being a business, of course there needs to be advertising.

Of course youd have to be an idiot back then to believe Trump - anyone who studied the situation could see coal was dying not because of regulation but because it just was outright not financially viable. Nothing Trump could do would fix that. But most coal miners dont get into coal mining because they have a deep understanding of economics. They dont understand the ins and outs of why they cant get a job, they just want to put food on the table again and only one person was giving them a way to do that again in their mind.Its one thing to hold them to highly ethical standards when things are good, but if youre suffering youll go along with a lot of unethical policies to make the suffering end. Right now a lot of people are suffering from the economy and have no clue why. Trump gives simple, confident (objectively asinine) answers to solve their problems. Theres a reason why Trumps most dependable voting block is white evangelicals with no college educationThats just one case I could see people voting for Trump and still being good. I already gave another other case in my other posts. If youre sensing a theme though, Id say its accurate: imo the top reasons to vote for Trump are ignorance &amp; disenfranchisement, not a lack of morals (though that might be item 3 or 4)","title":"Biden says good Republicans are scared out of pro-LGBTQ+ stances by far right"},{"text":"Because he actually is.

I'm not a Republican, I've never voted for Trump, and never will. I have not mentioned any of those things you talked aboutYou're continuing to lie about the bloodbath quote, which was clearly a protectionist rant about the Chinese threat to the auto industry. You're just not an honest person if you claim otherwise. You trying to portray democrats as the violent ones when most people know the violent rhetoric comes from the rightThere's violent rhetoric from extremists and politicians in every group. Trumps own rhetoric on Haitians eating pets has lead to 2 elementary schools being evacuated due to bomb threats.Love this claim. Why would someone who believes Haitians are eating pets threaten to bomb a school?This is the type of insane claim I expect from blue no matter who bots. You are just regurgitating emotional talking points that don't make any actual sense. You think it is okay for Trump to call human beings animals?This is the one cogent and honest argument you've made. I'll take it a step further, because you need to update your talking points.Not only does Trump use dehumanizing rhetoric towards [illegal, for the most part] immigrants, but his focus on their violent crime (which is largely misleading) is definitely authoritarian and fear mongering in its intent. It's a right wing populist message and it takes xenophobia to an extreme because illegal immigration is a real issue for working class people. It's misinterpreted by the left as racism, which is disingenuous. But it can feed into or become racism.He has taken the Harris/Biden \\"bloodbath\\" lie that you're promoting, and reapplied it to their border policies, and it's not true but it's going to work. He'll point to the very real issue of immigration (for instance the impact of 15k Haitians in the 60k town of Springfield) and find extreme anecdotes (that may or may not have any truth to them) to compound the feeling that working class people have of being threatened by immigration/immigrants. The reality is that legal immigrants have extremely low crime rates, and that there isn't a ton of evidence to indicate that illegal immigration plays a particular role in violent crime rates in the US. There are definitely cartels here integrated with the street gangs, though. And Europe is dealing with violent crime from immigrants, that we haven't seen yet in the US.You're letting him do that though, by stooping to his level and not rationally analyzing a very real issue.","title":"2.5 minutes of Democrats explicitly calling for using political vioIence.

If you look at racial issues and economy as a seperate you can easily say, I wish america was great like it used to be in that way, and because they are seperate, it's not like segregation would come along with a better economy today.2) It's kind of a gotcha, there's no perfect time even though things have generally improved especially in terms of equality3) There are some large nostalgia blinders on for these people, as there are for many people.

Race has been an issue in every society, ever.  Slavery is also as old as the human race, and has affected all races, and still exists today in places like Libya.  America is not special in this regard - except for dabbling in it probably the least, and having one of the bloodiest wars over it.  If anything, America has been addressing both issues head-on since its inception, and arguably has made the most progress of any other society.Also, several other American Presidential campaigns have also used the phrase \\"Make America Great Again\\" in the past.So, whenever someone uses the phrase \\"Make America Great Again\\" with mocking sarcasm, and points toward racial issues and slavery, I just ignore their very limited view.But, this question has been answered.  It was the 25 years after WWII, from 1945 to 1970.  By 1970, it was fully over.During that heyday, you could work a job, just any job, and you could afford to be the sole earner for your spouse and children, and buy a house, and have some left over for savings, and vacations, and higher education.  Economists have looked for any other period in any other society that was as rich as that time period in America, and they have yet to find one.Important caveat.  Yeah, and this was mainly because America quietly built up a population during its isolationist years after WWI, and came out of WWII pretty much as the only country whose industrial complexes weren't bombed to bits, nor were communist.  In essence, America had no competitors for about 25 years.  America had a global monopoly during that time.This was also a time when [minorities in America flourished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_family_structure).  The nuclear family was whole and employed.  And this time had been primed by [The Harlem Renaissance](https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties/harlem-renaissance).\\"BHUT VIOLINS AGENST BLUCKS!!!!11\\"Murder is murder.  Murder is very illegal.  Humans do horrible things to each other.  Sociopaths also exist.

You might as well bring up the Salem Witch Trials, if you are going to go back that far.There were obviously less gun laws back then, too.But, that ended by 1970.  America getting complacent and letting the steel and auto industries get dominated by Germany and Japan.  Liberals questioning everything that had been working up to that point, and changing it.  Them asking, \\"Can we do it?\\", when they should have been asking, \\"Should we do it?\\"Vietnam.  Gulf of Tonkin.  Bay of Pigs.  The assassinations of JFK, RFK, MLK, and Malcolm X.  MK Ultra (which created Ted Kaczynski and Charles Manson).  [Operation Seaspray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray).  America's CIA and FBI overthrowing democratically-elected governments in other countries in order to install more \\"American-friendly\\" administrations - leading directly to unintended consequences, which is why Iran is still an issue that America is dealing with, fifty years later.

None of those things have factored into making things \\"less great\\" for the average working class stiff, but since people love to assign blame, those sociopolitical/cultural gripes make for convenient, easy to swallow scapegoats for these folks to point the finger at.But here's the thing: average folks here aren't exactly fans of nuance, critical thinking, or...and this is the big one...self reflection. Dolt 45's slogan resonates with them because, whether the left is willing to acknowledge it or not (and they sometimes do, although in a very half-baked, half-assed way), its underpinnings are correct:*It is not \\"great\\" to be a working class (think middle and lower classes) individual in America. And it hasn't been for a long time. Things have slowly but progressively become worse, and worse, for the working class over the last 50-55 years.*I honestly don't see how that point is even objectively debatable. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's as true a sentiment as it gets. Most of these supporters are entirely aware of this fact; they just don't want to acknowledge (or simply don't have the educational background to understand) all the different dynamics that have contributed to the fall of the working class from the high point it reached in the late 60's/very early 70's.Sure, one could play semantics and say that it was *for white people*, but one could easily counter that while POC still faced plenty of inequalities and indignities, that period of time was still a time of potential for a high quality of life compared to the century or so preceding it for folks of color. Not on par with whites across the board, but still undoubtedly better economic prospects than what the generations preceding them faced.To look inwards and realize that those \\"great\\" times were directly the result of the labor/unionization movement coming out of the Great Depression, corporate tax structures ~~requiring~~ incentivizing companies to invest their profits back into their businesses and workforces, a Europe ravaged by the destruction caused in WWII, a minimum wage regularly adjusted to keep pace with inflation, etc. is simply a bridge too far for a large chunk of our electorate.Since those \\"great\\" times, we collectively have voted for politicians from both sides of the aisle who've aligned with big-money interests, slowly but systematically gutted labor protections, confidence in unions and collective bargaining, instituted at-will and right-to-work laws in far too many states, allowed outside money and influence into politics in the form of lobbying (and later came Citizens United cementing corporations as having the same rights as individual citizens), and so on and so forth.It's because of these reasons the Dems don't do themselves any favors by just hand-waving away the notion that things aren't great for the working class. They do acknowledge that fact, but are nowhere near blunt or aggressive enough about pointing out the *why's* to a largely uninformed electorate. I believe this is because, as altruistic as they claim their policy goals to be, the movers and shakers within the party have no actual plans to take a sledgehammer to the status quo and take on the uber-wealthy to restore some semblance of viability to wealth inequality.Because at this point, without someone in a position of leadership (or someone running for such a position) calling it out for what it is (ineffective leadership from both parties for the last 5+ decades), and pledging to help working class Americans to collectively shove our foot up the ass of the wealthy elite...and then actually *following through on those promises*...nothing will get substantially better for the vast majority of American citizens.The R's offer not a thing in terms of policy positions or proposals that would fix anything for the betterment of the working class. And they haven't in the previously mentioned 50-55 year period. And the D's? They offer half-measures and \\"tough on the wealthy\\" narratives, and execute them about as well as Bryce Young has been executing the offensive gameplans for the Carolina Panthers (for non-football fans, this means ineptly and quite poorly). They offer band-aids and duct tape to problems that require invasive surgery and do so with the knowledge that their opposition will fight tooth and nail to prevent the needed remedies from even being explored. As well as members of their own party, in the event they're ever able to achieve a supermajority in Congress.I wish I had more time at the moment to articulate my points a bit better, but alas work calls.  Let's just say that the statement the slogan makes isn't incorrect at all, but the nuance of *why* it's not great to be an American citizen compared to prior generations is completely missed by far too large a portion of our contemporaries.We need a labor movement rivaling the one that delivered that last \\"great\\" era for the working class, and some politicians with the stones and spine to dig in and aggressively lead that movement. A billionaire isn't going to be that person. Neither are \\"progressives\\" too chicken shit to actually take on the ownership class in this country. Show me a leader that pledges to solely support evening the playing field for the labor class, and bucks any resistance in doing so from inside or outside their own party, and encourages the electorate to look out for one another's collective best interests, and I'll show you someone who might just have the balls to get some real shit done. That is, if the ownership class in the country wouldn't have them \\"dispatched\\" as quickly as they possibly could.As it stands, until we do start to watch out for one another as socioeconomic equals, nothing is going to get better for any of us. And it still would be true to say it's not \\"great\\" to be a part of the American working class. ??","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"The funny thing is that the good old days of the 50s is largely [a cultural myth made up by the popularity of the band Sha Na Na](https://www.wikicu.com/Sha_Na_Na).

Hogan also vetoed an earned sick leave bill requiring workers to be given five paid sick days per year, and the establishment of a paid family and medical leave insurance program. The Maryland General Assembly overrode these vetoes with the hard work of a broad coalition of civic, labor, small business and faith groups, state legislative leaders and the public. On the issue of reproductive justice and access to abortion care, Hogan vetoed a law to increase the number of trained providers and availability of services, including in the two-thirds of Maryland counties without a single provider. Hogan issued his veto just as the Supreme Court was preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade and Maryland was facing the imminent need to provide care to patients from neighboring states like West Virginia. After the Maryland General Assembly overrode his veto, Hogan denied a request from the state comptroller to immediately release $3.5 million in appropriated funds for training new providers in quality and safe care. On education, Hogan vetoed the landmark reform legislation called Blueprint for Marylands Future, which was developed by the Kirwan Commission after extensive input and careful study. The legislature overrode Hogans veto to enact this 10-year plan to expand pre-kindergarten programs and increase funding for schools with high concentrations of poverty, increase pay and career opportunities for teachers, create new career pathways for high schoolers who dont plan to attend college, and establish an accountability board.On preventing gun violence, Hogan vetoed background checks for the sale and transfer of shotguns and rifles, legislation eventually enacted over his veto in response to a 2018 mass shooting at the Capital Gazette newsroom in which five people were killed and two people wounded by a gunman using a shotgun.On voting, Hogan vetoed a bill that would have given voters an opportunity to sign their mail-in ballots if they forgot to do so. In 2015, Hogan vetoed a bill  subsequently overridden  to allow approximately 44,000 ex-felons on probation or parole to restore their voting rights.Turning to other issues, Hogan canceled the Red Line light rail project for Baltimore; vetoed legislation to prevent eviction of tenants with pending applications for rental assistance in response to Covid-related economic hardship; and vetoed funding for the Prescription Drug Affordability Board.I dont buy fiscal conservative/social liberal nonsense, but Ill grant you that Phil Scott seems to at least be popular among his constituents.

The tarrif might lower demand for the stuff we use Chinese raw materials to build and thus even more reduce the demand for those materials forcing a price action by foreign suppliers. \\nIt also would depend on where else you can get a substitute. An easy example is soybeans. When the US put tariffs on China China puts tarrifs on US soybeans. China didn't buy less soybeans they just bought them from Brazil. The same substitution effects could impose the tarrifs on China without price action in the US. We don't buy Chinese rice we buy Indian rice or something similar, provided it's available. \\nIt's a bit more complicated with manufactured good because quality is different. but the same logic applies.

Corporations have no choice on a corporate income tax. They also cannot pass this entirely on to consumers, as higher profits still mean more taxes. Corporate income taxes are taxes on consumerism and windfall profits. Tariffs are taxes imposed to make a country's own domestic products more appealing on a local level. This means all companies who source products and materials from other countries (which are 95+% of domestic companies) will be affected. In this case, the price can be 100% passed on to the consumer, and likely will be. So while I agree that it is inaccurate to call it a sales tax, it will function effectively in the same manner. It will turn into a price increase on anything that isn't 100% domestically sourced, which is almost everything. Fruits, in particular, would probably be one of the hardest hit industries since very little of the fruit we eat is coming from within the US because we have shifted from an agrarian economy. This will affect prices for most goods for everyone. That's why it is, if not fully accurate, at least beneficial to call it a sales tax so the common person understands it absolutely does mean major price increases for almost everything they buy.It does come with pros, such as stronger domestic production. The problem is, it isnt possible for the US as a country to produce more than a small fraction of the overall resources that are needed to sustain the 330 million people that live here. That's why this has generally been deemed unsustainable by most economists, including several that were in Trumps inner circle","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"Personally, Im quacking in my boots.Now that the effective Comer has sentenced Hunter Biden to life plus 500 years hard labor.

Of course, this time never existed. A lot of the laws the right fear mongers about the left taking away are actually pretty new. Constitutional carry, or publicly carrying a gun without a permit, was only legal in one state, Vermont, just 20 years ago. This is not some right in our nations tradition. Its a right invented by the NRA in recent times, and theyve lobbied hard so that more than half our country now falls under state laws that protect it. Until 2008, the second amendment wasnt even understood to protect an individuals right to own a gun. Rather, it was understood to protect against a government monopoly on guns. This changed with DC v. Heller. All this fear mongering about how our gun rights are eroding just doesnt hold up to scrutiny. Our gun laws have loosened, and our gun culture has expanded, in recent decades.History isnt the last 20 years. Gun rights became more restricted in the late 20th century signifcantly, there was almost no gun control at all until the 1930s and even then it was very very loose until the late 60s. The NRA didnt invent anything. You don't seem to understand history extends beyond 20 years and the reason for these panics is because these issues werent even common enough to be considered as hot topic.Another time the right longs for is a time of morality, when abortions were illegal and divorces werent easy to obtain. The problem is, abortion being immoral is a relatively new construct within the history of humanity. Abortion was legal across every state until the mid 1800sThis is just not true. Something occuring doesnt mean people dont disprove of it, abortion was unheard of in early 1800s america. America back then was 99% christians who were devout so there was no need for an explicit ban.Another thing conservatives long for is the time before LGBTQ rights. Again, just because you bury something in the sand doesnt mean it doesnt exist. LGBTQ people have always existed.Existing doesnt mean tolerated, which they have not been in almost every western society.And finally, pure white America is probably the worst thing they long for. Those good old times before minorities poisoned the blood of America. This is false for several reasons. First, the southern U.S. has actually gotten whiter over the last century. Most deep southern states had a black majority until the second half of the 20th century. These people were disenfranchised, so you have to wonder if thats what these conservatives really long for. Do they really long for a white majority, or simply white dominance? But I digress. As far as anti immigrant sentiment, a lot of these individuals are themselves descended of Irish, Italian, German, Polish, or Portuguese immigrants. These groups were once accused of poisoning the blood of this country, but now some (NOT ALL, dont hate me) of their descendants like to long for a time when this country was pure and white.Nothing here disproves anything, America was founded by British people and they only allowed similar cultures in until the 60s. The south grew whiter because of internal migration and was the only majority non-white region in the US for most of its history besides a few cities in the north.TLDR: Americans of the olden days had looser gun rights, hated gay people, were whiter, and didnt approve of abortion at a cultural level.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"Of course.

After the world wars however they were able to coalesce into a larger union and promote peace on the continent.Wars are really bad for your economy, its the main reason the US and China are unlikely to ever fight, theyre too entwined for it to ever be in the interests of their elites. With these two scenarios we get two models, the ideal one is the European model, a group slowly adding more and more members with mutual defence and integrated economic activity. This promotes local disarmament and can serve as a model. The second is reciprocal disarmament such as nuclear test ban treaties, these have become more viable in recent years due to the massive increase in quality for our surveillance equipment. Countries in these frameworks dont have to trust each other but they can mutually scale down their militaries while continually spying on each other. We actually almost did it with nuclear bombs but we didnt invent the math to check for them until too late.We can still achieve disarmament, even if we dont trust each other, it just relies on making all parties too invested in the status quo to disrupt it.","title":"CMV: Demilitarization is a Pipe Dream"},{"text":"They share some of the blame.","title":"Joe Biden Is Bailing Out Papaws Steel Plant in JD Vances Hometown.

Racism was rampant, sexism was rampant, schools could use physical punishment, the cold war tensions were running high, you can go on and on about how terrible the decade was. And you'd be right.However, many issues of today weren't issues back then. Single income households were the norm, and livable wages could be easily achieved with only a high school diploma. College could be paid off by working part time and house prices were affordable on an average salary. This is also before the \\"female happiness paradox\\" started taking effect, and people in general were more satisfied with their lives. While racial tensions were high, the cocaine epidemic hadn't yet happened and black families were actually more intact than white families and in many ways were doing better than they are today.

Few people are moving to LCOL nations because they like what abundance offers. Look at housing costs, they have been going up at a high rate many places, but those places are also 1) popular and growing and 2) not building enough housing. Housing prices go up because housing becomes increasingly scarce and not enough housing gets built because when people have the ability to impact decisions they tend to want less as opposed to more dense infrastructure. Look at the woes of urban planners and their constant complaints.  the planned obscolescense of light bulb.LED bulbs are awesome, use way less energy than incandescent, and last what seems like forever. That you can do cool things like program them and change the color is just a QOL bonus. Sometimes things just *are* obsolete. Other example is that advertisment shifted. .... You sell the idea that material is gona change you non material problems.Sure. You haven't identified an actual problem here. Religion does the same thing without even offering something material in exchange. Even with luxury item like perfume, wearing something like Bulgari Blue or Jaipur does impart a signal of status compared to someone scentless or wearing something like AXE. They advertise status and to an extent provide it. To the extent that self confidence changes how one faces the world, that in itself can increase attractiveness, which increases status, which is a basic human social desire. It's not \\"stuff\\" that keeps people from forming strong social and community bonds, it's the atomization of everything from media to education and intensified by social media.

But this comes back to my point regarding the importation of raw materials used in producing domestic goods.  I would think that raw materials would be relatively inelastic, meaning that importers are going to raise prices; which then means the producers that are buying these materials are likely to pass the increased cost onto consumers of their end-product.  That's why I think it's much more than just a sales tax on imported goods and that it will affect our entire market, either directly or indirectly.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"Conservatives cant get out of their own way.","title":"Joe Biden Is Bailing Out Papaws Steel Plant in JD Vances Hometown.

Tariffs are duties on imported goods, designed to regulate trade, protect domestic industries, or raise revenue, making foreign products more expensive. In contrast, taxes like sales tax apply to all goods sold domestically, regardless of origin, and are intended purely to generate government revenue. While tariffs target imports specifically, sales taxes affect both domestic and imported goods at the point of sale. Unlike sales taxes, tariffs are more about trade policy than routine revenue collection.Kamala's Economic plans on the other hand would be devastating if they are allowed to go into effect. Kamala plans to tax unrealized gains at 25%!A tax on unrealized capital gains would force small investors to sell assets to cover the tax, often to wealthier buyers like billionaires who can afford to hold onto them. This transfer of assets siphons wealth from small investors to the rich, deepening economic inequality. As the wealthy accumulate more assets, small investors are left with fewer opportunities to build wealth, further widening the gap between the rich and poor.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"!delta this makes perfect sense.

The main one is of course that since American labor is more expensive than foreign labor, free trade leads to more and more jobs being moved overseas, leaving many American struggling to find jobs. I think according to economic theory this is dismissed as the better allocation of resources, but at a certain point it becomes a real issue. If there are no jobs in your country, who cares how cheap stuff is? And so, Protectionism is largely intended to improve the U.S. economy by strengthening the domestic jobs market. It also can bring in some revenue. I think the idea that the foreign countries will be paying for it would be based on the idea (like you mentioned) that they might have to lower the initial prices of their goods so that that with price + tariffs their goods will remain competitive. But the majority of the paying here will probably be from the consumers, it's just that it could be arguably worth it","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"time to job hunt.","title":"Its official: Americas real wages are up under Biden-Harris"},{"text":"That is the exact reason I wouldnt take part in a poll, Id be worried it was a scam.","title":"Kamala Harris Poll: Pennsylvania Sends VP Good Sign"},{"text":"And that's what Trump represents? 1950s family values?

I've been an import procurement officer for over 15 years.  I source raw materials from all around the world, but mainly China, about 80% give or take depending on the year/season.  When these tariffs went into place, China manufacturers didn't change anything.  every single product we import, which is in the hundreds, had the 25% tariff added and the base cost didn't move at all.  If anything, they went up.  We as the importer paid the extra 25% and we passed 100% of that cost on to our clients.  Nobody is negotiating better FOB prices, nobody is spliting the costs, or really finding alternative solutions.  They're just paying the fees and passing them onto the consumers.The thing most people dont realize is that there aren't any alternative sources for the vast majority of these raw materials.  Sure you can source some from Europe, south america, other asian countries, ect, but they don't have the supply for the world demand.  They physically can't come close to manufacturing the volumes needed for the US.  Even if they COULD keep up with demand, it wouldn't make any difference because ever single product that was now cheaper from non-chinese sources magically increased overnight to be right in the same ballpark as the Chinese material.And the US can't just not buy these products from China.  They are raw materials that we use for our manufacturing, our food production, our water treatment, ect.  Other than a few products that the US is actually competitive on, these tariffs have not hurt Chinas bottom line at all.  They literally just added a 25% increase that is 100% passed on to the consumer.EDIT:  I mean to also add in there that the 25% actual tariffs aren't just added to Chinese materials.  Those tariffs effectively caused the entire industry to increase.  Non-Chinese companies aren't going to keep their prices the same if they can come in just under the Chinese, which is exactly what they did.  Except they cant keep up with demand so we are forced to buy the Chinese materials anyway.  The Chinese tariffs are indirectly an increase on all imported raw materials the US needs for virtually everything.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"But all the right wing pearls get clutched when someone suggests that the bomb threats in Springfield Ohio that only just started for the first time in this small town might be the result of all the racist anti Haitian rhetoric from Trump and Vance.

Mortgages front load the interest payments, which don't go towards your equity.  If you don't live in the house long enough to pay less in interest than you would in rent, then all you've done is essentially pay rent to the bank while also tying up your down payment.Your down payment is also probably the most straightforward opportunity cost.  Any amount of money you tie up in the down payment is money you aren't investing elsewhere.  In other words, you pay interest - which provides zero equity - and then you also miss out on any returns you might have gotten had you invested it elsewhere.  Not to mention the risk of investing a potentially very large amount of money on a single property rather than splitting it among different stocks, bonds, and other investments.There are other costs too.  PMI if you don't have a large enough down payment.  Habitability costs like your oven, refrigerator, heating, or any other appliance failing.

In either of those cases the incidence of the tax is on the foreign producer. They didn't physically pay the tax but they suffer the consequences. Alternatively if the domestic retailer cannot negotiate a better price or find a domestic substitute it can either sacrifice its own margins or increase prices. In the former case the incidence would be split between domestic retailers and consumers (depending on how much the retainer reduced prices). In the latter case the incidence is on the consumer. \\nIn all of the above scenarios the accounting and financial plumbing of the tariff is the same, but different market conditions mean different parties are suffering the burden of the tariff.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"Reference, for those who haven't seen Blazing Saddles:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYTQ7__NNDI","title":"Joe Biden Is Bailing Out Papaws Steel Plant in JD Vances Hometown.

Most of those things were on the Conservative wish list before Trump. As such you have to identity the novel concepts Trump has added to the Republican policies as being what MAGA is, as opposed to creating some right up which would have been just as accurate to label Bush-era conservatives with.In some case like the LGblt, Obama didn't even support gay marriage when he was first elected, so that wasn't even necessarily the \\"conservative\\" position, but just like the general position, not even that long ago. Trump was the first Presidential candidate to have been elected who supported gay marriage before being elected either President or Vice-President. You can say he is just posturing, but if anything he is posturing by pretending to be more anti-gay than he actually is. His supporters might be anti-gay, but Trump himself was fairly open to LGBT stuff before becoming a candidate.The policies Trump pursues are some distorted versions of the 1950s, but more like policies from an accurate depiction of the 1850s. That was the time when the United States was pursuing a program of tariffs to promote industrialization. Bush was all like \\"If the?*terriers*?and?*bariffs*?are torn down, this economy will grow\\", that is clearly a departure from the Trumpian view on trade.I'd like to point out too that there was an internal revolt within the Republican party in the early Trump presidency as many of them had signed  some kind of Grover Norquist pledge to never raise taxes for any reason, and those people were screaming at the top of their lungs \\"TARIFFS ARE TAXES. TARIFFS ARE TAXES\\" but they were unable to influence policy, which is a massive departure from the Republican Party of the Bush and Obama years, where the Never Raise Taxes pledge was important in the various budget battles.This might seem minor but I'm trying to illustrate that MAGA is something fundamentally different than what existed before in the Republican Party, and thus you shouldn't assign anything that did exist within the Republican Party before as being associated with MAGA. \\"Conservatism\\", whatever that means, is just something that is along for the ride. Those who were \\"Conservatives\\" before Trump are just trying to get Conservative wishlist policies passed through a Trump presidency. The MAGA people are more people who want to pursue 19th century nationalism inspired policies more than anything else. It isn't stuff people have really seen in over a century, and as a result will primarily be stuff which seems \\"new\\", albeit it is actually older than pretty much anything \\"Conservatives\\" believe.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"He looks like a Dollar Tree version of Don Jr in this picture.","title":"Vance demands we love our neighbors, perhaps surprising Haitians"},{"text":"Could you explain a bit more why you think its a bandaid solution?

So let me get this straight- a conservative American can stalk the perimeter of a Kamala rally with a scoped rifle for close to 12 hours, then be shot at by the Secret Service because of his clear and obvious danger. But because he didnt get a shot off- he was not attempting to harm her? Listen to yourself man.

Maintain their margins and sell at a higher price ($11 in this case), or reduce margins to keep their price advantage. Which one they choose will depend on the demand elasticity of the product and the general value proposition of the foreign product. \\nSo it's not really true that a tariff is just a sales tax as it could just as easily act as an income tax on importers (which is I'm sure how Trump will try to sell it). However if domestic consumers are not overly price sensitive it's also possible that importers just add the tariff to the price and it's effectively a sales tax but only on imported goods. \\nAlthough I do find it a bit rich that both sides are actively peddling protectionist policies (which are almost always bad for the consumer) while finger pointing at the other for doing the same, but different.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"That comment pissed me off more than anything a politician has ever said.

Liberals tend to care most about the first two centers - care/harm, fairness/cheating - whereas conservatives are more spread out.Therefore, if you are religious (sanctity/degradation), in the military or associated with veterans (loyalty/betrayal), hold positive feelings about the police (authority/subversion), these are all going to increase the odds of holding conservative beliefs. Most of those are also things that young people are not as connected with, unless you went to a Christian school or have family members in the military/police. Later in life they might enter the military or police or church and become conservative thereafter.For context, I am a leftist. When I was in high school, I was liberal then I shifted to the right in college, and became a leftist now in my latter '20s. I think it's a matter of what items you prioritize. For me it's economic issues like unionization and income inequality so the care/harm and fairness/cheating dimensions definitely are my central interests.","title":"CMV: A lot of people dont become more conservative as they get older, its just that what it means to a liberal constantly changes and they dont fit the definition of what it used to be when they were younger."},{"text":"He is so far behind the times it is crazy and honestly it is dangerous for a sitting POTUS to keep legitimizing this party which values hate, racism, sexism, and fascism.
