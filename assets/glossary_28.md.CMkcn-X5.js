The incoming staff members spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss orders that were not yet public. The new administration will officially recognize two sexes (male and female), defined based on the reproduction cells at conception. Government agencies will issue government documents showing peoples sex at conception, stop using gender identity or preferred pronouns, and maintain women-only spaces in prisons and shelters. The measure will also direct the attorney general to write new policies about the 2020 Supreme Court ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, which found sex discrimination in employment includes gender identity and sexual orientation. The Biden administration had relied on that ruling to say the same logic applies to Title IX, the law that bars sex discrimination in schools. The action could prompt the Education Department to punish schools that recognize gender identity, for instance by allowing transgender girls access to girls bathrooms, locker rooms or sports teams. It might also affect teachers who, in some districts, are told to use students preferred names and pronouns. An incoming official said having to use someone elses preferred pronouns violates free speech. Another action will aim to eliminate government diversity programs by reviewing grants and contracts and holding regular meetings monitoring the issue. An incoming White House official named examples such as hiring people with intellectual disabilities in the Federal Aviation Administration, USDA spending on environmental justice and diversity training at the Treasury Department. The official called the measure very fitting for MLK Day, the holiday commemorating civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., which coincides with Inauguration Day this year. On immigration, Trump will deploy the military and the National Guard to finish construction of a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, require migrants to await asylum hearings in Mexico, suspend refugee resettlement for at least four months, declare gangs with foreign ties global terrorists, and stop automatically recognizing citizenship for people born in the United States to undocumented immigrants. Aides also described planned actions on the economy in vague terms. An executive order on Alaska will support liquefied natural gas exports and production of timber, oil, gas and critical minerals. Trump will also declare a national emergency to expand natural resources production and repeal Biden administration efficiency standards for cars and consumer appliances. Trump will also sign a memo directing the government to address inflation, though the details of how that would operate were not provided. Trump is not expected to impose tariffs Monday, aides said.What the actual fuck","title":"Inauguration Day updates: Donald Trump to be sworn in for the second time"},{"text":"He also pardoned all THE POLICE OFFICERS FROM THE D.C.

It took me over 50 years to really understand the link between age and wisdom.  For me it was learning that the world is so complex no good solution exists for major issues and anyone that thinks they know the right answer doesnt understand the issue.  Egomaniacs aside, as you age you care less about fighting for something to prove yourself right and are more accepting that you could be wrong.  You learn that mistakes arent the end of the world but the best opportunity to learn.  While some become locked in their beliefs with age more learn to accept their view of the world is not that of everyone else. Strong leadership and political skill take decades to learn.  I can now walk into a room of diametrically opposed factions, get them to find common ground and get them to work together.  I couldnt do this in my forties and it gets easier every year. There are counter examples of all of the above but were not talking absolutes here, were talking on average.  While I think we would be better off not having octogenarians as president, would a bunch of 35-45 year olds be inherently better?\\nThis part is less a direct argument for old leaders but it does have impact:The US government system is designed to move slowly.  I struggled for years railing against how little large organizations change and the bureaucracy of big government but consider the alternative.  Imagine the chaos if once one party took over congress or presidency they could rewrite hundreds of laws in 2-4 years.  Those politically opposed to the changes would likely win at the next election cycle and make their own hundreds of changes, many of which would be rolling back the previous changes.  It would be chaos!  You need government to move slowly so society can adjust to change.  Older politicians slow change.  While I think having a president that could die from old age while in office is a terrible risk the US is taking, the idea of people with only 3-4 decades of wisdom in that position has its own set of problems.","title":"CMV: America's government system is flawed and putting old men in office is just stupid"},{"text":"Yes.

Trump will issue other executive orders that will ramp up deportations, restart border wall construction and send U.S. troops to patrol the 2,000-mile boundary with Mexico, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules for a call with reporters set by the incoming administration. After Trump is inaugurated, he plans to declare a national emergency at the southern border.

A lot of people working together might.  So on that note...2. **Join up with the people already working to make it happen.** In most cases, that'd be [the Maryland Democrats, and their county affiliates within the 1st District](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/wiki/parties/md).  Show up to your local meeting with an attitude of \\"What can I do to help?\\"  They'll probably be thrilled to have someone new to join their work.3. **It's all about personal connections.**  Elections are, as always, won by votes.  Votes are cast by people who can be swayed by personal connection.  This will largely be up to the candidate who runs against Andy Harris, but you can play a part as well.  Talk politics with your family, friends, and coworkers.  Bit by bit, show how Trump and Mr. Harris are screwing them over, and open up their minds to the idea that better is possible.  One person doing this counts for quite a bit, and hundreds or thousands could lead to a surprise flip.4. **Look for the side benefits.**  I'm sure you know that this isn't an easy mission, and winning will be very hard.  But along the way, more Dem votes against Andy Harris could flip some State House seats on the Eastern Shore.  Maybe some county and local governments.  Maybe build a new bank of blue votes to keep Maryland blue.  I hope you knock off Harris, but even if you don't, remember that more blue voters will impact lots of other races.Good luck!

Once fascists were given power, however, mainstream conservatives / reactionaries quickly lost control and economic backing (the industrialists switched their support to the fascists). They were were eventually targeted along with all other political competitors, unlike those industrialists, who flourished under the new, even more corrupt, regime.IMHO this fits them more than the fascists who got purged alongside them, though the analogy is somewhat muddled by the fact that they're technically factions within the same political party rather than a separate reactionary party within a multiparty system. They're the past facade for oligarchy, now no longer of any use to the latter because a more direct, more violent political movement is required to keep the reactionary base's anger directed away from the billionaires behind the curtain. Like those parts of the movement itself that are no longer required, they will be discarded (if they're lucky).They are relics of a bygone political age so successful in achieving their socioeconomic goals, transferring wealth and power upwards, that they destroyed the social framework that supported them and created the rage now used by their successors to replace them. Their usefulness ended the moment rage and hate became more important than greed and selfishness as tools to mobilize their supporters. They made the bed they now lie in.","title":"Why Trumps second term populism has true conservatives like me worried"},{"text":"Trump wouldn't be able to say sentences like these","title":"My father in law hates MLK so I sent him some famous quotes"},{"text":"It's still banned....Open the Play Store or Apple Store and try to download or update TikTok, you cannot.The app was never \\"banned\\" it was removed from all market places in the US for download, which was told to all of us originally.","title":"Can we be there when Trump finds out?"},{"text":"Okay, still not force.?","title":"Biden pardons Fauci and Milley in an effort to guard against potential 'revenge' by Trump"},{"text":"Nixon had flags at half-mast during his inauguration in 1973, guess Nixon just had more class than your guy.","title":"U.S. Flags Raised to Full-Staff at Capitol for Trump's Inauguration"},{"text":"Update us when you tell him","title":"My father in law hates MLK so I sent him some famous quotes"},{"text":"Fine, then don't disagree when people say \\"both sides\\".

Also wondering. It is difficult for us over here to describe what we see without using words which may be interpreted as insulting. But the world really needs to understand what kind of USA we will see for the rest of this century. Because it will be this century which will determine the future of Homo Sapiens as a viable species living in some form of organized society. It is not the best century for the USA to become totally mad.One thing is obvious. There is no other nation where half of the population would be willing to (re-)elect a Donald Trump. It is almost like if German voters were willing to give Hitler a second term after WWII.So there is something like \\"Amercan Exceptionalism\\" after all. It just does not mean what Americans themselves like to think.I'm old. So there were still ruins in Hamburg the first time I was there with my parents. We lived in Denmark, a couple of hours driving away from there. - At that time all the grown-ups had experienced WWII, the Germans and the Nazis first-hand. So I know history from all of my family (and everybody else at that time).Lots of Germans supported Hitler in the 1920's and 1930's. Because Germany were in a bad state of affairs after WWI. The very harsh peace treaty more or less became the starting poing for WWII. It was too harsh.So Germans in the 1920's and 1930's were in a situation which is similar to what is the case in many red US states today. We can see that the demographics of Hitler supporters and Trump supporters is similar.The difference with Trump supporters is that they should know better. There as never been so much real information available to everybody, at there is now. So there is no real \\"excuse\\" for being ignorant about the realities of the world.Americans have this obsession with \\"conspiracies\\" for just about everything. Someday we will perhaps hear a conspiracy about that the sky is really pink, but that Democrates somehow has made some \\"underlay\\" to make it appear blue. And it will never occur to them that ther fictive god actually made the sky blue for a reason. As kind of a hint to American voters. Or some other totally mad conspiracy like the Jewish Space Laser igniting fires in California.Americans also seem to love being brain washed. We see that with Fox News every day. And after many years of brain washing it is now impossible to make them accept reality. So we have to get to the word \\"stupidity\\". There is no way around it. My wife has a simple answer: It must be something in their food!A very entertaining (but also dangerous for society) example is the \\"Sovreign Citizen movement\\". See Wikipedia if you don't know what this is. We see it a little bit here in Europe as well, because the USA is not the only country which have idiots. The USA just have so many more than other countries. A PhD in \\"American insanity\\" would be very interesting reading. And almost a necessity so the rest of the world can learn how to live on the same planet as the USA we see now.","title":"Can someone explain to a European what is going on over there?"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|rou0CTAp6Z8VW)","title":"Can we be there when Trump finds out?"},{"text":"Sounds exactly like you guys think and have operated for years now, yes.

Racism is common sense to a racist, for example. A misogynist probably feels its common sense that women should be at home making babies. Some years ago, some would say common sense tells you the world is flat.Common sense isnt always reality. It isnt always fact. It is a state of understanding that can vary from person to person.This is just a way for MAGA to ignore science and experts on the topics they want full control over. They will make their policy common sense and overrule the science and anyone who dares stand in their way. This works especially well with issues that are too complex for the general public to take time to understand. Economic ideas by Trump may seem like common sense to the average Joe, but that Joe may have a very limited understanding of how economics works. Same could be said with a plethora of other issues from international relations to even why someone is transgender or homosexual. The general public doesnt understand the complexities beyond their own experience and education. And people like Trump take full advantage of that. This type of thinking can also be incredibly dangerous. This can cause a democracy to completely destroy itself.

It would be interesting to see what time period and actions they specifically cover.I ask because as of now it appears that only Gen Milley and Dr. Fauci are the only ones to formally accept the pardons. But according to Burdick v US (1915) accepting the pardon has the following implications:1. Admission of guilt for the offenses (potential) pardoned2. Waiver of 5th Amendment rights against self incrimination because it will not be possible3. May not lose or have constitutional right impaired as punishment. 4. All punishments real (in progress) or potential are commuted. So potentially Gen Milley and Dr. Fauci could be compelled to testify to the items pardoned. And if its broadly worded and dated like Hunters it would be even more of a weapon than a shield. With all that said, I think this will be an unintended gift to this administration as it removes a distraction from their path towards their goals.","title":"Biden Burns Trump One Final Time With Last-Minute Pardons\\n"},{"text":"Its a gay anthem celebrating pre aids gay male gang bangs MAGA","title":"Can we stop playing the stupid fucking YMCA song plesase?"},{"text":"No but it was a war criminal so I'd see why you'd \\"forget\\" that one.","title":"This is how you know they're guilty--Biden pardons Fauci and others"},{"text":"Haha plenty of us know that they rigged the election.","title":"Not allowed to enter: Jan. 6 rioter who got green light to attend Trump inauguration must stay away from Capitol as ceremony moves indoors"},{"text":"Tea time!","title":"Inauguration Live Thread"},{"text":"What did they do to commit those crimes?","title":"Biden issues pardons to protect Milley, Fauci, Cheney from Trump retaliation"},{"text":"They, trump and Elon are on video talking about their secret, trump on several occasions has said people dont need to vote, Elon is talking about how easy is is to hack the computers and actually called trump the winner by a specific count before the election ended.

Now there is no legal right for Fauci to use the 5th amendment when questioned by Congress and if  lies you can charge him. The greatest thing the democrats did was go after Trump. In my opinion going after Democrats and having long investigations and trials would have sucked the energy out of getting things done.

You're allowed not to say anything, and the law is legally not allowed \\nto take that silence as evidence of wrongdoing. Now, another executive power that is similar is commuting of sentences, and I think this does carry a connotation of guilt.

Their obscene wealth will be built upon our suffering. They speak of democracy, but their actions will reek of tyranny.They will mock our freedoms, erode equality, and impose oppression. They promise dreams, but will deliver a collective nightmare.Tomorrow, I will rise, not in anger, but with a profound sadness that fuels my resolve. I will channel this righteous indignation into a force for positive change.I will strategize, plan, and advocate for a more just nation C one where decency and fairness guide our leaders. A nation where the voices of the oppressed are finally heard.Kleptocracy will leave another hideous scar on the history of the United States of America.

Their mission is focused on cutting government spending: Musk and Ramaswamy paid an early visit to Capitol Hill to discuss their efforts with lawmakers, and the creation of the Senate DOGE Caucus soon followed.According to the fact sheet, DOGE will oversee a substantial reduction in the size and scope of government and operate within the U.S. government, a potentially notable mandate given its creation as an outside-of-government entity.The work is slated to begin with a focus on modernizing information technology across the government, including an update to its software thats designed to be comparable with private-sector companies.The group will also be working with Trumps Cabinet picks to implement reforms, and the executive order directs every federal agency to establish its own DOGE team.DOGE will work with the Office of Management and Budget and all agencies to shrink the federal workforce, federal spending, and federal regulatory burdens, the fact sheet notes.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/20/2025/trump-uses-one-of-first-executive-orders-to-officially-create-doge?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Trump uses one of first executive orders to officially create DOGE"},{"text":"Bold of you to claim MAGA was educated once before.","title":"Biden pardons Fauci and Milley in an effort to guard against potential 'revenge' by Trump"},{"text":"I do not care that Trump says he's going after these guys.

Have you done any sort of research into DJT, who the family is, the bloodline, and who he has gotten involved with over the years?  Besides what you hear the media say about him or what he says about himself on his social media platforms.For starters, Im curious as to who you think the deep state is?  Who is this shadowy figure you speak of? I know who the players are but Id like to hear from someone who uses the term deep state, I tend to think anyone saying that hasnt even scratched the surface on what actually goes on at HIGH levels of power.The start of his real estate career was given to him by the Rockefeller family, specifically David Rockefeller in the 1980s.  You dont develop in Manhattan without the approval of this family.  This family played a role in the development of the twin towers as well as their destruction.  9/11.  And considering how easily he walked into his position of all star real estate developer all the way to the Presidency, he has been prepped for his current position probably since birth.  Decades of training in the spotlight has prepared him for what hes doing right now.  His father has the middle name Christ And his mothers name was Mary. I doubt this is who is actual parents are but both of them look insane.  And considering the damage this individual has done to families, specifically Christian families, and really Christianity in general, its ALMOST AS IF HES THE ANTI CHRIST THESE CHRISTIANS WHO SUPPORT HIM HAVE BEEN WARNING ABOUT.  DECEPTION IS A POWERFUL TOOL, AND PEOPLE AT THE HIGH LEVELS HAVE MASTERED IT.He claims to be the father of the COVID vaccine which is step 1 of the Mark of the Beast program in revelations.  Inject people with AI technology that connects them to the blockchain, then drain their bank accounts and cause absolute chaos, and offer the simple solution of getting normalcy back and your money back with a UPC code stamped on your forehead or wrist.  Think it sounds far fetched? Itll probably happen this year.  Everyone vaccinated and stamped will be a complete slave connected to the blockchain, EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM CONSTANTLY MONITORED. So yeah, this guy is one of the most evil and wicked individuals to ever exist on this Earth.  Congrats on supporting this, to be honest its worth killing your self over if you know what all\\nDJT has done behind the scenes and you sit here and cheer him on.

This kind of wording would prevent someone from going and looking for other avenues to convict the individual that havent already been pursued.In this case if you take the example of Fauci, Biden is essentially saying I understand everything youve done and the reasons for it.

Mark Milley and members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, using the extraordinary powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential revenge by the incoming Trump administration.The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him.The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense, Biden said in a statement. Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.The pardons, announced with just hours left in his presidency, have been the subject of heated debate for months at the highest levels of the White House. Its customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his term, but those acts of mercy are usually offered to Americans who have been convicted of crimes. Biden has used the power in the broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not even been investigated yet. The decision lays the groundwork for an even more expansive use of pardons by Trump and future presidents.","title":"Biden pardons Fauci and Milley in an effort to guard against potential 'revenge' by Trump"},{"text":"*sigh* You're right.

If you want to become a libertarian, I do encourage you to view liberty as a holistic goal, reducing harm from both the war machine and the welfare state simultaneously, while empowering private solutions and markets to address social and economic issues. Keep exploring these ideas, and you may find your perspective aligns more with libertarianism than you think.Some stuff I would criticize:1. Fiscal conservation is crucial, but relying on tax increases empowers the state further and punishes productive citizens. Trust me, there are so many useless government programs you can get rid of.2. The longer the safety net exists, the harder it becomes to dismantle. It creates a dependency that traps people in poverty and distorts markets, preventing solutions from emerging. 3. If I understood right, you wanna remove lobbying with the help of the government? Lobbying exists \\"because\\" the government has too much power to grant favors. The solution isnt more regulation or reform, its reducing the governments influence so theres nothing left to lobby for.4.

First off, Putin is one of the most likely to go off his deep end of all the leaders except maybe Netanyahu because he and Kim Jong just live off the deep end. So, it's kind of hard to say if he would attempt something. But that's no reason not to move forward. The US truly has a multi decade lead on military tech MINIMUM. I don't think we've really needed to be afraid of world war or nuclear war since 1948. The governments around the world seem to be in on the ploy of foreign threats to tax the literal fuck out of their people. The idea of nuclear war is not going away anytime soon. But equally, I don't think we truly need to fear it. Isn't that why we had children practicing desk dives AFTER WWII? to instill the fear? We all know there is no surviving under a desk...So, imo. Yes, Putin is always a threat, sanction or not. He's one of the only guys around who has centered his whole life on this leadership, feels the intense pressure of building up a post war economy, constantly failing at it as the US backed out of economic promises with Russia during the old wars... like he's desperate that his name is cemented this way. The guy who forced himself forward as the high king, yet failed to use it well. I see this situation as a boiling point issue. Sanctions may raise the temp, but he raises his own temp everyday he gets closer to death without much progress. So, let's sanction away. Also, I'm not a trump supporter but part of me loves day dreaming that his whole shtick is a psyop so he can get access to guys like Putin and Kim Jong only to fk their stuff up.

To quote that is not to make a judgement about the rights and wrongs of this robust shift of the mood in corporate America. It is simply to note that a lot of what is happening in the US now has strong echoes in the past.Coolidge presided over the Roaring Twenties, taking office in August 1923 and stepping down in March 1929 C just seven months short of the great Wall Street crash that October. Parallels are never perfect, and we are nowhere near the excesses of the latter 1920s. But it is worth remembering that market bubbles build up and then pop. There are some warning signs now of the bubble mentality, and some worries already reflected in the markets. Shares had a good day yesterday, but the bounce in share prices that followed Trumps victory has been largely reversed.The concern C and this is the poisoned chalice point C is what will happen when the country has to cut its federal budget deficit, now running at over 7 per cent of GDP, and when exactly that will come.Read Hamish McRae's latest newsletter here: [https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trumps-economic-bubble-might-burst-3482832](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trumps-economic-bubble-might-burst-3482832)","title":"Trump's economic bubble might burst"},{"text":"Hamish McRae writes:A new and different American political era begins on Monday, as Donald Trump becomes the 47th president of the United States. But a different economic era? Well, maybe not.There are solid reasons to expect the US to continue to outpace the rest of the developed world, but that will have little to do with the policies of the next administration and much to do with the extraordinary innovative energy of American business and finance. And one hangover of the Biden years, the huge fiscal deficit, will increasingly overshadow the financial markets C that may turn out to be an unwelcome drag on the economy over the next couple of years.So in one sense Biden leaves an enviable legacy; but in another, a poisoned chalice.**Confidence on the up**Step back a moment. The US equity market has had an extraordinary two years, with the most important share index, the S&amp;P 500, up by more than 20 per cent in both 2023 and 2024. Joe Biden got very little credit for that, partly because for many Americans this meant that the rich got even richer, while people not owning shares failed to benefit at all. Indeed, insofar as the surge in share prices was associated with inflation, they were worse off.But you cant take away from the fact that the markets were reflecting confidence in big American companies and in the high-tech giants, the so-called Magnificent Seven C Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), and Tesla C in particular. The share index that focuses on the high-tech sector, the Nasdaq, was up nearly 30 per cent last year.So Donald Trump takes office buoyed up by the hugely confident business sector. Its leaders have been quick not only to voice support but also to trim their policies to fit the new political wind in Washington. Several gave donations, and he has hired one, Elon Musk, to try to streamline the federal bureaucracy.Other random examples of the pro-business (and pro-Republican) climate include the push-back against employees working from home C JP Morgan Chase wants workers back in the office five days a week C and the shift away from investment in enterprises that score high on environmental, social, and governance measures.BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager, has announced that it will leave the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative, a group seeking to push funding towards investments that will cut carbon emissions.And the rollback of fact-checking and content moderation at Facebook and Instagram, announced last week by Metas chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, while presented as a reduction in censorship, seems to be a response to pressure by Trump.That famous quotation of former US president Calvin Coolidge C the chief business of the American people is business C very much applies.","title":"Trump's economic bubble might burst"},{"text":"Don't be fooled:https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ekm48/trump_turning_away_intelligence_briefers_since/dad6zxq/(And this is before the first Trump administration got underway in full.)","title":"Mike Pence Defies Trump, Comes Out Against RFK Jr. for Health Secretary"},{"text":"It takes someone with balls to support him with all the crap that comes along with it.","title":"Celebrities that support Donald Trump appreciation post.

Some are even defending their votes by pointing out how he never did the things he says he'll do.  They don't see that as disqualifying.  They have no idea what he'll do in office, and that's what they chose to lend their support to.

It's much more like a machine, with a whole lot of people that don't change between one presidency and the next.I did vote for Trump, but not that I think for a moment he represents any of us... I was just desperate for a new chapter. That last one was terrible.But I'm not naive to think this will be better, we'll just be looted and have our rights stolen out from under us in other new and interesting ways.Seriously though, really think about what the office of president is... Think about how much money people like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, Soros, Buffet and others have. And those are the people we know about.With that much monetary power, would they just let random people in that could swing the country against them? God no... The President answers to these people, and others. The President is a salesperson to push an agenda, and a face to take the blame when the people realize they've been ripped off.Then they start a new chapter with the perception of change -- but it's really just a rebrand of the same overall agenda... One that ends with us being poorer and with fewer rights.If war \\"stops\\" under Trump that's great, but if it stops it's because it was time to stop. Not because Trump singlehandedly said, \\"I'm putting an end to this!\\"Presidents don't have power like that.Think of the guy you interact with when you buy a car. The salesman.

So obviously those are promises we cannot make on behalf of the United States for any longer than the next five days. And so its critical that all of the parties to the agreement and the other mediators see that when the United States is in the room making commitments, those are lasting commitments that extend beyond this administration into the next one.I C let me C I will just say lastly I dont know if its unprecedented to have envoys from an outgoing and an incoming administration sitting at the same table negotiating a ceasefire agreement of this kind, but if its not unprecedented, its certainly unusual, and we of course thank the Trump team for working with this, on this ceasefire agreement.

The US military ([DARPA](https://drasticresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/defuse-project-rejection-by-darpa.pdf 'Nor does the proposal mention or assess Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) issues, and thus fails to present a DURC risk mitigation plan.')) advised the authors that their proposal involved \\"dual use\\" technology, meaning that there was both a military and civilian use of that technology, the difference largely being whether or not the virus remained within the interior of that lab.  A release into the public sphere would result in the pathogen acquiring a \\"bioweapon\\" status.It isn't as though the researchers *weren't* building a bioweapon.

Now, one would have to question how it is that we have a military that can recognize dual use research before it happens, and fails to recognize dual use research gone awry after the accident, showing symptoms such as the Chinese military building hospitals overnight and a pathogen with extreme contagiousness spreading rapidly overnight.

Brad Tabke, of Shakopee, who won reelection by 14 votes even after local elections officials said 20 ballots were accidentally destroyed without being counted. A judge earlier Tuesday declared that Tabke was the legal winner and rejected a GOP effort to force a special election in the swing district that they potentially could have won.&amp;nbsp; That gave the GOP a 67-66 majority until a special election can take place there in two weeks.

As long as government HAS that power, people will lobby for access to that power. Even if you get rid of professional lobbyists, lots of interested people will still lobby, because they can get things they want, if they can force their will on others with the power of Government Guns. To be blunt, the key to actually shrinking anything and balancing the budget is to somehow move certain things out of the Federal government's control. I'm actually not sure how this can be done, it might be a supreme court thing, where we get some people that will just roll back the government to its constitutional roles, and none of the other things that it does. It seems to me any cuts will just be un-cut, as soon as the other guys get back into office. There is so much Uniparty consensus around big government, that we really need to build up a viable third party, just to have a chance to do any of the cuts you dream about.

I think you're looking at this divide with California's fires from the standpoint of media and not from the standpoint of appropriate action. We're talking about people in their homes we're talking about businesses we're talking about a significant portion of a state with Americans in it that was destroyed. I may have my own personal opinions of the State of California but those personal opinions are going to have to be put aside until after it's over okay I am in North Carolina and I lived through Helene and I have opinions about my state not being prepared for such a thing when they knew about it. I also have opinions about the help we received which was not enough it really wasn't my entire hometown is gone and there's no way it's coming back and my government's not going to cut a check like they would California to fix it. but that doesn't mean I'm going to be injecting political divide into the event itself while it's going on. After Helene was over you better believe I talk shit about the federal government for saying we only needed $750 to get back on her feet and it was alone it wasn't even just a a stimulus type of thing like they could print money for whatever they want but they couldn't print money to fix my state and my town? Of course I'm salty about that. By changing the angle at which were to view the Californian wildfires away from what's happening and interject something as menial as politics into it you end up being the person that dehumanizes The Californians who lost their lives at homes their families. There's plenty of time California governments management over lack of fire hydrants with water and lack of reservoir as well as lack of staffing before the begins after the disaster is over after relief has happened after people picking themselves up as started. And yes you was a person have a right to say and promote whatever you like but just imagine does everyone who lost their home they're really care about your political opinion or someone else's political opinion or do they care whether you're going to donate a dollar to whoever is trying to help rebuild? As charged in politics as I Am there is a time and place for everything a a natural disaster or a disaster during the process is not the appropriate time and it just diminishes your position because now people perceive you or anyone else is trying to capitalize on This disaster to make a point on something that has nothing tangible to affect what's going on at the moment.
