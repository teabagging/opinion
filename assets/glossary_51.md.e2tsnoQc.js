Here's a perspective on why someone might choose to become a Democrat:# 1. Commitment to Equality and JusticeThe Democratic Party emphasizes social and economic equality, striving to address systemic inequities and promote civil rights for all. If you value fairness and want a government that actively works to dismantle barriers based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or economic background, the Democratic platform aligns with those goals.# 2. Advocacy for Social Safety NetsDemocrats believe in using government resources to support those in need. Programs like affordable healthcare (e.g., the Affordable Care Act), Social Security, and education funding aim to provide opportunities for everyone to thrive. If you believe society benefits when everyone has a safety net, this is a core tenet of Democratic values.  \\nSo yeah not much to look at there. ??","title":"Convince me to become a republican."},{"text":"#zuckthecuck","title":"Zuckerberg says he will work with Trump!"},{"text":"Quebec can become its own country.

Here are some key reasons why people choose to align with the Republican Party:1. Limited Government and Individual LibertyRepublicans often emphasize the importance of limited government intervention in personal and economic matters. If you value personal responsibility, entrepreneurship, and the freedom to make decisions without excessive government oversight, Republican policies may align with your beliefs.2. Economic FreedomRepublicans advocate for lower taxes and less regulation, believing these policies encourage economic growth, innovation, and job creation. If you prioritize a free-market economy where businesses and individuals have greater control over their finances, this approach may resonate with you.3. Strong National DefenseThe Republican Party often prioritizes a robust national defense, supporting policies that maintain military strength and protect national security. If you believe in a proactive approach to security and international affairs, this may be a compelling factor.4. Traditional ValuesMany Republicans emphasize the importance of traditional social values, including family, faith, and community. If these principles guide your worldview, Republican platforms may reflect your cultural and social priorities.5. Second Amendment RightsThe Republican Party is a strong advocate for protecting the right to bear arms. If you believe in the constitutional right to own firearms for self-defense, hunting, or other purposes, this position could align with your beliefs.6. Federalism and State RightsRepublicans often support decentralizing power to states and local governments, believing that decision-making closer to the people is more effective. If you support more localized governance, this aspect of the Republican platform may appeal to you.Final ThoughtUltimately, political affiliation should be based on careful consideration of your values and how different platforms address the issues that matter most to you. Its important to explore policies, engage in discussions, and stay informed to make a choice that best represents your vision for society","title":"Convince me to become a republican."},{"text":"Don't acknowledge him.

The reasons for the rates increases are multifaceted but the bottom line is that it has hurt US trade both internally and internationally. The USA built the Panama canal, and it probably was better managed when the US had control of it, and now it's got infrastructure issues and China is trying to build a competitor canal in Nicaragua. I think it's a strong arm tactic to get the Panamians to reduce the rates and probably work out some sort of infrastructure deal to fix the issues with the canal currently.

Even if most people never catch it so it's not actually a problem.Covid was such an exaggerated threat that they had to use a 45+ cycle PCR test to detect it, and Kary Mullis -- inventor of the test and lifelong critic of Fauci -- said the test can register nearly anything in someone with enough cycles.Then widespread testing was issued and early on they counted ALL DEATHS within 60 days as Covid deaths, lol... They did that until they hit their pandemic deadline so they could keep the 2017 World Bank/WHO Pandemic Bonds (another issue you know nothing about, more evidence that this was planned.)The they lowered it to 28 days, but still - people were dying WITH Covid, not FROM Covid. This is old news...And Covid deaths had an average of 3.5 comorbidities anyway.So yeah, maybe if you are an obese Redditor that never leaves his chair and fills his body with Mountain Dew and processed food constantly then you should live in fear...But it's your lifestyle that's killing you.

Consider: the Trump administration passed only one bill of consequence, which was [deeply unpopular](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-tax-cuts-are-even-more-unpopular-than-past-tax-hikes/) despite being a tax *cut.* The magnitude of fury over the official implementation of the family separation policy was so intense, Trump [backtracked](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/20/622095441/trump-executive-order-on-family-separation-what-it-does-and-doesnt-do) in two months.

Reuters obtained the December report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz through a public records request. The report found the officials improperly shared details with two media outlets about the department's plans to collect data on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes located in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan, four states with Democratic governors who had come under fire for their handling of the pandemic. The leak **will be our last play on them before the election but its a big one**, one of the officials wrote in a text obtained by investigators. The report did not identify the employees, though one of them worked in the Justice Department's public affairs office. They no longer work at the department, according to the inspector general's office. \\"The conduct of these senior officials raised serious questions about the partisan political motivation for their actions in proximity to the 2020 election,\\" Horowitz wrote. Federal prosecutors began looking at deaths in nursing homes in the middle of 2020, as the pandemic was cutting a deadly path through some facilities. The review focused on facilities in New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all of which had Democratic governors who had issued orders requiring the homes to accept COVID patients. The Inspector General concluded that Trump administration officials instructed attorneys to **focus specifically on New Jersey and New York despite having been provided data indicating that the nursing homes with the most significant quality of care issues were in other states.** In October 2020, department officials sent letters to the governors of New York and New Jersey seeking more information about nursing home deaths. The inspector general said the officials provided the letters to the New York Post before they reached the governors, and that another official spoke anonymously to the newspaper. That, the report said, violated the departments policies limiting contacts with the press.","title":"DOJ officials may have tried to sway 2020 election for Trump, watchdog says"},{"text":"To give us the illusion of choice.

Keep in mind, the Canal moves not only ships but also cargo and energy materials seamlessly through interconnected supply chains. The locks system is complemented by advanced port infrastructure, intermodal transport systems, and energy distribution networks that enable the efficient transfer of goods, including critical resources like LNG and petroleum.I wish Nicaragua the best.

Northern shipping route through the Arctic.** Currently Russia and Canada have the largest claim to the arctic circle and thus naval control over some of the shortest shipping lanes in the world from Asia to Europe and the US East coast. With global warming/climate change, these northern routes are more viable than ever for transporting large amounts of cargo around the world without having to either go through the Panama Canal (Central America), the Cape of Good Hope (Africa), or the Drake Passage (South America). **2. Military Bases and Air Traffic Control** In World War II the US had considered (albeit very briefly) the idea of creating a giant aircraft carrier made of ice and wood to use as a floating air force base to shorten the travel distances between the US and Europe and/or the US and Asia. Greenland would work in a very similar way, but wouldn't require the building of an artificial island made out of wood and ice. Alaska works in a similar way in the west for the US military as a stopping point when traveling to and from Asia. Anchorage, AK is one of the busiest airports in the world due to how it allows international airfreight to reach so many places around the world. It also allows for easy control of airspace in and around the arctic circle. With Alaska's location, it enables the US military to watch for incoming air based attacks on the US. This means planes and missiles coming over the north polar region are identified more quickly giving US defense systems more time to react. Greenland's location would have a similar advantage. **3. Mineral Resources** It is believed that Greenland has a massive amount of mineral resources hidden under the layers of glacier ice. With China pledging to cut the US economy off of cheap minerals, Greenland looks like a cheap alternative that doesn't directly effect Americans. Because it is so remote, there are not many people to be negatively impacted by strip mining for rare earth metals and the byproducts of said activity. There are also possible oil reserves in and around Greenland that would be beneficial to the US, but that is just purely speculation.","title":"Why Does Trump Want Greenland?"},{"text":"Two years tops.

As Ive stated in my initial comment (and will expand on): women have the choice/right to have an abortion if that is what they believe is right for them to do, restricting that choice is infringement on the womans autonomy. By no means should there be any laws pertaining to the state enforcement of banning abortions or state enforcement of giving abortions, it should be the mothers choice.

The only anti-trans legislation revealed in this article is:   *to amend the Education Amendments of 1972 to provide that for purposes of determining compliance with title IX of such Act in athletics, sex shall be recognized based solely on a persons reproductive biology and genetics at birth.*The dozens of comments comparing this to Nazi Germany are fringe, bizarre, and alienating to majority of Americans that support the fundamental legal protections. Many of the comments on this post are what makes our party seem out of touch. Democratic Montana State Representative Zoey Zephyr tweeting, were every bit as biologically female as cis women is a perfect illustration of how going too far plagues the party brand. Virtually no one believes that is true or sane, but no one called her out for fear of backlash.Wed be in a much better situation if every trans-related policy or view wasnt treated as an all or nothing proposition. The reality is there a divergent views within the Democratic Party, and outside of some fundamental protections, most trans-related policies are unpopular, many overwhelming so. When no distinctions are made and anyone with less than total support for every policy faces backlash, the issues start to be viewed as a toxic bundle backed by a radical mob that people want little or nothing to do with.","title":"House Republicans Reveal their Top Legislative Priority: Attacking Transgender Rights"},{"text":"They did vote yes to becoming an independent nation separate from Denmark a few days ago","title":"Trump refuses to rule out using US military to annex Greenland"},{"text":"Precisely.

Most of us don't live in squalor, and those of us who eat healthy food, exercise, and avoid unnecessary injections don't have to worry.Throughout history, most serious illnesses are a result of people either living in disgusting scenarios... Or else a result of environmental toxins.Poliomyelitis for example was largely a result of self-poisoning &amp; environmental harm. From mercurial powders to arsenic medications for those early cases --- but then as they made pesticides like Paris green, lead arsenate, and especially DDT commonplace, that's when the problem really got out of control.And coincidentally --- those harmful products were taken out of use just after the vaccines were introduced. But also, polio is caused by a number of things -- and the vaccine only addressed ONE... Except the poliovirus is mostly harmless if a person's organs are functioning normally. (i.e. not suffering from damage caused by consumption of heavy metals.)In other words -- polio was largely a manmade issue. Not an external thing to fear, but rather our own government and corporations.You should read \\"The Moth in the Iron Lung: A Biography of Polio\\" but I know you won't. Your perception of the world is shaped by corporatized \\"science\\" though, which is entirely for profit.  That means lying at times to avoid massive lawsuits, and also covering up harm because there is an immense amount of profit to be made on the back end of treating people for harm.Autism, for example, is an 18 billion dollar a year industry in the US alone -- and that is almost entirely a result of our vaccination program.But there are also common issues like speech impediments that are caused by vaccine injections... And nervous system disorders, cancer, and autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis.The problem is you trust and worship corporations while criticizing people who try to point you in the right direction.Read that book.

In Afghanistan, he substantially increased the number of airstrikes. In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the violent Saudi-led war against the Houthis. Trump dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone.What's more, Trump reversed Obama-era policy that required reporting on drone strike deaths.Trump cozied up to dictators, Putin in particular, glorifying the world's autocrats and oppressors.Trump sought to veto Russian sanctions, aided Russian proxy wars, considered returning spy bases to Russia, encouraged Russian cyber attacks, repeated Kremlin propaganda, particularly about NATO, the annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine. He has proposed abandoning our western alliances, and even sided with Putin over our own intelligence agencies.Trump supported one of Putin's greatest goalsweakening NATO. Senior administration officials revealed that multiple times during his presidency, Trump said he wanted to withdraw from NATO.Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \\"delinquent.\\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.Then there's the time Trump almost tweeted us into a nuclear war with NK.And how he made close allies with the Saudi crown Prince, Muhammad bin Salman.Trump practically defended Salman after the grotesque murder of Jamal khashoggi, and intervened in the bombings of thousands of innocent civilians in Yemen. he also tried cold selling weapons to Salman in the White House and right in front of cameras mind you.Trump was seen as such a dangerous interventionist that Congress passed not one, but two historic war powers resolutions to end his support for the Yemen war and to lessen the possibility of a potential war with Iran after he approved the assassination of Iranian Qassem SoleimaniTrump also abandoned the Kurds, America's middle east allies that have fought in more wars alongside U.S. troops than Donald \\"bone spurs\\" Trump ever did. And this move only heightened conflict in the Middle East while aiding Russian proxies.During the Trump administration, the U.S. was also engaged in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and more than 60 American soldiers died in hostile action.Trump withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in more provocations in the region and Iran scaling up its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it wouldve taken Iran at least a year.Trump also cozied up to Netanyahu and formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the American embassy there, he also formally acknowledged Israel's annexation of Golan heights, only aggravating tensions in the region.His \\"middle east peace deal\\" was poorly contrived, amateurish, laughably brief and insincere, and actually did the opposite of what it suggests, compromising our ability to act as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump didn't even conceive of it himself. In fact, It was more of a political stunt than anything as it happened to coincide with his re-election campaign.Trump literally negotiated with terrorists and ordered direct talks with the Taliban without consulting with our allies and partners or allowing the Afghan government at the negotiating tableTrump emboldened the Taliban by publicly inviting them to Camp David on the anniversary of 9/11.As part of the withdrawal deal, Trump also pressured the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison, including senior war commanders, without securing the release of the only American hostage known to be held by the Taliban.During the transition from the Trump to Biden, the outgoing Administration provided no plans for how to conduct the final withdrawal or to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies.There's also Trump's disastrous tariff policies.Donald Trump started a trade war with China that hurt Americans BIGLY. Nearly every economist agrees that Trump's tariff policies did more harm than good. And there's an even greater consensus around the fact that Trump's latest tariff proposals will be far more damaging for most Americans. Trump's tariffs will generate world wide economic tensions and pass costs down to American consumers. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.Trump criticizes Biden for the \\"trade deficit,\\" but in reality:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.In truth, Trump has never been an isolationist, And despite his supporters attempts to deem him as one.And although we're being told that Trump's repeated threats to annex Canada shouldn't be taken seriously, along with his plans to colonize Greenland, rename the Gulf, and seize international trade routes, part of the reason why Trump got elected in the first place, is because the media and the general public have all but sane-washed and normalized his absurdity, magically rendering him benign in the process, and despite the fact that he and his MAGA allies intend to follow through on some of their ridiculous and disastrous proposals.And in case you haven't noticed, Trump's most vocal supporters are all in on some of these ideas. Even going so far as to defend him as some kind of genius tactician and tough guy bringing back American expansionism.Keep in mind that some of this is Trump doing damage control for his harmful trade and tariff policies, and he's not even in office yet It wasn't too long ago that these same people were lauding Trump for being such a firm nationalist, wary of getting involved in the affairs of foreign countries, but as I've established, this has always been a fantasy.That being said, some of Trump's defenders are now reversing their stance and trying desperately to justify his taste for expansionism and his aggressive foreign policy. All of a sudden, he's now being praised as some hardened American strategist and conqueror.","title":"Trudeau hits back at Trump on Canada annexation: There isnt a snowballs chance in hell"},{"text":"Ban them.

Expecting trans people to solely fight this is asking what like .01% of the population to battle what feels like more than half the country? This whole thing is politicizing people going to take a dump when statistically speaking this is such a political non-issue. I cant be the only one that views the whole debate on topic as culture war nonsense right?To be clear, I dont think a debate is needed: trans people should use whatever goddamn bathroom they want/feel more comfortable using. All Im saying is the fact that this blatant discrimination is being used as a political wedge point hurts my brain. Frankly, it gets me even angrier knowing that it worked! Im so tired of race and gender being made controversial political issues, but I guess I shouldve seen this coming with the rise in openly accepted racism and sexism they were throwing at Obama and Clinton back in the day. So I guess that leads me to one thought: why is hatred so popular now, and how did we get to the point that so many people are using hatred and apathy as their reasons to vote?Like seriously, how did we fucking get here? We were doing so good by passing gay marriage, healthcare reform, and anti-discrimination laws to revoking Roe v Wade, demonizing trans people and celebrating extra-judicial murderers?? It feels like all the MAGA Rhetoric from 2016 to now has filled the same swamp their voters wished to drain with an insidious poison.

But the CORE components are there and transparent. No other platform does that!If you yourself admit that you think they are playing games behind the scenes with the algorithm then this is nothing more than a publicity stunt. Having the \\"core\\" components visible without knowing how they are being manipulated behind the scenes is like having the source code of a voting machine be open source but not caring about who has access to the admin passwords for it.Facebook donated $1M to Obama Inauguration fund. Why the double standards now?That was bad too (which is why Obama in 2009 had rejected all such donations). But it was just \\"corruption as usual\\" and not the major escalation we're seeing today.The (Bush) Republican that replaced Nick Clegg was his deputy director member of Meta global affairs team since 2011.And do you think that the timing of his promotion is just a coincidence?Only Dana White appointement that appears to be a political posturing move.I'll be honest: I'm not American.You can sane wash all of this corruption as much as you want, but just be aware that people looking on from other countries see the slide from robust democracy to oligarchy. We watched it happen in Russia, and the slide in America is concerning.If these things were happening in my country, I'd be sounding an alarm instead of pretending its totally normal. Or to the extent that it is normal (bribing incoming administrations with the inauguration), that in itself would be alarming.What exactly is your motivation for pretending this is all normal and cool? For the boards of private companies to be decided by politicians, for executive roles to coordinate with political turnover and for owners of social media to be part of government?

That propaganda *works*.It actually fkn *works*.  We have all seen it -- people who initially seemed reasonable and somewhat moral and sensible, being brainwashed within a year of going down QAnon or MAGA rabbit holes, getting sucked into antivaxx frenzy, Covid-is-a-hoax drivel, schools-are-turning-kids-trans drivel, 5G superstitions.Cults are scary enough when they attract just a few hundred members and something batsht evil and crazy happens like Jonestown and the Kool-Aid.  But honestly I never imagined that the internet and cable TV would be so effective in enabling the plutocrats to recruit for giant, distributed, non-co-located cults and then weaponise those into a voting bloc.When you talk to MAGA true believers, you might as well be talking to a Branch Dravidian.  And I don't say this just because they disagree with me on specific issues like taxation.  I mean that they are firmly attached to demonstrably counterfactual beliefs -- arrant nonsense -- and that they wllfully cling to those beliefs in face of any amount of contraverting evidence.  This \\"disconfirmation immunity\\" aka \\"blind faith\\" is the real telltale of the cult.  Diehard Stalin-loyalists similarly refused to accept any of the evidence that came out during the Brezhnev era, about the abuses and horrors of Stalinism.  Cultic behaviour is cultic behaviour whether you're a commie or a conservative.  It is possible to be a non-cultic commie, and it is possible to be a non-cultic conservative.But this Trumputin -- Mump Regine -- whatever you wanna call this thing, this Internatioal Fascist Tendency created and run by plutocrats -- is something else again.  This is the perfect storm, the weaponisation of ignorance and superstition, the merging of cult and politics using modern communications technology.  This is what Orwell was afraid of.The only antidote is *education* \\\\-- including media literacy and critical thinking and empirical method taught from the earliest possible age.  And that is exactly why the new far right international is so gung ho to destroy public education and replace it with religious schooling, which stunts and thwarts all those capacities and replaces them with \\"true belief\\" and rote learning.Take a good hard long look at N Korea folks.  Because *it can happen here.**And we need to be thinking real hard, to figure out how we prevent it.*","title":"Trump will start WW3"},{"text":"He appears to be having a hard time keeping a grip on reality.

If other countries tell him he can't do that, he's only going to lean even more into it for media attention. And then he won't feel able back down as his fascist base gets worked up about it and effectively declares war to maintain his own ego.On the other hand, if you just ignore this and it is just the ravings of a lunatic egomaniac, there's a good chance that he'll have forgotten it in a week in favour of the next idiotic thing he reads on the internet.That's not to say that this isn't serious, because it is how he feels and what his supporters feel. They're fascists in need of someone to bully. However, if there's even a slim chance that they don't start a major war in the next few years, then just ignoring them until they actually do something is OK in my book. Once they do act, of course, you have to react regardless of the risk. Appeasing these people never works.","title":"Trump refuses to rule out using military force to take Greenland and Panama Canal"},{"text":"New wars! YAY.What we got?
