Right now? When the GOP is ramping up their genocidal anti-trans narrative? Why not let them tear through gay rights too, women's rights, civil rights. All of em.Dems need to shift A LOT on social issues but a lot of the shifts could potentially just be rhetorical and changing of strategy. There's room for triangulation on some key issues (chiefly stuff like immigration, crime, affirmative action and such) while still supporting key liberal ideas like anti discrimination, gay marriage, abortion, LGBT rights (yes also the T), and so onPart of the issue on social issues is that liberals/leftists have gotten really bad at actually persuading people who don't fully agree with them. It's kind of like gay marriage (which is good policy btw, not arguing against the policy itself) broke our brains, and that we assumed it's easy win, paired with thinking about the \\"emerging democratic majority\\"/\\"demographics as destiny\\" stuff, meant there wasn't any longer a need to appeal to people on the fence and that we could win by just appealing to the morally good folks who already agreed with our basic ideas as opposed to being big bad moderates, fence sitters, center right folks and so on. With that, we've seen the rise of more rhetoric oriented towards preaching to the liberal college educated choir, as well as a shift towards support for deplatforming and using ideas like assumptions of bad faith, \\"just asking questions\\", sealioning, debate bros, \\"we just shouldn't have to debate basic human rights\\", \\"if you are explaining yourself, you are losing\\", and so on to justify not engaging in as much persuasion attempts Simply being more open to engaging in good faith discussions over things with the opposition (even if they themselves aren't engaging in good faith) would be a big shift on social issues without actually implying any shift on policy for exampleKamala ran on a centrist campaignThis is nonsense, just because the far left propagandists repeat it doesn't make it true. Kamala ran a very liberal campaign. She also got endorsed by conservative Republicans without having to make any concessions, so of course she accepted the endorsement rather than denouncing it. Any democrat who would reject the endorsement and make a big show of relitigating 2000s foreign policy rather than taking the W would be engaging in political malpracticeIf the dems go right the GOP will go even further right. And they'll keep calling the dems left wing communists and get votes off that because they actively reject realitySwing voters exist. Swing voters don't want far left stuff but swing voters also have been able to acknowledge that the right wing attacks aren't always correct.

The CPI clearly doesn't represent lived reality and the experienced inflation by most people was a lot lot higher than reported.  More likely people are going to struggle to make ends meet and remain verry frustrated.  And if something happens in the economy like a recession, stock market crash, Trump won't be able to convince people it was Biden's fault.

You saw 20% of the electorate voting to both protect abortion and vote for the man who caused abortion to need to be protected in the first place. Those people do not have a consistent, logical, cohesive belief system in the first placeThis is not neccesarily true. A consequence of American politics is that wildly different stances on various non-related topics are all bundled together in one of two packages named \\"democrat\\" or 'republican\\". But no one, literally 0% of the people, are 100% behind every single thing each party stands for.It is perfectly possible and internally consistent for an individual to want to protect abortion rights (generally seen as \\"democrat\\") yet still vote \\"republican\\". The reason could be that after having tallied up all the things they agree/disagree with in both parties and ordering them according to what they prioritize they concluded that they like the GOP-package more.That does not mean that agree 100% with everything that party stands for. And in this case, they might want more options for abortions.

The biggest one is that despite there being a fifth movie that is also completely unconnected from the trilogy... it is not similar to Halloween 3: Season of the Witch. If I had to say, it's more similar to Romero's Season of the Witch, just because it happens to involve witchcraft and dudes being the worst.The other comment that I've heard about this movie is that it was Brian Yuzna's attempt at remaking Society... and I wish that were true, but it absolutely isn't. Even though it got weird at times, I feel like I was promised a truly gross-out fest for its last 30 minutes, and I mostly got Clint Howard having a full about-face as a character.

And guess what? These things sort of haven't stopped...And I'm confused, are liberals \\"obsessed with race\\" or not?Well, I can tell you conservatives certainly are...There's all of the panic and hysteria around critical race theory being taught in public schools. How liberal educators are apparently teaching children to feel guilty for being white because history lessons are a little discomforting or not *white*washed enough for parents.Or you know, how some conservatives claim that racism is simply over while spouting \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric, yet it's anti-white discrimination that's the *real* threat to our country.Then there's the record number of challenges to book titles in libraries, thousands more every year, most of which conservatives admit to never having read. But because they feature a POC as the protagonist, or contain a queer character or title, they must either be rife with pornography or teaching children to hate whiteness.Think about how Republicans highlight isolated black crimes in particular in order to raise fears. Think about how every time there's a mass shooting, Republicans direct the conversation to gun violence and murder rates in places like Chicago, when the reality is, rates of gun violence and death rates are highest in Republican-led states like Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming, Alaska etc...Think about all of the outrage around \\"DEI.\\"The unfounded criticisms directed at people like Letitia James, or Jasmine Crockett, even Ketanji Brown Jackson. All of them dubbed \\"DEI hires,\\" even things like \\"ghetto trash,\\" despite being more than qualified for their positions. Hell, Jackson was far more qualified for her position than Clarence Thomas was back in the day during his judicial appointment, and Thomas has literally been labeled, \\"the greatest beneficiary of affirmative action in US history\\" by those closest to him.What about when black actors appear in a movie, TV show, commercial, or any form of media, there's always someone crying \\"woke.\\"Oh, and when some black MAGA personality speaks out on social media, conservatives quickly rally around them and make the case for their powerful appeal to black people. Remember those desperate and disingenuous AI images that circulated over social media featuring Donald Trump posing with black people on the street?Or how about Trump's campaigning at black events, where he would ramble incoherently and compare himself to Abraham Lincoln of all people. Remember his remark that Kamala Harris is \\"all of a sudden\\" black?Oh yeah, and how dismantling affirmative action for university enrollment was high on the priority list, yet conservatives refused to address legacy admissions...And the hysteria around the \\"defund the police\\" movement, which most conservatives took literally and still use as a political weapon today, while sometimes exploiting the phrase to push \\"law and order\\" dog whistles that play on right wing fears of racial crime in the suburbs...And when in reality, only a fringe minority of liberals were demanding a literal defunding of police, while many, like me, were merely asking for more accountability, the addressing of racial injustices, profiling, stereotyping, police brutality, and better de-escalation training for police officers... Which ironically, would require *more* funding! While keep in mind, Republican figures today are still using some of the racist, law and order rhetoric and dog whistling that we heard from conservatives back in the day like George Wallace, William Rehnquist, Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, etc...Then there's the whole \\"anti-racism\\" theme, which conservatives have somehow been able to appropriate and engineer into a disturbing concern about white guilt, while also managing to make being *too much* against racism a bad thing.Oh, and don't get me started about the extremely ignorant and revisionist talking point that Democrats are the *real* racists because they're the \\"party of slavery.\\" That one would require an entire reddit character limit post on its own.Sorry for the tangent, but I'm just fed up with this double standard.

Otherwise you're still screwed.\\"The whole \\"path to the middle class\\" thing is an exercise in frustration. What the Democrats have needed to do is make even the lowest-paying job able to support a decent life. This has to be by raising the minimum wage, providing something like Medicare for All or a \\"Public option\\" for health coverage, and regulating the availability of housing so reasonable and decent housing is within reach. People don't need to all have a single family dwelling and a boat, but they do need a decent apartment and enough money to be able to enjoy their time off. Oh, and they need more time off. These must be available even to people who work minimum wage jobs. Democrats should push hard and loud for bills that will let workers thrive in the circumstances they live in now, and those who have the ambition can improve their lives even further by taking classes/getting certifications/etc. Such bills will, of course, fail. But when that happens, the public should be convinced that they could have had the good thing, except Republicans killed it. People should get mailers that explain this in the same way for each blocked initiative. Every press interview should include it, with a good degree of outrage and passion expressed.

The MAGA machine then stacked the issues with lies and alarmist propaganda that made any discussion impossible.F/ex: When fear over LGBTQ books in public libraries wasn't enough, let's add the Drag Queen Story Hour taking place *in the children's section* on top of it.F/ex: When illegal immigration isn't enough, let's add concerns over taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants, or fears over gangs of murderous  illegal immigrants.F/ex: When trans kids in schools aren't scary enough, let's have them competing in school sports and using school bathrooms. You can add the MAGA lie that that schools were magically changing the gender of students during class.F/ex: When abortion isn't controversial enough, let's make baseless claims over infanticide.F/ex: Let's not forget the tried and true \\"They'll take away your guns!\\"In the end the mundane facts that Harris focused on were overshadowed by irrational fears created by MAGA propaganda.Trump can now claim that immigrants are no longer eating pets during his term in office, simply because they never ate them in the first place.","title":"Kamala Harris lost, but how weak of a candidate was she?"},{"text":"Hey get out of here with your facts and associated links?","title":"Kamala Harris lost, but how weak of a candidate was she?"},{"text":"I agree totally.

Overall, the AllatRa organization is in no way anti-Russian.

It's always important to keep in mind that the propaganda that Russia directs at an American audience isn't necessarily done to convince people to be pro Russia, but instead to sow chaos in the discourse between each other.   \\nAll that being said I have looked into AllatRa a lot and most of it is really weird and confusing, but I haven't seen much that has convinced me that it is extremely likely that they are an actual propaganda arm of the Russian government, but it's possible that they are just useful to the to stir shit up. Something I was confused about when I looked into them was claims that they were banned in Russia and that the Russian government even blocked Rumble in part because they allowed AllatRa to be on their platform, but when I looked a little deeper it seemed that all the news I could find about them being banned in Russia was coming directly from them, or quoting something that was said by an AllatRa member. So I'm not even sure if they were ever actually banned in Russia. My best guess right now is that Igor Danilov is trying to imitate Scientology. I'll see some things that genuinely seem like this dude is just straight up doing a cheap Scientology imitation.

I am writing a whole story about it so I won't be posting my evidence as far as he goes until it's ready to go,  but as a result of researching this I have also done quite a lot of research into AllatRa. Since my story isn't about AllatRa I'll share anything I've found about AllatRa. All of it is information that has been made public anyway, unlike the things I have for my Cholakian story.I don't know what you mean by fake cult but it is for sure real in the fact that Igor Danilov is trying to promote it  yes they use a lot of bots and obviously the information they put out a lot of fake information., but there are real people involved in the organization.Igor Danilov, their leader, fled Ukraine once the war started and was hiding in Slovakia, a Czech journalist tracked him down and confronted him. He apparently used fake documents to leave the country. There are videos of her doing this. After she did this, a Czech prosecutor started investigating her and  another journalist that she worked with was brought in for questioning. Ultimately this prosecution was stopped, and the lead prosecutor actually resigned as a result of this because he was about to be fired for his persecution of the journalist.There was also someone who worked in a regional prosecutor's office in the Czech Republic who was involved with this who denies being a member of AllatRa and the Creative Society, but was reported promoting them to colleagues. She is also facing some form of repercussions for this. That is to say that, while AllatRa might not be some big powerful organization, they are at least real enough to have influenced some prosecutors in the Czech Republic to go after someone who was critical of them.The same reporter also did a report on a software tool they use to generate and spread the content they post all over the internet. Basically it looks like it uses a bunch of APIs for all kinds of AI services like ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc .and all kinds of social media APIs as well so that they can create and spread their propaganda very easily. So yes in a sense a ton of their members probably are fake, and it makes it difficult to know how big they really are, but it does seem like they have some influence. One interesting thing I saw on Twitter from someone talking about this was that the cost for all the APIs for the tool that they are using would be so high that they likely have some backing. Due to the nature of the tool it seems like it could be Russia since they do very similar things.Here are some links about the reporter and the story about her being prosecuted.

A good way to look at this is to look at their electoral record outside 2016, 2020, and 2024 (the 3 years Trump himself has been on the ballot). In the Trump era, their electoral record outside these 3 years is downright abysmal. The one exception is 2021, but that election happened at the absolute low point for Democrats in the Biden era. Even this year, the bullet votes cast for Trump were more than his match of victory in at least WI, MI, PA and NV and this very well may have been the case in AZ, GA, and NC as well.

There was unrest, particularly in urban areas that had seen large migration of rural populations in search of food and water as a result of the drought, and Assad brutally repressed it in a manner that had Saudi Arabia done it, Obama would have shrugged his shoulders, including because Saudi Arabia would have said what the Defence Minister of Israel said about the rebels they are all al-queda / unrest would lead to the rise of Islamist groups such as ISIS and Al Queda.Instead of flooding a drought stricken nation with food and water, Obama flooded it with guns, knowing full well they would end up in the hands of groups such as ISIS and Al Queda Affiliated who would make his demand of Assad stepping down in reality a call for basically an ISIS takeover of Syria.  Obama knew Assad was not going to step down, but he also knew it would blow up the country and weaken Assad who despite at the time being arguably the most religiously moderate leader in the region outside of some major segments of Israeli politicos had close connections to both Hezbollah and Tehran (he was sort of the Netanyahu of Syria in that way) and was an ally of self described Palestinian movements.So Obama basically just blew up Syria by flooding it with guns knowing it would be a horrible bloody war and civilians would die en masse and Assad would be weakened, and would be brutal and murderous while being weakened, weakening him\\nFurther, but not weak enough to actually let ISIS and Al Queda take over (which Obama would have switched sides if it got close due to the weaponry held by Assad)Whats happening now isnt a new war.  Its more of the same wara different phase and you may be right about the groups being more moderate but from what Ive read Im not optimistic about that.  Seems to me its give or take going to Obamas planarm a bunch of guys he wouldnt actually let defeat Assad cause hed consider them worse and then create a bloody mess through those guys fighting AssadIn the process tens of thousands more children will die brutal deaths.  There will be horror and pain and death in innocent civilian populations.  Ultimately though its all Obamas choice (and plan) in flooding the country with guns and bombs rather than food and water after a drought.  He saw thirsty kids and started a war rather than give them water.  Thats Obama.  Now?

And this is not by the definition that the value of what you produce is just what you can demand in the marketplace for the use of your labor and ownership of capital. Obviously, by that definition (some would say the only definition) then yes, billionaires can be justified. But then by that definition alone, any amount of inequality can be justified.

The BBC is funded through their TV license fee that they collect, which currently is $18 a month, higher than most online newspaper subcriptions. So any other newspaper that wants to follow the same model would have to create a TV channel that then collects a subscription fee, which is hard to opt out of. That doesn't seem plausible and people still end up paying monthly for it. Might as well just subscribe to a cheaper newspaper only service.   \\nAnd in the case of the BBC there is even a questionmark about its future. More and more households in the UK cancle their TV license every year because streaming and online media is becoming more common.

But I feel like this could have been much shorter if the author just said instead:More and more people are struggling and our broken system doesnt work for them. Trump said the economys bad and blamed it on immigrants, DEI, trans people, Ukraine, and Palestinians (obviously none of these are why people are struggling, but hes not gonna tell the truth and say its rich people and greed, so its instead divisive distractions which are historically effective). Trump also said he would fix the bad economy. Kamala didnt say she would fix the economy, she didnt even say it was bad. She also didnt campaign on things like **min wage increase, healthcare, college, paid leave, or workers rights**. If Dems want to win they should campaign on the items in bold - no race or identity politics are needed, no celebrity endorsements, just those items and theyll win. Maybe throw in *campaign finance reform* and *overturning citizens United* and *restoration of Roe v Wade (again)*, but really even just the bolded items will do it. Look! Ive now listened to the working class, I took them seriously (Im not sure about literally) and I communicated the fix concisely. If Democrats cant figure this shit out, I truly have no faith left in the party. *Also just a reminder*:* Trump won by a very slim margin: the electoral college by 200K votes and the popular vote by 1.6% or 2.5M votes. \\n* Trumps votes of 77M is 30% of Americans\\n* Kamala also won 30% of Americans votes, but just 2.5M shy of Trump. \\n* 37% or 90M Americans didnt vote. \\n* And 3% or 2.8M voted for other people.\\n* Republicans have a 3 seat majority in the Senate and 5 seat majority in the House (one of the smallest majorities in US history). \\n* They did win, but not by much. However, Democrats should absolutely do a complete overhaul of their messaging and still campaign on those items I mentioned in bold up above, because not winning in a landslide to this guy is an absolute failure - but we should also just keep shit in perspective.

Back then, even if you didnt pay for a paper, you could easily access it through various meansbrowsing one at a coffee shop, borrowing from a friend, or even salvaging one from the recycling. The physical nature of the paper made it inherently shareable and accessible, and high-quality journalism could still circulate widely without every reader needing to shell out money.In the digital era, legitimate news outlets are trying to impose old-school paywalls that are increasingly out of step with how people consume information online. Even though some readers can get around these paywalls with archive sites or emailing the author, its still far more cumbersome than simply stumbling upon clickbait or misinformation shared freely on social media. The barrier to entry is higher for quality journalism, while the low-effort path of consuming dubious content is wide open. If readers have to jump through hoops to access reputable reporting, but misinformation is just a click away, its no surprise that bad actors gain traction and high-quality news struggles for an audience.Like it or not, this is the environment that todays publications must compete in. Sticking rigidly to old paywall models without considering new strategies only reduces their visibility and influence. \\nLegitimate news sources need to rethink how they present themselves onlinewhether that means experimenting with lower-priced tiers, offering more flexible payment options, or creating easily shareable content that can go toe-to-toe with all the free-but-flawed information online.

Like there are blatant lies out there that get rightfully censored.\\"Genuine misinformation\\" reeks of establishment gaslighting. The term misinformation itself only came to prominence in the last ten years. Before that, we just evaluated sources individually rather than trying to attach a tag that could be applied by the establishment the same way \\"anti vaxer\\" is meant to provoke an emotional response against an out group. And you and I are going to have to disagree with this premise of what should be \\"rightfully censored\\", because I don't believe any government mouthpieces should have a monopoly over what should or should not be \\"rightfully censored\\". Free speech is the tool we need to be able to combat actual misinformation.So, if by genuine misinformation you are simply referring to what we used to call \\"bullshit\\", then no, being a skeptic doesn't mean I'm particularly vulnerable to any grifts from sources outside of legacy media. Knowing the media is lying to me the majority of the time about the issues that matter is simply a useful compass to utilize, but unlike those who take MSM reports as the unquestionable, canonical truth of the matter,  I don't have to swear fealty to any of them if they start preaching incongruencies in their message. To use another covid era example, throughout the pandemic, people really kept believing the reports that indicated vaccines were \\"100% effective at preventing covid\\" long after our friends and family members kept passing the virus back and forth to one another via \\"breakthrough infections\\".When observable reality contradicts the media, then you disbelieve Big Brother and double down on what is seen before you.

Hunter Biden is not, has not, and never will be the president of the United States. Hunter Biden was excoriated and dragged through the mud for 5 years as the target of relentless partisan inquiries and investigations, media smear campaigns, political scrutiny, public harassment, which all amounted to a waste of time, because in the end, He was prosecuted for a crime the tens of thousands of Americans get away with every year. If Trump were prosecuted for lying on a gun form, his supporters would be having a collective conniption fit.Even most authorities on the matter have called the prosecution highly unusual due to how infrequently it is prosecuted in the first place, let alone including the involvement of Congressional committees, special counsels, and the DOJ.There is a massive difference between targeting the president's son in such a brazen manner and investigating a series of crimes committed by a former president, who is a serial fraud and known notoriously for his criminal misconduct and abuse of the justice system. And crimes that are all far more grievous and damning than anything Republicans could even fantasize about implicating Hunter Biden for.Not only that, but by comparison, Trump's crimes were more plentiful and subsequent investigations were backed by clearer and more incriminating evidence.This is not just a flagrant false equivalence, but also a double standard.If you compare the situations of Hunter Biden and Donald Trump side by side, you should be able to conclude that the differences are extensive. Thinking that Hunter's pardon justifies even more immunities for Trump is absurd.Hell, prior to this pardon, I didn't hear anyone trying to justify it by pointing to the rampant cronyism and favoritism that Trump legitimized after he pardoned several corrupt allies and co-conspirators, some of which he's welcomed back into his inner circle.Biden argued that raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice\\"But Trump uses this exact same language to describe the countless indictments, investigations, and lawsuits against *him*. All of which were warranted to some degree. Donald Trump has not only been exploiting his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system throughout his entire life, while evading accountability for his crimes and misconduct, but even as president, he used his executive privilege to avoid being incriminated for his blatant and frequent attempts to obstruct justice.Since then, he has been granted broad immunities by a kowtowing group of loyalists, immunities and privileges he has used to obstruct and delay the legal process.Trump has also made a number of unconstitutional threats against his political opponents and adversaries, warning them that he intends to abuse his power as president to seek retribution against them. This is a man who has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which illustrate his penchant for fraud, coercion, elusiveness and corruption.Trump has literally been charged with \\"defrauding the United States,\\" with conspiring to overturn an election, with disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans, with intimidating election officials into manipulating the vote for him, with attempting to install loyalists into positions of power within agencies like the DOJ, where they can help *him* steal the election. All of which Trump has been able to avoid convictions for due to his recent election win and his exploitation of the justice system. By contrast, Hunter was charged and actually convicted of lying on a gun form... He was also charged with not paying his taxes, which he eventually paid back.Trump has established himself as an infamous and serial cheater. He cheats on his wives, he cheats on his taxes, he lies about his wealth and the value of his properties, he even cheats at golf...And despite all this, when Joe Biden offers his son a pardon, after he was maligned for years, humiliated and scandalized, investigated by Congress, special counsel, and by the DOJ... after he became the target of relentless partisan inquiries and committee hearings, after the public harassment, the political scrutiny, the Media smear campaigns, all of which amounted to a waste of time, but eventually ended in him being prosecuted for a crime that most Americans get away with every year, a prosecution that even authorities on the matter have called highly unusual, after all of this, Donald Trump should be granted yet another immunity claim? Should be held to an even lower standard? Face less accountability?This is just like what happened during Harris's campaign. Because Donald Trump is a notorious and serial shitstirrer, because his absurdity has magically rendered him benign, because corruption, malfeasance, cronyism, obstruction of justice, the endless incoherent ramblings and emotional tirades at rallies, public events, during interviews, press conferences, via TruthSocial, etc, because his violent rhetoric and unconstitutional threats are just another day for Donald Trump, we've practically sane washed and normalized his misconduct.So the bar for Trump remains perpetually low, while his opponents are held to such a high standard that they're expected to be irreproachable by comparison.","title":"John Fetterman says Hunter Biden, Trump both deserve pardons after 'politically motivated' trials"},{"text":"If people blame democrats for republicans winning, maybe they should vote for democrats or celebrate republicans winning","title":"Democrats need to take the working class seriously and literally"},{"text":"I thought Obama was the anti-christ.

Its important to note that common respect does not require agreement or submission. You can employ common respect without surrendering your rights, opinions or freedoms.Deferential Respect: Selectively applied and based on a hierarchical dynamic- this can be following someone blindly or without truly understanding their competence in a particular context. Its also possible to be aware of ones lack of competence but be inclined to submit to them. This is typically based on a something like age or being in an authoritative role. It could be a single attribute or a combination.Respecting your elders is a long-held tradition that says older individuals have a valuable combined knowledge and experience (wisdom) that the younger should yield to. But IMO, if respect goes beyond common respect without or against valid reason- its deference. The child-adult context is self-explanatory. As adults, its important to recognize that knowledge and experience is gained over time. That wisdom is often critical for societal units to function. However, a system that consistently and blindly submits to unverified wisdom is a recipe mild slavery and chaos.With all things, there is a balance to be struck. Does it make sense to offer initial deference to someone older than myself who I assume to have more experience? Yeah. If Ive verified a fact and am being told otherwise by someone older, does it make sense to give them deference. No.","title":"CMV: Respect your elders is merely an ingrained custom thats actually kind of baseless and shouldnt be a thing."},{"text":"Trump was already pardoned by the Supreme Court.

I'd also suggest the Unvaccinated subreddit, which is more of a microcosm of the same sort of articles traditionally posted here about establishment corruption during covid. The mainstream media was able to support the big covid lie by insulating themselves from actual science via gatekeeping the peer review process. The establishment enforced the censorship of doctors who attempted to blow the whistle on the shady practices of the pharmaceutical industry in its response to covid, and then outright refused to investigate any of the claims being made by respected, reputable individuals. One such individual, Peter McCullough, was among the most cited doctors on the internet. His career was derailed when he started speaking out against covid, and his reputation was smeared by people who chose to stick their fingers in their ears and disbelieve any whistleblowers with credibility, while disparaging any whistleblowers through credentialism for anyone who was not a doctor of medicine.

Well, clearly not Trump voters who have no respect for the rule of law. Not the over 50% who didnt even vote because the view politics as complete broken anyway. That leaves the Dem/Harris/Biden voters - while they have the most right to be disappointed by this, I think most of them understand it. The US has voted to effectively end the rule of law and promised to target political opponents. The pardon is the only tool Biden has to protect his son. Personally I think pardons are ridiculous and political by nature, but if Americans overall arent concerned about powerful people being above the law (courtesy of electing a man who instigated an insurrection), they cant claim to be concerned about it. Its just the just nihilist political environment we find ourselves. All of these centrist political punfits criticising Biden are outraged for his hypocrisy - saying wouldnt pardon and circumventing the political process. But when pressed if they would do the same, theyre awkwardly saying yes - they would do the same BUT thats why they arent PresidentA lot of these political consultant types need to wake up to a few realities 1) powerful people have always been above the law in America (and most other western democracies) - this ideal otherwise is just that 2) the office of President unfortunately is not sacred - its been occupied by a lot of terrible, corrupt people (none worse than Trump) - but these are PEOPLE - and people in office make self-interested decisions, over what is supposedly good for the country all the time. 3) given what we know about Bidens family history, does anyone really think he can just leave to chance that the Trump administration will not do every possible to destroy his son? Its absolutely personal. The political pundits have this ridiculous doe eyed view of American values like rule of law, which apparently need to be upheld - even when Americans are either actively rejecting them at the ballot box or otherwise indifferent. Lets face it, were all hypocrites. No one is going to put an increasingly rabid country, to appease some talking heads on MSNBC, over the safety of their own son. Its very easy for people with absolutely nothing at stake to say Biden should essentially allow his son to be jailed and risk relapsing into addiction just so the Dems can maintain a moral high ground - which as the results of the election seem to indicate, not enough people  care about.","title":"Hunter Biden Was Pardoned Because Laws Are for Little People"},{"text":" Higher housing prices.From globalism?

Right now, paywalls are doing more harm than good, even for the publications theyre supposed to help.Edit: I want to clarifyIm fine with an annoying subscription pop-up as long as I can dismiss it and still read the article. I get that publications want to nudge readers toward subscribing, and Im okay with that. What really frustrates me is when the content is completely locked behind a paywall.Im not an Apple user, but doesnt Apple offer a $10/month plan that gives you access to multiple sites? I actually really like that kind of solutionit encourages people to pay by offering benefits rather than punishing them with gatekeeping. Its a better approach that feels less like being forced to pay for something I already own, like those ridiculous pay a subscription to use heated seats models some car companies are rolling out. Make me want to pay, not have to pay, and Ill happily support good journalism.","title":"CMV: Paywalls are destroying the web and fueling misinformation."},{"text":" Biden's pardon binds only us.

If all free news were gone, there would be more truth and less propaganda.I used to subscribe to print newspapers and magazines to get news. There was literally no other way to get news than to pay for it. I suppose you could go to the library, but in that case you still had to get off your ass and physically travel to a location, assuming you lived near a library and the media you wanted to read was not already checked out by someone else.**When you pay for news, you are the customer**. That means that the incentive of the news agency is to serve what you, the customer, want to see and what you find trustworthy.So you have to pay to get quality news. That actually makes perfect sense to me, in fact, it seems logical and proper. If you **aren't** paying for news, then that means that someone else is paying for it to be presented, and that means you aren't the customer anymore, but someone is paying for you to get a view that *they want you to see*. Why on earth would you expect that to be trustworthy? So you see a free article and it's full of lies and disinformation. What are you going to do, complain about it?

There are many elders who are not particularly worthy of respect. So what is the intent of the saying?Sometimes, it simply means that you should listen to what your elders have to say on a topic because you haven't lived through experiences that give you sufficient perspective. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to agree with them, but understand that if you haven't held down a job for 20 years straight and raised your own kids, you may be arguing with less authority on some topics. If your parent doesn't want to vote for a property tax that would fund schools that badly need the money, he may be wrong, but you may not have any standing to dispute his claim that it will make things too difficult for families like yours.Similarly, it sometimes means that you can't understand the sacrifice that those who have worked and raised kids have made, or how hard-won some of their wisdom is (even if you disagree with it). If you have raised kids, you still may not understand the wisdom of someone who faces their own decline and mortality, who cared for dying parents, or who has lost children and friends. There are things we go through in life that fundamentally change the way we see the world. Sometimes, we end up back where we started, but with a more complete understanding.So when a teenager says some dismissive, smart-ass thing to their grandmother, the adults in the room instantly see that this young person lacks the background to appreciate the years of love and sacrifice and work that it took their grandmother to raise their father. They don't truly understand the absolute adoration grandparents have for their grandkids and how vulnerable that makes them. They don't get how little time they have left with them. They've never had the experience of their life becoming about someone else.When they say \\"respect your elders,\\" it means acknowledge that they have valuable life experiences and sometimes it specifically means \\"respect what your elders have done for you.\\" So listen politely, and if you disagree, just try to do it in a way that is not dismissive.","title":"CMV: Respect your elders is merely an ingrained custom thats actually kind of baseless and shouldnt be a thing."},{"text":"Yes, uneducated people are suckers for lies, for example \\"Like it or not, people dont enjoy being condescended to\\" refers to what in the real world?

They believe we get our genetic updates this way.  40 something percent of the human genome was gotten from viruses or viral updates.These elites believe they should get ahead of the next evolutionary leap in human DNA, they believe they should be allowed to patent and guide our genetic code and they believe the merger of man and machine is intelligent and inevitable.

This respect is display by people in varying degrees from simply being nice to everyone, to valuing their opinions or perspectives.Where you are not differentiating is that you should respect elders specifically because they have seen and done more than you and have that wisdom to offer. That is until they have said and done something to lose your respect, such as simply being wrong about the best way about it. Respecting elders isn't about respecting their dignity, it is about respecting their experience. The difference is you would respect the basic human dignity of a child in much the same way you would an old person, but you would respect the experience of an elder in a different way you would a younger person.For example (if you need it), relationships, current events, historical events, moral conundrums, etc would all benefit from the perspective of an elder much more than someone younger who does not have decades of combined experiences and thought.In this way, I don't think the colloquial saying, \\"respect your elders\\", preempts the idea that an elder can be a terrible person who does not deserve respect (outside of your moral tolerance).","title":"CMV: Respect your elders is merely an ingrained custom thats actually kind of baseless and shouldnt be a thing."},{"text":"If he means he did his part in draining Africa of its resources so the rest of the world can profit off of it at Africa's expense, he's done it","title":"Biden Hopes Train Project in Angola Defines Africa Legacy"},{"text":"Nah, that's too much effort considering the much simpler options that will be available to Airline C-suites.The CEO of Spirit Airlines will request a lunch with Trump and will say very flattering things and endlessly praise him and tell him that Biden and Harris and Obama is responsible for this and that he will be a hero if he repeals the law.

This is less effective now given Russias world image and lack of reach, but it can still gain traction to certain audiences, particularly those on the right and far-left. It was especially effective back in 2016 when it was juxtaposed against a potential US/Western intervention which is what Hillary Clinton was calling for.You didn't mention Iran and its proxies, but they also support Assad and have given Assad resources, but their appetite for long range interests also will hinge on domestic issues and/or if tension flare with them and Israel.Im not claiming a rebel victory is inevitable. I just dont find it convincing that the prospect of one would be necessarily that bad or worse compared to the alternative.?If they want international recognition, it'll be incumbent on them to depart from al-Qaeda. Probably could be accomplished if they turned in Muhammad al-Jolani.How so? On the surface, it appears Jolani is leading the cause for unification, as I have argued.And do you know who else classifies HTS as terrorists?Im fully aware of the terrorist designation and at some point along the timeline that designation was more than likely justified but I am shifting the focus to what we are seeing unfold now and the lack of actions that we can designate as terrorism. Time will tell ofc and I will draw emphasis on that.I really don't think the HTS will get much farther than the territory it controls.Theyve just taken Hama. That has the potential to cut off the Russian naval bases in Latakia and Tartus. Thats no small thing.What you COULD see is a complete hollowed out, failed state, like Sudan. Where it's used as a proxy for all the international interests due to its strategic importance.You could and time will tell but Im not convinced thats a good enough reason to shoot it down before it can barely spread its wings.

Biden was also clearly hurt by the party rallying for him to step down, which is why he tossed his endorsement to Kamala right away against Pelosis wishes.

And much of the debate has focused on the gender gap - why men, including a lot more nonwhite men than in previous years, chose to vote for Trump.  In a scene straight out of my nightmares, a lot of the mainstream discourse is pure Reddit.What I mean is, as another user put it, \\"But WHAT ABOUT MEEEEEN?\\"Let me stop the replies before they start: Men matter.  They face real issues that need to be taken seriously, and need to be addressed by our leaders.  And if you sincerely care about this, you need to pay attention here, because you've got a lot of fake allies who are hurting your cause in the name of keeping women quiet.**Crashing the conversation**This time, we'll start with our word of the day: [Derailing!](https://speak-up.org/derail/)  In a nutshell, derailing is making statements that shift away from the main point of an important conversation.  Take a look at that link for tons of examples of how this is done.  It makes the point that derailing is usually unintentional...but sometimes, it's completely intentional.So, how does derailing apply in US politics?  It's often used to prevent a real discussion, as any debate with Donald Trump has shown.  Right now, it's being used to prevent a conversation about the role sexism played in his win.I've already discussed at length the different ways sexism hurt Harris, and has hurt other female politicians.  But the dominant narrative about this has been \\"Well, Democrats should have cared about men's issues!\\"  Which...they did.  Just Google \\"Kamala Harris plans for men\\" and you'll see several examples.  Hell, Google \\"Donald Trump plans for men\\" if you want to see how much he cares about them.But the point is: This attempt to blame Harris for not caring about men isn't based in reality.  It's an attempt to shut down the conversation about sexism.  When peoples' arguments can be disproven with two seconds on Google, they haven't thought them through or are trying to cover up something darker.**What's the problem, anyway?**I'm going to repeat that men do matter, and face genuine concerns.  I feel the need to, because I'm about to critique the whole idea of 'men's issues', and want to make it clear I still care about the guys.  So, let's get down to business!I read a *lot* of articles trying to figure out the issues men feel they are facing - because a lot of people who say \\"Men have issues, too!\\" never bother to say what those issues are.  Sign of a well-meaning advocate right there.  Anyway, I ignored the ones that talked about how Democrats 'look like the womens' party', because I already addressed that in Episode 5, and this chat is supposed to be about issues, not vibes.  And I found a few that came up repeatedly:1. Mental health2. Economic opportunity3. Education4. A general sense of 'not belonging'These are all real issues, and they affect lots of men, and I don't want to suggest otherwise.  **But these aren't male-specific issues.**[I'll let the researchers do the talking on this,](https://euideas.eui.eu/2024/10/30/mens-issues-or-issues-of-the-patriarchy/) but the short version is: These \\"mens' issues\\" either affect men and women equally, are better explained by factors such as race or class, or are actively being worked on by Democrats and other left-wing parties around the world.  (And those dastardly, man-hating feminists!)  Even the [general sense of not belonging](https://www.sharp.com/health-news/why-do-so-many-men-feel-lonely) can largely be explained by sexist stereotypes of what men 'should' be, or by things that affect women at least as much such as social media and a lack of third spaces.So I think the idea of men's issues is a bit of a red herring.  To repeat myself, I'm not saying that men don't face problems.  But **they don't face problems because they're male, specifically.**  The problems they do face are actually explained by other factors, and it's Democrats (in America) taking steps to fix them.No, the fixation on men's issues is a derailing tactic.  But what's being derailed?**Have you ever noticed...**I've been on Reddit for more than nine years now.  I don't recommend it, but in that time I've noticed a disturbing trend that still exists.Go into any large thread about a woman being hurt by men in some way.  I promise you'll find plenty of people pointing out how it happens to men, too.  This is true of sexual violence, mental health challenges, having an abusive partner, being cheated on...anything, really.  (In fact, some highly-upvoted posts would have you believe that *men* have it worse than women in all of these areas, but that's a topic for another day).Do all those things happen to men?  Yes.  But isn't it strange that every time a woman posts about it happening, the conversation suddenly shifts to how hard men have it?  **This is what I mean by 'derailing'.**  On big subs, women can't even talk about their own experiences without the conversation eventually shifting to how hard men have it.  In fact, I've seen a number of people have to include a statement like \\"I know not all men do this...\\" or \\"I know this happens to men, too...\\" in a bid to avoid making the boys upset.  (Not something I'd have to do multiple times, of course!)Oh, and one more important point: The guys doing this **do not care about men who are hurting.**  They tend to be manosphere jerks, who love blaming women but do nothing to improve men's lives.  Even the ones who aren't seem to spend their energy sitting online trying to speak over women.  There's no actual effort to make things better.  If they were interested in helping, they'd probably be working with groups trying to help - like, say, the Democrats.**Talking about the issues**When a woman tries to post about abuse and the conversation becomes about how men get abused, that's derailing.When a woman loses the Presidency because of sexism and the conversation is about how she should have cared more about men *when she did and her opponent didn't*, and how she didn't care about men's issues *that affect everyone and which she was talking about regularly*, that's derailing.Way back in Episode 1, I asked why pundits are scared of an honest conversation about the role sexism played in the Presidential election.  This talk is about how they've avoided that conversation.  It sounds very nice: Men do face real issues, like everyone, and men swung drastically to Trump.  But it's derailed a vital conversation about issues that only women face.  Like the right to decide what to do with a pregnancy they don't want, which could be used to control or kill them.  Or the right to be paid the same as their male counterparts, and have the same opportunity to rise up the ladder if they want to.  Or the safety of knowing that their President doesn't shake with contempt for their gender, and can commit sexual violence against them and still win.Those issues are why women get upset about politics, guys.  And the derailing isn't helping.In closing - these conversations will go to uncomfortable places sometimes.  Your feelings do matter, and the issues you face also matter.  We're going to keep working for a better world for everyone, of every gender.But Donald Trump is President, which put a real damper on that goal.  Sexism was one of his most potent weapons, as this series has discussed.  And the *only* way we weaken sexism is by rejecting its tricks and lies.  Then we can focus on reality, and lifting up everyone.  And when we solve any one of these issues, it helps us all.Your issues matter.  Let's lessen the grip of sexism and make a better world for everyone.Yes, that was an attempt to prevent derailing in the comments.**Questions to consider**1. Do you see derailing used in other contexts, especially in politics?2. Has someone tried to derail a conversation on something really important to you?  How did you respond?3. How can we show men we do care about their needs without playing into ideas that put women down?4.

Everything I saw of the people I worked with was eye opening to say the very least. By far, these people were quite honestly some of the most selfless and caring people Ive encountered in the corporate world. I had certain ideals about the gates foundation until I saw first hand the work they do. That experience was transformative for me to say the least. The Gates foundation isenormous. The wealth certainly doesnt trickle down here in the U.S., but for sure it trickles down in the most endemic and poverty stricken areas of the world where they provide services. One example of their philanthropy was of African Sleeping sickness. So many people suffer from this parasite. Guess who? People in the most remote and poorest sections of Africa. Any idea how much appetite there is to find a cure for this disease? Next to zero.Why?It doesnt make money.There was one lab in North Carolina (if memory serves me correct) that was working on a cure. Their grant funding dried up becauseit wasnt profitable. No one in advanced nations suffers from African trypanosomiasis so they couldnt find anyone to fund them.Enter the Gates Foundation They provided a grant of 11 million. A year later, a viable treatment was created. Step one, complete. Step two, delivery. Any idea how fucking hard it is to deliver drugs to people in remote parts of Africa? I got to meet a survivor first hand. I spoke to her and she told me her unbelievable story. Just amazing woman that was saved by the efforts of so many in the gates foundation and a small research lab in bumblefuck. The gates foundation found this woman in an alleyway in a hallucinogenic state. The local shaman/witch doctor decreed her to be possessed by a devil and told all the locals to leave her alone to die. This is literally the worst thing that can happen. She becomes a breading ground for Tsetse flys and the parasites they harbor spreading the disease to other people as she dies a slow painful death. They were able to administer treatment and she made a full recovery. She now works as a nurse helping countless individuals in her locale. Any idea how hard it is to get people who have a legitimate concern to trust foreigners to trust you about medicine? We can barely get Americans to get vaccinated let alone poverty stricken people who see white doctors as devils. They are also told that these people will inflict harm by using modern western medicine. The distrust is the biggest hurdle. So, they figured out that on top of having to pay bribes (to get medicine into remote locations) they also had to employ locals. They also had to build medical facilities that can properly store and handle treatments for common sub-tropical diseases. You also need trained staff that can administer and care for the treatments. All that shit costs so much money. How do you get a doctor that is in debt from schooling to pick up and leave a well paying job to go to dangerous parts of Africa, risk contracting a serious disease and live without commonplace luxuries to help teach and help people that do not trust you. You do it step by step by step. And a ton of money. The Gates foundation has no monetary incentive to do any of this. They do have a responsibility to figure out how to continue funding these projects so they can continue in perpetuity, and with that, you introduce the chances of corruption.  Often times you *must* deal in corruption if you ever want to accomplish anything, especially in countries where bribing is just doing business as John Kelly once mistakenly promised to do in front of a fleet of African journalists. Thats a good story by the way, maybe Ill look it up and link it. Anyway, Im long winded here but the point is, of all the foundations, The Gates foundation is pretty legit. They are subject to a lot of dis and misinformation and are really helping countless people in dire situations. Funny enough, ivermectin is one of their most used drugs as it is used to stop\\nParasitic infections (not African sleeping sickness though). I could provide more examples and go into more details but I feel much of this will fall on deaf ears as most people made up their mind about Gates a long time ago. But whats so important is that the Gates foundation is made up of countless individuals that are profoundly successful. One last example; one of their hiring practices is that they only hire people who are capable of a good work balance as it reflects on their character.  While Gates and his colleagues were absolutely toxic workaholics (something the gates foundation openly admits to), they discourage that kind of work ethic. They do not believe that overworking is a good quality but rather focus on efficiency and proper management that is qualified. And all the people that are working in these positions have long storied histories of great empathy and countless hours dedicated to philanthropic endeavors. The amount of passion and care for others people was amazing to witness first hand. Many of these people in the Gates Foundation take enormous pay cuts. They still make very good money, but compared to the roles they had at other companies, they talked about how they left their previous jobs because they were so disenfranchised and disappointed with what they were(nt) giving back that taking on the position in the foundation was a wonderful release where instead of fleecing anyone and everyone using economic levers, they used their skills to help make lives marginally better in parts of the world everyone else forgets and shits on. I think its obvious, Im a huge supporter of the Gates Foundation and for good reason. Im kinda like [Jim Bridenstine](https://phys.org/news/2018-05-nasa-chief-mind-believes-climate.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), a republican from Oklahoma that did a 180 on his understanding of climate change after working with the experts first hand.","title":"Why are billionaires bad?"},{"text":"Give all the immigrants a pardon, including the ones who went through naturalization.

And pardoning Hunter because he was unfairly prosecuted does not in any way give credibility to Trump's claims of political lawfare. Stupid people will of course make that argument in bad faith, but we do not have to pretend to be stupid and act like it has any credence. Democrats and Republicans simply are not the same when it comes to corruption, or the protection of the rule of law, or the preservation of democracy. That of course does not mean Democrats are perfect on all of those issues, but it is insane and entirely detached from reality to pretend like the there's doubt about which party is more reliable on those matters. Even if you deeply believe Hunter's pardon is a corrupt injustice, it is so minor compared to what Trump and his cronies are doing, and what Republicans have done to pretty much every prominent Democratic of our lifetime, that it's silly to give it any attention.

If anything else, the US always vetoing attempts at getting Israel in compliance with international law does more to encourage Russia to do the same. Especially when some of the munitions/arms that Israel uses are bought from the US. And Ukraine's war with Russia continuing to drain resources from Russia means Russian appetite for bailing out Assad goes down. The critical juncture for Russian support actually hinges more on whether Trump will pull out of Ukraine and whether the EU doesn't fill that vaccuum.You didn't mention Iran and its proxies, but they also support Assad and have given Assad resources, but their appetite for long range interests also will hinge on domestic issues and/or if tension flare with them and Israel.You haven't gone into the background of the rebels, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, their designation as a terrorist organization by the US, and how they were an affiliate of al-Qaeda. If they want international recognition, it'll be incumbent on them to depart from al-Qaeda. Probably could be accomplished if they turned in Muhammad al-Jolani. And do you know who else classifies HTS as terrorists? Egypt, UAE. It'll take quite a bit of convincing to them that they've departed from groups like the Muslim Brotherhood.There's just too many international interests - Turkey, US, Iran, Russia, and others, for any classification or rhetoric to matter. What each international player wants is its own interests. They're using the rhetoric and such for pretext but it's just driven by realpolitik. Turkey for instance doesn't want the PKK emboldened and therefore will want any bulwark against the Syrian kurds, right? It doesn't matter an inkling about rhetoric.CMV if it is a mistake to be optimistic and ifthere is good reason to believe that a rebel victory in Syria would be overall bad for the countryI really don't think the HTS will get much farther than the territory it controls. Iran and Russia see Assad as too vital. But we don't really know what HTS will be like IF it does dispose Assad and gains control over the country's resources. All we are left with is the HTS who is trying their best to either get aid, or to prevent Assad from getting aid.What you COULD see is a complete hollowed out, failed state, like Sudan.

But former Liberal staffer Olivier Cullen says the government's message about Conservative 'games' is a 'win.'**The governments delay in releasing two key fiscal documents may be a tactic to discredit the opposition parties ongoing filibuster of the House of Commonseven though the parliamentary gridlock does not actually prevent the governing Liberals from releasing these itemssay former party operatives.Theres a convenient opportunity or political motivations to blame the opposition parties who are engaged in the filibuster, said former Conservative Hill staffer Yaroslav Baran in an interview with The Hill Times. Theyre using this as an excuse to say, Look, theyre holding up the House.As the remaining fall sitting days wanewith the House set to rise for its winter break on Dec. 17the government has yet to release its fall economic statement or the public accounts.The fall economic statementsometimes referred to as a fiscal update or mini-budgetis primarily a political document, similar to the spring budget, which provides a broad fiscal overview of where the governments finances are headed, and often proposes new spending or changes to revenues.The public accounts provide the audited spending and revenue totals for the fiscal year that ended in the spring. That means this years public accounts will address the 2023-24 fiscal year, giving Canadians a look at how the government did on delivering its financial blueprint for that cycle, which it first laid out in the 2023 federal budget. This document would allow Canadians to know whether the government maintained its deficit target for the year.At her weekly press conferences on Nov. 26 and Dec. 3, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland (University-Rosedale, Ont.) pointed to the ongoing filibuster of the Housemaintained by all three opposition parties since the end of Septemberas the reason the documents have not yet been tabled.[...]The previous week, at the Nov. 26 press conference, Freeland had also suggested the public accounts were being delayed by the filibuster, saying Parliament is not functioning right now and there are challenges in doing our regular parliamentary work, in response to a question specifically about the public accounts.However, either document could be tabled by the government at any time.Olivier Duhaime, a spokesperson for the Speaker of the House of Commons, confirmed this in an email to The Hill Times.Documents can be tabled by a minister at any time in a sitting without the unanimous consent of the House, wrote Duhaime. Although administrative documents or documents required to be tabled by statute are normally tabled during Routine Proceedings, a minister may table any document at any time.While debate on a privilege motion has priority over all Orders of the Day, it does not interfere with Routine Proceedings or other proceedings, such as Statements by Members, Question Period, Royal Assent, recorded votes or the adjournment of the House, he added.Thats why, for example, the government was able to table its supplementary estimates B earlier this fall, despite the filibuster. An associated supply bill to approve the spending outlined in that document is yet to be passed, but the document itself is available to the public because it has been tabled.Similarly, any legislative measures stemming from the fall economic statement could be snared by the filibuster. For example, there will often be a ways and means motion or an implementation act to bring into law certain measures outlined in the fall economic statement. But legislating those measures is a separate action from tabling the document itself.Also, some governments in the past have deliberately chosen to present their fall economic statement outside of the House of Commonsgiving the public remarks that usually accompany its tabling at venues like a chamber of commerce.Asked about this at her Dec. 3 press conference, Freeland took a lengthy pause before responding Usual practice for our government is to introduce the fall economic statement in the House of Commons. Thats where the work of Parliament is done.#Its an excuse: BaranThere has been speculation the government may be delaying because there is bad fiscal news to be reported in the documentsespecially in light of an Oct. 17 report from Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) that estimated the government may have exceeded its deficit target for 2023-24 by more than $6-billion.If there is bad news in these documents, Baran said it would be a smart move tactically to delay their release for a moment when they will get less attention in the news cyclesuch as the week before Christmas.However, regardless of their contents, Baran said he believes the Liberals primary motivation for delaying is that they see it as an effective strategy to cast the filibuster in a negative light.[...]On Dec. 4, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, Ont.) announced he would provide a portion of the Conservative opposition day on Dec. 9 for the government to deliver its fiscal update in the House.The challenge is over to Chrystia Freeland and Justin Trudeau, said Poilievre to reporters. Stand on your feet Monday at 4 p.m. Well clear the deck so you can do it, and tell us how badly youve lost control of the nations finances, and the inflation and taxes Canadians pay as a result.Baran called this is a very prudent political move.Effectively, what its saying is Balls in your court. You have every possibility of doing it should you so choose. So that removes the ability to blame the Conservatives, or any other opposition party, said Baran.Freeland quickly dismissed this proposal, calling it utterly absurd.#Conservative games a messaging win for Liberals: CullenFormer Liberal staffer Olivier Cullen made the case that there is merit to the Liberal argument that the filibuster is delaying these two documents, even though it does not technically block their tabling.Cullen said the filibuster has been a distraction to governing, playing a role in the delay.So I dont think its an excuse, he said. I think that it is a reality.However, he also observed that the position taken by Freeland is a useful tactic to discredit the filibuster.[...]Cullen added that there may also be some other factors at play. He said there could be a desire to delay these fiscal documents if they contain bad news, or a need to retool the fall economic statement to account for a variety of new factors. This includes the governments recent proposed changes to immigration numbers, the GST holiday, and United States president-elect Donald Trumps looming tariff threat.#PBO forecasts larger deficitIf the fall economic statement eventually arrives before the public accounts, it will give Canadians some idea of the governments total deficit for the 2023-24 fiscal year, though not in the same level of detail as the public accounts would offer.In most budgets and economic statements, the fiscal outlook tables contain a column with the previous years revenues, expenditures, and total surplus or deficit.Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said this figure would, at minimum, be very close to the final deficit figure that would be approved by the auditor general to include in the public accounts, given that most of the work on them would be complete at this stage.However, this will not offer the level of detail contained in the public accounts.For example, we wouldnt see which departments and agencies overspent compared to the forecast, or underspent compared to the forecast, said Giroux, as well as the lapses of respective departments, among other items.Giroux said that the Oct. 17 PBO reportwhich forecast the government would have a deficit of $46.8-billion for 2023-24, compared to the $40.1-billion deficit it forecast in 2023s fall economic statementis based on information gathered from the monthly fiscal monitors released by the Department of Finance, as well as PBO analysis of economic activity in the 2023-24 fiscal year, and onward.Further readings:https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-gun-control-announcement-1.7402187https://nationalnewswatch.com/2024/12/05/ndp-pulls-channel-change-on-conservatives-forcing-house-debate-on-abortionhttps://globalnews.ca/news/10901067/conservatives-3rd-non-confidence-liberals/https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/utterly-absurd-freeland-rebuffs-poilievre-s-offer-of-two-hours-to-present-fall-economic-statement-1.7133308Other news:https://nationalnewswatch.com/2024/12/05/former-cabinet-minister-randy-boissonnault-tells-committee-i-am-not-indigenoushttps://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-s-new-public-sector-payment-system-is-still-years-away-from-being-implemented-1.7133923!ping Can","title":"Liberal delays on key economic documents a strategy to blame opposition for paralyzing the House, say political players"},{"text":"A grand jury in Massachusetts?

If the AI job is netting $1500 more per month, that would indicate that the AI is generating much higher productivity than its non-AI counterpart to justify the higher pay. The scenario then, that you are drawing, is a choice between a world in which someone is able to work for $500/month or a world in which they have the option to work for either $500/month or $1,000/month. How is the latter world worse than the first?But this premise isn't even correct (again, for the reasons that I stated in my previous comment, which you have not addressed). At minimum, if an AI firm is charging $1,000 for its AI tools, but another AI firm can provide a proximately competitive product at $500, then the prospective worker/employer is going to choose the $500 AI option instead of the $1,000 option. Now they have a $1,500/month job instead of a $1,000/month or $500/month job.

I think you're (and those you're critiqueing) are at least sometimes doing that.For example, if you say \\"everything is going to be fine\\" someone is going hear that as \\"cool..i'm gonna chill out\\".  People who read your view not as a call to action but as a call to complacency aren't really understanding you, but it's such a fundamentally different orientation that it's expected that you'll get push back.Conversely, some people take the \\"we must convince you of the doom in gloom and how bad things are\\" and then people will get their shit together.  This is more rational to many people - afterall if you actually got how bad things could be wouldn't you be behaving differently today?  It must be an intellectual gap, or a \\"i don't care about others\\" gap, etc.I think the appeal to history is somewhat compelling, but it goes both ways.  Look at civilizations ending - that is part of our history.  Look at how bad some places are that once were not!  History burns both ways - whatever bias you have allows you to see history however you want.  I am compelled on a macro level that things are generally improving, but that doesn't mean there aren't cataclysmic hiccups along the way that we'd really want to avoid but don't seem to do whats necessary to make it happen.I will say I much prefer you approach - positive attitude and belief in change and the \\"we can do it\\" attitude are part of how I approach the world.  But..I think I recognize that this seems polyanna to many or naive.  I think there has to be room for what I think at the end of the day is _quite often_ a different fundamental view of what is motivating.","title":"CMV: The future is going to be fine, if we take action and stop being doomers"},{"text":"Ayn Rand was an outspoken atheist during a time where people would fucking kill you for being an atheist.

Once anti-discrimination, desegregation, and equal rights became more prominent, those programs began to lose support because non-white Americans were now able to fully access them.","title":"Centrist Democrats should stop blaming progressives for Harriss loss: Whether to use he/she pronouns in emails wasnt a factor in the Harris-Trump race."},{"text":"If you know God already, why would you even need Tucker?

While other countries pursued epidemiologically-isolationist policies, Trump pursued a policy of laisse-faire denialism that allowed covid to spread more freely, intensifying its economic impact as well as its death toll (by a factor of hundreds of thousands). Free trade and immigration are a net benefit to the US economy, and the policies Trump has promised will intensify inflation and lower the GDP. A vote for the instigator of J6 is a vote against the status quo in the sense that it is a rejection of the formerly-consensus principles of constitutional self-government on which the country was founded, but economically speaking, voting for a billionaire who appoints other billionaires to his cabinet so that they can abuse their offices to enrich themselves is very much in keeping with the status quo. Wealth transfers to the 1% have been the keystone of the Republican economic platform since Reagan, as has the policy of scapegoating minorities, foreigners, etc., for the economic pain this inflicts upon the working class. Attempts by Democrats to change the status quo (e.g., to provide universal healthcare) are met with obstructionism (e.g., the filibuster), so that when voters aren't content with whatever incremental change the Democrats are able to eek out, Republicans channel their frustration into more scapegoating. They have the advantage because it's easier to destroy than it is to create. Trump simply merely the status quo metastasizing into fascism, and there's no valid excuse for anyone to lend him their support.","title":"CMV: saying it's a global phenomenon isn't a valid excuse when you support globalist policies"},{"text":"Can we get Wasserman to call it?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 5, 2024"},{"text":"Trumps been open about weaponizing the legal system against anyone who opposes him.

But if they must, we want to maximize choice and voluntarism (as opposed to coercion). And if we can't have voluntary organizations, we want small local government so we can maximize the inidivudal's input in the governance they have to subject themselves to.We have lots of institutions we like to help us meet these goals:The Rule of Law to make sure everyone has the same rules and same rights, and to help an economy thrive through predictability. The proper role of the states is to ensure that people's civil rights and property rights are respected. Limited, local government - to make sure that more people have insight into and control over how the power of government is being used, to increase accountability in the use of public money and power, and to make it harder for rich people to buy government influence.Ownership of self and property - property rights and the right to the fruit of your labors make people harder to abuse and coerce, and free-er and more prosperous because they are in control over their own choices and destiny.The Non-Aggression Principal - generally, we believe that voluntary organizations are good, because no one is forcing someone else to do something they don't want to do, and communities are better networked and stronger when they are working together to solve their own problems in their own way. We also just don't like forcing people to do things they don't want to do. So we restrict as much as possible the ability of people, using the power of the state, to force other people to do things.That's a brief overview of my libertarian beliefs.I will add - Germany is about the size of an American state. So as an American, I would say that you are demonstrating federalism - each individual citizen has a bigger say in the actions of the German government, than an American citizen has in the actions of the US Government. This recent election highlighted that many people were happier with their state and local governments than they were with the national government, and that people wanted a movement away from a powerful national government, and towards governments that are more Germany-sized.","title":"What's your understanding of Libertarianism?"},{"text":"Comer needs a new whipping boy now that Hunter is gone.","title":"Will There Be a Bird Flu Epidemic Under Trump?"},{"text":"You can do some things.

Get masks, sanitizer, etc.  Start thinking about your plans for work, school, etc., if we have another COVID-type situation except with a bunch higher fatality rate so you have a mental game plan.

It is obvious and undeniable that the only reason he faced these legal charges were because of Republicans nakedly political and corrupt attempts to target him to score political points against his dad.Again, it's the opposite. The only reason Hunter wasn't facing criminal prosecution for his VERY real tax fraud was because of who his father was. And I'm sorry, but it DOES matter. The Democrats repeatedly said they trust the American legal system and that Biden won't pardon Hunter.  This pardon, and his rationalizations for it, is a direct accusation that our legal system is *no longer* something any American should believe in. That the rule of law no longer exists.  If Biden is saying that the legal system is now based on politics and not law, then it ABSOLUTELY gives credibility to Trump's claims of being a victim of political lawfare.  Different factions of the political system are targeting political rivals in games of lawfare that BIDEN IS LITERALLY SAYING EXISTS!!!!! And yeah, they posted his drugged up pictures with hookers and stuff. And you damn well better believe the leftist media would have done the same with Don Jr. hooker pictures.  Look at the struggle session they did with Stormy Daniels talking on the stand about having sex with Trump. It wasn't even relevant to a case that was about falsifying documents.Go ahead and say it's generally bad for the president to pardon immediate family members, but there's absolutely no reason any of us should be treating this as a serious issue. It's not. No one is ever going to give anyone credit for adequately condemning the pardon, Trump is not going to somehow be even more corrupt because of the precedent it sets, it really does not matter.It's not just the pardon. It's his rationale for it.

The world did not have a spike in free trade, we have had mostly free trade for decades.
