In the real world we must make tough political choices and vote for people who make bad decisions that we disagree with precisely because otherwise we have abdicated our responsibility in a democracy. Their philosophy breaks down in a world where most actors are bad actors, where most people don't want what we want, and where the best of two \\"bad\\" choices is one you're morally obligated to make.I don't even believe Kamala's bad (and certainly think she's leaps and bounds better than Trump on their approaches to issues happening in Israel), but acknowledging their hypothetical I would happily vote for almost any candidate in her position (as the non-Trump leader) because in the short term it is what we MUST do to have a society that functions.","title":"Nancy Pelosi: Benjamin Netanyahu 'never believed in peace'"},{"text":"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-trump-polls-tracker-election-campaign-latest-b2628974.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-trump-polls-tracker-election-campaign-latest-b2628974.html)I guess the leftists who want to punish democrats for not being not left enough or for Gaza should already be preparing for a Trump presidency.","title":"DNC launching Wisconsin ad attacking Green Party candidate Jill Stein"},{"text":"Oh no.

That action is worth more than all his words on that topic.Even if Ukraine was to surrender fully and Russia annexing all of it, and assuming Putin really wants to rebuild the Warsaw Pact and USSR, attacking Poland or the Baltics would be the next step. But since they ARE Nato states and they can trigger Article 5 (Ukraine isn't and can't), Russian leadership still had to gamble on the assumption that NATO really isn't going to react more strongly if one of their members is attacked, compared to \\"just\\" a NATO-friendly nation like Ukraine. No one here can guarantee to you that the Russians wouldn't do that kind of assumption, but it still is a gamble and a possible additional deterrent.","title":"CMV: The US (and other NATO countries) should cease all diplomatic relations with Russia."},{"text":"But firing hundreds of missiles  into Israel isnt?","title":"Biden warned Iran that killing Trump would be an act of war: report"},{"text":"the guy who detonated bombs around children wasn't seeking peace?

He said, Its a problem, sir, they want us to make all electric boats, the problem is, the boat is so heavy, it cant float. I said, that sounds like a problem. He said, also it cant go fast because of the weight, and they want to now have a 50 mile or 70 mile radius, you have to go out 70 miles before you can really start the boat up, and you go out at two knots, thats essentially almost like two miles an hour. I said, How long does it take you to get out there? He said, many hours, and then youre allowed to go around for ten minutes, and then you have to come back, because the battery only lasts a very short period of time. So I said, let me ask you a question, and he said, 'nobody has ever asked this question, and it must because of MIT, my relationship to MIT. Very smart, he goes. I say, What would happen if the boat sank from its weight, and youre in the boat, and you have this tremendously powerful battery, and the batterys now under water, and theres a shark thats approximately 10 yards over there  by the way, a lot of shark attacks lately, do you notice that? Lotta shark attacks  I watched some guys justifying it today, well they werent really that angry, they bit off the young ladys leg because of the fact that they were, they were  not hungry but they misunderstood who she was. These people are crazy. He said, theres no problem with sharks, they just didnt really understand a young woman swimming, No, really got decimated and other people too, a lot of shark attacks, so I said, theres a shark 10 yards away from the boat, 10 yards, or here. Do I get electrocuted if the boat is sinking, water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking? Do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted or do I jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted? Because I will tell you, he didnt know the answer, he said, you know, nobodys ever asked me that question. I said, I think its a good question. I think theres a lot of electric current coming through that water. But you know what Id do if there was a shark or you get electrocuted? Ill take electrocution every single time.

But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that Im talking about, thatbecause look, childcare is childcare, itscouldnt, you know, its something, you have to have it, in this country you have to have it. But when you talk about those numbers compared to the kind of numbers that Im talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that theyre not used tobut theyll get used to it very quicklyand its not gonna stop them from doing business with us, but theyll have a very substantial tax when they send product into our country. Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that were talking about, including childcare, that its going to take care. Were gonna haveI, I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time, coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country, because I have to stay with childcare. I want to stay with childcare, but those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that Im talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I justthat I just told you about. Were gonna be taking in trillions of dollars, and as much as childcare is talked about as being expensive, its relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers well be taking in. Were gonna make this into an incredible country that can afford to take care of its people, and then well worry about the rest of the world.

That starts with pure semantics (NATO cannot be at war, its nations could), more important semantics (The only ones who can declare war are in Congress, and they haven't done so), and then reaches the brick wall that no NATO member state has their own troops fighting in Ukraine.Most western nations - including the US - have decided to not be neutral either, and Russia has said they consider NATO to almost be part of that war, but talk is cheap. Their actions show that they know the difference. No USAF pilots are engaging Russian jets, and Russia has no interest in changing that. That's why no Russian SAMs engage the USAF planes Poland and the black sea.Second, cutting diplomatic ties would be a terrible idea. Diplomatic connections exist to communicate intent. Remember when recently the public got the news about when Russia was preparing a pretense to use nuclear warheads in Ukraine? The US response was a diplomatic version of \\"Don't.\\" (\\"I am the leader of the most powerful military in the world, I don't make threats.\\") The US and NATO still have a lot of cards in their deck. They need to communicate to Russia that things could be much worse. And of course, the fact that Russia communicated that pretext with the US allowed the US to then talk to India and China and asked them \\"Are you cool with Russia making such unhinged threats?\\", which probably gave Russia just another reason to back off.Third, I am not aware of Russia abandoning the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. They are one of the 5 official nuclear nations, they have nothing to gain (and everything to loose) from a withdrawal or abandoning. I don't fully get how that's connected to the rest of argument, but it's also just plain false, so I wanted to point that out too.","title":"CMV: The US (and other NATO countries) should cease all diplomatic relations with Russia."},{"text":"Archived version: [https://archive.fo/zo3IP](https://archive.fo/zo3IP).Summary: Mr Trudeau became a beacon of morality after he swept to power in 2015, welcoming refugees from war-torn Syria that Christmas. He legalised marijuana, rewarding the record number of young people who had voted for him. He faced down a truculent President Donald Trump to salvage the North American trade pact that is foundational to Canadian prosperity. His governments annual payment to families of up to C$7,787 ($5,660) per child under six is hailed for lifting 435,000 children out of poverty. After promising child-care subsidies to help more women into work, working-class and younger voters gave him renewed minority mandates in 2019 and 2021. Three years later those groups have turned on Mr Trudeau. Today both tend to support the opposition, Pierre Poilievres Conservatives. What went wrong? The high cost of housing is central. The cost of owning a home in Canada has increased by 66% since he took office in 2015, with prices rising faster in this century than in any other sizeable OECD country bar Australia. Lack of supply is a problem in many, but is especially acute in Canada. In 2022 the average OECD country had 468 dwellings per 1,000 inhabitants. Canada had 426, a number that has hardly moved in a decade (see chart 1). Mike Moffatt, a housing economist, says a wartime effort is needed to triple the current building rate and throw up 5.8m houses in the next ten years. No such luck. In August, Canadian housing starts dropped to an annualised rate of 217,000. Demand for housing from the large number of immigrants during Mr Trudeaus decade in power has worsened the crunch. The number of temporary foreign workers jumped from 109,000 in 2018 to just under 240,000 in 2023. The number of non-permanent residentsincluding temporary foreign workers, students and asylum-seekershas more than doubled from 1.3m in 2021 to over 3m on July 1st, according to Statistics Canada, representing 7.3% of Canadas total population of 41m. [...] Climate change offered Mr Trudeau perhaps his clearest opportunity to blend moral leadership with pragmatism. But he ignored polling showing that while Canadians were concerned about the climate crisis, they were also loth to pay taxes equivalent to a Netflix subscription to fight it. His carbon tax, introduced in 2019, imposed a levy on greenhouse-gas emissions, currently running at C$50 per tonne, scheduled to rise by C$15 annually to reach C$170 per tonne in 2030. Canadas parliamentary budget watchdog said last week that most households were worse off when indirect costs of the tax were factored in [after 2030]. Mr Trudeaus failure to find a way to compensate groups who lost out as a result of the tax left it and him vulnerable to attacks from Mr Poilievre; he says the tax will lead to nuclear winter, trigger mass hunger and malnutrition and compel poor, older people to freeze. Support for the carbon levy has crumbled. [...] Instead of adapting to or confronting challenges thrown up by his policies, Mr Trudeau has preferred to attack his critics. He seemed inert as the erosion of his partys support has accelerated. Some Liberals privately suggest the breakdown of his marriage last year distracted him. In a shuffle aimed at energising his front bench last year more than half his cabinet changed portfolios, but the economic message remained the same: we will continue to deliver good things to Canadians. Only recently has Mr Trudeau begun to acknowledge that this fell short. Doing good things isnt enough to deal with the kind of anxiety that is out there, he told the Montreal conference. He still describes his voters problems in psychological rather than practical terms.**Boxed out** Mr Poilievre identified that economic anxiety early. This lent him credibility with the sectors of the Canadian electorate who felt abandoned. He has boiled his platform down to a series of simple three-word slogans. He says his first piece of legislation will be to axe the tax, ditching the carbon levy. He has yet to outline what his government would do to fight climate change, but polls make it clear that Canadians care far less than they used to. All too many have forsaken Mr Trudeau, and the causes he stood for.!ping Can&amp;Democracy","title":"Justin Trudeau is killing Canadas liberal dream"},{"text":"He isn't.

I do agree with you that if the full video was leaked, the new Chinese position would just find a new angle somewhere along the lines of those people are American spies attempting to kill the president. Where we differ is that I see the Chinese governments second position (American spies) as significantly weaker than the first. Its much easier to see a video of American spies being killed and question whether theyre actually spies than to see a photo of Tank Man wonder if hes alive. Take the photo out of context and it looks like hes just directing traffic for a parade.Witness testimony exists, but if people witnessed something truly horrible, wouldnt word spread regardless of whether deepfake technology exists or not? I also question word-of-mouth since it can be spread by anyone, including proponents of disinformation such as the government.

(If enforced or incentivized, ofc.) Lafargeholcim has reduced their emissions by at least 25% and aim to be net-0 by 2050. I'd wager there's some European net-zero steel plants too.Also, if you've ever read say environmental tables for different building materials, for a lot of materials, the bulk of the CO2 emissions can and often are emissions from transportation! For example, building a building out of quarried stone can be some of the lowest emissions out there - if the quarry is really close. Otherwise, the truck transport usually shoots it up to some of the highest. This tracks with the fact that the biggest proportion of global emissions come from transportation over any other category.It's good to think about it, as an exercise in your own life! As serious environmental design concerns and efforts are largely informed by local markets, governments, product lifecycles, &amp; supply chains. As an example, if you've never read about lead solder potentially being less polluting than non-leaded solder - seemingly paradoxically, papers found the lower failure rate of leaded solder resulted in less overall waste. [Though, since it's been a decade or more since I last read that, non-leaded design strategies may have since advanced to lower failure rates. Also, it didn't survey the wider range of solder alloys available; I personally expect many of them work far better. Just leaded vs pure tin iirc.]\\nAs another example, most people's small engine gas-lawn mowers over 30 min release equivalent amounts of pollution as a large car traveling ~300 miles. Why? At least in the states, small engines are not regulated &amp; have no catalytic converts and other protections on their emissions. Thus all the really nasty emissions are released into the air. (Similarly, diesel truck transport emits a magnitude or 2 more pollution per kg-mile of cargo than train or boat due to efficiency differences alone. Then even far away building materials might be more emission friendly if you can transport them to site almost wholly by train.)Hence why if anyone is pitching to you that \\"we only need THIS proven environmental tech solution\\" or \\"we do NOT NEED that proven environmental tech solution\\", they're usually full of hot air. The effectiveness of solution XYZ depends too much on local factors. This is also why pigouvian taxes are so damn effective in creating environmentally optimal solutions; suddenly all of this information is baked &amp; abstracted into the price tag! Now you don't need 3+ bachelors &amp; many man-hours of research to arrive at best environmental solutions. That bit can be offloaded to the representatives setting the taxes for different types of pollution.","title":"There is a common talking point among the urbanist sphere that \\"3-5 story buildings are the optimal density for sustainability\\".

As buildings increase in height they also increase exponentially in terms of cost. Building materials go up and more room has to be dedicated to elevators. The reason we have high rises in many places is because single family zoning means that only a few specific areas can have multi unit housing and so there is pent up demand. If you got rid of things like exclusionary zoning, parking minimums, arbitrary setback requirements, unnecessary environmental review ect. you would likely see far more housing in the 3-6 story range and not a ton of high rises. Of course that assumes essentially a largely free market which is simply not the reality. Since we still have those things and we are trying to build our way out of a shortage the market will likely support high rises and they shouldn't be blocked.

I am not at all convinced that net emissions are lower than cities that are taller and denser. But we can all agree that R1 zoning (and accompanying strip malls and minimum-parking suburban sprawl, not analyzed) is the worst option.Caveat: I'm on my phone and on the move, and can't read the studies completely right now. I have browsed, but I will do a more thorough reading later. They didn't make it easy to skim, but I'll get back to it, probably tonight. I'm sure someone will correct me if I've missed something.First, no one is arguing or could credibly argue that the way we zone and build low density suburbs is efficient in any way, and that's the only way you can build. Most North American cities have zoning laws that prohibit anything but single-family stand-alone zoning in 70-90% of the residential land. So we can all agree the thing North America is doing the most of isn't working.There seems to be an over-focus on the buildings themselves in the links. It is true that concrete and steel are extremely high-emissions materials, so it's not at all surprising that buildings made from materials with higher cradle-to-gate emissions would have higher emissions per resident to build. That analysis didn't really need to be done, though. The main thing I'm not seeing here is an analysis of net emissions from dense areas versus high-density midrises versus suburbs. Suburbs are already losing on the inefficient buildings, but what would the story look like for suburbs and mid-rise neighborhoods when your factor in 60+ years of actual living? Things like..* **Resident daily drive time and methods**. Missing this just makes me wonder why they bothered. I don't just mean commuting, but driving the kids to school, going to restaurants, visiting a park, etc. People in cities can generally walk, bike, or take public transport to all of life's activities. Public transport itself is easier to support as density rises.* Miles driven in and between stops to support the residents living there, including garage trucks, delivery vans, service vehicles, and so on* Lawns that don't need mowing and gardens that don't need watering and fertilizing* There was some analysis of wasted space, but there wasn't a full analysis of emissions from public infrastructure construction and maintenance, nor any attempt to analyze impacts on retail, extra concrete and asphalt for strip mall parking, etc.So have they proven that tall buildings are bad? **No**, not even close. Answering that question would require a much more exhaustive analysis.I have some other complaints, like the fact that the first link appears to be based on just 25 UK addresses with 'spot checks' on a couple other European cities. But I'm happy to agree that R1 zoning is the worst option for emissions.If I were doing the analysis myself I'd also like to analyze the quality of life and cost of living. We're humans, and it's not improper to consider how good of a job we're doing building homes for people when considering emissions. Overall they've done no such thing as prove mid-rises are 'more efficient.' You can't just ignore the impact of taller buildings on resident lives or other private and public infrastructure. You will very quickly overwhelm the savings on using less concrete with hundreds of people driving longer for daily activities every day.","title":"There is a common talking point among the urbanist sphere that \\"3-5 story buildings are the optimal density for sustainability\\".

You could clearly see the line between his orange makeup and his pale, white skin, which makes him look even more haggard . He mumbled through many answers, especially when the anchor pushed back on some of his bold faced lies. He no longer gives off large and in chargehes just large and needs to be charged or changed.

Jan 2020 ring a bell?","title":"Biden warns Iran any assassination attempt on Trump would be a declaration of war"},{"text":"Doing the opposite of changing your view, instead Im shoring it up.Democracy sucks and has never done good things for societies, in Europe democracy has turned ancient empires into American puppet states.Of the democratic world theres basically only four nations that relevantly matter as far as success and importance, the U.S, France, Germany, the U.K.The UK still has a monarchy and is basically an honorable mention because of it, a lot of their democratic processes are them pandering to America to keep the friendship alive.France sucks on most metrics other than still being somewhat regionally important, the French democracy has also failed multiple times in the last century and had to be restored by America and the UK, its on the verge of collapse once again.Germany is relevant economically and not really relevant with anything else, in most ways falls under the American puppet category that just has a mention of relevancy due to GDP. German democracy is under threat already even though its barely existed in its current form for much longer than I have, the only reason it even exists is due to American interference.And lastly, the only real relevant democracy that can be used as an example of it working potentially, America. America is so large and resource rich that its too big to fail which is 99% of our success, were notorious for constantly ignoring democratic principles (especially when things get bad, as soon as serious war breaks out we historically just piss on our constitution until its over), and almost all of our success that cant be attributed to insane amounts of natural resources can instead be attributed to the fact that all of our competitors genocided each other twice (more in some cases) in the last century while reducing each others civilizations to rubble, then paid us for the privilege of selling them things during it. Even with that being said, a simple look at American history shows the truth of how bad our Democracy has failed. In the short time we existed we had multiple mini revolution attempts in the early days, a major civil war that to this day has not been fully reconciled, a foreign invasion by a monarchy that succeeded and embarrassed us heavily including taking our capitol, multiple economic collapses, and general irrelevancy on the world stage until after ww2. We became relevant as a nation in our grandparents generation, when you think of it that way its a lot less impressive compared to the multi thousand year empires of the world. Since we gained that relevancy 80 years ago, what have we done with it? Lost multiple major conflicts, have let the Russians and Chinese close the power gap with us, narrowly avoid nuclear war, got close to a civil war/popular revolution in the 70s, narrowly avoided multiple attempts by authoritarians to seize power, and now stand more divided and chaotic than weve ever been, on the sharp decline and brink of collapse. Im a proud American so I think well come back from it, but like usual well probably do so by temporarily throwing aside our democratic values until we fix things as we always do. Most of the greatest things, example beating the Soviets in the Cold War, were done in spite of our democracy, not because of.Tl;dr America is barely a democracy when it matters, all of our worst parts are because of our democracy, and every other democracy that exists and doesnt entirely sucks only is able to do so because America is making it so. Without American interference the democracies of the world would collapse in decades and be taken back over by authoritarians. Americas current dominance is not proof of the superiority of democracy but rather a temporary irregularity caused by external circumstances in thousands of years of consistent data proving that irregularity wrong.","title":"CMV: people are too stupid for democracy"},{"text":"The bar is on the floor, when her competition can only bear to make appearances to yammering to a small crowd of cultists that will hear what they want to, or to only sit down with sycophant's that will bend over backwards to edit out all his more obvious 'senior moments'.","title":"Kamala Harris has agreed to her first-ever Fox News sit-down interview on Wednesday with Bret Baier"},{"text":"Holy shit.","title":"Trump shit himself in front of CNN and Biden (Link to the full debate and timestamp in the comments)."},{"text":"You want good opposition parties for outcomesThe issue is that the Republican party is fucking insane and not good opposition party.

Look to East Asia (Japan, Taiwan, SK) for their streets lined with 10-20 story buildings and their vibrant street life.Transit oriented development could never pencil which such low densities. Transit stations should be surrounded by towers so the system gets funded by the new residents using the transit, which can allow for the metro to keep expanding. You would never see such low development in Vancouver, and many urbanists in cities like Seattle are pushing to have taller TODs.This 5 story trope is often just a Eurocentric view of city planning that places undue emphasis on some arbitrary human scale. And we cant afford to wait for whole cities to density to 5 stories, which would take forever.

So I'm just paraphrasing his research/lectures.Is there a point in size or demand of a location where that extra density offsets the comparative sprawl of 3-5 story buildings?There are locations where there isn't enough land, and the only option is to build up (Singapore, island cities, etc). For a continental city without major land limitations, it's most efficient to build 3-5 story buildings citywide. For high-population cities where that would result in too much sprawl, then it would be more efficient to build 7 story buildings, usually with the bottom two floors using concrete/steel construction, and the top 5 stories using wood frame construction.But, for most cities, having 100% 3-5 story buildings would be sufficient density without needing to go higher, and that's much more efficient than having a mix that includes skyscrapers and single-family homes. Another benefit of shorter buildings is that they can be built with a smaller setback and no space required between structures (think rowhouses), so the difference in density between 3-7 story buildings and skyscrapers can be less than people might assume.That might all change, though, because of new building materials allowing wood to be used for skyscrapers (\\"plyscrapers\\"). That opens up possibilities for cheaper and more sustainable tall structures. That's still experimental/early days, though.","title":"There is a common talking point among the urbanist sphere that \\"3-5 story buildings are the optimal density for sustainability\\".

The short answer here is yes. Generally speaking, typologies with high-density 3-5 story buildings (I'd push that to 4-5) have the lowest environmental impact per resident over their lifecycle.?\\nThis is somewhat counterintuitive because we assume height = density and density is more sustainable. However, this intuition misses two key points the articles makes well:\\n1. Low-rise typologies can be just as dense as most high rise typologies. People here often talk about Parisian density as a good example of this. While it's true you'll never reach Manhattan levels of density in this way, very few places really need to (or even could given light/FAR requirements). Tall buildings also often 'waste' a lot of space due to unique requirements (elevators, second staircase, large structural supports, large HVAC, etc...).\\n2. High rise building have much higher levels of embodied carbon, due to tall buildings need stronger and more polluting materials than low rise, more complicated construction processes requiring more energy, and a host of other reasons. This can be very significant, sometimes the majority of a buildings carbon impact.Now of course there are a bunch of caveats and exceptions here. I'll list a couple below, though this is by no means comprehensive:\\n1. Location context: The contextual benefits of increasing building heights sometimes outweighs the embodied carbon. For example, building extremely densely around transit stations could have a positive sustainability impact by getting people out of cars more often, even if embodied carbon is higher.\\n2. Existing embodied carbon: in the same way embodied carbon makes tall buildings less sustainable, it also makes taking down any existing building stock for redevelopment less sustainable. As such, to achieve the low-rise density typology discussed in the first paper, you might have to tear down a bunch of existing building stock and re-build them in this 3-5 story mold. However, you could theoretically achieve similar densities by tearing down just a few of these dwellings and building tall. It's possible keeping the existing building stock intact and building high on a few lots would actually have a lower embodied carbon.\\n3. New materials: More sustainable materials like cross laminated timber (CLT) or just more sustainable production processes for existing materials, could dramatically change this paradigm. Not my area of expertise, but I remember reading that CLT could reduce embodied carbon of 10 story buildings by 40%.?","title":"There is a common talking point among the urbanist sphere that \\"3-5 story buildings are the optimal density for sustainability\\".

The inflation-adjusted minimum wage peaked in 1968, over half a century ago, and has been on a downward trend ever since.We remain the only developed nation without a universal healthcare system, and the only developed nation where a substantial percentage of citizens are uninsured. We spend far more on healthcare than any other country for results that aren't any better than other developed nations. None of this will change under Harris, though it may get worse under Trump.We remain the only developed nation that does not mandate paid parental leave, paid sick time, or paid time off. Even Korea and Japan, home of some of the most toxic work cultures in the developed world, beat the US here. I *believe* Harris wishes to mandate some degree of paid maternity leave; I would very much like to see that happen.There are many more examples, from awful public education funding to egregious military spending to ridiculous corporate tax loopholes, that, combined with America's individualistic streak, result in the average person not caring about anyone other than themselves. The fact that it's basically impossible here to see a worthwhile return on investment on your tax dollars for either you or your community doesn't help. That's why every proposal for policy that would benefit the general public is met with a mix of \\"Socialism/Communism/Marxism!\\" and \\"BuT hOw WiLl YoU pAy FoR iT?\\" It's no surprise that we seem like a nation of selfish douchebags from the outside.

But there is a higher baseline quality of life there that many Americans simply don't have. Certainly the biggest difference is that life there does not revolve quite as much around work; work is, generally, just a job in Europe. It is not the be-all end-all of survival like it is for way too many people here: there aren't concerns about an injury causing bankruptcy, there aren't concerns that you'll lose your job because you get sick, etc. The tradeoff is that the middle class is much tighter (e.g., there is less space for a more luxurious \\"upper middle class\\" lifestyle) and there are much fewer very rich people. Not the worst tradeoff, IMO.","title":"Opinion: I study nuclear war. Kamala Harris must be our next president."},{"text":"Who is this targeted at?

Its not working out that way."},{"text":"It is a superficial generalisation which depends on tons of local conditions, but the essence of it is true.In short, at around 4-6 story buildings you can make nice building blocks. Blocks with continuous facades all around the block are just extremely dense and efficient. Good examples can be seen in Barcelona, Berlin Friedrichstadt or Amsterdam Haveneiland (look them up in google maps). Central Paris can also be seen as an example, as it has extreme densities, but to me these Parisian building blocks generally have too little open space inside them. 3 floors is also the maximum you can comfortably built with normal rowhouses, which is good when you have less density and in more sub-urban settings.When you built higher, you firstly need more structure per square meter of floor, which shouldn't be overlooked and is expensive. Aspects like fire safety also need increased extra measures. At 3 floors you can built easily with wood, above that you need concrete or special expensive fire protection. This height of +/- 4 floors is also a perfect intermediate where you will use elevators, but plenty of users will still take the stairs, as such making efficient use of your building cores and circulation, not even considering certain regulations about elevator size and capacity which kick in above a certain height. Some of these issues are overly strict regulation, other are essential and unavoidable as higher buildings are simply more expensive and take longer to evacuate from the upper floors. Furthermore, as a rule of thumb, if you go above that height the building blocks will just become too big and massive. You'd either need to increase the width of the streets to still allow for enough sunlight and fresh air, or the buildings change from being building blocks to freestanding \\"towers\\" with space in-between. This can both be less efficient, the buildings will have more space in-between them and will require more facade per square meter of building, which is less efficient.Of course all of this is extremely generalized. There are plenty of developments where higher buildings are much better suited and allow for higher densities. At places like city centres or around transportation hubs you will also want to built higher, or in cities like Hong Kong where land is sparce you also need much bigger heights. Still, for the generic city it's indeed a decent rule of thumb.Then there are more urbanistic and aesthetic reasons for building at such height, the buildings stay \\"human scale\\", in proportion to the size of the trees, and the people living on the top floors will still feel a connection to the street. However, these arguments have nothing to do with sustainability, optimizing density or economic returns.","title":"There is a common talking point among the urbanist sphere that \\"3-5 story buildings are the optimal density for sustainability\\".

For example, Canada requiring two staircases in buildings taller than 2 stories makes it shockingly expensive and space inefficient to build 2+ stories without going all the way to a highrise (see Vancouver). The US requires massive elevators that can fit an ambulance stretcher.Concrete is significantly more polluting than wood frame construction, and most regions don't allow anything taller than 5 or 6 stories with wood even though it's safe. There are exceptions like Wisconsin building a 20+ story mass timber building. I would expect significantly lower emissions from that kind of structure. Going the other way, some modern buildings along the West Coast of the US are extremely sustainable, and Oregon even has a building that recycles its own water.Long story short, tall buildings can be sustainable, and there's nothing magic about 5 over 1s or 6 over 2s besides favorable regulations.Edit: I forgot one other point in favor of building new concrete highrises. Old buildings are almost always less sustainable to heat, cool, and provide utilities for. Because of this, newer construction's one-time carbon cost can be offset over time with the new building's efficiency from heat pumps, insulation, piping, appliances, etc.Edit2: u/Kanlectric there's an even simpler answer within the context of building highrises in established cities. It's significantly better for nature if humans live within dense cities. The more humans live in dense cities, the more unspoiled nature there is. Suburban lawns are insanely worse for biodiversity and animal wellbeing compared to a natural forested landscape. Accordingly, denser cities = more nature.

The House of Representatives elects the President from the three (3) Presidential candidates who received the most electoral votes. Each State delegation has one vote and it is up to the individual States to determine how to vote. (Since the District of Columbia is not a State, it has no State delegation in the House and cannot vote).  A candidate must receive at least 26 votes (a majority of the States) to be elected.The Senate elects the Vice President from the two (2) Vice Presidential candidates with the most electoral votes. Each Senator casts one vote for Vice President. (Since the District of Columbia is not a State, it has no Senators so does not participate in the vote).  A candidate must receive at least 51 votes (a majority of Senators) to be elected.If the House of Representatives fails to elect a President by Inauguration Day, the Vice-President Elect serves as acting President until the deadlock is resolved in the House.","title":"Kamala Harris has agreed to her first-ever Fox News sit-down interview on Wednesday with Bret Baier"},{"text":"She is an opportunist and scavenger","title":"Some Democrats are still hesitant to vote for Harris, citing the crisis in Gaza"},{"text":"I don't think Trump has been on MSNBC since 2015.

In fact, several publishers were arrested and criminally charged for criticizing the Adams administration. Some of those publishers were Jefferson owned or adjacent newspapers.

Paying them lots of career consultant dollars,  apparently.Additionally, the takeaways I got from Bernie 2016 and 2020 were as follows: The system and processes are dysfunctional.  You're not supposed to have any opinions which did not come from MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, NTY, WSJ, etc. If a nice, intelligent, well-meaning media person, who I will call Rachel Maddow, says on her broadcast that the U.S. should bomb Singapore by tomorrow evening, because they're making common cause with Malaysia, well then that's what you're supposed to believe, no questions asked. For emphasis, you're not supposed to have any politics and the political processes are not about politics. The system, processes, and personages are absurd. The Electoral College, the never-ending election cycles; the big donor money, the PACs; a democracy involving a \\"Senate\\", a circle of rotating villains, and of course a Parliamentarian; the Supremes serving life-time appointments (with \\"politics\\" involved); the endless wars and the military/security spending, etc. Bernie's candidacies made political efforts such as those by Genocide Joe Biden and Kopmala Holocaust Harris possible, normal, when they shouldn't be normal. The reason it won't get any better is because the interest groups who benefit don't have any need for politics of the sort Bernie, Kucinich, or FDR would recognize. But does our system support politics for Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, AIPAC, etc? Oh yeah.

That the new dogma that the Constitution, of its own force, carries slavery into any or all of the territories of the United States, is a dangerous political heresy, at variance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself, with contemporaneous exposition, and with legislative and judicial precedent; is revolutionary in its tendency, and subversive of the peace and harmony of the country.\\n8. That the normal condition of all the territory of the United States is that of freedom: That, as our Republican fathers, when they had abolished slavery in all our national territory, ordained that \\"no persons should be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law,\\" it becomes our duty, by legislation, whenever such legislation is necessary, to maintain this provision of the Constitution against all attempts to violate it; and we deny the authority of Congress, of a territorial legislature, or of any individuals, to give legal existence to slavery in any territory of the United States.The law banning slavery in the territories was enacted in 1862, despite being ruled explicitly unconstitutional in 1860CHAP.

After reading your whole comment I now realize why minorities can be protected. I'll summarize what I understood to elaborate why my view has changed (although not totally)?\\n?\\n? ?First off, a true democracy is dumb so that's why they don't exist. We have representatives and legislation to prevent the 51% from ruling. And now our government is like: Anybody running for a governmental office?wants votes, obviously. So they will want to cater to various minorities to get those extra votes needed. An atheistic governor can offer religious freedom to the religious minority, *even though he disagrees with them,* in order that he can get the votes he needs to continue in his office. His opposing candidate will realize that and will likely want to offer the same, to neutralize the governers offer. This results in religious people gaining freedom to practice. It doesn't *always* play out this way, but people will realize this strategy and cater to minorities to gain the edge, resulting in minorities recieving favor and recognition. This might even be why women gained the ability to vote. A president could promise to equalize voting and then he gains a TON of support from women, and that might guarantee him two terms in office. I hope I got that right.\\n? Thank you u/darwin2500 . I now realize that a representative and somewhat restricted democracy is self-regulating.

I was raised in a very conservative home and homeschooled for my entire educational career before going away to college. I went to a Tea Party rally in high school. My parents had me watching as much Fox News as cartoons. The brainwashing was strong. I was just beginning to deconstruct some of those beliefs. Ive never voted for Trump because Ive always seen him as a disgusting charlatan. I also didnt vote for Hillary because I couldnt bring myself to vote dem yet. My way of coping was apathy. The morning after the 2016 election, I saw many people on FB lamenting about Trump winning, literally terrified of what was to come. Sure, I thought he was a POS, but I figured wed deal with him for four years and move on to someone better. I truly didnt understand what was at stake. I made a Facebook post to that effect. I stupidly thought maybe it would help people calm down to be the voice of reason during the panic. A friend of mine tore me up one side and down the other over it. She came out to me that day and explained this was life or death for people like her. She told me that as a white, straight person, I didnt get it. I had the privilege to not worry about it, but many others didnt. I was confused. I felt bad I had upset her, but still didnt get it. I thought she was just scared, but then I started to see. I saw the havoc Trump put our country through and the rights he and his sycophants stripped away from the LGBTQ+ community and encouraged racist sentiment. I saw the hate in full force, and I woke up. A couple of years later, I messaged her in tears and apologized. I explained I didnt get it at the time, but now I did. And I would do my part to make sure this never happened again. Ive stuck to that. Ive voted dem in every election since. I live in Alabama, so its not uncommon for republicans to run unopposed. I write people in out of spite because I refuse to contribute to the poisoning of our country. I even wore a Harris Walz shirt to an art fair a few weeks ago.

The OP seems to almost be bait in creating from whole cloth the notion of a \\"dignity-victim\\" culture when the two concepts are completely at odds with one another. It reminds me of nothing so much as that old meme about how \\"atheists are actually are actually a different sect of Muslims.\\"Essentially everyone interested in studying this aspect of culture, from [ivory-tower cultural anthropologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt%E2%80%93shame%E2%80%93fear_spectrum_of_cultures) on the one end to [cross-cultural missionaries with a strong practical interest in not getting stabbed](https://honorshame.com/the-5-unwritten-rules-of-honor-shame-cultures/) on the other, directly equates honor and shame cultures to the point where they usually use the same word or phrase for each (\\"shame society\\" or \\"honor-shame culture\\" being most common).Of the four principles you assert are associated with honor cultures, the only one with much traction in practice is the fourth one, emphasizing reputation. Points 2 and 3 of the second link are the best explanations of how this works in actual practice. **Social capital fixes anything.**\\n \\n In honor-shame cultures, life is a constant quest to develop and manage an intricate network of relationshipsthat is, social capital. The most important asset any person has is his or her reputation. If other people respect and know you, then you can accomplish just about anything. Since problems are solved via relationships, a strong social network is essential for success in life. You accrue social capital by giving gifts, helping people, and sharing meals. Then, you can cash it in when you need help with a problem.\\n \\n In Western cultures, solving a problem through relationships is seen as corrupt and unfair. We use financial capital to buy our goods and servicesfor which the price is clearly listed and is the same for everyone. **Aggression restores honor.**\\n \\n When honor is lifes most important commodity, then any insult to ones honor must be vigorously defended. Most honor-shame cultures are antagonistic, which means they compete for their honor. When a woman is shamed, her male relatives appear weak for failing to protect her. The cultural response is to defend the familys name with aggression, either against the woman herself or against the aggressor. Similarly, a father whose child turns to Christ may respond with public anger and threats in order to save face in the community.\\n \\n On a larger scale, the rise of ISIS is in part a reaction to international shame and an attempt to restore Islams honor through violence. In the ISIS worldview, blood erases shame.\\n \\n For Westerners, bad behavior is viewed as a crime against the state, not a personal offense or honor insult. Those who respond to dishonor with violence are seen as immature bullies.Since in an honor culture *not* responding to a perceived slight results in actual tangible social harm, it is an obligation, in honor cultures, to blow absolutely everything out of proportion. You are the ultimate eggshell-skull victim, everything demands retaliation, and this makes you a good and honest defender of your family's resources every time you shriek \\"ostracize him!\\" or \\"give me blood!\\"The Founders, by contrast, were [Roman larpers](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/). In Roman thought, both *gravitas* (your obligation to perform your duties with seriousness) and *dignitas* (your duty to act in accordance with your station) overlap to a large extent with the modern concept of \\"dignity,\\" and to the extent that there was a Roman concept of a universal human dignity it was based on [the ability of human beings to act in a superior fashion to other creatures because of humans' possession of reason](https://academic.oup.com/book/5774/chapter-abstract/148938644?redirectedFrom=fulltext). A human that did not live up to this status -- like an emotional incontinent that would lash out at any goading in order to defend their \\"honor\\" -- effectively counted as an animal instead, with what they did being essentially akin to actually shitting on the floor. (Or, in Stoic philosophy, a wicked man is \\"like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes.\\") Because of this, the Romans had a reputation for very open speech to the point where [\\"speaking with Roman plainness\\"](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/-em-futuo-em-how-the-romans-swore/276397/) was a Colonial-era euphemism for the most awful vulgarities, and half of the quotes we remember from them are hilarious insults.(The chans are actually somewhat good examples of dignity cultures, because of this; since it is impossible to retaliate or ostracize, it's getting baited that confers a loss of status.)Since the Constitution was more modeled on classical Rome than not, and since \\"I will skullfuck you for slighting me\\" was both routine conversation in classical Rome and also would have been fully within the Founders' understanding of what routine conversation in classical Rome would have been like, it is very obviously true that the intent was **explicitly** for people to say disgusting, vile, and hateful things, without shrieking less-than-human animals getting away with imposing \\"consequences\\" or \\"having recourse.\\"","title":"CMV: The Founding Fathers of The United States came from an Honor Culture and meant for \\"Free Speech\\" to be interpreted through that lens."},{"text":"You know \\"spook\\" is a racial slur, right?

The point is that at the same time we were in favor of some horrible things (some we actually did not vote for), we also decided to change those. Yes, women couldn't vote before, but now they can, and have far more rights than they used to. Yes, we used to slave people, but now we don't (there are some countries that do but that's out of the scope). Nowadays we surely have a million things wrong, we could probably list them, but step by step we try to be better.In addition, generally minorities look for the same solution, each case is different, but segregation, racism and etc usually are solved the same way for everyone, for example, targeting a better education, equality of opportunities, social sensibility...

Then it's not the majority deciding, it's one ruler or a set of nobles deciding, and they're rarely going to feature *anyone* from minority groups.  Minorities do much worse under these systems, historically; whereas democracies have at least voted to free slaves and etc.If you have something that's *better* for minorities, then it's fair to criticize democracy in comparison to that.  But if Democracy is literally the best system for minorities that has ever existed and no better options are on the table? Then it's disingenuous to criticize it for being 'bad for minorities' when every minority would prefer it over the alternatives.2. The US isn't a true democracy,The thing here is, the US version of democracy, with a constitution and proportional representation and all the like, was *intentionally designed* to protect minority voices and improve on what you are calling 'pure democracy'.What you are calling 'pure democracy' is actually just 'dumb democracy', which has obvious flaws that everyone who cares about democracy already knows about and has tools in place to correct.As such, your argument, so far as it relates to 'pure democracy' in the hypothetical, sort of boils down to 'if this system were implemented in a really stupid way that no proponents of it actually want, then it would be bad.'  Which, yeah, bad implementations are bad; that's a truism, it's not a slam on democracy.\\nAnd so far as your argument applies to real democracies like the US, I say again, bad compared to *what*, democracies have ended slavery and passed civil rights laws and protected minorities in many ways that no other form of government has.\\n3. Ruling by majority means, of course, that the majority decides.This is a place where the details really matter.  Because in practice, what is actually true is that the majority *coalition* decides.Lets says that black people are 13% of the population.  Most presidential elections are won by about 1-5% of the population.  Most races for Senate are won by less than 10%.  If both sides were totally ignoring black people because 'they're a minority, and the majority rules in democracy', then either party could at any time start appealing to black people in order to capture 13% of the vote and win everything in a landslide.Which is in fact what has happened historically, with both parties trying to capture various minorities at various times with a variety of appeals and concessions, and neither party doing *too* much to piss off minorities because they need at least *some* of them to win.In a healthy representative democracy, where the parties are competitive and need every vote they can get, minorities can be crucial blocs in deciding any coalition victory, and do well for themselves.Even if you imagine a 'pure' democracy with no representatives and everyone voting directly on every measure (which has never been tried), I would still expect people to divide themselves into factions much like existing parties, and to coordinate into coalitions for important votes, and for minorities to be able to leverage their collective votes in the formation of those coalitions much as they do under representative democracy.","title":"CMV: Democracy hurts minorities"},{"text":"Sounds like your view was changed","title":"CMV: Democracy hurts minorities"},{"text":"In other words, he was unpopular as a result of opposing a illegitimate illegal war in which civilians were regularly slaughtered and people were forced to fight.","title":"Opinion: Time is running out for Kamala Harris to break with Biden on the Gaza catastrophe"},{"text":"?Let's call democracy the rule of the majority,Let's.Except: the majority of what?

It also shows how people in the same group can have radically different concerns and demands. Both poltical parties in the US are examples of this (the dems to a greater extent).So essentially there is no single stable monolithic \\"majority\\". Therefore the entire concept of \\"majority rule\\" is somewhere between incoherent and tautological. E.g. \\"Majority rule? Which majority rules?\\" or \\"under majority rule the majority is the coalition that rules\\".The most clear representation of this is the opposite of majority rule: minority rule.

Think Uyghurs in China, LGBT in Russia, versus racial minorities or LGBT groups in Western nations. All of the problems you can list with minority rights in democratic Western nations (eg. police brutality, economic inequality) exist much worse in non-democracies, and these groups also have to deal with literal reeducation or criminalisation in many cases. It's also the case that many non-democracies have more homogeneous populations, so there may seem to be less issues since these countries do not really accept minorities full stop (eg. in China there is almost no immigration). But that is not because their government is better at protecting minority interests.I would also point out that most countries do operate de facto on popular opinion, it's just that in countries without free speech (which I consider a tenet of true democracy), the majority is advantaged even more because there is no incentive for the government to act in the interest of minorities. At least when bad things happen in democratic nations there will be a public discussion, news articles etc. which will usually improve the situation somewhat (as members of the majority also care to some extent about the minority issues they hear about). Furthermore in countries with more free speech, the vast majority tend to agree with ideas like individualism which means the average person is more likely to agree everyone should have the same rights etc.Finally, I believe the theory you gave of democracy is flawed; I don't believe there is a consistent majority who a) know their interests and logically push those forward and b) exists in a stable form over time from election to election. A lot of people vote emotionally, irrationally, based on random specific policies, or because they find candidates attractive. Those candidates then implement policies which may or may not match their pledges, and may or may not have the intended effect. So the simple idea majorities will simply vote over time to strengthen themselves I think is false. In fact, in almost every democracy minority rights and interests have advanced over the last 50+ years, whereas if your theory were true they would've gone backwards.","title":"CMV: Democracy hurts minorities"},{"text":"It's not centuries old - such a historical fallacy","title":"Opinion: Time is running out for Kamala Harris to break with Biden on the Gaza catastrophe"},{"text":"Please outline your plan to stop the centuries-old conflict if it is so easy.","title":"Opinion: Time is running out for Kamala Harris to break with Biden on the Gaza catastrophe"},{"text":"Hmm.. so youre telling them not to do something and they are definitely going to do it..","title":"Biden warns Iran any assassination attempt on Trump would be a declaration of war"},{"text":"It was lame.

In the case of the USA it's the system of \\"rights\\" that can't be voted away.  For example, it's not a legal determination of a majority to make a law that is discriminatory in nature - flies in the face of the bill of rights.  You couldn't create a law that said \\"belief in communism is against the law\\" because of the first amendment.  Of course there can be abuses of power that occur including abuse of the electoral process.Then you're not dealing with the non-democracy alternative.

Even if they have good intentions, nobody can know everything and they could be just as stupid or incorrect in their pursuit of doing good as everybody else.The way I see it, democracy in general is a higher floor, lower ceiling type of a government as opposed to dictatorship in its various forms as a high ceiling, very low floor. Would a dictator be able to get more good done in the most optimal situation than congress? Sure. However, the capacity for tyranny, mismanagement, and overall disaster is also much higher when all of the power is concentrated. Even if they are trying to do the right thing, they can make mistakes that cost millions of lives; and in the pursuit of doing what they believe is right they can very easily become cruel tyrants that crush any dissent (I cant do the good things I want to do if Im deposed/stonewalled, so I need to remove those obstacles).Either end of the spectrum is bad, so governments today are generally somewhere in the middle leaning closer to one side or the other. In the U.S for example, we have the will of the masses vote for representatives who are generally better informed both on the issues and with the wheels of government who temper the often reactive and emotional populace. We have the House of Representatives who are generally more extreme and animated, and then the Senate which is generally more moderate and tempered.","title":"CMV: people are too stupid for democracy"},{"text":"1.

In a democracy, at least minority groups generally do have the ability to vote and make their voice heard, and can try to convince other people to support them.You say you're not interested in hearing whether Democracy *can* benefit minorities nor do you want to hear about better forms of government.

True democracy is a good starting point when the alternative is chaos, but as we progressed and settled into it, we incorporated more systems to accomodate the minorities, This is an ongoing process obviously, but seeing how the LGBTQ community is growing ever so rapidly, that should indicate that we're at least heading down an incrdibly, unprecedented form of inclusivity that no other governmental system has ever seen or allowed before.In short, democracy in it's pure form is inherently detrimental to minorities, but it is the (in my opinion essential) gateway to more inclusive types of government.","title":"CMV: Democracy hurts minorities"},{"text":"These people can't even vote for him.","title":"Bernie Sanders joins striking Marathon refinery workers on picket line in Detroit"},{"text":"That's a weak-ass excuse.

You are presenting the argument that our founding fathers operated within an honor system, yet here in this comments section where you are being given specific examples which prove that is *not* the case you are defaulting to this false pretense and in doing so begging the question.This is circular reasoning, you have completely failed to give evidence for your claims that the founding fathers of the United States operated within an \\"honor system\\" other than your own precarious assumptions about them. You say yourself that you are \\"not familiar\\" with any of the sources commenters here have presented to you in order to attack your claim. The truth of the matter is that these duels were not about \\"honor\\", they were about *public image* and *pride.* This is not the same as an honor system, which is an intentionally vague and disingenuous descriptor anyways.Furthermore, the \\"penal\\" part of the supposed \\"honor system\\" you're describing was considered barbaric and childish by the time the United States was founded. Dueling was quickly made illegal almost anywhere it happened to take place. Within the first 30 years or so of Independence, dueling was already criminalized in many areas and the practice was *very* often talked down upon by *most* of our Founding Fathers because violence was considered a juvenile (and often uneducated) reaction to speech.As another commenter has already pointed out, these people weaponized speech against their opponents *all the time* arguably to a greater extent than we do today. If you think yellow journalism is bad now, look at snippets of journalism from the early days of Independence. There was little legal recourse at that time if a paper published *blatant lies* about a person's character, and political opponents would weaponize the papers against one another to say the most **heinous**, vile, putrid, god awful shit about each other -- Many times worst I'd argue than our politicians of today.Our founding fathers condemned the practices you're claiming they glorified. As evidenced by their behavior (and **a lack of restraints on speech even when it came to blatant libel, slander, and defamation of character**) it's pretty clear that they were free speech absolutists.tl;dr: You don't even know what you're talking about.","title":"CMV: The Founding Fathers of The United States came from an Honor Culture and meant for \\"Free Speech\\" to be interpreted through that lens."},{"text":"Explain how Dems are dictators.Explain how you know Trump was joking, when he's been asked to clarify that statement *multiple times* and has stuck with it and doubled down.  but we need a strong smart leader like him anywaySo, not Trump then?she got where she is by sleeping with the mayor of San FranExplain how sleeping with the mayor of San Francisco get someone into the position of Vice President.  Be specific.","title":"Kamala Harris campaign is falling rapidly behind Donald Trump, 3 new polls show"},{"text":"Excerpt:In an appearance this week on the daytime talkshow The View, Kamala Harris was asked how her presidency would differ from Joe Bidens. There is not a thing that comes to mind, she said. The comment was seized on by the Trump campaign, who have used it in an attempt to seize upon Bidens unpopularity and blame Harris for the issues that seem to most enrage and terrify their supporters, among them high consumer prices and immigration. But the comment also rankled some members of Harriss own base: namely, the young, progressive and non-white voters who have been distraught over the suffering inflicted by Israel in its US-backed war on Gaza.If Harris cant think of any way she would differ from Biden, these voters may have some suggestions for her. The Biden approach to Israel, after all, has been disastrous on multiple fronts. It has been a moral catastrophe, with Israels wildly disproportionate campaign of indiscriminate slaughter in Gaza leading to famine, plague and tens of thousands of deaths. It has been an electoral liability, alienating Muslim and Arab American voters in the crucial swing state of Michigan and depressing turnout among the young voters whom Democrats have long relied on and which were a crucial part of Bidens 2020 victory.\\nAnd it has been a complete strategic failure, with Israel now expanding its war into Lebanon, the region on the brink of a large-scale conflict between American and Iranian proxies, and the whole world watching as American leaders fail to exert any meaningful pressure or discernable consequences on a small country that has used a great number of US weapons while completely ignoring US instruction.\\nThere was a moment, earlier in the war, when things could have gone differently. After the October 7 attacks killed hundreds of innocent Israelis, the Biden administration reportedly urged caution. But it was only in February, some four months into the war, when much of Gaza had already been leveled and its hundreds of thousands of people displaced into the south, that the Biden White House attempted to stop the Israelis from invading Rafah, the small southern border city where the refugees had fled, by delaying a shipment of 2,000lb bombs.\\nThe move had broad support: Nancy Pelosi, hardly a robust supporter of the Palestinian cause, was by then urging enforceable conditions on aid to Israel. The move would also have had the benefit of bringing the Biden administrations actions more plausibly into line with American and international law, which compels that states not sell arms to armies, like Israels, that have likely committed war crimes.\\nIt was, to say the least, a mild gesture, and not one that had any impact at all on Israels military readiness: all told, America has sent more than 10,000 such bombs to Israel over the past year, many of which have been dropped on Gaza. By the time the Biden administration even so much as dawdled in sending military support to Israel, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians had already been massacred. But reportedly, the anger that this small act of non-compliance provoked among Israeli officials and the American pro-Israel lobby was so intense that the Biden administration got spooked.\\nNo meaningful conditions have been imposed on military aid since, and Israel has openly flouted American efforts to de-escalate, continuing its brutal assault on Gaza, launching an invasion into Lebanon that has displaced approximately 1 million people, and attempting to provoke Iran into an outright war C which, Benjamin Netanyahus Israeli government seems to believe, America will fight on Israels behalf. Meanwhile, the whole world watches on, with every foreign leader around the globe seeing anew each day the bleak reality of diminished American power: the United States, the Gaza war has proved, neither keeps its promises nor follows through on its threats.\\nBut for all that the Biden administrations handling of the Gaza war has been devastating and embarrassing internationally, it has also been unpopular domestically, creating real electoral dangers for the Harris campaign. The protests that sprang up across American campuses last spring were not merely the venting of a fringe minority; they represented a large-scale mobilization of young people morally outraged by the images coming out of Gaza.\\nThese young voters view the Biden administration as complicit in a genocide; for Democrats to assume that this belief is insincere, or that those who hold them will overcome such a grave moral objection and turn out to vote for Harris anyway, seems both entitled and unwise.\\n[Time is running out for Kamala Harris to break with Biden on the Gaza catastrophe](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/14/kamala-harris-israel-gaza)","title":"Opinion: Time is running out for Kamala Harris to break with Biden on the Gaza catastrophe"},{"text":"You mean the one he didnt have?

But consider this...Between Hamas and Netanyahu, the stage has been set in Palestine/Greater Israel to ensure that the only way peace will come to the region is with the expulsion/eradication/suppression of one of the conflicting groups. That is a very brutal reality now. If DJT is the next president, I know which group will gain the upper hand in that struggle. And all the political organizing that Arab supporters in the US might do will not be enough to turn back that tide. It will be too late.So you decide.","title":"Some Democrats are still hesitant to vote for Harris, citing the crisis in Gaza"},{"text":"In the final months of the 2022 election there was a coordinated effort by conservatives to absolutely flood the polls with right-leaning junk polls for the dubious purpose of skewing public perception on the state of the race, and discouraging liberal turnout due to hopelessness. Of course, there was a predicted red wave that then never materialized.Were seeing the same playbook today, as the majority of recent polling has been from unreliable low-quality sources. Whether or not it actually affects voter turnout is up for debate, but another likely reason theyre doing it is so that they can cite such rosy numbers as evidence of voter fraud should Trump lose the election by wide margins.Youre right to be deeply concerned, however, I wouldnt base such worries on the polls alone. I, myself, have stopped looking at them entirely, as their veracity had problems long before this due to methodology that no longer works in the 21st Century.","title":"Democratic voter registration raises red flags for Harris"},{"text":"The polls are being manipulated","title":"Democratic voter registration raises red flags for Harris"},{"text":"The real outrage isnt that she used actors.

Everyone encounters prejudice from time to time, but most folks aren't prejudicial in the way media tends to depict it, because media is showing you bright-line culpable behavior rather than ordinary ambiguous situations. The problem we have is that we are falling into seeing society as \\"_the_ Democrats\\" and \\"_the_ Republicans.\\"Both parties right now are once divided to direct our attention to problems that are not easily solved, or which are divisive. This means that when the parties switch, each races to undo what the other has just done. And leaders come into office with just barely 50% approval rating. Folks like me will give any elected a leader a chance to make good on his promises. But at the same time, a candidate who promised to do ordinary things wouldn't make it through primaries. So the Parties either have to engineer the primaries to exclude candidates who would get popular support for dramatic change (e g., Sanders) or bypass the primaries to install a publicly unpopular but politically established figure (e.g., Harris).Our current mode of polarization is divisive. It's like a heart fibrilation, where the thing shakes in place without moving forward. What makes it more intractable, is that the original constitutions was designed to _cause_ congress to lock up when we're did t have cooperation, and _cause_ the president to be unable to address issues at the state level. Modern folks tend to forget that. We don't want a king. We abhor a dictator. But at the same time, we've frozen the number of congressmen in the house of representatives, and made senatorial campaigns incredibly expensive. So it becomes contest that invites corporate sponsorship and special interest influence. I have to crystal ball, and can't say what the \\"best\\" solution is. But honestly, we need to have a purposeful national conversation about how we want to repair the mechanical components of the democratic system we've inherited. To round back to your question; I dislike it when political parties lean too deeply into the race, religion, national origin, and sexual orientation questions because these divide is into \\"imaginary communities\\" that don't have to exist, and change based on circumstance. When I visited Kenya many years ago, I was called \\"white\\" because I have some French and Scotts-Irish ancestors-- African Americans are a mixed people almost always. Years ago, I studied in China, and my political views aligned far more closely with my classmate from Georgia than the average PRC student just because default assumptions about freedom of press, expression, and petition to government are so fundamental we don't talk about them here. Abroad, we're all Americans. And we forget, that at home, we're still all Americans. With the enhanced security, vilification, stress, and pressure, I don't know how anyone would even _want_ to be president anymore.","title":"Obama Scolds Black Men and it BACKFIRES; 'I Got A Dad, And He Ain't You!'"},{"text":"It's beyond voting....","title":"Von der Leyen's authoritarian plot - European National democracies will be subordinate to her EU Commission"},{"text":"It's been three hours and you're ignoring the contradiction in your own claim here.

Do we want to help them too?), then we will also have the technology to wrongly imprison people. Hell, we would have the technology to falsely exonerate people accused of any crime because they could produce convincing video of themselves distinctly *not doing crime* at the time the crime occurred. Your response to this conundrum has lazily been \\"but the technology would only be good enough to convince regular people, not those smart court people.\\" I think you misunderstand the media, the masses, and even how courtrooms work.

I posed the question this way:\\"If someone were to spread a deepfake video of you in any sort of sexual context, would it feel any different than if they shared a real one?\\"All three responded in roughly the same way: they'd be shocked that such a thing even existed because none of them have ever been recorded during any sort of sexual encounter / behavior, but if the video did exist, they'd be horrified because whether it was real or not, it would *look* real and thus people would have that image in their heads now.  And I'm inclined to agree with them.  While it *creates* plausible deniability, I don't think that makes it any better.  Some people will never accept that a video is fake and will immediately assume it's real, but even if they don't, it still *looks* real, which means people are, for all intents and purposes, watching you do something exceptionally private.

Will it benefit college kids? We're talking about people who will feel shame regardless of the nude being real or not. There were kids in a New Jersey HS that were found to be making deepfakes of girls in their class. The impact cannot be understated here. Whether it's real or not will not matter to the people impacted by it.I am just trying to understand how people will actually argue \\"Well it's a deepfake\\". Considering that plenty of people don't believe stories of abuse. Where do you see the shift happening to where people would accept that line of thinking? How many years into deepfakes being widespread? If people stop feeling the need to care about images, videos and audio, they might find it easier to switch off and more sceptical of the way that evidence is bent by those with an agenda, including conspiracy theorists. Too often such media makes us feel emotions that we don't know how to place, and then they go in the wrong outlets.Those things are evidence though. Pics, video, and audio are crucial things we use to show proof. Currently we have ways to fake images, videos, and audio. We have made up stories and people latch onto them. People take things out of context. I'm struggling to understand why you think we'd suddenly change the way we engage online or about issues in a social media landscape where the more you stoke the flames, the more money you make. But people might instead rely on loud, deranged influencers who appear to have sorted through the mess and come to simplistic, \\"authoritative\\" conclusions. I don't think we're biased to those kinds of conclusions like you seem to be implying but groupthink can have that effect. Do you have any more examples?We have a rise in right wing content that is served up to men and gets into many popular hobbies men enjoy. You can look at this sub and a lot of reddit. You can go online and easily find videos with millions of views that push dangerous narratives. These people won't be walked back if you can deepfake stuff because they will feel it's true. Look at how many popular videos online are just Man on the Street style videos or responding to one dumb TikTok post. A lot of people don't think deeply. This isn't an insult to people. They just don't engage in some topics with as much reflection and thinking. That requires time, effort, and interest. We all pick and choose what we decide to think about deeply. So in a world where there's so much fake information, people may decide none of it can be believed or they may decide well this could be fake, but what it says is true. I mean that is the basis of the entire manosphere online right now. It is the common defense for many online discussions of a Youtuber people want to show others.","title":"CMV: the proliferation of deepfakes will give plausible deniability to people who have had videos shared about them without their consent, and that's a good thing."},{"text":"Seems like it.","title":"Why is Biden throwing Harris under the bus?

It is easy to fool people even with media that has not been doctored, by only showing a partial perspective or a particular angle. Surely the point for such events is to promote the idea that they must be understood from a more holistic perspective, which means witness testimony, government policies and ideological messaging in the lead up to such an atrocity etcTake the Israeli genocide. Government officials constantly deny the veracity of specific videos, fine whatever. But then their social media accounts in Hebrew use dehumanising language and promote violence against all Palestinians, US and Israeli media use the language of \\"human shields\\" to justify bombing civilian populations, and paramilitary groups protest for the right to sexually assault Palestinian prisoners.

But feel free to give me examples of this.Part of my understanding of why people's consumption of political media specifically and media more generally has gone off the deep end is that there's simply too much. Too many things to care about, too much messaging. If people stop feeling the need to care about images, videos and audio, they might find it easier to switch off and more sceptical of the way that evidence is bent by those with an agenda, including conspiracy theorists. Too often such media makes us feel emotions that we don't know how to place, and then they go in the wrong outlets.I reserve some optimism with our ability to form productive, coherent and humanistic theories about the world, maybe from my socialist and critical theory background. I genuinely believe one does not need to go beneath our social reality in order to understand that things could be better, and systems are broken. But people might instead rely on loud, deranged influencers who appear to have sorted through the mess and come to simplistic, \\"authoritative\\" conclusions.

We know Hamilton, who was willing to kill and die for honor in duels, cheated on his wife at least once prominently. Belonging to an honor culture doesnt mean you are personally more honorable, it means your socioeconomic position (which jobs you get, which social circles you run in) is tied to your personal reputation. It has basically nothing to do with your morality as long as you can keep things private. The founding fathers always talked shit under pseudonyms.

Racial polarization and educational polarization seem to be increasing.The idiosyncracies of voters range from who is going to approve funding to fix the local storm drain to who is going to make them feel good to who is going to maybe potentially improve their quality of life just a bit. I get the sense from polling on things like immigration and abortion that the Harris could be up there with Slick Willy in terms of conservatism (crime bill, welfare reform, use of federal law enforcement) and probably still struggle with a potential reelection against a Kemp or Haley campaign in 2028.

What prevents labourers from doing this, is that they don't have capital themselves, and it is hard for them to get capital themselves if the resources of the world are already staked out and claimed.In early industrialisation, this was very quite explicitly noted by capitalists, who argued for the closing of common lands to force people to instead work for them. For example, in 1807 an English gentleman wrote:often at a loss for labourers: the inclosure of the wastes would increase the number of hands for labour, by removing the means of subsisting in idlenessIn a book about colonisation written in the 1840s, the author laments that:Where land is cheap and all men are free, where every one who so pleases can obtain a piece of land for himself, not only is labour very dear, as respects the labourers share of the product, but the difficulty is to obtain combined labour at any price.Henry George doesn't suggest recreating the literal commons, but to give people access to shared natural wealth through land value taxation.

The answer isn't to eagerly embrace a hell of a lot of innocent people being transformed into extreme porn stars despite doing nothing of the kind to act as cover for those that did make choices they now regret.The flipside of that is that people who watch such recordings can no longer be sure that they're watching the real thing, which to some won't matterWell it matters when scammers can spoof fake nudes and then use them to prey on people younger than themselves or to gain access to genuine materials and information that can be used for blackmail.It matters for catfishing, when people mislead their partner's and at very least waste a hell of a lot of their time.  And if it is extreme enough to make a difference in consent terms its a form of rape as consent was built upon that lie (like saying you were wearing a condom or didn't have HIV).More importantly though, if we can't trust video evidence, everyone is going to have to make decisions on what to believe is true based on littel more than their gut as there will be loads of fake vids of everything you can imagine bouncing around.  That's a real problem, we are already seing the impact via Trump's alternative reality via \\"fake news\\".Hell it may matter in mental health terms when people become absorbed into their own AI personas and both people are basically cosplaying as characters who are dating each other and neither knows anything true about the other.If recordings need to be verified in a court of law,?[there are ways to do that](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/05/1241446778/deepfake-audio-detection)Well sure, with enough forensic power you can ultimately unravel all sorts of subterfuge, but that's going to be expensive and an arms race in and of itself.  If we fully trust any video that gets through the \\"integrity test\\" whatever that test may be, then there will be a MASSIVE incentive for people to produce AI video creators that can gert through that test.More importantly, people's lives can be utterly ruined by rumour alone and if there was a fake video of me stomping on puppies or having sex with someone underaged, unconscious or actively resisting me then all my coworkers are going to have an emotional reaction to seeing me and treat me as a predator.","title":"CMV: the proliferation of deepfakes will give plausible deniability to people who have had videos shared about them without their consent, and that's a good thing."},{"text":"Democracy is the worst form of government.

After that her campaign has been infested by consultants that have historically given democratic nominees awful advice and slogans. On more than one occasion Kamala has said she has had talks about election strategies with Hilary. Unless those talk are about Hilarys flawed campaign and how not to campaign there is little value to be had.As for the Liz Cheney issue there is no excuse. The never Trump Republicans at this stage are already firmly either going for Kamala (a small percentage) or the ones staying home/going third party have had their minds made up already. To me picking a far right Republican to campaign with to show solidarity seems a bit strange when there are far less radical never Trump Republicans to do the same with.I think, and want Kamala to win but she needs to get back to campaigning more like before the convention as a progressive and spend less time worrying about Liz and Hilary.","title":"\\"A wake-up call for Democrats\\": NBC News poll shows Trump, Harris in dead heat"},{"text":"really really wanna go for a walk while its still dark and cool, but I woke up feeling really nauseous ):guess Ill drink water and hope it goes away ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I think a lot of them are young and bitter at the conceptual establishment but are much more winnable overall.","title":"We have had Reagan Democrats, and also Biden/Harris Republicans.
