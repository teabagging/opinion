He legit thinks *everyone* does this. People don't actually know that about Jimmy, but it eventually comes out in conversation because it's weird that Jimmy seems to accuse everyone of masturbating all the time, it's weird that they find out Jimmy doesn't understand normal hobbies.That's Jimmy's 'situation normal'.  He has no self awareness(awareness that other people have other experiences, memories, lives). Jimmy thinks everyone is like him. It is all he knows.  When he accuses someone of it, it's not projection, it's a legitimate belief.Projection is either a self defense mechanism or a full on conscious tactic.\\"It's all they know\\" is a simpler admission.It can be difficult to tell one from the other sometimes.Republicans dont care about censorship, they want to silence anyone with another opinion, and dont have the balls to admit it.This is an admission, imo.

He mismanaged COVID at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden.- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans took advantage of both opportunities to blame their opponents for the economic consequences.- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% - Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge.- The Trump admin crippled the labor movement and made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.- Trump shirked responsibility for the pandemic and encouraged his supporters to politicize everything pandemic related, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*To elaborate more on Trump's tariffs:Most economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.This was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency.And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression.The process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations, things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved, and risks that Trump failed to take into account. Trump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.They will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources to manage the fallout. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesAnd yes, when all is said and done, Trump's tariffs will disproportionately affect farmers and agricultural workers, groups that, ironically, vote for him in droves.Trump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the outcomes are estimated to be costly for most Americans. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \\"national sales tax.\\"Trump is not an \\"economic genius,\\" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. Trump has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:- Trump Casinos and Hotels \\n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\\n- Trump Magazine\\n- Trump Airlines\\n- Trump Beverages\\n- Trump \\"The Game\\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\\n- Trump Mortgages\\n- Trump Steaks\\n- Trump Travel Site\\n- Trumpnet\\n- Trump Tower Tampa\\n- Trump Vodka\\n- Trump Fragrances\\n- Trump Mattress\\n- Trump Network\\n- Tour de Trump\\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\\n- Truth Social (why not call it \\"Trump Social\\" at this point?)Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.He has profited off of screwing over people who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties for decades, he even lied to get on the Forbes list.Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money from his father and from banks, avoiding paying income tax for many years, amassing unsustainable debts, then dumping them onto others.Then his lucky break, The Apprentice. By the show's premiere, Trump had squandered his riches, but the show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.Trump is not a financial guru, his admin's \\"economic achievements,\\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.The next Trump admin, which is already the richest in U.S. history, will destroy what's left of a labor movement that's been in steady decline ever since Reagan's presidency. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of union workers, when he stated he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.And over the next four years, Trump's MAGA coalition will continue their efforts to redistribute wealth to the top.Even Trump's immigration policies, and his plan for the \\"mass deportation\\" of immigrants, will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP.","title":"CEOs Want Trump to Change Course on Tariffs.

Excerpt: Donald Trumps tariff threats have triggered a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign to soften or alter the president-elects plans. But the effort faces a potentially insurmountable roadblock: Trump isnt budging. That has left business executives scratching their heads about how to lobby for exemptions from the steep tariffs Trump has promised on imports from China, Canada, Mexico and other countries.  So far, executives are facing setbacks as they canvass Trumps aides for advice on how to influence the president-elects next steps. Trump is largely acting on his own, leaving his incoming team of advisers with few opportunities to shape his thinking. His recent late-night social-media statements about tariffs have come with little warning even to some of his closest allies, according to people familiar with the matter. Trumps team has told corporate consultants there is no waving the president-elect off his plans to make liberal use of tariffs once he gets into office, the people said.

I don't think ?? many of you get it. There's going to be political persecution against Democrats and this includes companies who have normally shown support to liberal views. This is why these billionaires decided to donate 1 million dollars to show they are on Trump's side.We (the Democrats) lost not only the presidency, we also lost the Senate, the house and a multitude of multiple local elections!!!!In My mind, people will never vote for a woman president until this country is on its death bed, which we're going to be during this second Trump presidency. Also, too many Democrats have tried to do \\"the right thing\\" and use bipartisan methods to govern, but the cost of doing this has ruined our chances at showing people what we really stand for. What do I mean by this? Every fucking time a bill is passed by the Democrats, it gets earmarked in the Senate by Republicans and watered down to the point where the bill is pointless. This means there's no meaning behind the bill.Republican voters are single issue voters mainly and don't care about anything getting passed and these Republican lawmakers know this. This is also why they don't have a solution to the \\"Affordable care act\\" and why they never will!!!!!I've been saying all along and even posted on here that it's high time Democrats start playing the Republican game, but people are too goody two shoes to do it!!!Now, under this new Trump administration, we have to live our lives in fear like Jews under the control of Nazi Germany or blacks (in every generation known to US history).I feel that it's too late to make change because all, yes all of Trump's cabinet picks will be appointed.Back to the point, if you want to survive in the \\"Fourth Reich\\" as I call it. You better blend in and that's what these people are doing. Just recently, ABC News had to pay Trump 15 million dollars just because they told the Truth about him raping E. Jean Carroll, but since he's president of the United States, he writes things in his own image and he knows he can because people idolize him.Do you think ?? any of these companies want to suffer the same thing under Trump's second term? I would think not and if a million dollars makes the dude happy so you (the CEO and their company) can keep doing business, then do it.Welcome to New America!!!!A lot of people voted for this and they really have no clue what mistake they did. They just didn't want a woman as president and like I said, we as Democrats couldn't convince people that we did anything positive for the people of the United States and thirdly, it's easier to persuade a person to vote with anger than being content and happy and this is part that Democrats have to learn, you have to get people angry to vote, not keep the nice and happy.","title":"Meta, Amazon and tech CEOs make $1 million investments in Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"Donald Trumps 34 felony charges were for interfering in the 2016 election, and his first impeachment was for interfering in the 2020 election.Weve known this for a long time","title":"Seth Meyers: Trumps fake populism was a con and it couldnt be any clearer"},{"text":"President can only fire them for cause.

Turns out most of them and the vast majority of the country agree now it was a bad idea, *including Trump,* who despite saying he was against the war, was at best lightly for it when asked in '03. Yet it goes back even further: NAFTA? That was *Reagan's baby* and dream, and a *conservative dream*, it's just that 1) Clinton was a stupid \\"Third Way\\" Democrat, an idea that only took off after Democrats got obliterated by Reagan in '80 and '84, then lost to his VP in '88, and 2) far more Republicans were in favor, regardless, while Democrats were insisting on inserting things like worker protections, etc., into the bill, stalling its passage. Guess what \\"both sides\\" now agree was a bad idea, including Trump? NAFTA.Now what are people on the left saying is a bad idea? Trump himself, and 'Trumpism' as a whole: that it's a big con, and all his policies will *hurt* all the lower, middle, and basically anyone not in the top 0.001%.

When it is trained on image data, the original images are not preserved.The process of training an image model involves it viewing images, doing all sorts of transformations on them to glean information about how the image is composed, and setting a bunch of weights in a neural network. The original image is thrown away and never returned to the user. Then, using that abstract model of the data, it will build up a new image that you ask for using what it has learned.If it returns an image of RDJ, it's because it knows the basic shape of a person, it knows that when you have images of iron man it tends to be composed in specific poses using certain colors, and it knows the size, shape and color of the features of RDJ's face have come to be associated with Iron Man, and iteratively layers noisy smudges of color, removes the smudges that don't seem to match its understanding of what various features should look like, and it keeps going until it has a new image. None of the data that is being used here is pre-made images that are simply stuck together. They are generated from the abstract data it has gleaned from its training. It really is a new image.The word stolen doesn't really make sense to use here. Intellectual property doesn't get stolen, intellectual property rights are infringed upon, and this is an important distinction in this case. It's purely a legal concept. If you draw a picture by hand of RDJ that is too close to an existing copyrighted work, that would also be infringing. When you play video games like City of Heroes or Champions Online that involve creating your own character from scratch, you're not allowed to make a character that looks too close to Iron Man even though all the assets used in the character creator are unique and owned by the developers. It has nothing to do with how your brain stored and retrieved the understanding of what RDJ looked like, it has to do with the final work and how close it is to something that has IP protections on it.Images that are generated (whether by human or by machine) can infringe upon other people's intellectual property rights, but whether a work is infringing is a property of the work itself, not of the creation process. The training process might involve gathering and storing works in a way that infringe upon IP law (so that they can be fed to the training model), but once those images are fed learner they are thrown away are not present in the final model. [You can also build a model that is not trained on anything encumbered by IP law - here's a simple example that was trained on just a small handful of hand written numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFztPP9qPRc&amp;t=1153s). Whether the resulting images generated are \\"new\\" or not has nothing to do with IP law. There may be ethical issues with how images are sourced, but it's not related to the inner workings of diffusion models.So no, you have not just mashed together parts of existing copywritten works when you have a model generate a new image, unless you consider a person drawing Iron Man from memory mashing together parts of existing copywritten works too.","title":"CMV: OpenAI model training constitutes fair use"},{"text":"if you say so &lt;3EDIT: aaaand I'm blocked.

This time Republicans will do a token attempt at doing something to alleviate prices, while trying to do the most extreme elements of their extremist agenda. What Trump is going to focus on, I think, is grifting as much as he possibly can, and having massive amounts of corruption with big business. It actually might occasionally be at odds with Republicans. By that I mean, Trump is going to use his position to gain favor and wealth from rich businesses / business leaders in our country. Not just for the money, but specifically the power he has over them and the favors that he can do for them are going to be too irresistible for him to pass up.He's a lame duck. He can't be elected again. So anything he does now won't even matter. He never actually cared about the Republican Party, and never actually cared about doing good policy. He just saw the presidency as a means to get wealth and power. And that's exactly what he is going to do this time. Last time was different.

Maybe be less surprised?Corporations save a ton of money with less oversight because it allows them to cut corners and exploit workers. They also lobby lawmakers to sway policy in their favor, and which side has more rampant corruption? They also rely on lower taxes to keep their coffers full. Which side advocates for lower taxes? Foreign adversaries want to keep people dumb and complacent in case they ever decide to invade. Conservatives policies bring us backward in time, and politicians that run on these platforms seek to silence voices, not to incorporate more.Religious leaders want to keep power because they have held onto it for so long, WHILE watching their strength dwindle as good times prosper, and in the face of adversity alike. They want people scared of foreigners, others, and of the status quo changing, because it drives them to church. The basis of faith is to believe something you cant see, and thats how they tailor their rhetoric.

And Liberals are actually sitting on a winning issue, but as usual, you've gone nuts with it. The larger Conservative position isn't that global warming isn't happening, but that the various proposed solutions to it would be worse than if it just happened. You could tone down the rhetoric and make \\"solutions\\" less drastic, but if course you don't. Instead you keep pushing your fear tactics that Florida and NYC will be underwater by 2020 unless everyone does what you want. And Conservatives just aren't buying it, particularly when prediction after prediction comes and goes. And specifically Al Gore's powerpoint video was full of predictions like that.Also nobody buys it because you're hypocrites.

So you guys tell us the sky is falling yet do nothing but sit back and wait for Big Government to do everything for you and we're not supposed to think this is just a plan to make government bigger?And adding onto the hypocrisy, you also lie about your findings. The \\"hottest day in London's history\\" was a temperature recorded at an airfield the second that a couple fighter jets were taking off. Or the NOAA re-averaging historical weather data specifically to make the past seem colder. Lots of such examples. If you have to lie to push a narrative, why should anyone believe what you say?During the Global Cooling scare of not too long ago, there was a plan to cover Greenland with coal dust, with the idea the earth could then absorb more heat. Gonna guess you wouldn't be in support of that plan now. If a crazy plan from only 40 years ago was terribly wrong, what makes the crazy plans of today so right?Today, US republicans operate even more fervently on tribal mentality. If Kamala Harris stormed into a burning house on live tv and saved a baby, we all know Fox News would spin it into a sinister hoax.Yes, of course you guys are above it all. Trump wins Time's Person of the Year and the resulting news articles are quick to note that Hitler once won it, too. Funny I don't remember those articles when Obama won.

When I worked for a large Law Firm defending lawsuits one of the first tasks on a new case was always to prepare a budget. The company wants to know how much time and money it will take to defend the case.  As we got further into the case the company always wanted a trial budget. Trial budgets were easy. Take how many days you expect the trial to last. Five business days for example. Calculate out 12 hours a day for that number of days at a senior partner's billing rate and 12 hours a day for an associate's billing rate.  Add another Associate's billing rate for 6 hours a day to be in office support. Add the billing rate for a paralegal for 12 hours a day for those 5 days. A senior litigation partner at the time and in the place I was practicing law was $800 an hour.   48,000 for the partners time for the week of trial. 36,000 for the associates' time for the week of trial and 18,000 for the paralegals time for the week of trial.  Then you have to factor in travel expenses and the fees for any expert Witnesses and their travel expenses.   Boom you got $150,000 trial budget.Part of the budget was an estimation of the liabilities. If it was an initial budget it was always preliminary because you didn't know all the facts.  The next concern was what are the outside cost of settling a case. Will it set a precedent and indicate that the company is willing to pay money or will it have a positive impact in terms of resolving an ongoing legal liability.  I don't fault ABC for settling.  They were in front of a hostile judge with an opponent who prides himself on making litigation as punitive as possible and potentially incurring the enmity of a sitting president who views criminal investigations and litigation as a form of punishment.   The balance sheet was probably looking pretty scary. I think said wing sets a bad precedent but I can see how the corporate executives were willing to pay it to try to come out ahead.","title":"Trump was prosecuted under the Espionage Act  now he'll turn it against his \\"enemies\\""},{"text":"All I ask is he cuts benefits to the disabled veterans since they voted for Trump by 2 to 1 margin.

They could have continued to fight to drive home the point that what what said on the air really wasn't defaming.

People wanted Dominion to go to trial and force testimonies and so on. But when Fox dangled 3/4 of a billion in front of them... it was a straight financial decision to accept. I am not going to look up the exact estimate -- and it is an estimate since Dominion is privately held and not required to disclose earnings, etc. -- but the settlement was equivalent to some 20 years of yearly income to the company.

And he sees it as crucial to ensuring his expansive agenda C which includes deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants and imposing tariffs on all the U.S.s trading partners C is put into force.The crazy lunatics that we have, the fascists, the Marxists, the communists, the people that we have that are actually running the country, he said in one typical stump speech, those people are more dangerous, the enemy from within, than Russia and China.To his critics, this is authoritarianism, driven by a desire for revenge.While Mr. Trumps path is complicated and certain to be met with court challenges, he likely will have the power to make at least some of it happen after his Jan. 20 inauguration. And the consequences would be sweeping....The civil serviceOn the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to make every federal government employee C of which there are about two million C fireable by the President. Late in his previous term, he rolled out a plan to change at least 50,000 civil service jobs into political appointments, but he didnt have time to implement it before losing re-election.Whatever number Mr. Trump ultimately lands on, the effect would be similar: He would be able to either fire much of the bureaucracy and replace it with his loyalists, or create a threat of firing to ensure compliance with his orders.This is an enormous deal. What it would do in a single stroke of a pen is upend 140 years of bipartisan support for a non-partisan civil service, said Donald Kettl, a former dean of public policy at the University of Maryland.Currently, the vast majority of federal government employees are hired on merit and protected from arbitrary firings. Mr. Trumps plan would at least partly revert the government to the 1800s spoils system, in which the President had a free hand to appoint and dismiss whomever he wanted, usually based on political allegiance....The Department of Justice, intelligence and the militaryMr. Trump is promising to use the federal government to exact retribution on a long list of people.He has pledged to put various political opponents on trial, including Mr. Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and members of Congress who have investigated him C though in an interview with NBC earlier this month he said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to pursue Mr. Biden unless I find something that I think is reasonable. He has suggested that Mark Milley, the countrys former top military commander, should be executed. He has said he will have Google prosecuted for displaying too many negative stories about him in its search results....Independent regulatorsThe U.S. currently leaves a wide range of government regulatory decisions to arms-length bodies. The idea is that having such rules enforced and interpreted by independent tribunals makes them less susceptible to being manipulated for partisan political purposes.Mr. Trump, however, has promised to put at least some of these agencies directly under presidential control, including the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC).These changes, even if implemented incompletely, will have the effect of weakening or dismantling the already shaky checks and balances in the system. Rather, these moves look to concentrate power in the office of the president either directly or indirectly. This will in the long run be detrimental to the government as a whole, and to the people they represent and serve.edit: grammar","title":"Donald Trumps master plan to overhaul the U.S. federal government, and the consequences it may have"},{"text":"And then to top it all off they throw the economy into recession after said deregulation.

Countries could hate each other alot but as long as there is no sense of a deadline the conflict could be allowed to simmer or freeze. India Pakistan have an incredibly hot relationship with a ton of friction. They even flirted with war, but there has always been some sense of resolution or equalibrium reached because there never been a sense of \\"do or die\\". Same thing with Korea rn. Offically they are still at war, but practically there is no rush to fight a war so both sides just wait. When you look at conflicts in history you realize there is a deadline to alot of them. Sinwar knew that Israel was making massive inroads with the Arab world thus he knew he had to do something to break that relationship. Putin knew everyday Ukraine  was getting stronger and closer to the west and every day he was getting older. Reason why US war planners view late 2020s as the highest risk of China invading Taiwan is because that's when China population will peak due to one child policy and when China will be at their strongest. Due to the energy, expense, and slowish communications in 1914 Europe an assassination gets blown up into a continental war. This lack of time I feel is the most critical aspect of why conficts happen, and why conflicts freeze then thaws. They Syrian Civil War froze but due to other conflicts and the sense that the current time was the best it was ever going to get for Jolani, he decides to launch an offensive at the end of November.
