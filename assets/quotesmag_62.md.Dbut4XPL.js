The study is looking at a subset of people who experienced long-term cognitive effects after recovering from COVID. This group is predominantly represented by unvaccinated people because those who are not vaccinated are far more likely to experience such long-term effects. In this subset, the vaccinated people experiencing long-term cognitive effects still perform better on tests of cognition compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. In other words, in the minority of cases when a vaccinated person experiences these effects, the impact is less severe than it would be if they were unvaccinated.Vaccination significantly mitigates this risk by making such long-term effects much less likely to occur in the first place. As the second link noted, severity and duration of illness are the main contributing factors that lead to decreased cognitive performance, and both of those factors are substantially mitigated by vaccination.People who are fully vaccinated and up to date on all of their boosters are unlikely to develop any long-term symptoms, including decreased cognitive performance. Here is a study showing the significant benefits of vaccination in curbing the likelihood of long-term symptoms: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaccination-dramatically-lowers-long-covid-risk/ Another piece of good news from this study is that the current variants appear less likely to inflict long-term effects on cognition compared to the strains circulating in the early stages of the pandemic: \\"Multiple findings indicated that the association between Covid-19 and cognitive deficits attenuated as the pandemic progressed. We found smaller cognitive deficits among participants who had been infected during recent variant periods than among those who had been infected with the original virus or the alpha variant.\\"All of this is to say that while I agree COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to unvaccinated people, it has been largely mitigated as a threat to the vast majority of vaccinated people. There will always be vaccinated folks who are still at risk because of their age, immunocompromised status, etc., but for most folks, the current strains of COVID-19 will cause mild illness at the very most, with a low likelihood of long-term symptoms. Thanks to the power of science, most vaccinated people don't need masks or other mitigation measures under most circumstances.","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"Two horrible people sitting next to each other, sad that the same person took their power away ?","title":"Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris after the 2024 election results\\n"},{"text":"Sanders is naturally diminished after his campaign was not supported (to put it lightly) by the DNC, and his own mistakes.

All the way back in 2016, the answer to Trumps right-wing populism scapegoating immigrants and promising change was Bernies left-wing populism (correctly) blaming the wealthy and elite with real plans for drastic changes to benefit everyday Americans and address wealth inequality: his policies like raising the minimum wage and Medicare for all had and continue to have public support.Obama was elected in 2008 on the promise of change and Dems lost support every election afterwards once people didnt see enough material change in their everyday lives. Clinton lost the white working class in 2016 because they didnt trust her to improve their lives as a status quo continuation of Obama, and Trump at least promised some kind of change and gave them a false scapegoat to blame and hate. In the same election that Trump flipped Florida, Florida voted for a $15 minimum wage by an even larger margin.Biden won in 2020 off the economic consequences of COVID, and still mightve lost without COVID literally killing more Republicans than Democrats. Harris lost even more of the working class than Clinton because people blamed her for the failures (real or perceived) of the Biden administration, and she didnt do enough to distance herself from Biden and his policies. Regardless of the fact that inflation isnt truly Bidens fault, that Biden cant directly force Israel to stop in Gaza, etc, just the fact that Biden wasnt seen as doing enough and Harris didnt promise drastic differences from him was enough to cost her votes from apathetic Democrats and independents. Theres a reason Republicans ran ads here in Michigan to convince people that Harris is just like Biden, with a voice clip of her saying she wouldnt change a thing from Bidens policies, and another specifically calling out how little shed change from Biden and invoking Bernie by name.Assuming Trump doesnt destroy the country over the next four years with Project 2025, the Democratic Party needs to take a long hard look at itself and ask whether its going to finally embrace left-wing populism or continue its losing streak against Trump and his successors right-wing populism. The cliche that those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it rang true on Tuesday: 2016 shouldve been the wake up call, and this loss in 2024 might already be too late.

So if you're a gang member and you would normally be killing somebody, why not kill a white person? Do you think that somebody thinks that white people are better, are above and beyond dying, when they would kill their own kind?AndSouljah: You can't call me or any black person in the world a racist.

Clinton said this:\\"If you took the words 'white' and 'black,' and you reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.\\"He loudly denounced them and it helped him out big time.

Poor governance, with results that are immediately visible/tangible when going to a city centre make for poor electoral results.I also think that there's a complete dearth of bold ideas in  Western politics. Trump's bold ideas are stupid, but they are nonetheless bold ideas. This sits in contrast to most center to left types who either offer more of the same (which reads as basically doing nothing) or seem frightened of their own shadows. Where is the creativity, leadership and follow through?I go into the city centre and the number of empty shopping units is staggering, yet I almost never hear of any way of fixing it.

On the stump, in town halls, and through various written and video formats.That is also a man who could explain that immigration numbers were inflated because the same people were being counted multiple times and kept re-entering after being deported, due to changes in policy.I also disagree with the PR strategy. It was a clusterfuck. They knew inflation was coming and didn't get out in front of it, policywise or PR wise. Biden didn't/couldn't provide routine and coherent updates or forecasts from the podium.

We support bodily autonomy for everyone including trans people. We protect women's rights and we did that in a state that will still vote for Republicans and we still fought off Glen Younkin's attempts to take those rights away.We are still a swing state but we're one where the Democratic party knows how to win and knows that talking about socialism is fucking stupid. And I'm going to say in future arguments \\"I am a Virginia Democrat\\" like I'm metaphorically flopping my gock on the table because I am.We won last night. I miscalled this election because I knew my party was doing the work, I knew I was doing the work personally to convince the conservatives I know to support Kamala, I knew Virginia was going to go blue, and I thought, mistakenly, that the Democratic party leadership in other parts of this country were going to do their jobs too.We are in the south and women like me and cis women as well are all playing this game on survival mode and we fucking won.The rest of this party needs to sort itself out, engage with rural America, focus on supply side work and making it easy for businesses of all sizes to succeed and for the people who work for them to earn a living, support the social programs that build social peace, engage with winnable conservatives, educate voters on the issues without fucking talking down to them, kick out the elitist assholes, and prove to the local leftists that you can win things for their progressive agenda without using their stupid fucking language that loses elections so that even they feel alright jumping on board because they get red meat when you win or whatever the vegan version of that metaphor is - just like folks in rural areas do so that your votes out there stay high enough that Richmond and Nova-like areas can put it over the top in a commonwealth-wide race.And don't send feminists to convince men to vote for you. Send men who are comfortable being in coalition with those feminists who can talk to other men about the issues that those men care about.Often jobs and inflation. But also things like abortion rights. \\"Do you want your wife and daughter bleeding out in a parking lot like they are in Texas? Because I want to protect my wife and my daughter no matter what.\\" That hits harder when it's husband to husband and father to father.I'm so fucking furious with the leadership in all these other states for fucking the dog on this election.Most of the people in this country hate Donald Trump. He will start as the most unpopular reelected president in American history.We won our election in this state on tuesday, in the South, in a Commonwealth that still regularly elects Republicans, and we did it while sweeping every single competitive race in our Commonwealth.The rest of the state and commonwealth party leaderships have absolutely zero excuse for their pathetic performances and the years - years! - of uncorrected failures that led to tuesday's disaster.I am a Virginia Democrat. We did our fucking jobs. The people in the trenches in the rest of this country did theirs.The party leaderships that failed us need to do their fucking jobs or get out of the way of those of us who know how to win and who proved it on Tuesday.","title":"Is a Bill Clinton \\"third way\\" style Democrat the way forward?"},{"text":"Wish hed have appointed someone other than spineless Merrick Garland as AG.

Nobody has a right to use their body to murder another person, much less a person they *literally created* and who had no say in the matter, who is also powerless has no means of self-advocacy.Less than 1% of abortions in America occur because of pregnancies initiated by rape or incest; less than 4% occur with a rationale of medically credible health risks for the mother associated with carrying the pregnancy to delivery. America has seen an average of over 1 million abortions every year over the last 25 years, and fully 95% of them have been mundane, elective pregnancy terminations serving as a form of retroactive birth control for women who were too irresponsible or impulsive to utilize reliable preventive birth control methods like hormonal birth control or the copper IUD, which are now cheap and ubiquitous, as a condition of basic prudence for engaging in recreational sex.Personally I'm a voluntaryist/anarchist and would prefer to see solutions to this problem that look very different from what we feasibly have in front of us given current circumstances, but if we have to live with a state for the foreseeable future then one of the few remotely legitimate functions I'd prefer for it to serve is to enforce general prohibitions against things like murder.

I think the explanation is a tad more nuanced. I firmly believe that if the candidate was a white man, Donald Trump would have been resoundingly defeated. I say this because exit polls show that while people voted for Trump they were actually still very dissatisfied with him. This election was mostly voting against Kamala Harris. (By the way this is not to say this is Kamala Harris fault. She ran a near flawless campaign, better than Clinton probably, devoid of any scandals or major gaffes, yet the results were actually far worse.) Arizona, for example, could elect Donald Trump but not Kari Lake. Instead, Ruben Gallego, the democrat, won by substantial margins. So the potential to elect a democratic president was certainly there, inflation did not make it impossible (i.e., this was no 2008 or 2020), but America was not electing a woman, let alone a black woman in 2024, period. [Theres evidence](https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/vfsc20/224632.html) that under times of economic stress / anxiety (high inflation or unemployment), low-info voters (uneducated, low-income, rural, Latino men, young men, working class etc) especially those in affected labor markets turn to the more masculine candidates. This relationship transcends political parties, too, and is more rooted in gender which would explain how voters in deep blue states and counties shifted significantly away from Harris. Litigating over minutiae and whether Harris should have said this or that or made overtures to certain demos is futile and is, in my opinion, kind of a pedestrian armchair analysis that we tend to naturally jump into post-election. I think its more simple, Kamala Harris (or any other woman for that matter) never had a chance in 2024, all else equal, no matter what she did. I was listening to The Daily earlier and the analysts are trying to extrapolate from this election that it signifies a seismic realignment. I dont necessarily think thats the case. Exit polls show that most people disagree with Donald Trump yet they would rather see him, a man, as commander in chief than a woman. The economic conditions and cultural tenor wasnt right to elect a woman in 2024.Harris poor performance in deep blue districts suggests she likely wouldnt have made it out of a shotgun primary / contested convention either. For years this subreddit trashed Kamala Harris but once she was anointed as the nominee its like this subreddit fell into a stupor about her electability. I suppose the stark contrast with decrepit and flailing Biden overshadowed her likability and electability concerns (which we all knew beforehand). Maybe we were riding the highs from 2022? Maybe we were starry-eyed bushy-tailed angel-headed hipsters living in our liberal Bushwick Whole Foods Sweetgreen-saturated keffiyeh-wearing Brat bubbles and flew a little too close to the sun? *A black woman as commander in chief of the armed forces of America?* BFFR. I think we forgot that racism and misogyny are deeply imbued within the American cultural fabric whether we want to admit it or not. Not to toot my own horn but I [pretty much predicted this would happen 100 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/XB4sD2Lbp4) and was excoriated by this subreddit, deemed a reductive racist, and one commenter even said just admit you hate black women! There are key takeaways that arent so obvious that we can glean with this most recent election. This isnt a massive realignment or dramatic reckoning. If our democracy remains the same, we can certainly win in the midterms and in 2028. Another takeaway is that Hillary Clinton actually ran a very good campaign, the economic stars were mostly aligned and the potential to elect a woman in 2016 existed. The glass ceiling was in reach. Men were voting for her. Black men and Latino men turned out. The margins which she lost key swing states were razor thin - Jill Stein voters, Bernie or Bust voters, or the Comey letter, any one of these small perturbations could have acted as the ultimate tipping point. Lastly, our strategy should balance our agenda with the state of the economy. This American electorate is like Maslows hierarchy of needs with the economy at the very bottom and the black queer trans nonbinary vegan ncaa athlete living in Gaza at the very top. Doesnt mean that prioritization is morally right but it is what it is. We cant help or progress if we dont win.","title":"Democrats ask: Why didn't anything work?"},{"text":"I don't think a woman is a good idea (sadly) but I am thinking AOC or Katie Porter (more KP because she doesn't get as much vitriol) .

This shift is particularly pronounced among younger Indian-American men, who might have been expected to rally around Harriss candidacy. Instead, theyre leading a generational realignment, pushing back against Democratic policies they feel have drifted from core priorities that resonate with them.Adding to this sense of disconnect is Harriss approach to her heritage. Unlike figures like Vivek Ramaswamy, who has embraced his Hindu identity, or Vice President designate JD Vance, a devout Christian whose wife is proudly Hindu, many Indian-Americans, who had hoped for a deeper cultural connection from someone with shared roots, have been disappointed. Harriss approach, some feel, lacks genuine cultural pride, coming across instead as shallow symbolism.As legal immigrants who followed a rigorous process, Indian-Americans generally support merit-based immigration but are wary of what they see as the Democratic Partys lenient stance on illegal immigration. Many waited yearssometimes decadesto gain legal status and are troubled by seeing people crossing the border illegally, receiving refuge, social benefits, and work permits. Additionally, the Democrats?have repeatedlyleveraged the status of skilled workers stuck in the lengthy immigration backlog to push for citizenship pathways for undocumented immigrants.

It is enraging that the Democrats are so smug and blind to this.But these are all just symptoms.  The deeper reality is that liberalism has failed, liberalism is dead, and people urgently need to wake up to this fact and respond accordingly. It is a defunct ideology that cannot offer any meaningful solutions to our social and ecological crises and it must be abandoned.Democrats have proven over and over again that they cannot accept even *basic* steps like public healthcare, affordable housing, and a public job guarantee - things that would dramatically improve the material, social and political conditions of the working classes. And they cannot accept a public finance strategy that would steer production away from fossil fuels and toward green transition to give us a shot at a liveable future.Why? Because these things run against the objectives of capital accumulation. And for liberals capital is sacrosanct. They will do whatever it takes to ensure elite accumulation, it is their only consistent commitment.  At home, they suppress and demonize progressive and socialist tendencies. Abroad, they engage in endless wars and violence to suppress input prices in the global South and prevent any possibility of sovereign economic development.The Democrats have done all this purposefully and knowingly, for my whole life, not as some kind of \\"mistake\\" but in full consciousness that it is in the interests of capital.And because liberalism cannot address our crises, and because it crushes socialist alternatives, it inevitably paves the way for right-wing populism.  They know this pattern, and yet they risk it every time - this election being only the most recent example. They did it in 2016, when they actively crushed the Sanders campaign and sent Trump to the White House. They do it because ultimately they (and I mean the liberal ruling class here) don't really mind if fascists take power, so long as the latter too ensure the conditions for capital accumulation. They 100% prefer this to the possibility of a socialist alternative.So, progressives have to face reality. The dream of \\"converting\\" the Democratic party is dead. This is now a fact and it must be accepted. The only option is to build a mass-based movement that can reclaim the working classes and mobilize a political vehicle that can integrate disparate progressive struggles into a unified and formidable political force and achieve substantive transformation. This will take real work, actual organizing, but it must be done and that process must begin now.\\" - Jason Hickel","title":"White House: Respectfully disagree with Sanders that Democrats abandoned working class"},{"text":"Speak for yourself","title":"Biden urges Americans to 'accept the choice the country made' in a White House address following Trumps win"},{"text":"Tantrums should be ignored, just like you do for 2 years olds.

I watched a trial with subtitle translation, occurring in Afghanistan right after the recent American withdrawal. Immediately, the US installed judge was removed and the community put a local expert on the Koran and Sharia law in his place. A woman came to court claiming her husband had been killed, she thinks by his brother, but didn't know, but his brother was asserting he had a right marry her. Her position was that she had never learned to read, because she obeyed the law, but was certain she remembered hearing that the Koran demands she return to her father's house until such time he could find her a suitable man to marry, and that this is what she wanted because her father chosen her husband and she loved him, so she trusted her father to choose a good man again. The brother of her dead husband was cavalier about how it had always been the tradition in the region that when his brother dies, he has a right to take her as his wife if he chooses. The judge condemned him harshly, because he could read, and ignored the Koran and Sharia law, and was there making his case based on a heathen regional traditional practice. He complimented the woman for remember what Allah commands, even though she could not read the command itself, and for coming to the court to see it carried out. He told her father not to worry about this man, and if anyone present should see him trying to ignore the court's order to seize him and bring him before the court immediately, then he sent them on their way. He had his bailiffs bring a man recently convicted of shoplifting in and had his punishment carried out, cut off an arm. He told the man he may return home or to his brother's house, and he may have his brother's things because he had no evidence he had killed his brother and no reason to believe there was a another living person with a better claim to his estate, but warned him not to steal what is rightfully her father's until such time she is rightfully her husband's, after one is chosen and a marriage occurs, because he will be treated as a thief and it'd be hard to get away with it with so many present.I'd call that justice. It's certainly not a system I'd want to live within, but there is an objective rule that is to be obeyed, an impartial arbiter of disputes according to that rule, and far greater faith and compliance in the rule and it's arbiter among the community that will honor the decisions and bring any contempt or violation they witness back before the court.

The choice has already been made. America has,willfully and unironically, voted for fascism over democracy, blind to the consequences of its own decisions.

Look the Arabs have been defeated by  Israel since 1948 when Israel declared independence. Before Hamas and Fatah there was PLO. They never gave up on fighting for Palestine. Israel was so fixed on Hezbollah which defeated Israel in 2006. I still remember it, the invincible Merkava tanks defeated by Hezbollah anti-tank missiles. The elite Israeli unit Sayeret Matkal and the Northern Command that went in believing Arabs don't know how to fight but found out Hezbollah was strong. You don't know how Arab world was proud that someone can stand toe-to-toe with Israeli troops.Can you imagine what this does to Israeli physiologically? \\nThey scored victory after victory in 1948, 1967 and 1973. And against rag-tag Hezbollah they lost? The hit on Israeli warship Hanit by a missile, the shock of Israel as 4000 rockets rained down on Northern Israel while the vaunted Israeli Air Force searched and destroyed Hezbollah rocket lauchers. You can't comprehend Israeli determination not to let this happen again. In the background is Hezbollah is supported by Iran. The mortal enemy of Israel, Iran which was developing nuclear bomb.This ultra focus on Hezbollah led to the failure on October 7, 2023. Hamas pulled a maskirova, a soviet tactic of deception before attack. Hamas had been receiving money from Israel and indicated to Israel Hamas don't want war. You have to realize Netanyahu previously served in the Matkal special force and his brother Yonathan (yes he also served in Matkal) was killed in the Entebbe raid. He was facing huge demonstrations against his move against judiciary. Hamas came in and killed soldiers and civilians..never before Israel proper was invaded. Hostages were also taken.You think Netanyahu won't take revenge? You think Hamas don't think Israel would go after them and destroy Gaza? Israel will go after Hamas in Gaza..Israel will destroy Gaza..Hamas knows this. Hamas is courting public opinion as images of buildings and infrastructure destroyed will turn against Israel..the killings and woundings of civilians will turn the world against Israel..the economic blockade including food and medicine will repulse world opinion against Israel..I am sorry if this painted me as not caring for the sufferings of Palestine but me is insignificant to the power brokers in Washington, Jerusalem, Riyadh and Tehran.

Thats not some moral boundary youre drawing its literally only about the fact that it is not directly affecting you.And when it comes to cutting people out of your life, I think that's a pretty reasonable line to draw. If someone believes something immoral, but generally treats those around them well, I think it's better to be their friend because 1. It's important to stick by friends and family, and 2. You're more likely to be able to convince them out of their beliefs if you're friends with them than if you aren't. I think you aren't a good friend to them if you don't call out bad behavior. If someone is being racist, are you really a good friend to them if you aren't willing to call them out on that? If your first response is to abandon them when they hurt others, how will they learn to change? Also if you talk grandma and explain to her how thats wrong and racist and she doesnt care then yeah maybe you should cut her offI think we just fundamentally disagree on 1. How important family is, even if they're imperfect, and 2. Sometimes people take more than one conversation or experience to change, so you shouldn't just give up on them if they don't change after one conversation. The fact that youre [comfortable] being around someone who says horrible things about other groups people and holds a mindset that negatively affects and even gets people killed is insaneWe both agree that racism is bad, we just disagree about the best way to personally handle racists. You believe that people should try a little bit to help people see the error of their ways, and if that doesn't work, it's better to just make the morally upstanding decision of not being around them. I personally think that that is reasonable, but overall does more harm than good. I believe that that way of treating those around you puts yourself in (more of) an echo chamber and puts him in an echo chamber. If everyone refuses to interact with racists except racists, how will they ever learn not to be racist? It's better, in my opinion, to be around them more often to show them a better way to be. I believe the morally upstanding decision to make is to continue trying to help them, not just abandon them to their own devices. I understand these are two fundamentally different ways of viewing this. We both want people to not be racist, and we both think racism is bad. I just think the best way to show racists that they are wrong is to continue to be with them and show them better ways, as much as you can.","title":"CMV: Having racist family that you actively choose to hang out with is still wrong"},{"text":"Had Kamala won, his legacy would have been cemented as one of the most significant presidential moments since Washington.?Kamala lost, Dems and voter cant cope so the blame game and finger pointing is well under way.?","title":"Biden faces doubts over his legacy as he prepares to hand over power to the man he called a threat to democracy"},{"text":"Well seems like she had plenty going against her without that.

They passed it at the 11th out and there were no repercussions for price gouging..  Then on the exchanges it was 700 a month with a 12k deductible so we just paid cash for everything medical And it was cheaper. The price at my husbands job has gone down bc everyone was quitting and going independent bc why be staff if your benefits arent worth it. So they had to work out deals to keep staff. Any way its doable now. The only good thing about aca was pre existing conditions but they coulda done that and then forced a cap on premiums like utility companies, they could legislate price transparency and the in network bullshit and made it so you could shop nationally. But the aca catered to the insurance lobby. And it didnt work. The fines were cheaper than the premiums.

This would be evidence of a society based on racial hierarchy, one that doesn't actually live up to its own claims about being a safe place for Jewish people.If I were conducting a multi-decade campaign of ethnic cleansing on my neighbours, but justifying it that \\"we need this land, it's the only place people of my religion can be safe\\", I imagine I'd prioritise actually fulfilling that promise.

I can't believe it has taken a decade for us to finally start reversing these policies. Experimenting with policies is good - we should be willing to try things out - but we need flexibility and the ability to change things more quickly when it's clear something isn't working out. The leftist tendency to portray everything related to criminal justice as some great moral fight is totally counter-productive.

For prices to return to pre-pandemic levels, you need to have negative inflation (or deflation), which is also bad for the economy.

Harris ran against Trump on the idea that he was an existential threat to our democracy. He won, and by a great margin and with more power than expected because of the congressional races. If Trump truly is an \\"existential threat to democracy\\" -- which I think is obvious -- how are people jumping to \\"oh, well, in *the next election* we'll do better\\"? How does that make sense? I expect that one of the first things that will happen is a wave of \\"election security\\" measures from federal and state governments, to bake in an even heavier bias into the electoral system. Elections will be useful to legitimate their rule, but they won't be free and fair if Republicans do the things that they have been saying they will do. Democrats need to figure out how they are going to deal with that. If they go full obstructionist, that could backfire since they wouldn't be doing anything (though it worked for Republicans); if they engage or negotiate, they validate what is coming. Talk of the 2028 elections is very much an early-November 2024 issue, but things will likely be drastically different by 2028, and I'm not terribly optimistic -- though between Republican infighting, Trump's dementia and incompetence, and their utterly brain-dead economic plans may weaken them enough. But even then, the idea that they would respect the outcome of an election in 2028 when they couldn't do it in 2020, when they had less power, is just incredibly naive.","title":"If Democrats want to beat JD Vance in 2028, the good news is: There already exists a handy template of the most popular policies in America."},{"text":"It is really depressing living/working in LA and Santa Monica, and then traveling other places and being like \\"oh....shit, this is actually really nice.

Among the states that typically require an excuse for a voter to receive an absentee ballot, many interpreted their existing list of accepted excuses to include COVID (or the fear of COVID) or added the pandemic as a temporary acceptable excuse. In brief: In January 2020, 16 states required voters to identify an excuse, or reason, to request an absentee ballot: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.

If one defines a Zionist as someone who wants a Jewish state, we of course need to define what a Jewish state is. If a Jewish state is simply a majority population of Jews in a state, that in and of itself is not inherently problematic. That however is not really what a Jewish state is. In the same way we dont call the US a white or christian state because the majority of the populace is white and/or Christian, a Jewish majority isnt what makes a Jewish state a Jewish state. What makes it a Jewish state is efforts to further interests, power, dominance, and resources for Jewish citizens. Its efforts to limit self determination to Jews in the state, something enshrined in Israeli law. That is an ethnocracy.So if one understands Zionism to be a call for ethnocracy, of course it is not inherently hypocritical or antisemitic to be against all Zionists. It is of course hard even with that definition to blame all Zionists for the aggressive territorial expansion of the Israeli state that manifested in this war, it is not something inherent to the notion of wanting a Jewish state in and of itself, but I will note it was always something inherent to the formation of Israel. The national founder of Israel made clear that the initial territorial inquisition was only part of a greater effort to establish a state in the whole of Palestine. And in that respect, given that form of Zionism is the one that had practically effected the region as opposed to strains more analogous to assimilationism or those that simply sought a state without care as to where, its not a stretch to blame zionism.","title":"CMV: People blaming Zionists and Jews for war in Gaza are either hypocrites or antisemites"},{"text":"Vance has to be put into a position to lead midway through Trump's tenure to gain the experience to lead, but also be able to extend the kind of charismatic leadership of Trump.

They are absolutely not the same thing. A person can be opposed to Zionism without being an anti-Semite. Many Jewish people are opposed to Zionism in its current form, and for good reason. Also, one can support the concept of a Jewish state, and still see what is happening right now in Gaza as a genocide.Secondly, all of the arguments for a Jewish state, for Zionism, are great. Things such as the long history of persecution of Jewish people; of a place where Jews can be safe to live and be Jewish; a place to go for those made stateless by the holocaust.Except for one critical thing...If you create your state by taking land from other people, regardless of the liberal values that underpin that society, the people you have displaced are going to hate you. In fact, those people have a very valid reason to hate you. So now the only way you're going to be safe and free from persecution from the people who now justifiably hate you, is if you persecute them to the point they are too scared to retaliate... and that is what is happening today. Tens of thousands of Gazans are dead, because Israel \\"defended itself\\" by literally destroying Gaza. That, in itself, is a serious problem and it's also a valid reason to oppose Israel.I've never had a problem with Jewish people and never will. I don't have a problem with the state of Israel existing either. But I do understand why millions of people do have a problem with Israel, and I do have a problem with Israel's current actions, and with anyone who supports those actions. This doesn't make me an anti-Semite.","title":"CMV: People blaming Zionists and Jews for war in Gaza are either hypocrites or antisemites"},{"text":"Define price gouging. Because companies always try to maximize profits.Prices are high because inflation has a cumulative effect. It's illogical to conclude from a combination of high price levels and slower rate of change in prices that companies must be \\"price gouging\\" (whatever that is). Inflation contains information on the rate of change in prices. To be explicit, slower rate of change in prices does not imply that there are sufficient market forces (e.g. change in the supply and demand curves) toward deflation (which would be a decrease in price levels). Slowing rate of change in prices just means there are market forces to slow down the rate of change. Do not confuse levels with rate of change. This is a very common mistake among journalists as well as voters. So I don't blame you for falling for it.And no, Trump did not have \\"insane levels of spending.\\" For three years from 2017 to 2019, federal deficit as a percent of GDP was around 4%. It is only in 2020 that the deficit skyrockets to 14%. There was an emergency. And a lot of government spending was necessary.Now if you look at Biden, the record is in fact worse. In 2021, federal deficit as a percent of GDP was 12%. Given we were already putting Covid behind us, there simply was no call for massive deficit spending. (This reckless spending is in large part why we would have red hot inflation in 2022.) I guess if you're partisan enough, you can say all of the 12% deficit was justified. But you cannot defend the deficit spending in 2022 or 2023. It was 5.3% in 2022 and 6.11% in 2023! For reference, federal deficit as percent of GDP at 6% is what you would expect in national emergencies like the Great Recession or Covid.","title":"Why did Kamala Harris lose the election?"},{"text":"McCormick ads were the \\"Casey is for they/them and I am for you\\" ones.","title":"Republican David McCormick flips pivotal Pennsylvania Senate seat, ousts Bob Casey"},{"text":"That smile is saying to the democrats, that's what you guys get for giving me the flick ","title":"Biden is the happiest man in America today"},{"text":"She's absolutely wrong.","title":"Jill Stein Says Harris Lost Because Dems 'Betrayed Their Base'"},{"text":"What's their objective?

Or spend some time online and see many people from India supporting Israel.

Unlike Israel, Gaza hasn't had elections in 20 years, meaning that 2/3 of its population never voted for (or against) Hamas. 2.

My point is that plenty of people are imperfect and do things that may impact others negatively. But I don't think that inherently makes them such an evil person that you shouldn't hang around them. The thing I was trying to get at is that there seems to be some level past \\"imperfect human\\" where you believe that someone is so inherently evil that you should leave parties if they're there, and refuse to attend family events if they are going to be there. I do think there is a line there, (unrepentant rapist, for instance), but I don't see why you're drawing that line at \\"racist\\", especially when there is such a huge spectrum of what that even means. Do they believe that black people are cursed and carry evil in them? Do they wish for slavery to return? Do they believe that white culture is generally superior to non-white cultures? Do they believe that blacks are genetically less intelligent and should be coddled? Do they have stereotypes about black people not having great families? Do they believe that more black people than average are criminals, and they are just lucky that all the black people in their life are nice? Do they feel slightly uncomfortable around people from different cultures because they don't know how to interact with them? Do they unconsciously associate whiteness with competence? All of these things fall under the umbrella of \\"racism\\", but they are so different as to render me unable to judge if a person is evil or just misinformed if you call them a \\"racist\\".Basically, it seems unclear to me why any degree of racism (If I'm understanding you correctly) is so evil as to be equivalent to assault. There are levels of racism that are that bad, and you should probably distance yourself from those few people, but you seem to be using the term so broadly that I'm not sure it's useful in helping you understand what people are genuinely worth being with, despite their imperfections. Everyone is imperfect in some way, what specifically makes any level of racism so bad as to be fundamentally beyond that?","title":"CMV: Having racist family that you actively choose to hang out with is still wrong"},{"text":"Wow fucking love this comment, it's actually extremely accurate and succinct, and that kind of messaging is tough to distill for Democrats.

I remember. 2008 GOP House leadership was literally prognosticating that the Dems landslide trifecta was a generational repudiation of the GOP. The margins and demographic realignments  by which 2008 was won had commentators questioning that they would never be back in power again for decades and decades, because young people, working class people, people of color, and pretty much everyone had institutionally made their exodus from the GOP in reaction to the Great Recession. I was one of those people who thought about that theoryFunny how that got proven wrong in two short years right after bailout spending and the ACA was passed and the Republican version of the liberal resistance woke up and came to play ball. Democrats have seen this game before. 2016 was arguably an even greater handicap given how unforeseen a GOP trifecta was, with Trump at the top of the ticket. Republicans had a House majority greater than 20+ what theyll end up with now and a Senate that was willing to toe the line, sans McCain, Murkowski, and Collins. How they didnt repeal the ACA entirely was a McCain miracle and nothing else. A razor thin GOP house majority will also probably flip in 2026 once low propensity Trump-only voters get apathetic during the midterms, like they seem to always do, and a 2018 redux happens simply because Democrats remembered to wake up after realizing what theyre in for by 2025, while reliably Trump-only voters stay home because they dont actually care if their congressional district matters to passing agenda. Trump wont be on the ballot again in 2028, so its difficult to foretell if MAGA will fall apart like the Reagan Coalition and disband once the OG can no longer run for elections, or if 95% of that base will still reliably flock to Vance. Somehow I doubt its the latter. The majority of low-propensity Trump voters are attached to him and him alone and do not care about any of the GOPs institutional legacies to want to be just as enthusiastic about Vance. I think there is a solid, solid chance that Dems can win back a narrow trifecta in 2028 as a culmination of those reasons. A narrow thin House majority will also mean the ACA most likely wont be repealed, and the more extreme elements of the conservative agenda could only pass in lite versions, if at all. Too many Republicans in blue states or purple states will make up the new Congress, and I doubt they are willing to permanently anger their electorates (many of whom are probably on the ACA) and be voted out by 2026 simply to appease Mike Johnson and co.","title":"Folks, I know were tired, scared and disappointed.

Im just saying that we have a natural ability to recognize fairness the same way that we have a natural ability to recognize different qualities or something.I guess I also dont really mean anything super platonic, which is why it seems simplier to me than the evolution argument. Babies have a natural ability to recognize relative quantities, for example, and that perception improves on its own over time without explicit instruction. Theres a point where explicit instruction does have to take over, but just like some other animals, we have a natural ability to recognize numbers up to 5 or so even if we dont have the names for those numbers.When I say that morality is real, I mean its real in the same way that quantity is. Im not arguing that we need to believe in a realm of Number^tm where the true form of One-ness exists that all other ones are a reflection ofI just mean that when we perceive that one thing is bigger than another, we are recognizing and labeling a real, intrinsic quality of the natural world. That quality would be there whether we named it or not.I think even without a real of Virtue^tm we can say that when we identify that one thing is just/good/fair, we are also recognizing some quality of the natural world that would be there whether we labeled it or not.Just like your example with tastewe can say that our drive to seek out certain flavors does reflect a real quality in them. That quality is what drove the evolutionary development of the taste buds in that the flavors we like natural occur in nutrient dense foods.

If we are born with a faculty to identify something, Id think thats a pretty reasonable suspicion that theres a corresponding part of nature that faculty goes with. We can definitely imagine other explanations, but if we can argue that these more reason to believe in those, then shouldnt we just accept the simplest one?So I think the problem with this argument is that technically your position is the less simple explanation. Positing stance-independent norms on top of the processes we see in evolution and biology is less simple when we could just appeal to evolutionary biology to explain our intuitions(more specifically the people who are moral realists). I can give you a similar example in philosophy. Pretty much everyone finds certain foods tasty. They'll say that certain foods taste \\"good\\". But there's a simple explanation for why we find certain foods \\"good\\". It's because we evolved to find certain foods tasty which gives us an extra incentive to eat and survive. In my opinion, there's no reason to posit some sort of aesthetic or gastronomic realism and say that foods taste objectively good or objectively bad. Some people think tomatoes taste good, and others think it tastes bad. It seems like a superfluous explanation to say that tomatoes objectively have the property of being tasty when we already have an explanation of why some people find tomatoes tasty.So if we only need to appeal to processes in the natural world to explain certain intuitions we have, we don't need to posit some sort objective \\"moral realm\\" or objective \\"aesthetic realm\\". I also think the word \\"faculty\\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Isn't that arguably begging the question because we're assuming from the get-go that we have a specialized part of our mind to interact and find out about an aspect of the world? To me, it just seems like we have \\"faculties\\" to the extent that certain events will trigger certain emotional responses from us. I'd like to like to know what you mean by the word faculty.","title":"CMV: I lean towards moral anti-realism"},{"text":"Nothing. Texas and Florida are no win states.

You said it sounded authoritarian. I would say it sounds that way because it is. Or well has elements of authoritarianism.  \\nThe road block I see many anarchists run into is there is still a desire to have an.... ordered society that is dictated by the people but a problem arises when you ask the question who enforces that?  \\nEvery policy that the people come up with, who enforces that?  \\nRight now the nation-state has the monopoly of violence and it is what enforces its policy.   \\nWhat you're preposing with the direct democracy worries me because throughout history minorities have constantly and consistently been oppressed by the majority and if the answer to 'who enforces the will of the people' is 'the people.' Then that terrifies me. We need only think back to things like 'witch trials.' It was the will of the people to murder those women. Most of the people in the community wanted to do that (because it was the people that carried it out) (or they were to afraid to stand up for her). If the answer to everything is democracy then by definition it will be mob rule. Because when you cut to the heart of the matter democracy is just the majority forcing their views upon the minority. So, any system driven by democracy will be inherently oppressive.  \\nSo, I've been all over the map when it comes to anarchism. I would've called myself an ancom for a while. Other times an ancap (yeah ik XD). But what I lean towards most now is for all anarchists who believe in destroying the government to unite and destroy the government (so yes even ancaps). And then we can split into our groups and we can just see which group works the best. I think it is our hatred for one another that makes us forget how similar we all are. The average ancap and ancom have infinitely more in common with each other then either does with the average conservative or progressive. I've made a point of spending a lot of time talking to ancaps and ancoms and I'm always amazed at how similar they are. Even though they truly hate eachother so much.

This is my take on how Trumpism took over the Republican party, too. People forget that when Trump seem poised to take the nomination for 2016, Republicans were freaking out. Rank and file Republicans were blaming his nomination on clandestine liberals joining Republican primaries. Prominent Republicans (Mitt Romney, Ben Shapiro) were begging people not to vote for him. Ted Cruz stood up at the 2016 RNC and basically told people not to vote for Trump. But because Republicans couldn't have the same discipline that the Dems needed in 2020 to avoid a Bernie nomination, Trump ran away with it. Trump was not some inevitable conclusion to the trajectory of the conservative movement.Once he had the nomination, Republicans rallied around him for no other reason than he was the Republican nominee. And every time Trump found a new low, Republicans became that much more trapped by him, because bailing at any point would mean doing the unthinkable, which is admitting that Democrats and liberals were right about him all along. That is simply unacceptable, so they sane-washed him and defended him until little by little it turned into a cult of personality. At this point, anyone that hasn't already left the conservative movement is extremely unlikely to do so. It would simply be too painful to confront the years of deception they had fallen under.","title":"A liberal technocratic coalition can't win against populism if we don't address the two realities problem."},{"text":"For swing voters?

How do we build a new tent capable of winning the popular vote and electoral college? It starts by appealing to men. The Democratic Party has to become more aggressive. We need more alpha males in the party. Tim Walz was a good start. Obama I would say is one. Maybe Lebron James needs to run for something! We need to start recruiting every macho man who votes democrat and bring them into the fold and front of the message. Let me give some examples.-Steve Kerr great person to have speak at the convention. We need to elevate people like this-Why was Dave Bautista, former WWE superstar and actor who has lesbian moms not recruited to counter hulk hogan? They could have at least gotten Mick Foley! -There is no middle class anymore. What democrats fail to realize is that the average voter is living paycheck to paycheck. America is split into two classes. The wealthy ( top 5% of income earners) and the grabowskis. (Mike Ditka phase synonymous with blue collar. Also relevant because Mike Ditka is a Pennsylvania born trumper.) - Democrats have to abandon Academic PC culture. I went to one of the most liberal colleges in America if not the world. I fully believe in being woke, CRT, DEI, &amp; affirmative action. I wish our side was persuading people. They are winning the culture war folks. Whether we like it or not there has been a massive rejection of our views on comedy, entertainment, media, and culture. Even amongst Latino men! Latino men didnt care that Trump let someone insult them, they cared about who they thought would lower costs, and improve their standards of living. Its not a secret sauce. Latino voters have completely embraced American culture and dont see themselves as a special voting block. Like every immigrant group that has come to America they are beginning to split 50-50. We saw this with Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants. We are now seeing it with Latinos as well. \\n-Joe Biden was seen by some as a working class Democrat. Thats probably why he was able to carry the rust belt and Harris and Clinton werent. Joe Biden isnt the Democratic Party.

After years of hoping democrats would do something about rising prices and stagnant wages they decided to give someone else a chance. Trump gave them an enemy and told them he would fix it. Democrats need to give them and enemy and tell them how we will fix it.

It is a way for them to try to impose their bigotry and to claim that pushback is merely a difference in culture and values, and that not respecting conservative culture is being intolerant. When I was a kid, this wasnt the case. Many topics had no easy political divide (violent video games), while others had a religious element that didnt involve bigotry (teaching creationism in school). The culture war was not a clear left-right, conservative-liberal divide. Your side of the culture was not solely determined by your political ideology. I mean, Tipper Gore was out here trying to put warning labels on music. This all changed with gay marriage. Gay marriage was a decisive loss in the culture war for conservatives. It became legal and no one cared, the country was not destroyed. The right tried some other things that fizzled out (remember the War on Christmas?). After Romney lost, which was seen as a rejection of conservative policies, the religious right joined with the racism of the Tea Party to repackage all their bigotry as conservative ideology or culture. This way, conservatives can make bigoted attacks and then dismiss liberal defenses as distractions. Im not attacking trans people, Im just defending my conservative values, and youre wasting time on this issue when you should be solving something else.

Kids need to be taught how to behave fairly because they need the self-regulation skills to do it, but kids recognize unfairness in other people pretty much as soon as theyre are of the world. I think the fact that we are born with the faculty to identify that shows that we are recognizing a natural truth external to ourselves rather than acquiring customs from our community 2) moral systems are pretty similar and become more similar over time. If moral truths were just the product of cultural norms, then wed expect them to vary as much as other cultural traditions do. Wed expect there to be as much difference in notions of fairness and justice as there are notions of politeness, but instead we see pretty much the same core aspects of moral systems pretty much everywhere. Thats not to say everyone follows those moral systems, just that cultures tend to have roughly the same moral standards.","title":"CMV: I lean towards moral anti-realism"},{"text":"And anyone with active brain cells should be against this sort of censorship regardless of the party in charge.
