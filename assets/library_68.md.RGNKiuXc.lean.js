JOHN HANICK, a/k/a Jack Hanick, a United States citizen, is charged with violations of United States sanctions and false statements in connection with his years-long work for the sanctioned Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev. Pursuant to the request of the United States, HANICK was provisionally arrested on February 3, 2022, in London, the United Kingdom, with a view toward extradition.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: Konstantin Malofeyev is closely tied to Russian aggression in Ukraine, having been determined by OFAC to have been one of the main sources of financing for the promotion of Russia-aligned separatist groups operating in the sovereign nation of Ukraine. The United States sanctions on Malofeyev prohibit United States citizens from working for or doing business with Malofeyev but as alleged, Hanick violated those sanctions by working directly for Malofeyev on multiple television projects over the course of several years.

It's a complex demographic and NBC has enough staff and reach do the necessary research and capture the perspectives needed to use their platform in a more effective way than yelling at a bunch of people who could easily be won back to the Dems' side. It's vitriolic and condescending and the alarm on denaturalization should have been sounded a lot louder a lot sooner and pressure should have been put on Dems to act swiftly on the matter. Thankfully the conservative Supreme Court in 2017-2018 IIRC set a precedent for a very high burden of proof for such an act and has mainly used it to target war criminals and legitimate fraudsters, and even in cases of fraud it has to be a massive lie that proves the fraud was a main contributor in citizenship being attained and even ruled that certain lies do not qualify for denaturalization.

There are less than *100* trans student athletes across the entire US. Only 2 federal inmates have been given gender affirming surgeries (and only because it's part of the law that healthcare be provided to them, the same law Trump upheld no less) at a total cost of &lt;$50,000. So when there's hundreds of millions spent on those things? Let's stop pretending that it's not all borne out of Republicans simply hating trans people.Meanwhile, we're seeing is an avalanche of anti-trans ads the past few years (600 in 2024 alone), and these laws have resulted in suicide attempts by transgender and gender nonconforming teenagers increase by as much as 72%. Total silence from them when children are dying needlessly.But the economy! But what about the children! What a farce. Because the reality is that trans people are not hurting anyone. Neither are immigrants causing the issues in the US. The real issue comes from wealth inequality via the rich refusing to pay their fair share.

The bottom line is that Antifa/BLM targeted US citizens and their property and they were bailed out by their leaders from the establishment. Regular people were significantly affected by their actions. While Jan 6 folks targeted the establishment and their place of employment and got no bailout. No US citizens were significantly harmed, except for Capitol (the establishment) police shooting and killing an unarmed Ashley Babbitt.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk has cited the need to stay competitive, as US President-elect Donald Trumps pro-fossil fuel stance could lower American energy costs.A draft law, published on the governments website, outlines amendments to existing legislation that aimed to support energy consumers during?2023?and?2024.They include an extension of the price cap into 2025, effectively freezing the cost of electricity at the current rate of 500 zloty (114.92) per megawatt-hour (MWh), below the market tariff of 623 zlotys, reports Business Insider Polska.The cabinets economic committee has endorsed the measure, which will cost an estimated 6 billion zloty (1.38?billion) in additional compensation required for energy providers to offset price caps, on top of 2 billion zloty already earmarked for consumer protection.Explaining the move at a press conference, Tusk said that the change \\\\[of president\\\\] in the United States may also mean, at least initially, that the competitiveness of the US economy will still increase, mainly due to energy prices.To maintain stable, competitive energy prices, we need a sustainable system that allows Poland to compete globally, particularly with the United States, he added.The election of Trump is anticipated to lead to increased fossil fuel production in the US, which could lower American energy prices and further challenge European economies that are transitioning to greener energy sources.Tusk noted that Europe already has, on average, 2.5 times more expensive energy than the US. He added that Polands competitiveness in particular will be threatened unless action is taken.Poland has among the highest electricity prices in the EU thanks in large part to its reliance on coal and the resultant high costs under the EUs Emissions Trading System (ETS). In the second quarter of this year, higher electricity prices were recorded only in Italy and Ireland.Tusk said that at last weeks summit of European leaders in Budapest, everybody without exception said, how can we even talk about the competitiveness of the European, including Polish, economy if we are going to have the most expensive energy in the world?We will not allow Poland to suffer economically due to high energy prices, Tusk said. He added that he had instructed finance minister Andrzej Domaski to present a comprehensive proposal for maintaining the freeze on electricity prices for consumers and exploring the possibility of freezing prices for industrial producers as well.Tusk also criticised the EUs carbon reduction strategy as too strict, thereby undermining competitiveness. He said that Europe is currently looking for an answer to the question of what to do about the exaggerated environmental criteria in the European Union.I thought for a long time whether to say it outright, but I will say it outright. Some of the assumptions about CO2 emissions are disarming the European economy, even on such obvious issues as hydrogen energy, he added.We are constrained to consider only green hydrogen, i.e. completely zero-emission hydrogen, and do not considerhydrogen that is less perfectly clean, but still cleaner than other energy sources, the prime minister said.Tusks remarks come as Poland explores avenues to mitigate the impact of energy costs while positioning itself within the EUs energy transition framework.Poland has in recent years accelerated the expansion of its renewable energy capacity, which?accounted for 26% of the energy mix last year. However, two thirds of power was still generated from coal.In July, the Tusk government, which replaced PiS in office at the end of 2023, partially unfroze energy prices by increasing the price cap and removing it entirely for distribution charges. That helped stoke an?acceleration in inflation, which by August reached the?third highest level in the EU.","title":"Poland to extend energy price freeze next year following Trumps election victory"},{"text":"I expect that they will revoke the press credentials of any real news organizations.

Here's my plan to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our democracy from Washington corruption once and for all, and corruption it is.  \\n  \\nFirst, I will immediately re-issue my 2020 Executive Order restoring the President's authority to remove rogue bureaucrats. And I will wield that power very aggressively.  \\n  \\nSecond, we will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our National Security and Intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them. The departments and agencies that have been weaponized will be completely overhauled so that faceless bureaucrats will never again be able to target and persecute conservatives, Christians, or the left's political enemies, which they're doing now at a level that nobody can believe even possible.  \\n  \\nThird, we will totally reform FISA courts which are so corrupt that the judges seemingly do not care when they are lied to in warrant applications. So many judges have seen so many applications that they know were wrong, or at least they must have known. They do nothing about it, they're lied to.  \\n  \\nFourth, to expose the hoaxes and abuses of power that have been tearing our country apart, we will establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to declassify and publish all documents on Deep State spying, censorship, and corruption, and there are plenty of them.  \\n  \\nFifth, we will launch a major crackdown on government leakers who collude with the fake news to deliberately weave false narratives and to subvert our government and our democracy. When possible, we will press criminal charges.  \\n  \\nSixth, we will make every Inspector General's Office independent and physically separated from the departments they oversee so they do not become the protectors of the Deep State.  \\n  \\nSeventh, I will ask Congress to establish an independent auditing system to continually monitor our intelligence agencies to ensure they are not spying on our citizens or running disinformation campaigns against the American people, or that they are not spying on someone's campaign like they spied on my campaign.  \\n  \\nEighth, we will continue the effort launched by the Trump administration to move parts of the sprawling federal bureaucracy to new locations outside the Washington Swamp. Just as I moved the Bureau of Land Management to Colorado, as many as 100,000 government positions can be moved out. And I mean immediately out of Washington to places filled with patriots who love America, and they really do love America.  \\n  \\nNinth, I will work to ban federal bureaucrats from taking jobs at the companies they deal with and that they regulate. So they deal with these companies and they regulate these companies and then they want to take jobs from these companies. Doesn't work that waysuch a public display cannot go on and it's taking place all the time, like with Big Pharma.  \\n  \\nFinally, I will push a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress.  \\n  \\nThis is how I will shatter the deep state and restore government that is controlled by the people and for the people.","title":"THE END OF THE DEEP STATE: President Trumps Plan to Dismantle the Deep State"},{"text":"You're acting like it wouldn't be completely wiped off the face of the earth if Harris had won, instead.

To many a real idiot, but to others just being real was enough. The left are still stuck in the past of complacency, civility and political correctness. Which is kind of wild to say but the landscape has changed. All the left needs to do is reach voters with the sense of authenticity Trump brings (not saying Trump is authentic, but the way he speaks reaches the most engaged with the illusion hes an authentic, no bullshit kind of guy). The left has better wins to campaign on, better policies that are actually popular with the American public. But you wouldnt know it because they cant get their message to reach the less engaged voter.  Not attaching themselves to any one or two specific ideas (not saying they shouldnt have refined policies, but instead of running a anti abortion campaign for example, they run on a solid, wide spread platform that gives the candidate talking points on almost every perspective possible, in some sense acknowledging all Americans, not focused on more narrow demographics) but rather better messaging and more authentic discourse with a heavy dose of reflection is what they should campaign on.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":" he will bring back prayer in schoolsDoes Trump even go to church?","title":"Trump Will Bring The School Culture Wars To Every State"},{"text":"Its probably going for be 213 to 222.

Those tactics for sure helped the GOP. Literally nobody who is chastising us is talking about that. Voter suppression isn't just kicking people off the rolls. When state governments pull suppressive tactics, it also scares a lot of people into staying home during elections. There is already too much negative media coverage about Latinos in general and this shit doesn't help. 20 million people who voted in 2020 didn't do so in 2024 and i's irresponsible to cover the exit polls' demographics this way. I'm also mad about how the media is choosing to hyperfocus on marginalized people when MAGA cannot exist anywhere without the white voters who fuel it in much larger numbers and percentages than everyone else.

Hunting for scapegoats is one. Sometimes the poor unfortunates who failed to make unrealistic things magically happen - but more often simply any handy nearby groups who were already disliked by the mob, be they aristocrats, bourgeoise or Kulaks. Which served as both a useful distraction for the mob and a way to divert anger away from political leaders. Another was a gradual bifurcation between reality and political reality. Inconvenient facts and numbers stop being reported - or get corrected before being fed up the hierarchy. Eventually the government is happily playing about in a fantasy world blissfully unaware that in the real world the wheels are really coming off. Sad to say I think theres scope for modern parallels to both to happen in the U.S. Its not like MAGA types are short of groups they already despise - starting with immigrants but also including pretty much every religious and racial minority, atheists, college educated people  etc. And during the pandemic we saw just how readily even a modern audience accepts things like not counting the numbers so the problem goes away.

Additionally that risk youre taking might also just decrease the risk of a war ever breaking out, through deterrance, since your contribution strenghtens your countrys military, further decreasing the risk of you having to ever experience war at all.

Increasing the costs for working Americans and at the same time the price of real estate rising will continue to squeeze the middle class. The other thing thats concerning is what happens if they cut the 2 trillion from the federal budget that Musk was talking about. The far reaching effects in the economy are hard to predict but most likely they will cut welfare programs like social security, Medicaid and Medicare. Thats essentially the only way to cut that large part of the budget. Remember the deficit is 1.7 trillion. The whole budget is 6.2 trillion. This is gonna cause deflationary pressure in the economy. Then the Fed is going to have to lower the interest rate to stay at 2% inflation. Lower interest rate means again assets are going to rocket in value. The increase in asset prices will also be boosted by the Tax cuts that Trump wants to implement. When very wealthy people have more money they buy assets. So cutting their taxes boosts the value of assets even more. We have already seen blackrock rolling around the neighbourhoods buying up housing just because there are to few good investment opportunities. Just based on what Trump has said he wants to help make the wealthy more wealthy and the cost is going to be carried by the working Americans.","title":"People Are in for a Really Rude Shock on Trumps Economy"},{"text":"They'll just pin it all on Dems and their loyal, unthinking sheep will follow, as they always do, right over the edge of the cliff.","title":"People Are in for a Really Rude Shock on Trumps Economy"},{"text":"All 4 of those presidents have caused massive harm to the USA that have lasted decades, and Trump and his rich buddies are really aiming to be the worst ever.","title":"Democratic warnings about Trump were not simply campaign rhetoric"},{"text":"Trump is building a cast, not a government.","title":"Trump Picks Pete Hegseth, a Veteran and Fox News Host, for Defense Secretary"},{"text":"I like how they also say, see how we did not storm the capitol and insight an insurrection.

While sending someone to war that agrees to it is no such violation.\\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, there are multiple downsides to mercenaries. The most important one is: they need war to be the normal. If there is no war, or at least a threat of war, mercenaries are unemployed. And history has shown us, that unemployed mercenaries are a menace. There are many examples of unemployed mercenaries turning on their former employer, or a random party that is just nearby because they need money/supply and have the power (weapons, soldiers, organization) to take it.?\\nIn short, with mercenaries, you create an incentive to go to war. For the mercenaries due to them needing war to make a living, and for everyone else, because otherwise the mercenaries will become a threat because they need to make a living. This situation is a constant evil, while with conscription laws, there is only a chance that an evil (forced conscription) might occur. Arguably, thus makes the former the greater evil.","title":"CMV: Compulsory military servise is worse than mercenary work"},{"text":"Demand a recount!","title":"Trumps pick of Pete Hegseth to lead Pentagon signals turmoil ahead"},{"text":" Dude, people think that the economy worsened under Biden.

Capitalism only pursues greater profits, and as a result turns into a race to the bottom as far as ethics are concerned. If you dont do the unethical thing that makes more money, your competitors will and then your company goes bankrupt as shareholders pull their capital. This is compounded by the fact the capitalist class necessitates a state to enforce property rights on their behalf, thus crafting laws where it becomes illegal to not engage in unethical profit seeking as that would break your fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders. Fascism, just like before in the 20th century, is nothing more than a reactionary response to late-stage capitalism.

This makes military upkeep costly, painful and unprofitable for the country, its people, its leaders and even military commanders themselves, meaning that it's something that country with accountability to the welfare of its population should only do if it has to, and once the conscripts are discharged you're not left with masses of professional soldiers waiting for the next conflict.","title":"CMV: Compulsory military servise is worse than mercenary work"},{"text":"Per Elon, get ready for years of \\"temporary hardship\\".

The why is something that the party will need to deeply reflect on.Walter Lippman, one of America's most influential journalists, who had the ear of presidents, called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" almost a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever. He argued that Americans don't make politically informed decisions, and that's what happened this election, Americans let their *feelings* decide the outcome. The onus was on Democrats, not Republicans, to help Americans make those politically informed decisions, however unfair that may seem.So Democrats have to take some of the blame. But first, Biden was supposed to be a transitional candidate. His decision to run for re-election put democrats in a very tough spot. He was also tasked with overseeing an economic recovery and his admin was blamed for the fallout that followed the pandemic.In fact, an economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped into office and oversaw an economic recovery. Republicans exploited these situations for political gain.It was particularly effective this time because, unfortunately, many Americans care more about their immediate circumstances than they do any \\"threat to democracy.\\"What's more, American voters tend to have short memories and a large swath of low propensity voters are who decide our elections. Many of them don't tune in until they're being inundated with political messaging months leading up to an election. And that messaging is excessively sensational, propagandistic, misleading, deceptive, partisan, heavily distorted etc.And this is, in large part, because, as studies consistently show, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda and lies travel farther and faster, reaching wider audiences. The truth receives far less engagement I'll be willing to concede that this type of messaging comes from both parties, but it's Republicans who disproportionately benefit from it.Combine this with the fact that incumbent leaders around the globe were facing political challenges due to world wide economic tensions, and it becomes obvious that this was always going to be an uphill battle.Add Kamala Harris being shoehorned in at the last minute, and you've got yourself a recipe for an election loss What's really frustrating is that Donald Trump is going to be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. One he'll surely take credit for *again*. The only consolation is that Joe Biden's presidency will act as a sort of stop gap effort, sandwiched in between two Trump presidencies. Two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.Trump's loss to Biden in 2020 was of necessity. The beginning of a return back to normalcy, and it could very well set up obstacles for Republicans that would not have been put in place otherwiseYes, Democrats would have had a much better shot had Biden refused to run for a second term, but what was done was done. And after Biden stepped down, Democrats played their hand terribly.While they failed to take into account how Americans care more about their immediate circumstances, how they have short memories and show disinterest or lack of concern for nuance, they also failed to articulate a message that should have emphasized, above all else, Trump's poor economic and foreign policy record.Inflation and economic issues were the key drivers this election, and while many Americans tend to think in black and white terms, e.g. \\"when inflation/economy bad, it must be the fault of whoever is in power,\\" it still would have benefitted Democrats if they prioritized above all else and drove home the message that Trump was*not* better for the economy, and his economic policies for his next term are even more potentially damaging.Voters cared far more about this than they did about Trump as a threat to core Democratic values.The national debt ballooned under Trump.He instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. He pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His admin took actions to that made it more difficult for workers to unionize, and for unions to operate effectively.He championed tax cut legislation that is estimated to cost the govt trillions (while Republicans bragged that it would pay for itself), and these tax cuts permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations. Trump and his Republican allies preserved a GOP agenda that has been hamstringing the labor movement, redistributing wealth to the top, safeguarding a broken tax code, promoting corporate profit-mongering and personhood, prioritizing rich/special interests, cultivating an economic culture of greed and profligacy, and widening the wealth gap, among other things, for *decades**All of these things contributed to inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the Biden administration*Trump's foreign policy record was a disaster too. He weakened our alliances, escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our ability to act as peace brokers, withdrew from the working non-proliferation agreement with Iran, emboldened Putin's autocratic agenda, aided his proxy wars and aligned himself with Putin's goals, cozied up to dictators around the globe, dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone, forced Congress to pass not one, but two historical war powers resolutions, abandoned our Kurdish allies, negotiated with terrorists and the list goes on and on.Oh, and on immigration, Democrats weren't going to reach through to anyone cheering on mass deportations, but Trump tanking the bipartisan border deal should have been emphasized more along with how Republicans prefer to run on immigration as a wedge issue, stoking fears and appealing to grievances while proposing extreme, non viable, disingenuous \\"solutions\\" instead of more practical, economically considerate, humane ones.Most Americans don't know this stuff! And, yeah, maybe they don't care as long as they're paying more for groceries and gas, while believing that whoever's in charge is responsible for higher prices, but even if this is the case, you at least try to convince them otherwise. And if Harris was ever going to have a shot, despite rolling in at the last minute, her campaign was going to have to articulate these points, emphasize them over and over again, so that the low propensity voters just tuning in might get the picture.In the end, there were a multitude of factors working against democrats, they also likely miscalculated how some voters just weren't willing to vote for a woman considering the alternative was a perceived strongman, especially during a period where a movement and \\"crisis of masculinity\\" is on the rise. Walter Lippman was right a century ago, and he's still right today. The general public *is* an irrational force. He argued that voters don't make politically informed decisions. Well, they're especially not making politically informed decisions if you're not *informing* them. So instead, they're voting based on feelings, and that's what won Trump this election, *feelings.*","title":"Trump Called His Win a Historic Realignment of American Politics.

In the \\"lesser\\" I mean not so much \\"policy\\" (in quotes for a reason) but freedom of speech. That's what the Dems threatened and that is dear to all our hearts.Of course few think Trump will be a panacea. Just loking at his recent appointments should dissuade anyone who thought for a second we are past the rubbish that rules our politics. Personally, I think Trump will be a disaster for the Palestinians, perhaps 25% more than Biden was (note the precision here).This country is unfortunately in the midst of a decline phase and no, Trump may be able to apply a few band aids but not arrest the decline. Money destroyed our political class and destroyed competence in governance.Frankly, if you were to really probe you might find some may be rooting for the global South, led by Russia and China. That IS what's really happening. Everything else is just shadow play.Personally I can't wait till Trump finds out what dire state the economy really is. No amount of drilling for oil will help either. The deeper problem is that, as a country, and as a system, capitalism maxed out on growth. China figured that out long ago which is why it is actually trying to get some prosperity going in under-developed countries, which means new consumers, which means growth. For a few decades more perhaps. Then that'll plateau as well.The reality is that as residents on this planet we have to eventually figure out an economic system that does not require substantial growth and is not dependent on prosperity for the top 20% (at most). Our economists have failed us. Totally.So, this is an opinion for you that's perhaps a bit out of left field, but many agree we are in deep trouble and no Trump can save us. But at least, for the next few years, we can still exchange opinions freely.","title":"Is this sub compromised?"},{"text":"Exactly why Im done watching the news and reading articles for the next 4 years.?","title":"People Are in for a Really Rude Shock on Trumps Economy"},{"text":"Well isn't Mr consequences of their actions showing up yet again","title":"People Are in for a Really Rude Shock on Trumps Economy"},{"text":"He predicted the future looked quite bleak under Trump's presidency?","title":"The Last President"},{"text":"And the common man has no idea why hes in the situation hes in, how government grifting and dollar debasement make it impossible for him to achieve financial freedom.","title":"Donald J.

This creates a connection between the different populations and more empathy for each other.You also don't have to be in the army in dangerous places.

Many states for instance will have a right to free speech and a right to privacy and there is no clear demarcation of where you draw the line between the two when one person's free speech endangers another person's privacy. This conflict between rights is something each state must navigate by itself.Now compulsory military service certainty seems like it is a curtailment of people's rights. However a right to safety and security is also a right people have even and if you are invaded and occupied by a foreign power you could lose all your rights. It's therefore not a case of condemning compulsory military service but comparing the damage mandatory conscription does to people's rights versus the potential damage from an understaffed military.Mercenary work is generally morally wrong under most frameworks of international law, though not explicitly illegal. War is viewed as a last resort that should be avoided at all costs, with the only justification and legal instances of war being in defence or when approval has been granted by the UN due to a pressing need to intervene. In those cases war is considered sad but necessary.

But in democracies, and even in modern autocracies, the public ends up treating military conflicts on foreign soil akin to sports competitions where they root for their team, without really realizing the sheer human suffering (which the media ensures) or even the economic cost to themselves (due to financial illiteracy).Think about it this way.

It simply is. It really needs to go.

It's really simple - BACK THE CANDIDATE THAT YOU ACTUALLY LIKE. NOT THE ONE WHO IS BLAND AND MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD ENOUGH THAT YOU THINK THEY'RE SAFE.We backed Hillary even though none of us really liked her. We cut Bernie off at the knees even though we actually liked him, because \\"oh, no, he's too extreme, he can't possibly win.\\" And who won instead? The most extreme, most polarizing, most blatantly unstable, most scandal-ridden, most hated candidate we've ever seen. Why? His base LIKES him. God knows why, but they really do. As much as we call him a \\"threat to democracy,\\" I've never seen a candidate more democratically chosen than him. NOBODY but his voters want him in that seat, but they really want him there, and they put him there twice.Biden was another bland, safe candidate, and he barely scraped out a victory. But he at least had genuine goodwill left over from the Obama years and a long career. Kamala had very little. She didn't do that well in the 2020 primaries. I give her a lot of credit for stepping up in a messy situation and taking her best swing, but once again, we put forward a candidate that we had little real enthusiasm for, and once again, we lost to the same nutjob whose voters really love him.Do you LIKE Pete? Do you LIKE what he has to say? Do you think he'd be a good President by YOUR standards? If you do, then support that guy! Stop overthinking it and trying to guess what other people will vote for. Trust your actual real opinions and feelings. Vote for who YOU would vote for. If you actually like him, chances are other people do too. If you throw him under the bus and pick a \\"safer\\" candidate who you don't actually like as much, chances are other people don't like them much either, and they won't turn up at the polls.It really is that simple. Last time we got it right was Obama. That was another \\"impossible\\" win. Those are the ones people actually show up for, I think.And who else do we really have that can do it? The only other person who's expressed interest in the job who I like and respect as much as Pete would be Cory Booker. I'd back him with equal enthusiasm. MAYBE Elizabeth Warren, but I think she plays too much into the inside-baseball left/right divisiveness for my tastes, whereas Pete and Booker are a lot more willing to reach out to a broader range of voters. Ditto for AOC, though I do think she's got potential in the future.I'd have no problem with a straight white guy running, if he was a good candidate, but... who? Name him.

Second, which is more important, the laws surrounding immunity of a sitting president (and presidential elects) are very muddy. They basically have immunity of most crimes, and it's hard to prove someone is guilty under these protections. These immunity laws are in place to protect presidents from criminal and civil cases that may distract them from their duties. This is why, even though the 37 felony charges have a crap ton of evidence, they most likely will be thrown out due to some of these crimes occurring while he was a sitting president. For example, there is more than enough proof to show he actively tampered and tried to conceal evidence of him keeping classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. If he would've turned them over and not talked to anyone about what the documents held, sure, don't charge him. A mistake, but understandable. However, he actively lied to the FBI and tampered with evidence. This then turns into a felony. Additionally, the cases that are being held in Georgia currently (the case that is trying to charge him for attempting to falsify voter records and overturn the election), will most likely be thrown out due to him becoming president in the next two months.  \\nThere is a case up against him currently, and they are trying to charge him for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection. However, this happened while he was president, and people's jobs (mostly the judges and lawyers in the DOJ) will be at risk, since Trump is currently stating he will fire anyone on the case.","title":"Melania Trump declines to meet with Jill Biden at White House, citing Mar-a-Lago raid: source"},{"text":"This is exactly what Musk wanted though?","title":"Trump says Elon Musk will lead Department of Government Efficiency with Vivek Ramaswamy"},{"text":"I dont see the difference.

I'd rather it be us along with a Western coalition of Democratic nations that oppose autocrats like Putin, instead of Russia or China who would use their dominance to do exactly what they're doing now in Ukraine, trying to absorb the country and dissolve their freedom and independence. Even if you don't believe the \\"we're fighting for democracy\\" argument and think we are doing the same thing as Putin or just out to enrich the arms manufacturers, it's clearly still in America's best interest to have some influence on who's running the rest of the world. Putting our hands over our ears, closing our eyes, and pretending that what happens outside the US doesn't affect the US is naive. I'm not supporting all interventions here, but it's pretty obvious how helping Ukraine and Israel can be supported by both arguments.As of October, we've sent an equivalent of $18 billion to Israel and $170 billion to Ukraine since the start of each conflict, not trillions. The 2020 defense budget which was set during the Trump administration, before either war, was 3.7% of GDP. **Defense spending has gone down** since then and is about $850 billion for 2024, or 3.4% GDP.Arguments against military aid have been largely political, a way for conservatives to associate the war with Democrats and capitalize on high costs due to inflation, reinforcing the perception that the economy is bad and it's all Biden's fault. Your belief that we're spending trillions on this just shows how effective this messaging is. Military aid is not affecting domestic spending or inflation whatsoever, but if that's your concern, tariffs and massive tax cuts certainly will. The argument might be more legitimate if they were criticizing the other hundreds of billions we're spending every year on defense, but you're not going to hear that. Why? The fact that we have to package support of our allies with unrelated, essential domestic legislation in order to get Republicans to vote for it is kind of disgusting if you're being honest. Remember when conservatives disliked Putin? What happened? One of the few things Trump got right, but for the wrong reason, was that NATO countries weren't spending enough militarily. But that's because it's in their own best interest to do so, especially when you have people like Trump and the Republicans beholden to him who put our alliances into question.","title":"What has Marco Rubio said about the Israel-Hamas Conflict?"},{"text":"Maybe.","title":"What happens to Donald Trumps criminal conviction?

We're in our 50's.","title":"They love to throw around the word uneducated."},{"text":"What's there to explain?Musk bought an overvalued Twitter, and while its value has since tanked, he fired thousands of employees, especially those who dissented, altered the algorithms to direct traffic to him and any right wing personality willing to pay for the privilege, turned Twitter into a bastion of right wing conspiracy theories, misinformation, fear-mongering propaganda, foreign disinformation campaigns, the most divisive and incendiary rhetoric on any major platform, while constantly sharing and spreading these talking points, unsubstantiated rumors, partisan, culture war narratives to literally hundreds of millions of followers everyday, along with hundreds of millions of more Twitter users who have no choice but to be inundated with Elon Musk's relentless posts. And posts that are, all the while, appealing to fears, hate, prejudices, unfounded grievances, paranoia and phobias.He also spent a large sum of money on the Trump campaign, all while trying to position himself on the shortlist for Trump's cabinet. Even suggesting himself that he'd be excellent for the role that Trump is now offering him.What else is there?It's just a plain fact that Musk's businesses receive billions in federal dollars. Something he conveniently doesn't share while he's continuously lamenting government spending.Musk has even suggested that positions in the government only be reserved for \\"high status males.\\" Recommending that a technocratic and plutocratic Republican regime control the government at every level.And you don't have to be a sociologist to understand that a lot of rich people are rich because they were born into wealth...You don't have to be an economist or historian to understand that the Republican agenda, for the last several decades, has favored the rich, special interests, ideologically adjacent corporations that now have the same rights as American citizens thanks to a former conservative supreme Court...An agenda that is responsible for a redistribution of wealth to the top, a widening of the wealth gap, and the racial wealth gap for that matter, an economic culture of greed and profligacy, a broken tax code that disproportionately and permanently benefits the rich and corporations, while also unevenly taxing income over wealth, giving the rich the opportunity to evade paying taxes on that wealth... ...An agenda that prioritizes profiteering, shareholder and executive interests over things like public health and environmental degradation, an agenda that has been gradually hamstringing and crippling the labor movement for years, installing corrupt right wing corporatists into positions within the government like the labor relations board, where they can continue to disrupt the balance between employers and employees. An agenda, simply put, that takes from the poor and gives to the rich. And one that Republicans have been much more keen on preserving.You don't have to be a genius to understand that in America, the American dream is much more easily achievable if you're wealthy. Our system rewards the rich. The wealthier you are, the easier it is to become wealthier. However, the poorer you are, the harder it is to become wealthy.And to add to this, the wealthier and more privileged you are, the more often you can fail. In fact, this coincidentally applies both to Trump and Musk. You can fail over and over again, and always be rewarded with another shot, particularly if you're subsidized by the federal government. Even if your failures are astronomical, you'll still be bailed out in the end.Additionally, our system has made debt an important tool for the rich, while it's merely a burden for the poor. This is something that the wealthy often take advantage of.But if you're a poor, working class schmoe, one small failure can be catastrophic for you.This is the way...Trump is not an \\"outsider\\" In the sense that his supporters perceived, but is a narcissistic, greedy, vindictive individual who has always wanted to belong to a class of \\"elites,\\" a boy's club he was previously denied entry to.He's also a demagogue and a useful idiot to a new Republican coalition that will pledge whatever loyalty they have to in order to maintain this agenda I speak of, while eliminating the separation of powers to build a one-party system and state for the foreseeable future.A technocratic, plutocratic, (perhaps even kleptocratic) authoritarian regime is becoming all the more plausible.Now we have billionaires funding billionaires funding billionaires, and we're supposed to believe their pseudo populist message, when in reality, they're all part of an exclusive club that you're not allowed into, but a club nonetheless, that exists because it's members appeal to the grievances, fears, hate, prejudices, paranoia of the poor shits who will never be members themselves, a club that exists off of exploitation, by indulging the lowest common denominator of feelings and the worst impulses of Americans. These people have thrived because others haven't. They don't have to worry about the same things we do. Their place and status is cemented because they enjoy the perks of being rich in America.Musk used his power, privilege, wealth and influence to buy his way into the Trump administration. It was transactional, as that's the only kind of relationship that Trump can have, a transactional one. Musk provided Trump with campaign contributions and a platform to prop up MAGA propaganda, and in return, he gets his position within Trump's government.And I shouldn't need to explain why Musk's new position in Trump's admin is a massive conflict of interest at this point.

This allowed the US to have one of the best armor in the world. (Tanks and Warships) China has largely subsidized their steel manufacturing making its products cheaper. Over time this lead to less profit for steel manufacturing in the US which leads to lower investment in new steel technologies and production capabilities. \\nChina has been taking the financial hit for flooding the market with cheap, nearly as good, steel but has gained a military advantage in doing so. Now, their steel industry no longer has to be subsidized as investment in new steel technology has become better than the US. Slave (and/or near slave) labor is also used to drive down prices further as well. In order to compete globally other countries competing in the steel industry must provide value to the customer in similar ways to compete for new business. This largely leaves the US with its high(er) regulations and general cost of doing business at a disadvantage. \\nNow, extend this example to nearly every other sector outside of financial and services and you can begin to see the real problem with free trade. \\nThis is why Trump has threatened tarriffs on vehicles produced in Mexico for example. (Tractors all well, I believe) He is seeking to stop US vehicle manufacturing (and the skills of the industry) from moving to Mexico where companies are seeking to avoid US labor costs and compete in the global market. \\nIn order for US manufacturing to compete they have to find value to the consumers somewhere. This is where the cost of regulation and labor really has an effect on a company seeking to compete with others without those burdens. (Or as many of those burdens, each country has different regulatory burdens)Interestingly, its becoming cheaper to produce in places like Mexico and India now over China. There are a lot of reasons for that, but it mostly revolves around cheaper shipping costs to/from the US and equally low labor costs.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"Russia probably got what they want.

Look at the water vapor capacity of the atmosphere, it's exponential. Every 10C it goes up by about 80%. Water vapor is also a very portent green house gas.As an example (these aren't exact numbers): you increase atmospheric temperature by 1C you can now hold enough water vapor to increase it a further 0.1C. 2C, closer to 0.21C, 3C an extra .33C, and so on. Somewhere down the line going up 1C will push enough water into the atmosphere to heat it up another 1C, from there you can see the problem.There is a tipping point. It's hard to know exactly where that is, but if you look at models, maybe somewhere between 8-16C more than the industrial era.And because it's going to come up, no, cloud cover won't save us.

That is to say we burned it. From that heat we took energy. The exact amount doesn't matter, suffice it to say a given amount of fossil fuels produced a given amount of energy and given amount of CO2.Looked at more mathematically, X fossil fuels, produced Y energy and Z carbon.We can sequester that carbon, put it back on the ground, but that takes energy. A lot of energy, more than we got from burning it. Some of the best process take ten times more energy for the amount of carbon produced. That is, for every Megawatt of power we produce today, we'd have to spend 10 Megawatts tomorrow just to capture that carbon. That doesn't include keeping our cities lit up or anything. 10X fossil fuels, 10Y Energy all goes to trap -1Z carbon at the cost of 10Z carbon. A net of 9 units. Obviously that's not possible.Let's say we have a miracle, Jesus, Buddha, Moses, come down from the sky we are suddenly a carbon neutral society. All our power and energy comes from renewable, nothing produces carbon anymore. Yay!Ok, so we turn all that energy to carbon sequestration. We're not powering up our cities, not growing food, not playing games, just carbon sequestration.Using our 10:1 example, For every 10 units of energy we use, we will capture 1 unit of carbon from the old process. Ok, so 10X for -1Z. We're producing the same amount of energy as before, so it takes the same amount of time to generate 1 unit of energy it's just clean. So to generate our 10X will take 10 times more time. So 1 year's worth of carbon will take 10 years to sequester back. to go back 10 units of carbon, will take 100 units of energy or 100 units of time. To go back to were were were in 2014 will take a century, 2004, 2 centuries, etc. Again, assuming we start today and do nothing but carbon sequestration.However it's not possible to devote all our energy to this, even assuming we want to. So what if we did half? Well then the numbers all double. Going back a year takes 20 years, a decade 2 centuries, and 20 years will take 400 years. This also assumes an optimist 10:1. 20:1 is more realistic, you can see the problem here.We don't have time to wait. Trying to go back even a year, is a herculean undertaking. In a sense, every year we wasted, is a generation lost.","title":"Biden just finalized a major climate rule.

Now browse my most recent comments as that is a nice intersection between my Lebanese side and American side.But while a secular humanist, culturally I am very much a Lebanese Shiaa (think someone who is culturally Jewish, or culturally Catholic).It's just a sect of Islam. To make an incredibly long and convoluted story short, Israel invaded Lebanon in the 1980s, a resistance was formed, and essentially it was mostly composed of members of my sect.Now my country Lebanon after a long civil war (yeah, like I said, long convoluted history) starts this peace process that is supposed to transition into some form of democracy at some point, but in stages.To make another long story short, it starts with the different sects and their political leaders/representation sharing power equally and then they realize if we share power than we actually never have to give it up lol. So they basically ruled over us like feudal lords and oligarchs but occasionally would act like an actual modern state or has had some features of a modern state.**Well, the main party that represents my sect and serves as the popular support base for said party is the party known as  Hezbollah**.I think you can see the problem now.Basically, I am radically opposed to them for a variety of reasons. But they have flat out murdered people that have opposed them,.There's a whole war now here, and we don't know what the future will look like, but what I can tell you for sure is that **we absolutely need some kind of LBJ** because fascists, the billionaire class, death-cultists, self-serving corrupt politicians, boomer men into dirty politics and dirty money, etc., - they don't give up power easily and if you give them an inch they take a mile.I may be a mini-mini-mini figure like that for a tiny tiny part of Lebanon some day, as a few people have told me I should run for office (it's just so complicated here,  and again historically they'd either rig the election [like unironically, I mean this lol] or threaten you or just kill you depending on how much of a threat you are.We haven't gotten to that point in the U.S. , I hope/think.**Sp please fight like hell guys. Starting from now, you can't be anything but daily active participants in this audacious political experiment in a diverse tolerant multicultural multiethnic multiracial politically diverse democratic republic. **I so recognize all the amazing work Biden has done, I absolutely recognize the excellent campaign VP Harris and Gov. Walz ran.Unfortunately it's not even a drop in the bucket of what we need to fight this movement toward a so-called \\"post-democratic order\\" (I think project 2025 puts it in those terms right? someone fact check me).So yeah, we have stoics on democracy's siide both here in Lebanon and in the U.S. We really do.But we have not been enabled to come to the arena in some cases, in other cases (e.g., again, in Lebanon) it may be deadly to try.Either way, it's time we actually show ourselves who we really are.And I promise you, especially given that America welcomed my immigrant Muslim parents with open arms in the 80s, the America we see today is not who we really are.This iis disinformation. This is working class people hurting. And this is shit like billionaires uniting the crazy people that normally never even know of each other and turning them into a whole MAGA cult (e.g., Musk and twitter).So we're figfhting big forces, and these but a few.We really need to swing a big something or another around, and I think we need that LBJ spirit.But, I admit, American presidential history is a weak point of mine so maybe I'm full of shit lol.","title":"Full List of Democrats Who Voted for Bill That Gives Trump Admin More Power"},{"text":"He was in rhe air force (not the army) for 2 whole years at a low rank and saw no combat.

But then when they have 2 terms in a row some stuff still doesn't happen, and they make excuses while passing bills/laws that allow corporations to get away with more crap.  \\nJust look at stuff like federal minimum wage how it should be close to $23 an hour or something but it's not even close to that. Or how we still have for profit colleges/universities. Still don't have universal health care when other countries figured it out a long time ago. As well as all the monopolies/oligopolies out there in the market screwing people over. And how we continue to waste a lot of money being put into the military and money somehow disappears or isn't accounted for and that just never comes back up. ETC!  \\nBernie is the only candidate that I can think of that isn't full of BS like so many politicians out there. We know that, because we have seen it time and time again. You still get people who will  about how his ideas wouldn't work if he was president or bla bla bla. But it's clear he would have been a much better president than either side could ever come up with way back then. I voted for him back then even though he wasn't an option anymore, cause Hilary and the Dems screwed him over cause they didn't want rich people to lose money. My vote just like this time didn't matter though cause I live in a red state full of old geezers. Literally 70% or more red all down the board so none of my choices mattered. I almost didn't go vote this time because of it, but I wasted my time researching (though most don't fill out any info on what they stand for, or have horrible websites/none to gain any info on) and going to vote anyways and voted for the least worst options and again was a waste of time here.The ones here who will complain about stuff like everyone getting $2k from the gov't because of covid and how that caused younger people to not want to work a year or two after the fact. This is a legit reason an old geezer gave to other old geezers I overheard while at work a few years ago. Cause yeah $2k is SO much money to live off of for over a year. /s When so many jobs around here suck and offer awful wages/benefits (if any). They wonder why teenagers leave this state after high school and don't return.   \\nSure this isn't as bad as countries like China, and Russia etc, but people have to quit using those as reasons as to why it's \\"SOO great to live here\\", and pull their head out of their ass and focus on the long term problems instead of focusing on what celebrity is doing what, or that the news is talking about illegal immigrants are flooding in by the billions each day on the southern boarder and what each side would do if they were in charge like they haven't been this entire time this country started having these problems?","title":"Bernie Sanders in 2003 - How Republicans Win"},{"text":"Posting DEI articles?","title":"Women Shaving Heads in Trump Protest Slammed For Gross Ideological Myopia"},{"text":"Keep in mind nothing has been paid and secondly its not the fault of the lawyer of anything the client did.","title":"Alina Habba Emerges as Frontrunner for Trumps White House Press Secretary"},{"text":"Guess no one will be bit by a dog in THIS white house!","title":"What to know about Kristi Noem, Trumps pick for Homeland Security secretary"},{"text":"Its toilet paper all over again.","title":"I cannot fathom that people actually believe that Trump will become the next Hitler??"},{"text":"He openly sided with Trump when it became clear that Trump was going to win.

Pete has said that there are people who voted for him and Obama and Trump and Pence for Governor, based on who they thought would be most helpful, and I honestly think thats very indicative of a lot of middle America. People vote for the person they vibe with sometimes across party lines, and I think a savvy midwesterner could do well in the crucial swing states. That being said, Pete was reelected as mayor BEFORE he came out, so we dont have a test case. But he was well respected and well liked among almost everyone regardless. I think its feasible. Veterans like him because he served in the military, for example. Immigrants like him because hes culturally competent and multilingual. A lot of queer folks might vote for him over someone that wasnt. Hes a practicing Christian, so that will get some folks on board. Hes a family man, and that cant hurt.

Unfortunately the majority of voters are the uneducated that Trump loves and have the attention span &amp; memory of a goldfish.During Trump's last administration they adopted rules that made it more difficult for workers to form unions &amp; vote for representation.   \\nHe narrowed Labor Relations laws, reducing protected activities for employees &amp; leaving them vulnerable to retaliation when on strike or protesting safety conditions and weakening workers ability to organize &amp; collectively bargain.Trump finalized a Labor Law allowing states to contract services for unemployment career centers to private employers instead of them being operated by public employees, reducing the quality of jobs for those employed in them as well as the services offered.     \\nHe weakened employee rights for temporary workers &amp; contractors, causing their industries to lose out on $1.3 billion in wages annually.   He tried to make changes that would make it harder to get overtime pay. He attempted to changed labor laws that allowed employers to pool tips &amp; distribute the money however they wished; also permitted managers to order tipped employees to perform an unlimited amount of side tasks at min wage &amp; he reduced fines for labor law violations.        \\nTrump refused to update OSHA regulations or enforce existing guidelines during Covid; he reduced the number of OSHA inspectors &amp; inspections to the lowest level ever, causing an increase in workplace deaths/injuries.He initially didnt require employers to protect the health of workers or document Covid cases, he battled against CDC &amp; WHO recommendations and provided conflicting information to the public/essential workers which endangered their health.     \\nDuring COVID Trump issued a rule that excluded over 13.5 million healthcare workers &amp; first responders from being eligible for paid leave during Covid, meaning they received no pay if they got ill or had to care for a sick family member, even if it was time off that they had already earned.   Trump tried to lower wages for legal migrant farm workers but declared them essential during the pandemic. He issued guidance encouraging states to cut off unemployment benefits to people who refused to return to unsafe jobs during the pandemic &amp; narrowed who was eligible. He opposed extensions of financial relief during Covid.     \\n  \\nTrump caused over 40,000 workers in meat processing plants to get Covid or die because he issued an executive order requiring them to stay open even if experiencing widespread outbreaks and allowing them to increase line speeds even while understaffed.Trump policies increased the offshoring of factories to foreign tax havens during his administration, awarding more than $425 billion in federal contracts to corporations listed among those responsible for offshoring 200,000 American jobs during his presidency and depriving the US of over $100 billion in revenue annually.     He dismantled protections regarding retirement savings, allowing brokers to suggest riskier investments without disclosing the risk, causing people to lose their money.     \\nTrump pushed/passed changes to tax laws that primarily benefited the most wealthy individuals &amp; profitable businesses, creating deep, permanent reductions of the corporate tax rate. He signed an executive order temporarily suspending the collection of Social Security tax from employees during Covid, causing them to owe the full amount of tax later.He has had his charities shut down for misuse of funds, has bankrupted at least six businesses and caused many others to go under due to mismanagement and nonpayment of bills, and Trump has been involved in 4,000+ lawsuits over the past three decades, many for nonpayment for services.     \\nHe manipulated his net worth and property values to avoid paying taxes and to get loans from creditors. Trump stated that he was hoping for a recession/collapse of financial markets so that he could buy up properties/ stocks while they were cheap.   Trump refused to divest from his businesses &amp; continued to profit financially while in office. He created over 3,000 conflicts of interest and made many millions of dollars by paying himself with federal funds for stays of himself, security &amp; staff at his own properties while president.      \\nHe constantly violated the Emoluments Clause by accepting payments &amp; business at his private properties from foreign government officals &amp; special interest groups, basically paying for the privilege of meeting with the president. Trump continues to sell merchandise referencing his time in office in order to make a massive amount of money from his presidency.     \\nHe was the first president in 40 years who refused to release his tax returns &amp; even fought in court to prevent them from becoming public.","title":"Donald J.
