Anyone or any group who can write big checksand bend congress to their willare the ones with real power. This system is a capitalist oligarchy with a democratic veneer. Has always been, even in 1776.After having been president, Drumpf still has no clue how little power the constitution has given the presidency (and for good reason: founding fathers who wrote it did not want a king and fought a war to break away from a monarchy).

Those judges said the rioters who sought to keep Congress from certifying Bidens victory were otherwise obstructing that proceeding, even though they were not destroying or concealing documents.\\nThe outlier was U.S. District Judge Carl J.

Maybe vuvuzelas are worse for hearing after all, and I can imagine why they might be worse for animals as well. Your argument about crowds and chaos doesn't really work. During fireworks, people gather in large crowds as well, and it looks and sounds like absolute chaos. As for COVID, it's true that launching fireworks doesn't make people spray their saliva around (a small ), but my experience is that it doesn't keep people physically distanced at all, in fact, COVID was the reason for the firework ban in Germany in 2020 and 2021.As for items cracking after being used for some time and ending up in a landfill, I think it's still better than being designed to immediately desintegrate into pieces, which then end up in parks and rivers.

He was asked how his evangelical base would react to it and he said \\"well they still have to vote for me, what are they going to do elect a Democrat who will push for abortions up to birth\\"? And he was right, evangelicals and super pro life people continued to support him. But when it comes to the far left, they don't do the same. When one candidate is pushing for a progressive tax system and raising taxes on people making 400k+ but not dismantling capitalism while the other candidate is pushing for tax cuts for the rich and corporations, your response isn't \\"guess I have to vote for the one more in line with my views\\", it's \\"earn my vote and cater to me\\". And the problem is catering to progressives costs other votes and is typically not actually worth it, which is why they don't.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"My sister got power at 11:50pm and it went away again after 4am today in the metro area of PR","title":"Puerto Rico power outage slowly being rectified after massive New Year's Eve blackout"},{"text":"Lived long enough to see Trump win.

While fireworks are louder, they're brief and intermittent. A crowd of people blowing vuvuzelas creates sustained noise exposure, which is far more damaging to hearing. Just look at the 2010 World Cup - players and spectators reported hearing problems lasting days after matches due to continuous vuvuzela noise.The \\"less scary for animals\\" argument doesn't hold up either. Animals can adapt to brief, predictable firework displays (that's why many pets are fine after the first few bangs on NYE). But sustained, chaotic noise from different directions is way more stressful - it triggers their predator response mechanisms continuously.Your PTSD point is also flawed. Many PTSD sufferers are triggered by loud crowds and chaos more than by predictable explosive sounds. A massive crowd of people making sustained noise would be a nightmare for someone with crowd-related trauma or sensory processing issues.Also, have you considered the COVID factor? Thousands of people simultaneously blowing into instruments, spraying aerosols everywhere? That's a public health disaster waiting to happen. At least fireworks keep people physically distanced.Your \\"no waste\\" argument ignores the fact that plastic vuvuzelas are basically disposable - they crack, break, and end up in landfills just like firework debris, except they contain more plastic.","title":"CMV: simple wind instruments like vuvuzelas or samba apitos would be a better alternative to fireworks"},{"text":"Trump: We need smart people coming into our country, and we need a lot of people coming in.When will MAGA realize that maybe true patriotism means working hard on your education so that you can help your country become the world leader it once was? The only way to become a scientific and technological powerhouse that it once was decades ago is by building up our K-12 and higher-education systems again. That will Make America Great Again and reestablish a strong economy and innovative leader worldwide. Ramaswamy recently shared a long post saying, American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long. Is he wrong? I dont think so. When will they get do the hard work of getting to the bottom of the reason? So easy to keep pointing fingers at the other side. Im just as guilty. America is in such deep shit, and ironically, its their love of vacuous people in politics, uneducated influencers, morons with podcasts, Hollywood, and billionaires who proudly boast about their hate and ignorance with pride that got us here (among other reasons, for sure.) MAGA is an idealistic religious cult of laziness. They dont seem to want to do what it takes to make America great, since really making America great again would take hard work, and lots of it. Making America Great Again is a form of pride and finger pointing, with lots of signs, bumper stickers, willingness to get in fights with friends and family over your cult leaders, a belief that the country needs God and guns, a willingness to buy into any number of false conspiracies to support your narrative, and a worship of some type of idealized good ol days culture that never really existed.  We ignore history as its repeating itself. We praise religious zealots for putting Bibles back into our kids classrooms as people just sit back, thinking thats the problem with education. Meanwhile, our kids could care less about the Bible or about education as they are mentally hijacked by social media. Part of his campaign was about railing against education, even claiming he wanted to dismantle the Dept. of Education. Yet, in that NYE interview, Trump now claims we need educated people, that America doesnt have the educated people we need, thus we need to actually embrace immigration! Wow, now that's on heckuva 180! How long before Trump can connect the dots and realize that maybe a full-on funded overhaul of the American education system to make math and science great again with our kids, to funnel incentives for our own kids to purse higher education here and fill those jobs here is the actual solution?Education is not the enemy but the solution. Is America willing to work hard on its education to make it a powerhouse again? In a land whose kids celebrate influencers perpetuating the growing idiocracy over working hard on their math homework and whose adults and families are struggling to make ends meet and cant afford the time or energy to care either way, its not a hopeful time.

Specifically, the grievance we feel that he keeps getting away with it is predicated on an assumption that our system is meant to provide *justice* that is, to identify wrongdoing and punish it.But of course were now waking up to the possibility that it was never meant to do any such thing. What it really is looking like is something else: yes, the system identifies transgressions (crimes) but it doesnt necessarily punish them. Instead it appears to funnel crimes onto two separate tracks. If the perpetrator has no monetary or political power, then theyre treated as a wrongdoer and punished, either for the benefit of proving to the rest of us rubes that The System Works or else, some say, for more sinister motives (*cough* for-profit prisons *cough*). If, however, you have some kind of monetary or political profile then the fun begins! Yes, the System identifies your crimes but it doesnt *punish* them, oh no, that would be silly. On this track, crimes are an essential tool. Without them the perpetrators would be free to do whatever *they* want with their money or platform cant have *that*!

And the noise mostly has to to with the impact on animals (both pets who get scared and wild animals who waste precious resources in the winter from being stressed and trying to flee from the noise).So replacing fireworks with loud instruments would only solve one of the two problems. Sure, they might not be *as* loud, but they are more continuous (constant noise vs occasional bangs). Animals will still get stressed from cities full of people blowing vuvuzelas.Besides, you describe vuvuzelas as joyful, but then say that fireworks being beautiful isn't going to convince you because that's subjective. Personally I loathe the sound of a vuvuzela, and I know many other people do too.Columnist [Jon Qwelane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Qwelane) described the device as \\"an instrument from hell\\" (...) The Spanish midfielder [Xabi Alonso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso) said, \\"Those trumpets? That noise I don't like?... FIFA must ban those things?... it is not nice to have a noise like that\\". Dutch coach [Bert van Marwijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_van_Marwijk) remarked, \\"...?it was annoying?... in the stadiums you get used to it but it is still unpleasant\\". There's a reason they're banned in many sport events, and are considered to be dangerous when used in close proximity of others.The vuvuzela has been the subject of controversy when used by spectators at football matches. Its high volume can lead to permanent [hearing loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss) for unprotected ears after close-range exposure,[^(\\\\[11\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuvuzela#cite_note-Journal3-11) with a [sound level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_intensity#Sound_intensity_level) of 120?[dB(A)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) (the threshold of pain) at one metre (3.3?ft) from the device opening(both quotes from the wiki page on vuvuzelas)","title":"CMV: simple wind instruments like vuvuzelas or samba apitos would be a better alternative to fireworks"},{"text":"Interesting.

Nixon passed the Clean Air act and founded the EPA which taken in the context of his time was a pretty big step.And on top of all of that you're forgetting a few key issues that people care about 1) foreign affairs, biden was weak here compared to progressive desires refusing to even pay lip service to the idea that Israel's war of destruction and genocide could be wrong, 2) racial justice, biden did actually try here, he was doing his best to move the needle in the right direction but was held back by congress, 3) keeping your promises, biden came in with *very* lofty promises, he promised 2k to everyone, delivered only 1.4k, he promised student debt forgiveness but was blocked at every turn (and many believe there were smarter, easier, harder to block ways he could've gone about it), he promised a grand infrastructure bill, and got less than half of what he promised, he promised a resurgence of union protections and then didn't get the bill passed and had his administration convince unions to back down, 4) covid, Biden didn't really do anything extra to stop covid and indeed declared the pandemic as \\"over\\" when it still rages to this very day and is still killing and disabling so many people every day.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"deflection, look at the birdy while I steal everything that is not nailed down","title":"What's really behind Donald Trump's tariff threats and '51st state' posts about Canada"},{"text":"Yes we realize but the Lion doesn't care what gazelles say about him.","title":"Former Trump adviser: If Denmark cant defend Greenland, let US buy it to become part of Alaska"},{"text":"I'm personally a lot more disgusted with every single republican but that's just me?","title":"Trump picks Musk's money over 'forgotten' Americans of MAGA.

And it's based on very short term thinking.These are people from families who are well enough off to have already educated them. They already have high status and are valued in their own country. These are not the poor with nothing to lose. Once the pay isn't good enough, they simply don't need to come. This is very different than migrant farm workers who are desperate for any money. These people are in a different societal class in their home country. They can simply calculate yeah that deal isn't good enough to make it worth it. But in the meantime, the damage has been done to American wages and the American educational system because we will no longer have the demand for Americans trained in these fields. Because the other problem is along with the falling wages for these professions which is Musk's real motivation the demand for the degrees will go down. The lower wages will become a disincentive for Americans to pursue expensive STEM degrees. Who wants to go $200,000 into debt for an engineering degree if you're only going to get paid half of what they currently make now? Worse they will be competing with debt free graduates from other countries whose government paid for their education.  With less demand it will  literally gut and fatally weaken these programs in American higher education. Our own students can't compete with those from all of those countries with government funded or much cheaper higher education. No one wants to pay that much and take on debt for a career that won't end up paying well. Capitalism works both ways. But this is indeed how we go from being the greatest country in the world to losing that.  Once our universities aren't the best, it's a slippery slope.  Once our wages are low, there is no brain drain that makes it worth living here.","title":"Trump is a little guy, Musk is a big guy: historian predicts trouble for president-elect"},{"text":"he heard that the luncheon after the funeral is being catered by macdonalds","title":"Trump says he is planning to attend Jimmy Carters funeral"},{"text":"They got RF xp in India while getting their under grad.

If you thought the money grabbing was blatant before, you haven't seen anything yet.* Trump has at most a year and a half to enact his entire agenda before the midterm elections. The margin in the House is already razor thin and historically the party that lost the Presidency always gains a few seats back in the midterms. Trump is about to understand the definition of the term \\"lame duck\\".* His cabinet picks are designed to trigger liberals. It's not the team you put together to get shit done, it's the team you put together to take a picture together and post on Truth Social. Trump chose so poorly that a few of his picks have already withdrawn or will have trouble getting confirmed.* After the midterms, the GOP needs to nominate the next candidate for President in 2028. That means Trump will no longer suck the oxygen out of every room. Someone else will be the focus, someone else will be coronated and Trump will find he has limited sway over who the next guy is. You won't hear as much about Trump after 2026.* The man is a walking clusterfuck. He has fucked up everything good in his life-- his $400 million inheritance, his casinos, his first two marriages, his first term in office... this will be no different. Except he's older, dumber and slower this time.* The most extreme components of Project 2025 require constitutional amendments, which means 75% of states have to vote for them. That's never, ever happening.* He got some credibility back in early November and destroyed it by the end of December with the Canada annexation and H1B visa scandals.

NAFTA wasn't popular, common hemispheric market wasn't a popular thing to say.Iirc polling tended to show NAFTA with large amount of idks/undecideds and opposition to NAFTA being well under 50% so it doesn't seem clear that the trade stuff mattered. In terms of that leaked quote, I'd guess that the \\"open borders\\" part did more to scare voters (and immigration was the thing Trump talked about much more than trade anyway)I seem to recall the broader narrative of \\"economic anxiety\\" as an explanation for Trump's popularity being considered largely debunked after 2016 by political scientists and such after looking at polling and exit polls and such of the electorate, with it appearing much more likely that Trump voters were largely motivated by cultural concerns instead of economics. Can't speak so strongly on that though. But looking at exit polls, Clinton did better than Obama on \\"the economy\\" (Obama actually lost voters who considered \\"the economy\\" their key issue by 4 points, he won due to his strengths on healthcare and foreign policy, while Clinton won on the economy by 10 points), it's just that Trump won landslides among voters who thought terrorism and immigration were the most important issues, and there were many more voters who prioritized those issues in 2016 vs 2012","title":"AEJ: The import tariffs introduced by President Trump in 2018C2019 adversely affected US exporters by raising input costs C The cost increases for exporters were substantial enough that the import tariffs were also the equivalent of a US export tariff of 2-4 percent."},{"text":"His supporters literally say 'He just says things, that's how he is'.

Trump has areas of--and this isn't praise; I loathe Trump with all my being, and you can check my comment history for proof--but Trump has areas of absolute brilliance. He can connect with people who like extremely simplified takes on topics, and get them angry about things. He's got a sense for people he can work over. He's got a fantastic understanding of bankruptcy procedures, lol. Most of these traits are simply narcissism, but they're intelligence in the sense that they help him make decision to navigate the world. That said, he--like so many of his followers--doesn't have any understanding of detail in any way. His understanding of almost every topic is surface-level at best, and that's... when you're leading a country, some level of attention to detail is needed. It's really important, in fact. Detail is important. So, yeah--I don't think he's \\"stupid\\" in the sense that the word \\"stupid\\" doesn't really tell us much, and more than anything else, he's chaotic and amoral, and that's why he's so dangerous to us and to the world order.","title":"Trump is a little guy, Musk is a big guy: historian predicts trouble for president-elect"},{"text":"The downvotes are a sign of conceding the argument.

Elon was getting blustery and ready to fight to the death on this issue a few days ago, now hes retreating and making some very different pronouncements. Im sort of glad it happened, though, as it was highly informative as to how the American people are perceived by certain powerful individuals who just joined the MAGA movement (hint: with derision). I always believed Elon was more MEGA than MAGA. It doesnt make him good or bad, it just is. And now everyones eyes should be wide open. Elon is not America First in the way it was conceived, and in the way that tens of millions of Trump supporters envision it. I guarantee that he does not lose sleep over the plight of the West Virginia coal miner nor the Wisconsin trucker. Elon is Elon First. But he also helped Trump win, and that cant be ignored. Accordingly, hes going to want certain things, and as the richest man in the world, he wants to be a shot caller. It has long been rumored that he was butting heads with ride-or-die people in Trump World behind the scenes. Obviously, it was over things like this.Team Bannon  who oddly isnt pictured on the card OP posted, has already won. This visa program will either not survive honest, rigorous scrutiny or be so altered as to not be recognizable.This entire thing could probably have flown under the radar, but the arrogance of Vivek (who told that nerd it was a good idea to send out that X Post over the Christmas holidays?) coupled Elons toddler-like temper tantrum at the same Trump supporters who have embraced him (while the Left excoriates him and prays to Satan for his demise) has laid this issue front and center. Now a giant spotlight is on the H1B1 visa and it looks more like something DOGE should cull in a cost cutting maneuver, than lauded. People are digging into the records, looking for all those 0.0001% once in a generation Einsteins on H1B1 visas, but theyre instead finding a lot of basic coders making 70k a year. If only Elon were as savvy as he is smart.People who think just because a form immigration is legal, that it is de facto good and non-deleterious to American citizens, apparently dont understand (or care) how corporate America sees middle-class Americans. To the tech bros in particular, they envision a country where tech feudalism rules and native-born Americans (and foreigners alike) are all just surfs tilling their silicon fields.

Need to use Title IX to protect yourself and others? Oh, easier for the accused to get away with shit until Biden fixed it back. Meanwhile, humans and animals alike suffered because, GASP, regulations can function for the greater good. Hell, I even found out that the reason why Lowes and Home Depot kept having to replace our washer was because of a Trump deregulation- basically, big box stores were no longer required to check inventory at ports, and so they didn't want to spend the time and money on that.

So when Canada's Chalk River nuclear research facility experienced a power surge that damaged its reactor, the U.S. sent Carter and his team. He was one of a few people in the world who could do it.Fuel rods at the research reactor experienced a partial meltdown after the power surge. It ruptured the reactor and flooded the facility's basement with radioactive water, rendering the reactor core unusable.In his 2015 autobiography, \\"A Full Life: Reflections At Ninety,\\" Carter described the incident and his preparations for repairing the reactor. They built an exact replica of the reactor, true to the last detail (except the actual nuclear material) on a nearby tennis court to practice and track their progress.Carter and his 22 other team members were separated into teams of three and lowered into the reactor for 90-second intervals to clean the site. It was estimated that a minute-and-a-half was the maximum time humans could be exposed to the levels of radiation present in the area.It was still too much, especially by today's standards. The future president had radioactive urine for months after the cleanup.\\"We were fairly well-instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that, I had radioactivity in my urine,\\" Carter told CNN in 2008. \\"They let us get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now. It was in the early stages, and they didn't know.\\"The exposure was especially dangerous for Carter, whose family medical history is full of cancer deaths. His father died of pancreatic cancer in 1953, which led to Carter leaving the Navy that year. Cancerous tumors were found on the former president's liver and brain in 2015 as he turned 91, but quick diagnosis and treatment led to a cancer-free bill of health a year later.His extensive knowledge of nuclear reactors and energy would come in handy when Carter became president in 1977, as other world leaders respected his knowledge on the subject.https://www.military.com/history/how-jimmy-carter-saved-canadian-nuclear-reactor-after-meltdown.htmlEditAlmost forgot to mention that he help lead the nation after the Three Mile incident:https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2024/12/30/jimmy-carter-pennsylvanians-three-mile-island-partial-meltdown/","title":"Jimmy Carter Was the Anti-Trump Who Made America Great | Carter served in the Navy, won the Nobel Prize, fought for civil rights, human rights, and environmental preservation.

Key impacts include:**Reduction in GDP and Employment:**\\nUndocumented immigrants contribute significantly to the U.S. economy. Their removal could reduce the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by approximately 4.2% to 6.8%. Additionally, employment could decline by 6.7% by 2028, reflecting the loss of millions of workers across various industries. **Labor Shortages in Critical Industries:**\\nIndustries such as agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and services heavily rely on undocumented workers. Mass deportations would lead to labor shortages in these sectors, disrupting production and services. For instance, the agricultural sector could face significant challenges, potentially leading to increased food prices due to reduced labor availability. **Inflationary Pressures:**\\nThe sudden decrease in the labor force could drive up wages as employers compete for a smaller pool of workers. This wage inflation, combined with decreased productivity in key sectors, could contribute to an overall increase in consumer prices. Estimates suggest that such policies could push inflation rates to between 6% and 9.3% by 2026. **Fiscal Impact:**\\nUndocumented immigrants contribute to tax revenues, paying approximately $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022. Their removal would result in a significant reduction in these tax revenues, potentially exacerbating budget deficits and affecting public services. **Implementation Costs:**\\nThe logistics of deporting millions of individuals would entail substantial government expenditure. Estimates indicate that conducting mass deportations could cost at least $315 billion, or up to $967.9 billion over a decade, considering enforcement, legal proceedings, and transportation expenses. In summary, while the hypothetical mass deportation of all undocumented immigrants might aim to address certain policy objectives, it would likely lead to significant economic disruptions, including reduced GDP, labor shortages, increased inflation, decreased tax revenues, and substantial implementation costs. https://apnews.com/article/a18de763fcc01557258c7f33cab375ed?utm_source=chatgpt.comhttps://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2024/10/01/price-increases-reached-20-during-biden-s-term-under-trump-it-could-be-disastrous-too_6727866_23.html?utm_source=chatgpt.comhttps://www.vox.com/politics/381637/elon-musk-donald-trump-2024-election-temporary-hardship?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"What will happen to the economy if Trump manages to deport all of the undocumented immigrants?"},{"text":" and how many divisions does the Chief Justice have?/s","title":"Roberts warns against ignoring Supreme Court rulings as tension with Trump looms"},{"text":"That's because he's a fucking asshole.","title":"Trump says he is planning to attend Jimmy Carter's funeral"},{"text":"You know, as long as America is going the oligarchy route, can we also have the part where the state confiscates an out-of-favour billionaires assets, dissolves his company, and puts him under house arrest?","title":"Elon Musk channels Hillary Clinton in calling Trump supporters contemptible fools amid H-1B visa debate"},{"text":"They had enough cowardice to burn cities down though?","title":"What we do if the libs storm the cap this time"},{"text":"You have to realize, none of these people live in the real world.

I believe politicians have the responsibility of not only balancing these interests but also figuring out what would optimally satisfy them. If we simply enact legislation the moment the population wants something and we don't consider their knowledge on the issue nor their other competing interests, the result will be disastrous, to say the least.","title":"cmv: Political flip-flopping and pandering is not a bad thing"},{"text":"Yeah 100%.

Not because they're bad ideas, but because they're solutions from a different time. Leftists don't understand that FDR and LBJ were enacting these policies when trust in government was sky-high. The vast majority of people at the time actually believed that government worked for the people, unlike now. FDR was a once-in-a-century politician who had close to 80% of Congress under his control. LBJ was inaugurated just after the JFK assassination. These were special circumstances.The New Deal and Great Society programs also came about during a really unique time in American history. The rest of the world was either destroyed from WWII or too weak to compete economically, making the US basically the only place for global capital to go to. This meant that even though companies faced high labor costs from the New Deal regulatory apparatus, they didn't really have any better options, so they set up shop in America anyway and brought industry and jobs here. Contrast that with now, when there's tons of competition between America and its economic rivals.Whatever the new economic policy of the Democrats is going to be, it isn't going to be neoliberalism or New Deal-style welfare.

The reality is there is a dearth of talent in the US that have the skills and experience necessary to fill these technical and specialized jobs, so many employers turn to international candidates that possess those skills. The major issue is that some of those companies then leverage the H1-B visa as golden handcuffs for those employees. Its not quite indentured servitude, but it allows employers to limit raises and/or promotions because H1-B visa holders have significantly less freedom of mobility to go somewhere else than their domestic counterparts if they arent happy with their current situation and/or have further professional ambitions.

For one thing our military-Industrial complex companies are recruiting in all the good engineering schools from practically the Junior level. That leaves fewer picks for private companies. For another a very larhge number of available engineering jobs are neither out-sourced, nor can they be. The engineering I have in mind often requires hands-on design and lab work, as well as working in a team of several different types of engineers. As matters stand, india or pakistan are hardly known for their mechanical and electrical engineering acumen. Yes, they do have software engineering and computer science, but again, the majority of jobs I know of have requirements that make them poor candidates for outsourcing.So yes, studying engineering in a good reputation department still will pay of. Most of the engineers I know practically write their own ticket, and several are in their later 50's and still are in much demand (experience does count).I am admittedly less familiar with software type jobs and can see how these may not offer the greatest security especially as many can be done remotely. Areas like Biology and Physics is still a different story. In these areas a BSc qualifies one to be basically a technician. So a master level or even PhD may be a better ticket. At least that's what I advice (BTW, neuroscience is all the rage nowadays, but it still has a high academic component).You're better off learning a skilled trade or becoming a police officer or fire fighter.Going into trades is not a bad idea at all. Most of these jobs are non-AI replaceable and certainly not out-sourceable. Two years in a community college + 3 years apprenticing on the job can get you set for life with excellent income.PS It's 2 weeks later and I am still waiting for the electrician to find some time to come over given his busy schedule. Where I live, it'll likely cost over $60./hr. If I pay a bonus of $200. he can come sooner.Then there's nursing. A huge shortage in that area. Jobs go begging constantly, even with all the Philipino special visa holders.Finally, as i said many times before i believe that those who study STEM fields in College should be absolutely required to take some serious humanity course. Been saying that for years.","title":"Why all the Musk hate! [Pt. 2, the Follow Up]"},{"text":"His supporters are not going to bail on him no matter what position he takes.

Perhaps that has changed for some (sad) people in the internet age, but thats immaterial. **Dates get written as MMM-DD-YYYY because thats how theyre spoken by English speakers.** We say January 1st, 2025.So why that order? I think thats actually really simple. **Its a practical order of least to most specific in daily conversation.** To illustrate this, think about answering the question when was the last time you bought dog food?1. If its within the month, youd probably just answer with the date: on the 13th.2. If its older, you might just answer with the month: in December.3. If its older and you want to be more precise, youd add specificity by saying on December 13th.4. So why is year last if it seems the least specific on the surface? I think its because its functionally *selecting a specific December 13th.* After all, how comparatively often do you discuss things from more than a year ago? The year is very frequently omitted entirely and we assume the date is for the current year.But this is just most conjecture. What you need to keep in mind is that language is not designed; it is organic, and evolves.

Richard Winger's Ballot Access News is a great resource on all thing related to ballot access. His essays on how we got here are short and worth reading. https://ballot-access.org/ It's a shame we don't have a national standard (a fair one) like we do for campaign finance.Anyway, I agree with you about labels. I don't actually care what a successful party that works for the people is called. Green, Communist and Socialist definitely have baggage as far as their names. Younger people seem more open to the name Socialist. But I'd like something that can convince people of all ages to vote for their own interests. Labor sounds good though it has baggage too.Interestingly enough, the founder of the Greens (Petra Kelly, in Germany) said she envisioned a party that was neither right nor left, but \\"in front.\\" Unfortunately, the U.S. Greens have to keep explaining to people that they don't share the German Greens' foreign policy.Which is why I do think it's important to agree on some fundamental issues. One of my heros, Judy Bari, had a bomb placed in her car. She was an environmentalist who was able to talk to loggers and win them over. She was making too much sense, so they had to shut her up.My point is, labor issues include issues not directly related to the worker-management struggle. Everyone needs clean air, water, land and food, housing, healthcare and education. We don't want our kids to die in war. What are our demands that we won't budge on? And that we can make people understand?The definition of worker needs to be inclusive too, in a way that makes sense to people. There really is a lot of division where there shouldn't be. Tech workers and farm workers and the checkers at the grocery store shouldn't be pitted against each other. Nor should old and young. Everyone is scared of being able to retire, or keep their home, or surviving a medical crisis or inflation.Identity politics (on the right and on the left) are a way to divide us all. I think we could all come together on many of these, if they were framed right. But that's adding complexity. Going for the fundamentals could be inclusive.I think we all know from Bernie's 2016 campaign that people will come together when it's clear that their life and death kind of interests are taken seriously. I think that's why people on the right and the left are reacting the way they do to Luigi and finding commonality.No idea about who is welcome at the February event. When I hear more about it, I'll share.Lots more to talk about.

That should speak volumes.Basically boomers just printed a shit ton of money to loan to themselves to buy assets while devaluing the currency to inflate those assets and expecting everyone under 30 to pick up the tab on that debt.So now were in a situation where my mother has a $5M stock portfolio and pays almost no taxes.  While the amount of taxes I pay go to her social security checks, her Medicare insurance, and running the country and paying off all the federal debt her generation racked up along the way that materially helped her grow her assets.Its like having a roommate that stole your identity, opened a credit card, and took out $35 Trillion in debt in your name.

That's because I brought up the sacred cow - our education system really is broken and no one wants to talk about that.This has been an issue for me for the longest time, partly because i know quite a bit about Science and math education in our public schools. I know how unbelievably unequal the schools are and the huge - unbridgeable gaps - between those who get to go to the good schools and those who don't.I taught classes in University where the gap between incoming students in my own science field (Physics) was so large that I had to start grading on a scale of 125%, just so that the B students will not be crestfallen that a 76% was all they got (which was fair). As for the C students - a normal grading curve would put them in the range of 60 to 75%. What happened was that there was a gap of well over 10% in the curve, meaning an 85% will make you an A-. Yet I'd have usually 2-3 students who'd score in the 95 percentile. This huge gap between those who actually can handle the subject (and this was Physics 101, ie, pretty basic - the kind I studied in High School in my home country) boiled down to insufficient fluency with basic Algebra, more than say, handling Physics concepts.This gap, which has a few way at the top (who are as capable as any student anywhere) and the next cohort of the so-called B's (who are in truth, C's) is something that happens across the country, per what I hear. This is what's reflected in the abjectly dismal scores American students got in the latest int'l TIMMS study.We DO have a problem in this country with the STEM subjects and on this Musk is right. We simply don't produce enough capable engineers ( who'd have had to take that Physics 101 as well as 201 later). I have not done the numbers but I know from experience we don't have enough engineers, especially in Mechanical, biomechanical, electrical and computer sciences. The ones who do graduate from a good university with at least a BSc in these fields (a master is preferred nowadays) find jobs rather easily. If they are American citizens the Aerospace companies swoop them up, leaving far fewer for private industry. Which BTW points to another part of the problem, namely the behemoth size of the aerospace leeches wthat receive the lion share of the non-discretionary budget (nearly 2/3 per my calculations, if military outlays are included!).That's what I think has come Musk's way. And like me and many others he has no doubt observed that the lion share of the graduates in these fields have foreign sounding names. They may be first generation or even second generation but still, not very many American natives. That may be why Vivek talks about American \\"culture\\" and Musk talks about the unfulfilled need for \\"top talent\\".I do wish that instead of piling on Musk we used this opportunity to talk about what's wrong with our K-12 education system and how to fix it. But not much chance of that because it's a lot easier to turn this into a spit ball fight than address a very thorny and difficult-to-solve problem.Which BTW a problem that neither Musk nor Vivek will know how to even start addressing, IMHO.","title":"Why all the Musk hate!

In general, progressives in the US seem to run on 80-year cycles; in which they start the cycle with a cause and no clue; over time end up ramping up their goals but failing to get any ground, before eventually convincing enough of the country that they are correct to force through a few incremental changes, then massive gains in the last decade of the cycle, only for the leaders to be killed or put into office, at which point the entire movement collapses and the next one forgets all of the lessons about how to get results - which means the next cycle has to start from scratch.The American Revolution saw the first murmurs of unity in the 1670s; and first started organizing political power in the 1680s; but it wouldn't be until the 1760s that they started getting enough popular support that they were able to get anything meaningful done. The antislavery movement was already underway during the American Revolution; but wouldn't start seeing results until the 1850s. The American Labor Movement got it's first legal success in 1842; but wouldn't see meaningful results in forcing legal changes until the 1900s, with the major wins coming in the 1910s and 1920s. The Civil Rights Movement started in the 1890s, with Plessy v Ferguson a failed attempt at securing rights in 1896; but it wouldn't be until the 1950s that they started getting victories; and the major wins would come in the 1960s.The current American Progressive Movement started some time between the elections of Nixon (1968) and Reagan (1980). Based on that, and the roughly 80-year cycle you see in US progressive movements, you the first small victories should come between the late 2020s (2028 is a good chance if Trump manages to piss off enough of the US and push them into progressivism) and early 2040s. The big wins the current movement will be getting will likely come between 2040 and 2060.But it takes everyone along the way. We don't get Martin Luther King Junior without Michael King taking up the movement in the 1920s, and changing his name and the name of his son to Martin Luther. We don't get the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations without the Knights of Labor. We don't get John Brown and Harriet Beecher Stowe, nor the success of Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, without Moses Brown and Thomas Paine.

The reason why we started advancing at a quick pace after the Renaissance Era was due to the proliferation of knowledge and education, even more so once the printing press was invented, when the telephone was invented, etc. The easier the general public can access information and communicate with others different than them, the more educated and progressive people become.It's hard to conceptualize this, but societies views on war, people of color, marginalized groups, how we govern, have radically changed in the past 100 years, which is practically instantaneous in the grand scheme of things. Imo after another 100 years racism and sexism will be practically non-existent, unless we end up taking ourselves out first, or we end up going back to the stone age from WW3 or something.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"This has everything to do with Don Jr. not wanting to be seen doing coke.","title":"Snopes claim: Don Jr. trashes New Year's at Mar-a-Lago: Dad's pals treat me like a 'freaking imbecile"},{"text":"Notice how in all the lists of Carter's accomplishments, none of them cover anything he did WHILE he was President?Carter's presidential legacy is the abandonment of FDR, New Deal economic populist Democratic politics, the birth of Neoliberal capitalist third-way politics, and the prelude of the destruction of the American social safety nets that would eventually manifest in Regan.And that's not even covering the war crimes he shares with every other President.Carter was a shit President who played a heavy part of what brought us to Trump and this entire \\"Republican vs. Diet Republican\\" paradigm we now have dragging us down by our necks.I'm not saying he was a bad person. But let's stop pretending he was some amazing President. He wasn't. He took the Nixon scandal and turned it into a Regan landslide, while destroying the DNC's platform and putting us where the party is right now. Wanna' know the history of the DNC losing working-class voters? It starts with Carter.Carter was the Biden to Nixon's Trump (and Regan's Trump.) He is fortunate that his legacy was built after he left office, because his time in office was very reminiscent of the failures of the Biden administration.","title":"Jimmy Carter Was the Anti-Trump Who Made America Great | Carter served in the Navy, won the Nobel Prize, fought for civil rights, human rights, and environmental preservation.

Also, considering that Canada treated its natives just as poorly as we did despite still being a British colony, I doubt much wouldve changed in that regard aside from it perhaps being delayed by a couple of decades.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 31, 2024"},{"text":"Always has been","title":"Sorry if this is a given, Ive noticed something about r/conservative."},{"text":"For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.","title":"Our farms will come to a stop: US farmers fret over Trump's deportation plans"},{"text":"Presidents have done questionable things and even occasionally illegal things.

It often feels like neither side truly represents the people, instead prioritizing the interests of the corporate oligarchy. Policies like the Patriot Act, which expanded state surveillance, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which stripped away fundamental rights, are glaring examples of how our system fails to protect or serve the public.When it comes to the Democratic Party, their inability to deliver real, transformative change isnt surprising given their internal divisions. They encompass a wide range of ideologies, from moderates like Joe Manchin to progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This diversity could be a strength, but it often leads to watered-down policies and an unwillingness to challenge entrenched systems. For example, AOCs loss in her bid for the Oversight Committee demonstrates how leadership often prioritizes seniority and caution over the bold ideas we desperately need.Then theres the Senate filibustera rule that requires a 60-vote supermajority for most legislation. This procedural hurdle has made it almost impossible to pass significant reforms, even when Democrats have held majorities. Efforts to reform or eliminate the filibuster have been blocked, often by members of their own party who seem more concerned about maintaining their power than addressing the urgent needs of the people.The real issue, though, goes beyond the Democratic Party. Both major parties are deeply influenced by corporate interests, and this shapes their policies in ways that protect the wealthy and powerful. This isnt just about campaign donationsits about a system that prioritizes deregulation, privatization, and wealth concentration at the expense of ordinary people. The revocation of Roe v. Wade and the continued expansion of state surveillance and militarization are bipartisan failures that demonstrate how both sides perpetuate systems of control rather than challenging them.Youre right to feel disillusioned. The system, as it currently stands, serves to protect itself rather than the people. But that doesnt mean change is impossible. Grassroots movements and local organizing have historically been powerful tools for pushing back against oppressive systems. Look at how workers' movements have historically fought for rights like the eight-hour workday or how civil rights activists challenged systemic racism. These victories didnt come from within the establishmentthey came from people demanding change from the outside.The key is recognizing that real progress will never come from a single party or politician. It comes from sustained pressure on the system as a whole. Whether that means advocating for reforms to weaken corporate influence, dismantle state surveillance, or rebuild protections for fundamental rights, the fight for change requires challenging the structures that both parties seem intent on preserving. Its a long, difficult road, but its one weve walked beforeand we can do it again.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"As one who hears him and maga, I know they want to deport ALL browns.","title":"Connecticut AG says hed be first to sue if Trump targets birthright citizenship"},{"text":"He also wrecked Peter Thiel's McLaren in 2000 and they could have both died.

We need to _blame the illness_ and not the person who is suicidal of those who love and care for them.The obvious frame to counter with here is that there are lots and lots of people who are failed by loved ones and friends - it's awful and it's sad.  But, they aren't suicidal because they have above-bar mental health, not because they have awesome friends or family.  The problem here is that we should not claim failure to those who cannot resolve someone's mental illness with \\"caring\\" - you and I have no greater capacity to cure mental illness in someone than we do to cure cancer with our caring.  We can help get resources, we can be by there side, but our love is not some panacea for suicidal tendencies.
