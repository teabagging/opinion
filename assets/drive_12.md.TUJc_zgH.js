I believe that compelling someone to undertake a harmful, selfless act against their will, and giving them no choice but to undergo said selfless act, is both immoral and impracticalyou simply cant expect a human being to agree to experience great pain, hardship, and life-changing events for the sake of someone elses life while telling them that it is selfish to refuse. Some people will be in the right space and the right time in their lives to make said sacrifice, and some will not be.I therefore believe that women should have a reasonable window of opportunity to decide whether they want to carry out a pregnancy. For me, I think setting that window in the first trimester is the best solution.","title":"The begging has begun...."},{"text":"They think that Republicans are as hive mind as they are.

While I agree that the author did a good thing, I don't think I can grant him / her hero status bc the local zoning board isn't really a Goliath. US intelligence agencies are.

This is why it's already a purple state, not a red state, and it's a mistake to think otherwise. You only need to see the Dem voter total growth from 2016-2020 to understand how much has changed, and why simply labeling it as an unachievable flip is a mistake.I don't know if it will flip this year, of course. There are real challenges to actually pulling it off, both cultural and logistical, and even some of the optimists tend to bawk at the money needed to invest in the state...But that's the cost of Democracy, honestly. As the state grows in population, it gains more of the EC totals. The Dems cannot afford to keep ignoring it, period. It starts by the party growing at the grassroots level from within, which is what we've been working on since 2018. The Republican elected leaders make it hard, but they've hit a point of diminishing returns in their suppression efforts, similar to what you saw in 2020 Georgia.This is why I talk so often about the need to bring back the 50 state strategy, and am glad to at least see talk of investing in Allred's race (and Debbie's in FL) more seriously. Unfortunately, even people I otherwise trust like Rosenberg have a cynical take on the south, and I get why (the cost of allocating resources into TX/FL isn't cheap, and he's bullish on Montana, which I actually agree with), but democracy cannot be solely driven by cash alone. It must also be driven from the ground up, something people in this forum have been unusually good at.If you live in a swing state and need to invest your time there, do it. I understand and agree with the importance of those fights 1000%, if you live in a blue state and want to put your time into the swing states, I certainly also understand. No question, Harris must win by whatever means we electorally can achieve.But if you live in the south, or have time to spare, and can help us? Please consider doing so. Texas and FL should not be surrendered to fascists. We see the effects of these horrid laws first hand and so many of us fight to fix it. We're trying to warn others of what awaits on the other side of a Trump/Vance/Project2025 win, and show it can be prevented even here. Moving to a blue state is either not an option, or is an extraordinarily difficult one if we're privileged enough to consider it.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 4, 2024 - 32 days until election day!"},{"text":"It is political malpractice that Democrats never talk about the ways immigration benefits the average American.JD Vance was up on the debate stage talking about immigrants competing for limited housing - had he been to a construction site lately?

Yes, it was just an example. My point is that a black person could have a British name for a multitude of reasons, even if your assertion is true in the vast majority of cases.  How would you not know that you did. Otherwise you'd have family stories about coming here. My family has the story about my great grandmother being orphaned in the early 1910s in North Carolina by a car crash and growing up with her cousins whose family were sharecroppers. I knew this woman and I'm in my late 30s now. I mean surely there are people who don't have families or the family atmosphere is such that storytelling isn't a common pastime(for whatever reason)? You mentioned your great grandmother became an orphan. I don't think it's difficult to imagine a few things going differently and there's no family stories from before her time.Its only a few generations back. For that much black family in the South in the early 1900s, we were already here, immigration was practically a non factor for the presence of black people in the US before the 60s/70s.It is only a few generations back. I have fond memories of spending time with my great grandmother. But what about the generations before her? My uncle did a bit of digging recently and he shared our family tree dating back to 1792. He may have had more but we didn't have time to explore further. At 36yo I had no idea about my family tree before the 20th century, I just never looked into it even if it was available. This is how you could not know. I don't think people are so different from each other that you wouldn't have a few cases like me in the population of black Americans. These people obviously don't know whether their ancestors were slaves or not. They may find out if they feel like jumping into their family history. But even then I'd argue that there are still many people who won't be able to find records that go far enough to find the information.Now you did mention ancestors in the US in the 1800s as a reason for knowing what their situation was and of course having information of that, whether through records or passed down through generations, is sufficient to be called knowledge in this context. But one still needs to have this information to know, otherwise it's an assumption. Maybe a fair assumption and for most situations it's good enough. Yet it isn't knowledge.I do not doubt that you know your roots but there's close to 50 million black Americans. How many of those don't know the answer? Even if they were able to get all existing records then how many still wouldn't know? A million? 100,000? 10,000? Seventeen? I'm pretty sure it has to be at least seventeen but I'd wager it's a lot more than that, even a million people is still only 2%.","title":"CMV: The Way Race is Categorized in the United States Makes Almost Zero Sense"},{"text":"Let these idiot Trumpers do more stupid shit.","title":"Biden says he's concerned 2024 election won't be 'peaceful' after Trump, Vance comments"},{"text":"Or that trump is so much more corrupt that even the corrupt establishment is telling people hes dangerous.","title":"So there really is no difference between establishment Democrats &amp; Republicans.

That wouldve won the race.  GOP leadership (an oxymoron, I know)has completely failed.But I am 100% convinced NJ is very winnable for republicans.  Republicans just refuse to follow a winning playbook, and there is one.  They continue to do the same things that never work here and they mock the ones who have.

More urgently, we have an election to win and the guts of that takes place basically now and over the next week or two.Smarter would have been what Ive been recommending for two months and that is to send the best possible weapon - Tim Walz - to recruit these bros.Instead, he was subjugated into the background as a mostly silent mascot, while Kamala and Oprah and Taylor Swift and Hillary Clinton and (now) Liz Cheney took center stage.If you know these MAGA bros, you know this just repels them, strongly.  Tim Walz could have attracted some of them.Carville gave a more concise version of my strong recommendation when he said the campaign has a preachy woman problem.  And of course, outrage seeking people thought that was so terrible for him to say.There was never a day to waste, and now theyve wasted weeks not deploying Tim Walz.  One week I saw a tally and Walz did 2 appearances to JD Vances 59.The net result?  Kamala is doing well with all the people who were voting blue anyway.   Not great though, since she has only recovered about half of the polling leads that Biden had in 2020.  But its been disastrous with men.  Men of all ages, and men of most colors and backgrounds.  She has historically bad negative polling with them.Walz is the one that could have made a difference with these bros.  It might not be fair, but fair aint got nothing to do with it.With no days left to waste, Kamala is now going on a preachy womens gossip podcast.  Yes, Im aware Walz is being given a day pass to appear on Kimmel.  But too little too late has been ringing in my ears for weeks now.  Oh, yeah. Obama is apparently going to do his usual minimum possible contribution again, taking a break from windsurfing and publishing playlists to do a couple last minute appearances.  Contrast that with former president trump who has been campaigning in swing states for three and a half years straight.

But what Ive been yelling for the last two months was to deploy Tim Walz to the least-worst of the gettable Independent/undecided sources (which are really just Republican Lite characters not willing to drop the mask)These macho frat bros are never, ever, ever going to give Kamala Harris her due, for multiple unfixable reasons.  But they could and would respond to Tim Walz.I said Walz was an absolute weapon who should be used to go snag this small but reachable slice of votes.I said it would provide separation and cover for the unfortunately poor strategy of DWS and Donna Brazille who were sending Kamala into Oprah territory.  I said it was pointless busy work to re-win women who were already going to vote for her, and that Oprahs yodeling was actually a turn off to the men and independents that the campaign desperately needs.  Carville put it more succinctly well after I raised these strategies when he said: the Harris campaign has a preachy woman problem.Instead, DWS/Brazille used the early momentum to reassert the power and dust off their tactics from Hillary Clintons victorious campaign. /sTim Walz was reduced to mascot status, standing behind Kamala like a prop and doing 2 interviews to every 60 that JD Vance was doing.  So how did ignoring what myself and Carville recommended work out?  Well, the campaign did get the bump that I screamed would happen if Biden would just drop out.  And they did get the bump I screamed would happen for whichever party had the sense to listen to 150 million Americans and drop their geriatric candidate.But they also have only gained back half of the demographic percentages that Biden had in 2020.And theyve created the worst polling with men in years.  Kamala has all the same voters she had a month ago, the ones that were already blue.  But shes lost men of every age and most ethnicities.Hiding Walz has hurt the campaign, and most recently, set him on a back heel for the debate.He is a weapon.  He attracts the exact voters that Kamala/Oprah/TSwify repels.I dont care that theyre unlikeable men.  I just care that we need their votes to save democracy and that well look after them too if we can get a chance to govern.So before you make dishonest and flippant strawman statements about what Im saying, maybe check first...","title":"Kamala Harris to appear on \\"Call Her Daddy\\" podcast"},{"text":" she could lead us to victory in the swing Green Bay Assembly seats even if she doesnt winGreen Bay is leading Wisconsin in early ballot return percentages right now.

Rabin had taken the steps to negotiate a meaningful peace with the Palestinians. (For the sake of argument, let's put aside the fact that the plan to trade land to Palestinians was in no way just, since it was designed to fragment Palestinian territories into barely functional Bantustans, but it still was progress and represented a real start toward something better.)Netanyahu saw that there was political advantage in tapping into the fear and anger of right-wing Israelis and Kahanists who hated Rabin for his efforts toward peace.So Netanyahu rallied with them. He marched in parades where effigies of Rabin were carried in coffins. He delivered speeches before people who compared Rabin to Hitler and who called him a traitor and a murderer.And, in the end, one of them murdered Rabin.

They have paid $30,000, but still have an outstanding balance of $15,000 on the school loans, due to the way the loans are written. The loan relief is saying - youve paid $10,000 more than your loan value, so were discharging that remaining balance. The loaner of the $ already received their loan amount, plus interest. And 18 yr old old bowerers are ill prepared to understand the long term ranifications of these high interest loans. Better to forgive the remaining balance to allow their spending to help the economy.

But the podcast has changed so much since moving to Spotify and this is a great move on behalf of the campaign.So many women (of all political leanings) listen to this podcast and I am sure Harris will lay out in no uncertain terms how much Trump and Vance will completely fk them over if elected in November.","title":"Kamala Harris to appear on \\"Call Her Daddy\\" podcast"},{"text":"For anyone here who would like a reminder, journalist Paul Glastris (who has long covered health-care issues) has a summary of all the things Trump did to undermine the ACA, contrary to Vance's bald-faced lie that Trump salvaged it:https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/10/04/vance-lied-to-conceal-trumps-plan-to-destroy-obamacare/In summary:\\"-- Shortening the enrollment period from 3 months to 6 weeks.\\"-- Cutting the advertising budget during the ACA enrollment period by 90% and sharply curtailed funding for the navigators who help people sign up.\\"-- Eliminating cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers so low-income enrollees would have lower out-of-pocket costs.\\n\\"-- Eliminating the individual mandate, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated decreased enrollment by 3 to 6 million people and increased plan costs by about 10%.\\"-- Allowing greater use of association plans for small businesses and self-employed individuals, These plans exclude ACA-mandated benefits and\\"-- Backing the legal challenge to the ACA which Trump appointees to the Supreme Court partially endorsed in 2020, allowing states that refuse to expand Medicaid to continue receiving federal funds.\\"In addition:\\"The Trump administration also succeeded in 'lessening the regulatory burden' on insurers by expanding access to short-term health plans with limited benefits. How? By lengthening their maximum duration from 3 months to 3 years. These plans provide less comprehensive coverage than ACA-compliant plans by eliminating free access to highly-rated prevention services like flu shots and mammography. They also can include very high out-of-pocket costs.\\"And, of course, Trump and *almost* all Republicans in Congress came within one Senate vote of destroying the ACA completely.As Glastris further explains in detail, Vance and other Republicans are advocating, under misleading language, the return of pre-ACA conditions -- notably changes that would allow younger, more able-bodied people to flee the exchanges and thus make insurance under the ACA much more expensive.There is nonetheless a major ACA issue coming up next year, which Charles Gaba also set out in a compiled Twitter thread i discussed below in this topic.  Essentially, the ACA subsidies were too stingy, and legislation under Biden corrected this problem -- but only until October 2025.  This change led to substantial growth in insured people, and it will be up to the next Congress whether to continue it.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 4, 2024 - 32 days until election day!"},{"text":"Do you think Trump is going through all this effort to be president for just 4 years and not run again or decide elections are no longer necessary?","title":"Kamala Harris Rally Crowd Cheers Mike Pence, Dick Cheney"},{"text":"Roberts' response: \\"Nah.\\"","title":"Raskin, Ocasio-Cortez demand answers from Roberts on Alito, Thomas actions"},{"text":"I would pay good money just to hear the boss fire him.","title":"Bruce Springsteen endorses Kamala Harris and calls Donald Trump 'dangerous'"},{"text":"Fall back from the news and anything negative.

Immigration is the #1 or #2 issue to voters depending on the poll you're reading and a little more then half of them approve of mass deportation. Unfortunately a large chunk of independents want polices like this and things like this may convince them to vote for Harris. Even if it only convinces a few hundred independents max that alone could win Kamala the election given how close it is.Our electorate has put us into a trolley problem. If Democrats don't adopt some anti-immigration policies throwing immigrants under the bus to appease xenophobes they run the risk of losing the election which in turn will lead to a Trump administration that will 1000x more cruel to immigrants. It feels like a no win situation for someone who actively supports immigration.","title":"Biden Will Allow Legal Permission to Lapse for Migrants From 4 Countries"},{"text":"I don't understand the question?\\nMy dad asked me one day \\"son, what do you want to do after college\\" and I said \\"make a lot of money\\" and I got the job.\\nIs that not how you guys in Europe do things?","title":"Kamala Harriss Wall Street charm offensive begins to pay off"},{"text":"Natanyahu did.

It doesnt end the overall program for the four countries, so a new person from any of the countries could still come and stay here legally for two years under the program. Its just the people who have already been here for two years that are affected2. It doesnt mean the people who have been here for two years have no options to remain in the United States, but they do have to qualify for some other, more permanent program to remain. I dont know enough to know how easy/hard that is to do, but I guess the original spirit of the TPS program basically lies in this point: that its a temporary, emergency pathway to come to the US and stay for two years while sorting out a more durable legal pathway to remain here (or returning home, if not). So I think the failings of the immigration policy may be a lack of these more durable options, more so than an inherent problem with TPS only lasting two years.","title":"Biden Will Allow Legal Permission to Lapse for Migrants From 4 Countries"},{"text":"But we're much more successful than Asian economies.

It's the administrative bloat, obsession with silver bullet solutions that ignore the fundamentals, and ideological bullshit in red states and deep blue cities that are doing most harm.

I'm not a big fan of Liz Cheney other than what she did on the Jan 6 committee and I'm not a big fan of Dick Cheney. This election is razor close. Do these leftists understand that if we lose then it's over? They're upset about Gaza? Trump will turn that s into a parking lot. If Trump wins forget about any kind of left-wing agenda, even gay marriage may be on the chopping block.

If you truly believe that communist propaganda, you are a lunatic.Yes, it is true that people generally vote their values, but that is not the case here because they do not want illegal aliens to assimilate into American culture because that would make them more independent-minded and support limited government. There is no \\"assimilating into conservative ideology\\" for them, only perpetually fragmented as a politically confused, non-English speaking, left-wing voting bloc. I guess the left does support a type of assimilation, but it is in the direction of being kind of an economically despoiled and politically held hostage group of people.The purpose of the border invasion is for the deep state globalists to finalize their control of America. They will do this by politically manipulating the illegal alien population giving them free housing, education, healthcare, etc, but not giving them too many resources that will make them economically prosperous or compete with the other leftists already in the country in terms of high-skilled jobs. This would give them too much independence which is what they don't want. (I.e. look at the way they treat Asians)And if you think we can just make illegal aliens rich so they won't need to rely on government programs and vote democrat, no, that is not a good idea because it is an unfair redistribution of wealth from American taxpayers to people who don't even belong here. Also, giving free money to get kids to go to rich schools like Harvard is how you get voters even more far left, rofl.By the way, all I've said so far are just referring to non-criminal illegal aliens. As for the tens of thousands of murders and sex offenders who are illegal aliens, they serve an additional purpose which is to condition the native population to gradually normalize crime. Or they use these criminals as propaganda tools to get the native population to surrender gun rights. See what happens in Canada, UK, etc for examples.Illegal aliens have no political connections in America so they will naturally lean towards leftist propaganda even though it ironically goes against many of their values. But all of those free programs in addition to a promise of future citizenship will be enough to get them loyal for a many generations.","title":"I think the Democrats literally have a plan to let illegal immigrants in on purpose to change voting demographics"},{"text":"\\"but he's not dead, just in hiding from the deep state.

Lots of other people say theyre more accurate than anyone thinks. As many say theyre dependable as say theyre flawed. Heres what Ill offer: Data scientist Thomas Miller has crafted a model that appears significantly more accurate than the standard polling model, based on betting markets and historical trends, that says Kamala Harris is most likely to win the election by a margin of 66 electoral votes. Polls ask people who they *want* to win, and betting markets ask who they think *will* win. Polls take groups of 750-1200 voters and skew their data results based on whatever model theyve designed. Millers model is based on a *much* larger data set. Hes accurately predicted several elections, including the 2020 presidential and the Georgia runoffs within pretty narrow margins of error. Theres tons of polls and models out there. How accurate they are remains to be seen. Until Election Day, its all just noise. But if youre looking for someone whos really digging into a *huge* data set looking for an outcome, Millers probably your guy. https://fortune.com/2024/09/18/trump-vs-harris-election-odds-who-will-win/","title":"Biden Issues Dire Warning on Transfer of Power After the Election"},{"text":"I got mine last week, ~140 full-format pages in English only and JUST for the state propositions.

Also you have to put that in perspective of the fact that were talking relative to how much those states are paying in. The blue states have plenty of people on welfare but they also have a lot of rich people who pay a lot in federal taxes.Republican states generally are in the middle of the country while Democratic states dominate the coasts. The coasts and Democratic states have bigger cities which are large economic engines. These states were the first to be colonized by western people and thus have very well established and prestigious universities and have a history of important industries that started there and continue there to this day (ie Wall Street, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, etc.) These Democratic states thus have a lot of high income earners who pay a lot of taxes.So right away you have a higher concentration of 1%ers and even top 10%ers compared to red states. The top 20% pay virtually all of the taxes. In fact in spite of all the left will tell you, with the new Trump tax cuts, in 2020 the bottom 61% paid no taxes. The top 39% pay 100% of federal taxes. With the most progressive tax system in the world, the top end of income earners in the US are vastly disproportionately paying taxes. Therefore often the blue states are net payers of taxes compared to the red states.Like I said, theres a lot more thought that goes into that just casting blanket statements","title":"I think the Democrats literally have a plan to let illegal immigrants in on purpose to change voting demographics"},{"text":"I think a reason why many grass-root activists are so excited this year is because finally we are getting good and consistent investment down-ballot nearly everywhere.

Meeting with foreign associates who paid his family millions, creating over 20 shell companies, and generating 150 suspicious activity reports are not mere business dealings. They are red flags for influence peddling and corruption.Secondly, the argument that Hunter and Jim Biden are free to make money based on their name is a flawed justification for potential wrongdoing. Leveraging a family connection to the President for personal financial gain undermines public trust and creates conflicts of interest.Thirdly, the lack of recommended further action by Republicans doesnt invalidate the investigations findings. Its possible that the committee is gathering evidence for future prosecutions or awaiting more information.Lastly, dismissing the investigation as a Fox News spectacle ignores the credible witnesses, financial records, and suspicious activity reports backing the committees findings.

I honestly believe his intentions were pure, however, he would never have a good career in public relations as his choice of going to Russia did nothing but detract from his credibility.As for Mark Felt, he is anything but a hero. Whether we like it or not, the government, specifically law-enforcement agencies on the federal level, as well as the state and local level operate under an unwritten set of ground rules. At the time of the Watergate break in, political campaigns committing petty crimes against each other, like trying to steal each others campaign material was well known and accepted by law-enforcement. This doesnt make it right, but as was the case with President Kennedys infidelity it was considered out of bounds. Everyone knew this happened on both sides and this is in fact why they did it so often.Mark Felt was one of the top people in the FBI. He was under the impression that President Nixon was going to give him the job of the Directorship of the FBI when Jay Edgar Hoover retired. This would have made him only the second Director of the FBI, and propelled him into a role of prominence on par with that which Hoover held. When Nixon appointed someone else Felt was infuriated. He broke the unwritten rule, and, like a coward, anonymously, reported the break-in to the Washington Post reporters rather than risk his career with the FBI To put this in more understandable terms. I was a police officer. In that role, you become aware of many indiscretions as well as derogatory information that public officials would not want to be made public. An example would be if an officer saw the towns married Mayor frequently at a spot frequented by members of the gay community, or out in the company of another woman on multiple occasions, that information is something that he would keep and hold in confidence. Adultery is still illegal in many states. Imagine now that officer was up for a promotion, didnt get the position and then told the spouse of the politician what he knew about of his indiscretions. Nothing more than petty revenge of someone who didnt get something they wanted. When he got older, and his career was long over Felt believed if he went public, he would be viewed as a national hero, and heralded by the American people. When people actually looked into the background of the story and formed the same view that I hold, he was not in fact viewed as a hero, and his story made for little more than one 24 hour news cycle. He was devastated by this and never recovered.","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"Welp, at least it won't be sanctioned by the US president if Kamala wins.","title":"Biden says he's concerned 2024 election won't be 'peaceful' after Trump, Vance comments"},{"text":"In Minnesota.","title":"Biden suggests Israel may be trying to influence election by refusing to agree to ceasefire"},{"text":"You got it wrong.

Based on what I've read, poll workers are not allowed to hand out water, but can have a self-service water station that voters can leave their place in line to find and use (if they even have one). The fact that external parties can't bring them water is silly. They claim it's some sort of bribe prevention, but voting booths are confidential, so if somebody actually promised to vote for a specific person in exchange for water, they don't have any incentive to actually follow through. Plus most of the activists handing out water are just general pro-voting activists. They aren't trying to pressure people to vote for specific candidates.And even if they did, many have rightfully argued that not allowing them to advocate at polling locations violates free speech. It's like banning pro life activists from standing outside abortion clinics and offering Pregnancy Center services to try to convince people not to abort. Sure many people consider it harassment and wish they wouldn't do that, but in most places they are still allowed due to free speech.Finally, it's easy to defend individual voting restrictions, but when you zoom out and look at their impact overall, it's hard to ignore how low the rates of voter turnout are in these states. What is the explanation for that? That people in red states simply care less about their civic duties, or don't care to be represented in government? GOP strategists have admitted that they prefer lower rates of voter turnout to secure their seats,  so it's hard to trust their motivations for these voting restrictions.","title":"CMV: JD Vances logic on abortion policy during the 10/2/2024 VP debate leads to a pro-choice conclusion."},{"text":"This isn't surprising - everyone should be concerned.

The committees findings reveal that Joe Biden, during his vice presidency, met with foreign associates who paid his family millions of dollars, contradicting his previous denials of involvement. Over 20 shell companies were created to facilitate these transactions, generating over 150 suspicious activity reports. Key witnesses, including Devon Archer, Tony Bobulinski, and Rob Walker, have provided testimony corroborating these dealings. Furthermore, Hunter Bidens art sales, often valued at artificially inflated prices, have raised suspicions of pay-to-play arrangements. The committee has identified payments from oligarchs in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, totaling millions of dollars, which were funneled through entities linked to the Biden family. These findings suggest a disturbing pattern of leveraging Joe Bidens public office for private financial gain, undermining trust in the highest levels of government and warranting further investigation.

But they can detect missiles coming in from every direction at any point in time.\\n* They have no will to save their people that are still hostage.

However, this could very easily spin out into an actual nuclear conflict, unless Israel is absolutely sure they can get everything.Past that, if Israel really goes after Iran, I think they have the ability to destabilize the state.  This might sound good in the short term, but at best you would probably end up with ISIS 2.0, but better trained and armed, as the IRG goes on a Jihad.The whole region really is just a mess, but the one upside is that the new Iranian President seems to be trying to avoid a full on regional war.  The problem is that he's still subservient to the Ayatollah, who want responses.So every time Israel does something the Ayatollah doesn't like, the Iranian President has to figure out a way to respond that makes the religious leader happy, but isn't enough to set off a full scale regional war.This is made worse as it seems Iran's control over it's proxies may be slipping, as their local leaders want to be more aggressive, and the know the Ayatollah won't let their weapon supplies be cut off.So with Hamas apparently unwilling to return to the Cease Fire talks, Israel seeing the current offensive in Lebanon as too good an opportunity to pass up, and Iran trying to balance what it can get away with - Again, I don't see what more the US can be doing right at this moment :S","title":"Biden's Destructive Israel Policy Has Led Us to the Brink of War on Iran"},{"text":"Probably afraid wearing glasses would make him look like a NERD, even though no one would think that.

There are proper channels for individuals with a security clearance to whistleblow. He made very little attempt to follow these first before going public. He did complain internally at Booz Allen, but took it no further than that. Cleared individuals are encouraged to escalate to their congressional representatives if they have serious concerns.2. He fled rather than face trial. If he truly believed what he was doing was right he wouldnt have run. He especially wouldnt have run to China and then Russia.  The first thing any country would do with a wanted criminal former intelligence employee is question them and extract any useful information from them. Russia especially wouldnt give whistleblowers citizenship out of the kindness of their hearts, he had to earn that somehow.3. He caused irreparable harm to US intelligence gathering initiatives abroad. We will likely never learn the full extent of the damage he did, but most of what he leaked was related to our military capabilities, operations, tactics, techniques and procedures.https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=692https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/snowden-leaks-could-cost-military-billions-pentagon-n46426","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"They shouldnt, but magically do because theyre conservatives: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/supreme-courts-abortion-pill-case-exposes-double-standard-standing","title":"Missouri judge blocks Biden student loan forgiveness that was cleared to proceed"},{"text":"Just say \\"the Jews\\" Marge...  you hideous idiot.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene Implies Dems Created Hurricane Helene: They Can Control the Weather"},{"text":"Every accusation is a confession","title":"No, Biden didnt take FEMA relief money to use on migrants  but Trump did"},{"text":"Drones.","title":"Biden says he is concerned about election being peaceful"},{"text":"Guys skin looks the same color of a hotdog left out under a heat lamp for too long.","title":"Trump Is in Panic Modeand Threatening Kamala Harris Over Project 2025"},{"text":"The irony of the MAGA peanut brain in action.","title":"GOP lawmaker yells Go back to where you came from! at Native American Democrat"},{"text":"the world's largest kleptocratic mafia state which routinely violates human rights, especially privacy and freedom of speech, imprisons and murders political opponents, and is actively killing people by the thousands.Russia correctly described","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"Nah they're idiots.

We don't abandon the rule of law because some people have a particular affinity for certain crimes. What he did was illegal, yea, but have you ever heard of the duty to disobey? Its what the military uses to allow disobeying an order, but that order has to be expressly illegal.And that is a *legal defense.* He should 100% go before the court, face his charges, and put all of these defense forward to clear his name. Then there would be no question.Do military members who have a duty to disobey flee to hostile foreign nations and declare their fealty or do they make their defense during the court martial? If your defense is legitimate, then make your defense. Fleeing suggests it isn't. Snowden found something extremely illegal and aimed at the people, so he exposed it.Which he could have done legally. If thats not a hero, then I dont think a hero has ever existed tbh.Heroes don't swear fealty to hostile foreign nations because they're too afraid to defend their position. Now thats not taking into account where he went after the exposure. Im not a big Russia fan, but its not like he had much choice.He had the choice to plead not guilty and win the trial. Or lose the trial and get a pardon or a commutation. Or get the charges dropped or reduced. Or to make plea bargain. Or to get a probation sentence. Fleeing to Russia only made things worse in every imaginable way, in addition to creating a consciousness of guilt. He only harmed his case, his cause, and his credibility by running away from accountability. The government wouldve killed him and you know it lolThis is a baseless claim.

Thats important. But lets not forget that he didnt just stop therehe leaked a ton of other classified info that wasnt directly about U.S. citizens or our domestic surveillance. Some of it involved international intelligence operations, stuff that didnt need to be in the public eye. By dumping all that data, he may have hurt U.S. intelligence efforts in ways that go beyond just protecting privacy rights.**How He Did It:**Sure, he pulled off an impressive feat in sneaking out all that info, but what about the way he bailed to China and then Russia? Its hard to fully trust someones hero status when they end up seeking asylum in countries known for their sketchy human rights records. I mean, he says he didnt give them any classified info, but it still doesnt sit right. Compare that to whistleblowers like Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers), who stayed in the U.S. and faced the music. If Snowden was fully confident in his righteousness, why didnt he stay and defend his actions?**The Results:**Yes, some NSA programs were reformed or shut down, which is a win for civil liberties. But a lot of the big stuff, like FISA Section 702, still exists. Plus, the leaks didnt just stop with the NSAthey included sensitive info that couldve hurt U.S. intelligence abroad. Its not as simple as good guy exposes bad stuff. There were ripple effects, and not all of them were positive.**Why He Did It:**Snowden says he did this to inform the public, and I believe that. He didnt seem to want to hurt the U.S. But the way he handed over so many documents to journalists puts a lot of trust in them to know what should and shouldnt be released. And once that info was out there, it was out of his hands. So, while his goal mightve been to spark a conversation about surveillance, the method came with some serious risks.**Punching Up vs. Punching Down:**No doubt Snowden was going up against one of the most powerful entities in the worldthe U.S. government and its intelligence agencies. That takes guts. But again, a lot of whistleblowers take that stand and then deal with the consequences. Snowden fled and has been living in Russia ever since. Im not saying facing the U.S. government is easy, but part of being a hero means taking responsibility for your actions, and he skipped that part.**In Conclusion:**Look, Snowden did something important by exposing government overreach. But theres a lot of complexity here. He didnt just leak domestic surveillance infohe put out intel that couldve compromised U.S. security globally. And while I get why he didnt want to face the consequences here, fleeing to Russia doesnt exactly scream hero to me.So yeah, Snowden definitely deserves credit for sparking an important debate, but to call him a hero without any reservations? No way.","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"Can't really control what the brainless MAGA morons will do.

He did not give information to hostile governments but to journalists, ensuring journalistic discretion in the release of sensitive data.1. His primary intent WAS to harm US intelligence operations. Regardless of his (non-lawyer) opinion on the legality of the programs in question, he knew exposing them would harm US interests and national security. At BEST he had a reckless disregard for the damage this release would cause.2. Glen Greenwald should be taken with a massive grain of salt here, but regardless of the supposed *intent* he knew the action WOULD cause harm. He *knew* it and did it anyway.3. The last paragraph, and I can't state this emphatically enough, is 100% false. Snowden did NOT \\"carefully select\\" documents. **He took EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY COULD**. And then he **GAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION TO CHINA AND RUSSIA**, literally the two MOST dangerous nation-state actors in cyberspace. Then he gave it all over in bulk to Greenwald and Co. The power of his antagonist(s): Who was the big boss? Was he punching down, or was he punching up?On a scale of \\"not powerful at all\\" to \\"as powerful as they get\\":Snowden went up against the US gov't, its plethora of intelligence agencies and all their networks of influence, the DoJ, the entire executive branch... this has to be \\"as powerful as they get\\".Why does this matter at all? It's entirely irrelevant to your own point. Either what he did was 'right' and moral or it was not.Edward Snowden should be categorized in the same light as Mark Felt (Deep Throat) and Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers).?Neither Felt nor Ellsberg fled to hostile nations and handed over US national secrets in bulk. Ellsberg stood-up, made his case in court, and won. Snowden fled, and not just to anywhere, China and Russia where he then became a Putin apologist.

She's probably glad she's not facing front line duty in Ukraine.

I worked in NSA's Tailored Access Operations during the time the Snowden incident took place. You can choose to believe me on that, or not, but I'm not going to go into any specific details, nor reveal any classified information, nor even give specific details. I put it out there for 2 reasons.1. This was real for me. It wasn't something theoretical I read about, it impacted my work and my co-worker's lives.\\n2. I'm stating up-front I have a bias because of this. \\n3. I know of what I speak (again, not going to offer 'proof' so don't ask). Although my working there shouldn't matter because everything i talk about is open source.&lt;sighOk Fine. Let's do this. What he did: Does \\"what he did\\" represent a heroic feat?Snowden exposed the existence of massive surveillance programs that violated the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.If this were **all** he did, you might have a case, but it's not; not even CLOSE. He stole literally millions of highly classified documents, the vast majority of which had nothing to do with the programs in question and then released them to our adversaries and the world at large.How he did it: Does \\"how he did it\\" represent an *excellence in execution*?Snowden leveraged his admin rights to securely download massive amounts of data, then smuggled it out of NSA facilities by exploiting their relatively low-level security procedures.\\"Securely download\\" is a roundabout way of saying \\"stole\\". He stole them. What he did was scrape *every single* *bit of data* he could gain access to on the 'high side', regardless of what it was, and exfiltrated it. He then fled to China and later Russia (our 2 greatest adversaries in cyberspace) with it. China and Russia copied every single bit of that **unredacted** information on some of the most sensitive programs we have. That is espionage. The only reason it may not legally qualify as \\"treason\\" is because China and Russia aren't officially counted as \\"enemies\\". He then released that information to the press, unredacted. Even by A VERY generous definition of \\"excellence in execution\\" he would have only taken the FISA-related documents and files, but that's not what he did. But even before that, there are whistleblower laws *specifically in place* that he could have utilized for any concerns he had. He did not even attempt to use those methods. In fact, he could have gone directly to any member of Congress (Bernie Sanders for example) with his evidence and he would have been protected. He did not do that either. A rebuttal to my position might bring up the concerns about America's international surveillance and personnel in the field, but holding Snowden responsible for the consequences is akin to blaming journalists for exposing government wrongdoing in war, even if their reporting indirectly affects military operations. Just as we wouldn't hold war correspondents accountable for the consequences of exposing atrocities, Snowden's actions aimed to hold the government accountable for unconstitutional surveillance, not harm personnel in the field.No, it's akin to blaming journalists for revealing ongoing military operations with US personnel downrange, which incidentally is a crime. Remember during the Iraqi invasion when Geraldo, embedded with the US military, started revealing exact military plans for the unit he was with? Remember how bad that was? Now multiply it by 100. I personally know at least one person whose name was on classified reports they authored who had to get security briefings from Counter Intel personnel telling them their name was exposed and there was a list of countries they basically could never visit. And this person wasn't a \\"spy\\". They were an analyst, working in the US, on *entirely legal* *programs (*again, nothing to do with the 702 programs) that got their name leaked and potentially put in danger.That's not to mention all the other *entirely legal, not FISA-at-all-related* **programs** that Snowden burned. It's like someone claiming they are 'whistleblowing' on contracting fraud committed by Lockheed Martin by giving **all** the blueprints and test data of the F-35 to China, Russia, and then the rest of the world.","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"\\"Simply incredible that the Dem nominee has crowds chanting for Dick and Liz Cheney.

This new funding, provided through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, builds on $8.2 billion in grants announced last December for 10 passenger rail projects across the country, including the first high-speed rail projects in our countrys history, as the Biden-Harris Administration continues to fund projects that will deliver the world-class passenger rail service Americans deserve.  \\n...  \\nIn addition to supporting new high-speed rail service in Californias Central Valley and the Brightline West High-Speed Rail project connecting Las Vegas, Nevada, and southern California, FRA is funding upgrades to frequently traveled rail corridors in Virginia, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia, as well as upgrades and capacity expansions at Chicago Union Station in Illinois, one of the Nations busiest rail hubs. In total, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes a historic $66 billion specifically focused on rail projects, the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak. See a map that shows corridors identified for future federal investment here. Eligible projects under the Fed-State National Program include projects that expand or establish new intercity passenger and high-speed rail service, improve the performance of existing service, and/or replace or rehabilitate rail infrastructure. Projects improving intercity passenger rail safety, reliability, performance, including any associated project planning elementssuch as environmental review and final designare all eligible for funding.  \\n...  \\nThanks to funding in President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, FRA announced more than $28 billion in grant awards to nearly 170 rail projects across the country last year. Including todays announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration has now made available more than $6.4 billion this year in infrastructure law funding across multiple grant programs, including the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) Program, Railroad Crossing Elimination Program, and Fed-State Northeast Corridor (NEC) Program. These funds are vital for improving and expanding Americas freight and passenger rail networks, increasing safety in communities across the country, reducing greenhouse emissions, and creating good-paying jobs.  \\n...Statement from FRA Administrator Amit Bose:This additional funding through Fed-State National will further expand intercity passenger and high-speed rail services across the Nation, said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. This funding addresses infrastructure needs, reduces congestion, and expands access to reliable transportation options for people living in underserved regions; all while honoring FRAs commitment to working with states, Tribes, and stakeholders to reshape Americas rail network and lay the foundation for its future.","title":"Investing In America: Biden-Harris Administration Makes More Than $1 Billion in Additional Funding Available to Support Americas Passenger Rail Future"},{"text":"A real alpha male y'all; https://preview.redd.it/48terg67kssd1.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7c885dce628588a623380e9c9c5816ddad4f0a2","title":"WTF"},{"text":"Shes either dumb enough to believe it, or just smart enough to know the dumbasses that vote for her do.

A massive overhaul to government oversight is really the only thing that will and we have not seen that.There are several organizations in the US doing the same kinds of things. The other members of Five Eyes and other allies like Israel are doing the same thing. And guess what, if the UK says \\"hey a spy heard a US citizen saying X\\", it's not the NSA spying on US citizens so that's allowed... good thing we are data-sharing allies through Five Eyes! Further, cases like Room 641A and other contractors and private partners enable the US to \\"spy\\" in ways that aren't really the agency itself spying on anybody. These kinds of data brokering and private contracting enable our data to be sold when the result is the same as if it were acquired by spying.

Distributing information to journalists is arguably worse than directly giving it to adversaries, because at least adversaries have a reason to keep that information secret, rather than journalists who have an incentive to proliferate it as far as possible. There is also no reason to think that \\"journalistic discretion\\" would have anything to do with preserving US security. \\"Affirmed that Snowden's intent was to inform not harm\\"Unless Greenwald (a questionable source in his own right), has information external to Snowden that shows his intent, simply quoting Snowden on his motivations is not sufficient. Contrary to what Snowden might say, he did have other options. Even if he reported the abuses to the NSA ten times (no evidence of a single time), he could have reported it to Congress . [According to the House Intelligence Committee](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/891/1?outputFormat=pdf), Edward Snowden started downloading information months before Clapper's testimony (which he claimed was the motivation) and soon after workplace disagreements unrelated to surveillance. If Clapper's testimony bothered him so much, then how come he didn't also try to testify before congress? Before he started leaking information, he fled to HongKong which had strong ties to CCP intelligence and security agencies, and then he fled to Moscow. According to him this was en route to get to Ecuador where he obtained emergency travel permission for. Someone who is affiliated with intelligence would know that it's useful to misdirect people as to where you are traveling. In fact all of Snowden's actions have an equally or more logical nefarious basis as the innocent ones he claims. I think that it is perfectly reasonable to interpret Snowden's action as espionage, in such a way that he could become a celebrity and make millions of dollars off of speaking fees and book sales.","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"I wish I had the luxury of thinking my vote didn't count.

Not even in just global ways, but, specifically, are there any institutions within the US federal government you find legitimate? NOAA? A true whistleblower under the statutory definitions is someone who brings unlawful conduct to the attention to the people who can reign that in under the checks and balances of the government, congress. But Snowden didn't do that. Snowden turned it over to journalists, whose jobs are to sell the news for profit.So, the most detailed accounting I've seen was the 2016 House Intelligence Committee report. From there, we can see Snowden was a poor performer and disgruntled employee, he was a serial exaggerator and liar, and he caused tremendous damage to US national security. He used stolen credentials of co-workers for his theft. Namely the 1.3m documents he stole, that were in the hands of foreign adversary, were mostly giving the means and methods of the military, defense, and intelligence programs.It's not hyperbole to say that a 2015 Paris terrorist attack was enabled, in part, because ISIS knew how their electronic communications were being tracked and could evade them. My opinion changes if Snowden acted in the ways that other whisteblowers in the public interest act. They select the documents carefully to be the thing that's in the public interest and made sure they don't hurt national security interests. But he didn't. tl;dr this is a rorschart test on whether you think the House Intelligence Committee's safe harbor for contractors to provide the House with information on unlawful activities is legitimate.","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"Someone will replace him who will have a better delivery than he does.","title":"Trump: Dems Led by Harris, Jack Smith 'Lying' About Jan. 6"},{"text":"\\"When the day comes to hang the last capitalist, they will gladly sell us the rope\\" - VI Lenin (apocryphal)","title":"Dear Liberals:"},{"text":"Consider Blanket Pardons [https://online.ucpress.edu/fsr/article-abstract/33/5/301/117729/Are-Blanket-Pardons-Constitutional?redirectedFrom=fulltext](https://online.ucpress.edu/fsr/article-abstract/33/5/301/117729/Are-Blanket-Pardons-Constitutional?redirectedFrom=fulltext)","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"All theater.

But he released specifics on agents, tools, and procedures used overseas (not 4th amendment violations) against other countries (both allied/hostile).  This put real people in danger both US intelligence agents but also sources assisting them.  Again NOT consistent with only wanting to expose un-constitutional intelligence activities.    Also, the way he released these insured hostile government entities would be aware and able to use the information.  Unlike a Journalist who is looking from the outside.  Snowden had internal knowledge and awareness of how the information could be used to hurt the US.* ResultsMore opinion based, but by exposing some of the methods and not just the results of the collection efforts has caused the US to better hide how they collect under the FISA section 702.  So rather than stop collecting, we have even less accountability.  While some bills have been floated through congress to replace/revise FISA, none have really gotten anywhere and the Government now uses it more than ever.  So Even if Snowden had the best of intentions, the results show we are worse than we were before.* Power of Antagonist FacedFinally, and one of my biggest criticisms of Snowden being a \\"hero\\", is that he didn't face the antagonist.  You've compared it to what journalist have done in the past, but Journalist are not the government and thus are actually going against the entity in order to get information.  Snowden WAS the government.  He was a government agent who took from himself.  He was invited in from the front door and walked out the front door.  That's not facing or competing against anyone.

These include plans for the largest deportation in history C a promise also made by Trump C and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.A key part of Project 2025s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of whats necessary to take control of these bureaucracies, Vought said, And we are working doggedly on that, whether its destroying their agencys notion of independence  theyre independent from the President  whether its bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment  the ability to not spend money  whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former bosss disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position were at, he said. The relationships will be there.

Mike Lawler (R-NY) at least twice in the past month has missed or sidestepped opportunities to condemn racist language in public settings, Politico has learned on the heels of a New York Times report that he wore blackface in college. Three weeks ago, at a forum on combating antisemitism held north of New York City, Lawler spoke almost immediately after a participant used a racial slur for Black people, but he did not address the mans use of the epithet, according to audio reviewed by Politico. Last week, the freshman Republican pivoted to a different topic when far-right talk radio host Sid Rosenberg told him in an interview that Islamophobia and white supremacy do not exist, but Black supremacy does. While neither episode is an example of Lawler himself using racist rhetoric, each may shed light on how he reacts in environments where such language or sentiment may go unchallenged. The endangered House members conduct was thrown into sharper relief Thursday when the Times reported on a nearly 20-year-old photo of Lawler dressed as Michael Jackson with his skin darkened by makeup  an image recalling racist minstrel shows and a practice that has plunged other public figures into scandal. The first-termer told the Times that blackface was the furthest thing from his mind and apologized to anyone taking offense to the photo. He told CNN late Thursday that his costume was an homage to Jackson. The Republican member is locked in a close battle for reelection in New Yorks Hudson Valley against former Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Black Democrat. Their contest is one of about six in New York that could determine which party controls Congress. A political moderate in a swing district, Lawler has been repeatedly tested by Donald Trumps conduct and rhetoric  and has stood up to his partys leader in some instances. In one example, he recently called on his GOP colleagues to cease spreading baseless rumors about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.\\nLawler was part of the Sept. 13 roundtable in Chappaqua where a participant sought to make the case that antisemitism goes unchecked on college campuses. The man said, if a bunch of white boys wanted to start a Klan membership at Columbia University, set up chants and started chanting, Lynch the ns that such activity would not be allowed for longer than 30 seconds. After a female participant appeared to agree, Lawler responded, not by directly addressing the racist comment, but by offering a general recollection of a visit he made to Columbia, which was home to pro-Palestinian encampments. Lawler was a guest more recently on the talk radio show, Sid &amp; Friends in the Morning, when the host argued, Its kind of like Islamophobia, its nice to say, but it does not exist. They want to kill Jews, not Muslims. Its kind of like white supremacy, it doesnt exist. Blacks, yes, but not white supremacy. The member of Congress chose not to engage or call Rosenberg out. Instead, he focused on the topic at hand, which was his bill to grant presidential candidates the same Secret Service protection as presidents in office. Lawlers team responded by noting that Jones, his Democratic challenger, has made racially charged remarks. As a House member, Jones accused the GOP of white supremacist politics. In 2021, he called ICE a racist institution. Let me get this straight: Politico wants our campaign to answer for inappropriate things other people said in Congressman Lawlers presence, but it is simultaneously unwilling to cover and analyze the dozens of instances where Mondaire Jones himself has personally used racially divisive, slanderous, and hyperbolic rhetoric to attack police, border patrol agents, and people with whom he has political differences? Lawlers campaign spokesperson Chris Russell asked. Thanks, but well pass.","title":"Mike Lawler is under fire for using blackface.

What was revealed about violations of the privacy of citizens does not outweigh the massive risks that were incurred for US troops, informants and allies.  He also leaked information about how the NSA was planning on improving their network security, which really hurts our ability to keep sensitive national security information safe from foreign adversaries.Second, there was no attempt by Snowden to raise concerns about the violation of privacy rights with the sorts of people both within and outside the NSA that could have addressed those concerns without the need for a massive, dangerous leak.  Typically, whistleblowers understand that the entire US government is not a monolith and know how to identify the right people within the government that will both share their concerns, and also be in a position to act on those concerns in an efficacious way.  Whistleblowers would only leak as a last resort,  for Snowden this didn't seem like a last resort at all.Which leads into my third point: it really seems like there were personal and professional motivations for Snowden's leak.  The House Intelligence Committee investigation found that he was an extremely contentious and uncooperative person with big ambitions that he was unable to realize.  He was always feuding with his immediate supervisors and going over their heads to higher-ups in an inappropriate manner.  On its own, being a difficult employee / contractor isn't necessarily conclusive of anything, but combined with the fact that he didn't really whistleblow properly and went straight for a massive leak seems to imply that maybe there was some degree of spite behind his actions.","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"No Trump supporters on IG famously","title":"Democrats censoring everything is getting out of hand."},{"text":"Legally uh oh scary.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are asking Chief Justice John Roberts to answer a series of questions about his awareness of an upside-down American flag that flew over Justice Samuel Alitos home. Citing reporting from The New York Times, the letter from the two Democrats on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee asks Roberts why Alito was bumped from drafting an opinion on a case, Fischer v. U.S., that ultimately determined prosecutors had erred in indicting numerous Jan. 6, 2021, defendants on charges related to obstructing an official proceeding. Alito had been set to handle writing the opinion, but Roberts took over four days after the Times revealed a flag associated with Trumps efforts to block the transfer of power was flown outside Alitos Virginia home. Alito said his wife had raised the flag because of a dispute with a neighbor. Your decision suggests that you recognized that Justice Alitos partisan ideological activity called into question his impartiality with regard to the Fischer matter, Raskin, who is the committees ranking member, and Ocasio-Cortez wrote in a letter obtained by The Hill. Yet, Justice Alito, like Justice Clarence Thomas, whose own ties to the Stop the Steal movement are well established, was allowed to participate in the Fischer case, in violation of the Courts institutional commitment to the principle that a Justice must disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the Justices impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' The court did not immediately respond to request for comment. The letter, sent just ahead of the courts new term, asks Roberts to answer a series of questions about the episode, including to provide his rationale for bumping Alito from drafting the opinion and whether he discussed the move with any other justices. It also asks Roberts when he became aware that Alito flew the inverted flag at his home as well as another raised at his New Jersey vacation home C an Appeal to Heaven flag that has also been associated with Jan. 6. The letter also asks questions about Thomas, whose wife contacted White House and other officials ahead of the Jan. 6 certification of President Bidens electoral victory. The lawmakers ask Roberts to disclose whether he spoke to either justice about the matter, including whether they should recuse themselves. By taking the half measure of replacing him as the opinions author, instead of requiring him, as well as Justice Thomas, to recuse wholly from the matter, you allowed the Court to violate and defy federal law, the Constitution, and its own Code of Conduct, they wrote. The notion that individual Justices can decide for themselves whether their own conduct violates the Constitution, federal law, or the Courts Code of Conduct is untenable in our Republic and clearly violates the fundamental and original principle of due process that no man can be a judge in his own case. Raskin and Ocasio-Cortez previously asked the court and the Judicial Conference to weigh in on Thomass acceptance of gifts and luxurious trips. But the duo got only a short reply from Robertss attorney. The Judicial Conference, which was established in order to provide guidance to and coordination among the lower federal courts, cannot review a Justices inherently judicial decision whether to recuse in a case, Judge Robert Dow, counselor to the chief justice, wrote in a July 12 letter. That would place lower federal court judges in the position of supervising the Justices, contrary to the Constitutions command there be one supreme court.The masks are all the way off at this point.","title":"Raskin, Ocasio-Cortez demand answers from Roberts on Alito, Thomas actions"},{"text":"\\"But but but January 6th.

The author argues that without privacy, humans cannot experiment to evolve our understanding of morality. He sites things such as gay rights and legalized marijuana as (very recent) examples. One of my favorite parts, \\"We dont yet know which subversive ideas and illegal acts of today will become political causes and positive social change tomorrow, but theyre around. And they require privacy to germinate. Take away that privacy, and well have a much harder time breaking down our inherited moral assumptions.\\"If the US federal government had the kind of surveillance systems it has today back in the 50's, I can guarantee you we wouldn't have gay rights or legal weed today. Why? Because surveillance causes us to  censor ourselves! If everyone was under strict surveillance throughout the 20th century then I imagine we would see that gay people simply wouldn't exist in our communities. Take away that surveillance and suddenly they exist! It's almost as if people don't feel they can truly express themselves when they're being observed 24/7 (it often may not even be due to a fear of consequence... just the knowledge that the observer is there changes how we act in private).Sure, you may *think* that you have nothing to hide... but I promise you that your subconscious is not immune to the influence of the powers-that-be. The knowledge that these systems exist are causing you to self-censor. If you really believe that you are immune then I'm afraid you need a lot more education than the importance of privacy. I'll end with quoting the final paragraph from the link above:\\"Privacy makes all of this possible. Privacy encourages social progress by giving the few room to experiment free from the watchful eye of the many.

These investments from the Biden-Harris Administrations Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are creating good-paying jobs building roads, bridges, and tunnel projects across all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and helping states chip away at infrastructure needs that have gone unaddressed due to lack of funding.  \\n...  \\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made the single largest dedicated investment in American transportation infrastructure since the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and 1960s. The fourth year of funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $62 billion in funding for Fiscal Year 2025 C an increase of $18.8 billion in formula programs compared to Fiscal Year 2021, the last fiscal year before the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was implemented. This funding is distributed annually by FHWA based on Congressionally mandated formulas. [Learn more about the impact of President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law by the numbers.](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-09/BIL.pdf)  \\n...  \\nCongress authorizes the Federal-aid Highway Program funds periodically through multi-year laws to assist States in construction, and improvement of highways and bridges on eligible Federal-aid routes. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law created both new programs and expanded existing programs within the Federal-aid Highway Program.  \\n...The allocation list of funds can be found in a link at the end of the press release. Statement from U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg:With over 60,000 projects funded through our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we continue to deliver on the decades-long promise to invest in American infrastructure, said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The $62 billion the Biden-Harris administration announced today will help states and communities continue to rebuild roads and bridges, implement new and innovative transportation solutions, strengthen our supply chains, and create good-paying jobs nationwide.Statement from Acting Federal Highway Administrator Kristin White:The Biden Harris Administrations Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed into law less than three years ago, and yet we are in the midst of an infrastructure decade celebrating historic funding investments to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, said Acting Federal Highway Administrator Kristin White. These investments keep Americans safer, promote efficiency, advance our climate goals, and spur technological innovation. This funding also creates good-paying, high-skilled jobs and helps to reconnect communities, improving the lives of every American.&amp;nbsp;Check out [Invest.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) for an overview of current private and public projects.

I acknowledge that union members have diverse political views, and no candidate is entitled to someone's vote but must earn in. However, I don't understand why the firefighters union didn't endorse Kamala Harris.Let's discuss Trump and Vance's records on labor and workers' rights. A while back, Trump expressed on X (Twitter) that he [supports firing workers who go on strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-and-musk-discussed-firing-striking-workers-the-uaw-is-now-seeking-an-nlrb-investigation). Additionally, [he doesn't support overtime pay and would pay \\"other people\\" to avoid paying it.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iKYgSTbIn5M) Might I add that JD Vance wrote the foreword for Project 2025, which seeks to abolish public sector unions, undermine worker protections, eliminate child labor protections, and promotes converting workers into independent contractors. Trump also issued executive orders against unions during his presidency. Use Control + F, type \\"Union,\\" and see what's written [here](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf).The firefighters union is voting against their own interests, which begs the question: Why? Are they misinformed about the issues? Is inflation so high that it supersedes Trump's stances on labor and workers' rights? Have our social media algorithms gotten so bad that we live in two different realities? Are they refusing to endorse Kamala because she's a woman?There is one presidential candidate who supports labor and workers' rights and one who doesn't. In my eyes, the choice is clear.","title":"Firefighters union wont endorse in Trump-Harris race"},{"text":"The courts decision in the methane case means that an Environmental Protection Agency regulation that was finalized in March and is intended to cut methane emissions by?[up to 80 percent](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-12/key-things-to-know-about-epas-final-rule-for-oil-and-natural-gas-operations.fact-sheet.pdf)?over the next 14 years will remain in effect.Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat once emitted into the atmosphere, hence contributing to global warming.","title":"Supreme Court declines to block Biden rules on planet-warming methane and toxic mercury emissions"},{"text":"I think NC is gone .
