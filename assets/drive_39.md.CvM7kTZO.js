I personally did a lot of maturing in my 30s thanks to being exposed to what is actually abusive to others despite what appears to be good intentions that actually have inapppropriate underlying assumptions (eg I would often \\"help\\" people who hadn't asked and give unsolicited feedback that I truly believed would be helpful. The impulsivity to say and do these things served to make me an invaluable consultant but I cringe now to think how it really came across.)?\\nWhat's more, I think that people who are new to the idea of boundaries, like I was, are often mistaken about where their own boundaries ought to be in addition to what they ought to expect from others' behavior and how to create some distance from behavior that is both uncomfortable and inappropriate. We also must understand that our roles and activities in society will indeed make us bump into things that are uncomfortable but honestly the only way forward, and fully appropriate. So I see this as an issue of maturity. And while I deeply appreciate that some people will never mature because they refuse to do the required introspection, I think there are people out there who benefit from the nuanced conversations about who they might want to be in the world.?\\nThat isn't to say that sometimes or all the time with some people, what feels like abuse really is abuse, and the only tools to deal with that problem once accurately identified are very different from tools to deal with a misunderstanding, miscommunication, or disagreement. I think we all have to make mistakes in order to have useful fodder for reflection and I'm OK both being wrong and helping someone else figure out what's wrong and right, or close.","title":"CMV: narcissistic abuse is not a helpful term and should be retired from use"},{"text":"screw this goosestepping fascist.

What's the problem there? Why should extra voting power be attached to the land? What makes the land on one side of a state line more valuable *in national elections* than the land on the other side of the line? And why should the value of my vote, as the same person, change depending on where I lay my head? We still always only have exactly one President at a time. And, in order to give some people extra power, it necessarily must come at someone else's expense. It's not mathematically possible for me to take more than half a pie while also leaving half for you. It's zero sum.Also, abolishing the EC would not change Congress, or the judiciary, or the Constitution (beyond amending it to abolish the EC), so all these parade of horribles you're listing off wouldn't actually be possible. Electing the President by NPV doesn't magically turn them into a dictator who no longer needs to pass legislation through Congress, and whose acts are no longer subject to judicial review, and who is no longer bound by the constraints of the Constitution. It wouldn't be possible to tax all 50 states just to fund projects in CA, NY, or TX, because both revenue and appropriations bills have to pass both houses of Congress, and the other 47 states would still have 94 Senators in aggregate, and would still have 319 Representatives. So unless you think 45+ Senators from those states, and 101+ Representative from those states, are going to vote in favor of, it's not going to happen.What you're advocating for is the tyranny of the minority, and the cure is worse than the disease. You seem to think, for example, upsetting 63 million Trump voters by making Clinton the President would've been tyranny of the majority, so your solution is, instead, to upset 66 million voters and make Trump the President. If 63 million upset Americans is too many, then 66 million is even worse. This is an inescapable fact. And if you're willing to upset the many to please the few, then why not upset the 63 Trump voters as well and make Stein the President? Why not upset 136,669,236 voters and make *me* President instead?","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"Israelis know we will help them be safe and even they sick of Bibis shit  and I think they have already signaled this so the administration needs to stop","title":"Bernie Sanders preparing resolutions to block $20B in US arms sales to Israel"},{"text":"Wow thanks for letting me know, guess I'll stop taking the medications that have drastically improved my life over the past few years","title":"CMV: narcissistic abuse is not a helpful term and should be retired from use"},{"text":"My problem is that I have no time :-(","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"Actually, union leaderships are mostly on the left.

The idea that all people with NPD are abusive or that theyre all abusive in the exact same way is just demonstrably not true.  the victims well-being takes precedenceI agree, but I dont think the term narcissistic abuse is helpful for victims either. It makes it easier for a victim to sympathise with their abuser because it centres their mental illness (which they are a victim of) rather than their problematic behaviour (which they are the perpetrator of). Although not part of the CMV, I think you should be careful about buying into the information about narcissistic abuse thats out there.

Her daughter did not develop an eating disorder, but it was not due to restricting one type of media. It was due to educating her on the causes of eating disorders and such.

Narcissistic abuse is specifically the patterns of abuse that emerge when the abuser has a high degree of narcissistic personality characteristics and/or narcissistic personality disorder.  These patterns are meaningfully different from how abuse might manifest from an abuser with other personality traits or disorders, such as paranoia or antisociality.  2.  Any term can be misapplied, that doesn't necessarily mean the term is poorly defined.  It sounds like you are able to spot when people are misapplying the term by using it to describe normal interpersonal conflicts.  If you can spot this, it means there is no problem with how the term is defined.3.  The inherent difficulty with narcissistic personality disorder is that the people who suffer from it usually never seek help precisely because their symptoms prevent them from doing so.  Specifically, their symptoms severely limit their capacity for self-reflection and self-criticism.  Most of our understanding of the disorder doesn't come from administering treatments to those who have the condition, but instead from those people's abuse victims.  Even if narcissism wasn't stigmatized, narcissists would still be blind to it.4.  Psychotherapy and medication can help treat people with NPD, the real challenge is getting them to recognize their own condition and commit to treatment, as described in 3 above.  But if you can get to the point of acknowledgment, usually the commitment to treatment logically follows.  I would imagine this often plays out as an ultimatum to continue the relationship: \\"NPD isn't an excuse, start therapy or we're breaking up, or I'm kicking you out of my house, etc.\\"5.  Again, I think you are just blaming the term and the discipline of psychology for people that misapply or misunderstand the term / psychology.  People can self-diagnose any condition, but professionals know how to distinguish between different conditions or spot when multiple conditions are involved.6.  Empathizing with an abuser isn't inherently bad, it's only bad when it leads to enabling and an unwillingness to enforce boundaries.  Like you said in your #3, it is a real condition and people suffer from it.  I think it is really good for an abuse victim to either say \\"get treated or our relationship is over\\" - or, \\"our relationship is over and it is because you have this condition, please get help.\\"7.  Yes, there are other terms that describe more specific behaviors that fall under the umbrella of narcissistic abuse.  This doesn't change the fact that it is useful to describe the specific patterns of abuse that come from people with NPD.","title":"CMV: narcissistic abuse is not a helpful term and should be retired from use"},{"text":"Oh look, another blatant lie by Trump.

You're are defining what is demeaning to all women. The content of porn is only demeaning if they see it as such. Before internet porn there was cable TV porn. Before that Sex movies in adult theaters. Before that 16mm movies shared about. Every generation of women likely have a story of what inexperience men tried.2. Sex isn't love. Sex is reproduction. Porn isn't about love. Porn is about lustful desires to reproduce. Porn is not educational about building a healthy relationship. What is romantic to one couple can be very different to another.3. The majority of media promotes unattainable standards in beauty or ability. Porn is essential a form of entertainment just like a TV Doctor show or Marvel Movie. If anything porn gives couples ideas of something new to try. We should note that porn is more inclusive than other forms of media. Porn has accepted other races, sexual orientations, and people who do not fit into historical gender norms for much longer than other media. Porn allows people to explore their fetishes and their own sexuality.4. I think it's fair to say the same about other forms of media as well. The industry enforces that actors have agents and managers who take income from their clients work regardless of how much that agent or manager actually helped in getting the client the role. Look how many child actors were abused at Nickelodeon under one show producer. Look what one Hollywood producer did to his contracted actresses.5. There are many forms of addiction and how it manifests is multi-factored. A guy who drinks beer a lot will likely move to liquor if their only goal was to be drunk. Secondly, how people date now versus a theoretical then is hard to quantify. Before the dating apps and certainly before Covid, young people were more likely to visit a third place (by definition a place outside of work/school and the home). The concept of \\"why even look for a mate\\" extends to both sexes. I would argue that social media outside of porn has had a larger role in social ineptitude. Dating apps make each person aware that they need to promote why they are a good pick. Dating Apps have replaced the social structure of just walking up to strangers. It's nearly a faux pas to ask a stranger to a date. As anecdotal evidence, a dating app was how my wife and I met. Third point, magazine porn was social accepted but only after decades of being called smut. The argument that 'gentleman magazines' were better than today's internet porn is a reach as porn movies have been part of the culture growing at the same time as magazines. Movies like Deep Throat became well known even if unwatched. Cable porn was soon available as the theaters closed. Internet porn replaced cable TV porn. Porn just evolved with the technology available. Final point, we are in the middle of a societal evolution, with changing of social constructs, and the perception of what being a person be it he, she, they, them actually is.","title":"CMV: Hardcore porn is overall bad for society (especially with how it affects straight men's treatment of/attitude towards women)"},{"text":"I fucking hate the fact that the far-right have been allowed to claim patriotism.","title":"Kamala Harris Framed Climate Action as a Patriotic Duty.

The lack of empathy, need for control, lack of accountability, love bombing and discarding, only being valued for how you can benefit the narcissist, being used as ego supply, the rage, the entitlement etc are characteristic behaviors of narcissism. Many of their psychological defenses cause abuse. The abuse and the disorder is thus very hard to separate. Not everyone with NPD is abusive, but certain presenting symptoms lead to abuse. The experience you have dating someone with this disorder is unique from other forms of abuse and its real victims deserve to be validated. Its very different being abused by someone who can feel empathy and someone who cannot. Interacting with someone who is pathologically entitled is different than someone with a bit of affluenza or privilege. The blind rage you see in narcissism is terrifying. The accusations, belittling, etc is its own breed. The complete lack of care and consideration and systemic emotional and psychological abuse is really damaging. It takes years of psychological safety for a victims nervous system to regulate after that kind of abuse. The narcissist truly believes the lies they tell you and themselves. They are incredibly defensive and deny reality all the time. They make you feel like youre going insane, and that youre just not trying hard enough. Meanwhile, they put on a facade of being the perfect partner to all your friends. They isolate you, make you dependent on them, and then pull any support from you and tell you youre asking for too much when requesting the bare minimum. The abuse you face when someone has a diagnosed personality disorder is different than when theyre just kind of shitty. The motivation behind abusing you is ego threat and a perceived necessity for survival in a PD. They are willing to say whatever they need to protect their self concept.They are not in psychosis. They are entirely responsible for their behaviors. *And* their behaviors are symptoms of their personality disorder. Interpersonal problems is part of the diagnostic criteria for this disorder.","title":"CMV: narcissistic abuse is not a helpful term and should be retired from use"},{"text":"And how do we know they are all terrorists?","title":"Why isn't the US condemning Israel's terrorist attack on Lebanon?"},{"text":"Yep","title":"CMV: narcissistic abuse is not a helpful term and should be retired from use"},{"text":"I'm hoping for a Kamala landslide along with the rest of this sub, but I am reminded of an old scam in the stock market industry.How it works is that some wall street pro picks a stock and mails out flyers predicting how it will perform in the future.

However, I believe that the corrected texts are quite faithful to the original style, since even Italians have believed that I write (in Italian) with ChatGPT. Anyway, in that last comment I digressed about the purpose of my presence in this subreddit: it was not relevant to the text. However, I have tried to ask Chat GPT to summarise the text.\\n1. The English Revolution as an antecedent: The English Revolution (1642-1651) lacked the precedents and revolutionary ideologies of later revolutions. It was primarily influenced by Protestantism and conservative values, unlike later revolutions which drew on thinkers such as Rousseau or Marx.\\n2. Religious and conservative roots: Early English revolutionaries saw themselves as defending existing institutions such as religion, liberty and property against the absolutism of Charles I, rather than pushing for radical change. However, some conservative ideologies became revolutionary when creatively interpreted.\\n3. Regicide and royal authority: The execution of Charles I was not just about killing a mortal king, but destroying his political authority. The notion of the king's 'two bodies' (natural and political) was influenced by theological concepts, and public regicide represented a deeper break with the monarchy.\\n4. Influence on later revolutions: The English Revolution set a precedent for future revolutions, such as the French Revolution. Figures such as Cromwell influenced thinkers such as Robespierre and revolutionaries around the world, including American independence leaders and later European nationalists.\\n5. Puritan and Jacobin ideologies: Despite their differences, the Puritans and Jacobins shared some ideals, particularly around morality and virtue. Rousseau, deeply influenced by Calvinism and English republicanism, bridged these movements with his ideas of popular sovereignty and the general will.\\n6. Mazzini and Cromwell: The Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini, influenced by Jacobinism and English ideas, saw Cromwell as a model for his own political activism. Mazzini's ideals also influenced global movements, from European independence struggles to Gandhi's non-violent resistance.\\n7. The global impact of the English Revolution: The legacy of the English Revolution extended beyond Europe, influencing the American Revolution and movements such as Indian independence. Figures such as Lenin, Gandhi and even the founding of the League of Nations were indirectly influenced by the English experience.\\n8. Cromwell's legacy: Cromwell's influence spanned centuries and regions. The American revolutionary John Brown admired Cromwell, and even African American descendants of slaves have adopted his name as a symbol of liberation.\\n9. The European Union and revolutionary ideals The European Union draws in part on the revolutionary ideals of the English Revolution, particularly through the influence of thinkers such as Mazzini and Jacobinism, which emphasised democracy and European unity.\\n10. The ongoing revolutionary process: The essay concludes that the English Revolution set in motion a revolutionary process that has continued throughout history, influencing political and social change throughout the world.","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"Dejoy - \\"mail in voting you say?\\"","title":"Please, not again!"},{"text":"The problem is the DSM diagnoses of \\"mental disorders\\" which are really just scams to get people scam hooked on addictive big pharma pills.

On what grounds do you base that claim? Because narcissistic personality disorder is pretty well studied and accepted, and the abuse patterns that generally come with it are very consistent across relationships involving a person with NPD.Its broad because like most things psychology, one size doesnt fit all. But there are very concrete diagnostic criteria for NPD (and all personality disorders), and not every person with narcissistic traits is a narcissist in the clinical sense. That said, like I mentioned before, the patterns of abuse present in these cases have their distinct features directly stemming from NPD traits.Your issue with mislabeling can really be extrapolated to any psychological disorder and is more telling of society and individuals than it is the label. As for stigma, I agree. A person with NPD shouldnt be disregarded as a lost cause. This is an issue even many professionals commonly battle. That said, when it comes to helping a victim of narcissistic abuse, semantics come last. Whether or not the abuse is narcissistic in nature is secondary, so while its regrettable and harmful overall to mislabel an abuser as narcissistic, the victims well-being takes precedence over the abuser in that scenario.Ive had many NPD traits in the past and even causes what could be called narcissistic abuse and suffered narcissistic abuse fairly recently, after Id undergone years of treatment, self-reflection and change. Had I never learned about what it is, I wouldnt have spotted the same patterns in my ex-partner, who was immensely abusive. But I also wouldnt have ever spotted them in my past behavior. I would never have hit rock bottom, and I would never have reformed/learned real empathy. In essence, I needed to know just what a dirtbag I was, and truly feel just how much hurt I caused, really let the shame set in, in order to stop being one. And I hope the person who I hurt realizes as well that it wasnt their fault, they were just the victim of an unmanaged narcissist. The first step to that realization was the ease of access to information about narcissistic abuse. So anecdotally as well, I think as a label, it serves an incredibly important role.","title":"CMV: narcissistic abuse is not a helpful term and should be retired from use"},{"text":"and realizing that there is no \\"freedom from religion\\" and that that belief is opposed to the first amendmentThe Establishment Clause is the basis for freedom from religion and does not contradict the rest of the First Amendment.Much of the Bill of Rights is a list of things that the government can't do in order to protect individual rights.

People prefer to live in California instead of, say, Wyoming, Idaho, or North or South Dakota. Instead of giving those states extra power to compensate for their relative unpopularity, why don't they make policy changes at the state level to make themselves more popular, so more people want to move there to live, work, and raise families?Once you concentrate a disproportionate amount of power on the two coasts, the rest of the countries voice is meaningless.Also, we're only talking about abolishing the EC. We would still keep Congress, including both the House and Senate. So Wyoming, etc, would still keep their malapportioned two Senators, would still keep however many Representatives they're entitled to under the most recent census and apportionment, and would still have their various state governments.

You're crying that equality is unfair and meaningless, which is absurd.No reason to even try to help them, or be decent, just take from them.So, the reason to help them is because we're all Americans, and at least some of us can do things for each other out of a sense of patriotism, empathy, and comity. Even if you choose not to believe that, they'd still all have their Senators and Representatives, and would have power in Congress to get things for themselves in exchange for confirming nominees, passing a budget, and voting for or against any other legislation.Your entire argument pretends that, without the EC, we'd have a popularly elected autocrat, with no coequal branches of government, no checks and balances, and also that people don't have the ability to move to other states. If Wyomingites would be so put upon by, say, California, as you claim, then they'd be free to move to California where you claim they'd now have political power.

Addiction makes people prioritize something destructive over everything else in their lives. People do stupid things because of it, but ultimately, they still made the choice to start using drugs.That doesnt mean I think drug use and addiction should be punished, as to me addiction is a medical issue that should be treated as such. However, when someone crosses a line, say robbing stores to feed their addiction, they are still responsible for their actions, and theft is theft, no matter the reason behind it.The same logic applies to guns. As you said, \\"People kill people\\" as is oft repeated. When it comes to intentional killings (murder, manslaughter, or otherwise) the responsibility lies with the individual who pulled the trigger. We can debate gun laws, store policies, state regulations, and on the other side you can argue about whether children, those with diminished mental capactiy, or people who are temporarily overcome with something (insanity, extreme emotions, etc) all trying to argue in some way that there is a shared accountability, doing everything to prevent tragedies, but at the end of the day, someone made the decision to use that gun.I believe in personal responsibility above all else. Too many people try to shift the blame or look for external causes, regardless of the subject, but the sole responsibility lies with those involved.The idea of shared accountability is often thrown around in situations like gun control and hot button issues, but its applied selectively and inconsistently, and rarely to those who intend harm. Often blaming others is just scapegoating at worst and finger-pointing at best, and while I do understand the reason why people do this, I also feel it does undermine the personal responsibility in a given situation. To me, this undermines the true essence of justice. Justice means being held to a standard, not diluting responsibility by pointing fingers elsewhere. Lastly, it undermines times where there is actual shared accountability, an example being where many individuals in a company involved in whatever acts we are talking about actually are guilty of something. This and that are very different.","title":"CMV: Hardcore porn is overall bad for society (especially with how it affects straight men's treatment of/attitude towards women)"},{"text":"Im not your buddy, guy!","title":"Ohio Sheriff who told public to write down the address of Harris supporters says those individuals with liberal policies have to accept responsibility for their actions"},{"text":"Since it was about a federal election, I would think the FBI should be paying him a visit and speaking to him about his actions.After they publicly arrest him and make an example of him, of course.

As for the rest, I think you are partly right. The Hussite Wars were also unintentionally triggered by the preaching of the Englishman John Wycliffe, of whom Jan Hus was a great admirer. Some time later, the ideas of Jan Hus inspired Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. Even more interesting in this context is Wat Tyler's revolt, which was triggered by the intervention of a royal official. His attempts to collect unpaid per capita taxes led to a violent confrontation that quickly spread throughout the south-east of the country. A broad spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rebelled in protest, burning court records and opening local prisons. But the causes were not only economic: a few decades earlier, a law had been passed preventing peasants and townspeople from receiving an increase in wages, caused by the decline in the labour force following the Black Death of 1348-1349, and from moving away from their places of residence in search of more favourable working conditions.\\nNot to mention the religious aspect: the raging plague (which had occurred 35 years earlier) had, if I remember rightly, led the peasants to believe that the 'second coming of Christ' was imminent (after the suffering of the plague), which would remove all social distinctions and bring greater equality. Religion was known to have an inherent revolutionary potential: the preacher John Ball (who had also adopted some aspects of Wycliffe's theology, if I am not mistaken) insisted on social equality in his sermons at the time, and was drawn and quartered for his revolutionary sermons after the rebellion failed. Although economic in nature, the rebellion soon made political and social demands, including an end to serfdom and the removal of high officials and royal courts. But here I wanted to refer to modern revolutions not only in terms of the timing of events, but also in terms of the way in which they occurred: for example, it would be difficult to imagine any of these revolutions if we removed the contribution of the press and propaganda (which gradually became more important), just as it would be unthinkable for us today to try to make a revolution in a way that was too different from this.","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"He should be held responsible for his actions.

Race/Culture/Ethnicity are so intertwined, incorrectly or not, that splitting them for the purpose of this conversation isn't really helpful because we know exactly what that name is likely to mean in the real world, so the study reflects reality.  And I think that was the point of having those names in the study.   Your thoughts on the impact of names in general is super interesting, including what most people might find as ridiculous 'white people' names.  They should have controlled for that by adding them to see how much of hiring bias is a hiring manager judging the name.  Same for heavy accents from different areas impacting interviews.  Many of us, including myself, can trend towards a bias of automatically judging a heavy white southern accent as evidence of stupidity, and it's not, of course.  People with the linguistic affectations associated with being gay may be judged consciously or unconsciously as too feminine or... silly.  Also not true, but it's a real thing that happens.   It's also true that much of this conversation and others that are focused on race are really a problem with class-warfare (which supports your point), and race or sexuality or religious identification has been successfully wedged in by the rich to split working folks apart artificially.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"Deport.?","title":"Secret Service Probes Elon Musk Joke About Killing Prez Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris"},{"text":"And what's your point?

From the article:Traditionally, the route to winning the African American vote for Democratic politicians has run through Black churches that are very much like Brownsthat is, ecumenically minded congregations that preach the message of the beloved community and civil rights. The members of these churches are overwhelmingly loyal to the party of Jesse Jackson, Barack Obama, and Biden; 90 percent of Black Methodists, for instance, are Democrats.-For those who were part of the Baby Boom or Silent Generations, the Black Church was a semi-involuntary organization, Nichole Phillips, the director of the Black Church Studies Program at Emory Universitys Candler School of Theology, told me. Black people in the 1950s and 60s, she said, believed that nothing else could equal the Church as a refuge from racial animus and hostility and as a leader in political, religious, legal, educational, [and] social reform.-Younger African Americans face a very different situation today. Although Phillips insists that the prophetic tradition of the Black Church still influences young people, she concedes that they also have a much wider array of options than their parents or grandparents did.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_churchBlack churches primarily arose in the 19th century, during a time when race-based slavery and racial segregation were both commonly practiced in the United States.The Black Church (sometimes termed Black Christianity or African American Christianity) is the faith and body of Christian denominations and congregations in the United States that predominantly minister to, and are also led by African Americans, as well as these churches' collective traditions and members.In many African American communities, the concept of \\"the Church\\" is often seen as being synonymous with the congregation of people who gather to worship, rather than the physical building where the service is held. This distinction reflects a deep cultural emphasis on community and shared spiritual experience.[1] For African Americans, \\"the Church\\" is a dynamic, living body of believers whose collective faith and fellowship are central, regardless of the physical space.The \\"black churches\\" make up \\"the black church\\", just like \\"catholic churches\\" make up the catholic church.

In the sense that if, having invested time and feeling in my view, I simply wanted to change my mind on the subject, I would not be a rational person. It is logical to believe that if a person holds a particular view of things, it is because they believe it to be true or plausible: why else would they hold it? Why should I defend it in a debate if I do not believe it to be true? Of course, this does not exclude the possibility of changing one's mind: it is indeed possible for a person to change his or her view if, after new facts and new reflections on them, he or she is convinced of it and believes it to be close to the truth: he or she does not arbitrarily choose to believe something different from his or her previous view, but recognises that his or her current view is closer to the truth than the one he or she held before. In this sense, too, freedom, to be such, must (also) be the freedom to change the world according to one's own demands. In this sense, virtue (understood in the Greek sense as 'excellence' in a given field) and agency are two sides of the same coin. In fact, in most fields of human knowledge, greater knowledge and competence in a given subject offers the ability to manipulate the subject matter according to our own instances: knowledge is power.\\nThis is why stereotypes can be a problem that limits our freedom: although they are necessary tools for orienting ourselves in reality and making sense of it (otherwise we would be overwhelmed by an enormous amount of information). When this happens (as in the case of racism, for example), we lose direct contact with reality and consequently the possibility of responding to it in a meaningful way. We cannot actively influence reality according to our instances if we are unable to understand it and interact directly with it. It is true that the actions of a person guided only by stereotypes have an impact on the world, but - because he has a distorted perception of reality - these actions can never fully realise his goals and will always miss the mark.?\\nI am afraid that when stereotypes take over reality, our free will - our space in which we can make free and informed choices to change ourselves and the world according to our wishes - is restricted. A person who is guided only by stereotypes has allowed them to overpower reality and, as a result, has reduced his or her own space of freedom. It is true, however, that in order to be free in this sense, it is not enough to be passive and indifferent to the thinking of others, but an active engagement in the search for trial is required (hence my reference to Milton). If my vision corresponds to the truth, then it should necessarily emerge victorious from the confrontation, and if I were really sure that it is true, I should not even feel the need to resort to threats or subterfuge in order to defend it, unless I were afraid of being mistaken, unless I were afraid that the truth I am defending by force and deception is not really the truth underneath. That is why I believe that the firm and uncompromising belief each of us has in the truth is shown by the extent to which each of us is able to allow it to be honestly challenged.?\\nIn this sense, I believe that Milton (I quote him not because of his authority, but because he creates images far more poetic than my own) was right when he said: ?Though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously, by licensing and prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter?

As for the rest, I think you are partly right. The Hussite Wars were also unintentionally triggered by the preaching of the Englishman John Wycliffe, of whom Jan Hus was a great admirer. Some time later, the ideas of Jan Hus inspired Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. Even more interesting in this context is Wat Tyler's revolt, which was triggered by the intervention of a royal official. His attempts to collect unpaid per capita taxes led to a violent confrontation that quickly spread throughout the south-east of the country. A broad spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rebelled in protest, burning court records and opening local prisons. But the causes were not only economic: a few decades earlier, a law had been passed preventing peasants and townspeople from receiving an increase in wages, caused by the decline in the labour force following the Black Death of 1348-1349, and from moving away from their places of residence in search of more favourable working conditions.\\nNot to mention the religious aspect: the raging plague (which had occurred 35 years earlier) had, if I remember rightly, led the peasants to believe that the 'second coming of Christ' was imminent (after the suffering of the plague), which would remove all social distinctions and bring greater equality. Religion was known to have an inherent revolutionary potential: the preacher John Ball (who had also adopted some aspects of Wycliffe's theology, if I am not mistaken) insisted on social equality in his sermons at the time, and was drawn and quartered for his revolutionary sermons after the rebellion failed. Although economic in nature, the rebellion soon made political and social demands, including an end to serfdom and the removal of high officials and royal courts.

This funding would support 47 small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) across the country to implement a wide variety of energy and efficiency projects, including installing onsite solar and heat pumps, improving lighting and heating, and electrifying industrial equipment and fleets. Supported by President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and administered by DOEs Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), the ITAC Implementation Grants program provides up to $300,000 to manufacturers to implement recommendations made by DOE and other qualified energy assessments. The ITAC program supports the Biden-Harris Administrations efforts to lower energy costs, improve efficiency, and reduce harmful emissions, all while supporting small businesses strengthening our domestic manufacturing sector.  \\n...  \\nThe grants announced today will help SMMs, which comprise more than 90% of the nations manufacturing base, leverage federal support and local expertise to identify cost-effective opportunities to improve energy efficiency, increase competitiveness, and reduce emissions. The 47 selections are expected to abate more than 28,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, equivalent to about 115 small businesses annual emissions. To continue supporting U.S. manufacturers, DOE also announced that the ITAC program is open for additional applications, and announced 11 additional entities to provide and coordinate energy assessments across 8 states, greatly expanding access to the ITAC implementation grants.Todays [September 13th] announcements reinforce the Biden-Harris Administrations efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, create good-paying union jobs in industrial communities, support small businesses and entrepreneurs, lower energy costs and strengthen our energy security, advance energy and environmental justice through the Presidents Justice40 Initiative, and meet the Presidents ambitious goal of a net-zero economy by 2050.For more than four decades, the ITAC program, managed by MESC, has provided more than 21,000 energy assessments at SMMs and typically identify more than $150,000 in potential annual energy savings opportunities for every manufacturer. This $9 million investment will leverage an additional $14 million in industry investment to support the 47 grants. Fifteen projects will benefit disadvantaged communities by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and non-greenhouse gas co-pollutants and supporting local jobs, underscoring President Biden and Vice President Harris commitment to ensure that the communities most in need are able to benefit from the transition to a clean energy future. This program supports DOE's work towards advancing the Presidents Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal to deliver 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.Under the Biden-Harris Administration, 162 businesses across 36 states have been selected to receive a combined total of more than $26 million through the ITAC program to implement energy saving improvements, matched by more than $50 million in industry investment. These improvements are expected to save $15.6 million in annual energy savings and abate about 55,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.  \\n...List of recipients for this latest round of funding can be found in a link towards the end of the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:The Biden-Harris Administration is powering a clean energy transition, delivering new manufacturing opportunities throughout the nation, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. DOE is ensuring American leadership in advanced manufacturing by training the next generation of clean energy workers and mitigating upfront costs for small-and-medium sized manufacturers to increase their energy efficiency.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $9 Million to Bolster Clean Domestic Manufacturing and Support Small-and Medium-Sized Businesses"},{"text":"legit thought that was Larry David on the thumbnail for a sec.","title":"Bernie Sanders preparing resolutions to block $20B in US arms sales to Israel"},{"text":"I remember when he met Obama during the 2017 transfer and got all starry eyed and gushed to the press, right after accusing him of wiretapping his campaign.

Williams writes. Today, many of those congregations are shrinking, and church attendance among younger African Americans is dropping. Those who have stopped attending, even if they havent abandoned religious faith, are less likely to identify as Democrats: [https://theatln.tc/eTej1tGz](https://theatln.tc/eTej1tGz)Regardless of their spiritual practices, their lack of participation in the Black Church means that many dont have Black Church members access to Democratic Party networks and traditional commitment to the party, Williams continues. They are less likely than members of historically Black denominations to vote in presidential elections, and when they do vote, they are more likely to identify as independents whose votes cannot be taken for granted.Black churches are also losing potential congregants to white or multiracial churches that tend to be evangelical congregations, often of the Pentecostal or charismatic variety that have provided Donald Trump with his strongest base of evangelical support, Williams writes. Traditionally, Black churches tend to see political action on behalf of civil rights and racial justice as an integral part of their Exodus theology, and many have invited progressive Democratic politicians to deliver campaign messages from their pulpit. But African Americans who attend a nondenominational church or a congregation affiliated with a white evangelical denomination may be more likely to hear a sermon against abortion than to see a Democratic politician in the pulpit.Even when surrounded by white evangelicals who tend to be Republican, African Americans are still highly reluctant to support the GOP, according to research. But younger Black voters who are not members of historically Black denominations are not as loyal to either party as their parents and grandparents might have been, Williams continues, which means that the path to winning the Black vote no longer runs through the church door.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/eTej1tGz](https://theatln.tc/eTej1tGz)","title":"Democrats Cant Rely on the Black Church Anymore"},{"text":"Next, hell endorse her.","title":"Trump quips he wishes Biden hadnt called him: He was so nice to me"},{"text":"Every time I see this type of message,  my statement is the same, \\"doesn't matter,  please vote!\\"   Trump won't care how many votes that Harris gets,  but many other Republicans will.

During the Protectorate, Locke had studied at Oxford, where he remained for some time as a teacher of Greek and rhetoric.

I'm not arguing. So, I don't really want to participate in this if it's a tit-for-tat argument. What you want to get into is the relative importance of John Locke's theories in a manner in which you're building a case. But in a more conversational form, the prompt said that there wasn't any thought leader. Adding in that John Locke's social contract, which provided that the crown itself has a duty to the society itself and is why government forms, was the intellectual justification. Weighing this fact in trying to build a case is a different thing and pushes this conversations in places my commentary and responses to the CMV isn't intended to go. If we are at the place where we're trying to reconstruct the relative importance for every nobel that helped chop off the king's head and install Cromwell then it's a conversation that will go nowhere and I have no desire to speculate. ?In no small part because when the English civil war started John Locke was 10 years oldI think being argumentative, you've missed some of the point. The entire point made was that John Locke's writings gave the intellectual justification - which isn't the same as saying the people doing the revolution relied on the justification on the front end.The entire point I am making is the 1689 was instrumental in people's understanding about whether the English Civil wars and the successor rulers were legitimate.  I am aware the English Civil Wars is a period of time from 1642 to 1651, which people say ended with Cromwell winning.What John Locke helps in transitioning from the Glorious Revolution to being able to transition from the Interregnum period without further violence was the social contract theory.   \\n[https://housedivided.dickinson.edu/sites/teagle/texts/john-locke-second-treatise-on-government-1689/](https://housedivided.dickinson.edu/sites/teagle/texts/john-locke-second-treatise-on-government-1689/)Lastly - I also said in my comments that the Magna Carta was revolutionary and ushered in the idea of a thing called the rule of law and that the king is bound to it. That's the leading thought the english civil wars were relied upon in the front end - and Locke's writings provided legitimacy on the back end. I hope this clarification helps.","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"The popular vote for sure, the electoral college is going to be trickier.I'd like to meet these people voting for democrat senators and governors but then are also voting for Trump","title":"Could there be a Kamala Harris landslide in November?

If we're splitting a pie, the more pie I take, the less pie there is for you. It's zero sum.What is special about Vermonters that they deserve extra say in electing the President? And what is special about Californians that they deserve less say in electing the President? And how can you justify changing one's say, if, for example, a Vermonter moves to California?

Unions are absolutely important for low skill industries where employers have monopsony power over the employees, the employer can afford to lose an employee for a month whereas the employee cannot. The potential loss for the employees ends up being higher so they are forced to take worse deals. Unions even the playing field by making the entire not work, which can actually hurt the employer because they need employees. I am going to mainly focus on food protectionism. In Turkey, It was cheaper to import food from abroad because the currency was valued at the time. This caused local food production to close down and reliance on food imports grew. Then the currencies value went on a nosedive and suddenly, these imported foods ended up a lot more expensive. While this did help restart local food production, it came with the consequence that people, especially the impoverished, couldn't afford food or had to make sacrifices for it. Sometimes it's not the potential cost savings but the potential risk of losing your source that you pay with importing. While I do support free trade, I am cautious about it when talking about food security.","title":"Neoliberalism Worked Pretty Well, Actually"},{"text":"Yes and it seems treasonous that isreal has more say in our country than we do...","title":"Why isn't the US condemning Israel's terrorist attack on Lebanon?"},{"text":"I remember having this conversation with a Washingtonian while we were living in Missouri.

It protected noble people, but also had protections to all members of the feudal society. It ushers in the rule of law.The thought leader for the English Revolution was John Locke and the social contract theory. You can trace a straight line from his political theories and the events of the Magna Carta. First of all, the American revolutionaries had drawn on the English experience, at least initially, because of the similarity of their struggle.History teaches the \\"American Revolution\\" like it was a revolution, rather than a reaction. The parts that are glossed over are the first demands.Legally - all of the states were formed via proprietary charters with the king. They were self-governing (but needed subsidies from the crown to operate). The parliament gained more power especially when they chopped off a head, put in Cromwell, then restored a different monarchy to replace Cromwell. Both the King and the colonies were aligned in not wanting parliament to gain more power.But where the King and the colonies differed is the colonies wanted their own parliament. But the last thing the monarchy wants is even more parliaments because monarchies don't like their heads chopped off.From the Albany Congress through the English crown's proclamation of rebellion, the colonies all wanted their own parliament. They also argued parliament trying to legislate over them broke the English constitution. US History usually begins with the Declaration of Independence but they don't really teach that the Crown already issued a proclamation of rebellion AND the second continental congress tried the olive branch petition first.  Where your view is wrong and can be changed is that there wasn't a thought leader that gave the intellectual justification - because it was John Locke's social compact - but I do agree, in part, that the American Revolution's was derivative of English law and not an innovation from scratch.The part that was an innovation from scratch was the executive branch and the central government that wasn't monarchy based.","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"You rock!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 17, 2024 - 49 days until election day!"},{"text":"those are still disastrous, even for people with net worths that high. if she did implement a tax that radical, it could have horrible consequences for the stock market beyond how itd affect the 1%","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"The chances of a Harris landslide are way higher than a Trump landslide.

Bernie Sanders is preparing several resolutions that would stop more than $20 billion in U.S. arms sales to Israel, a longshot effort but the most substantive pushback yet from Congress over the devastation in Gaza ahead of the first year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war. In a letter to Senate colleagues on Wednesday, Sanders said the U.S. cannot be &amp;quot;Complicit in this humanitarian disaster.&amp;quot; The action would force an eventual vote to block the arms sales to Israel, though majority passage is highly unlikely. As the war grinds toward a second year, and with the outcome of President Joe Biden&amp;#039;s efforts to broker a cease-fire deal and hostage release uncertain, the resolutions from Sanders would seek to reign in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&amp;#039;s assault on Gaza.\\n**\\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1fjyeyf/bernie_sanders_preparing_resolutions_to_block_20b/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \\"Version 2.02, ~694037 tl;drs so far.\\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \\"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Sanders**^#1 **war**^#2 **sales**^#3 **Gaza**^#4 **resolution**^#5","title":"Bernie Sanders preparing resolutions to block $20B in US arms sales to Israel"},{"text":"And poor education.

A poll from earlier this year showed Trump leading against Biden 50-38, that is a solid lead but when almost 40% of a state's voters are blue then that is a significant amount of people who shouldn't be discounted. I can't find any recent polls between Harris and Trump but I would be willing to guess it's more along the lines of 47-42 now. The problem in South Carolina is that many Democratic voters believe that the state is firmly red and so there is no point in voting, so it has one of the lowest turn outs in the country. This could be an election with historic turn out in favor of Harris. All that being said, it is highly unlikely that the state flips blue but I think the numbers will be closer than most people seem to think when they think of SC. But yes, SC voters are to blame for Lindsay Graham, which is a definite strike against the state.","title":"South Carolina students oppose Kamala Harris roast featuring far-right host"},{"text":"Oh man, I don't want to spy on people haha.

Thanks for sharing your obvious propaganda for lowbrows though! The video doesn't even mention the aspects of the plan that mean it *will not* effect everyone, which is the only thing that would make it a bad idea.Wake up and realize that there are a lot of people with a lot of money that don't want this to happen. Analyze your sources a bit more. So far you and the other person believing this bs about how it will devastate our economy are referencing a propaganda YouTube cartoon and a personal blog full of blatant misinformation. Have you tried actually researching the proposal and making sense of it yourself? Let me break it down for you.The bill would only apply to those over 100m net worth. Thats about 10000 affected individuals in the US. Their average net worth is 280m. Their average stock holdings are ~20m. So the total projected effect would be 10000  20m  0.25 = 50b. That is roughly 1/1000 of the stock market. Its a drop in the bucket. And thats assuming they sell to cover the tax, which most won't. The tax will also be payable over 9 years intially, and 5 years moving forward. So thats 1/1000 of the stock markets value MAXIMUM that will be lost over a 9 year span. Realistically, probably more like 1/10000 since the vast majority of these people will not need to sell. Now, the real effect it has is making alternative investment options more attractive. The tax advantaged accounts would potentially be less attractive to these individuals since the gains tax supercedes that. So there may be more incentive to move their money around more often, creating a slightly more volatile stock market, but also increasing gdp. It absolutely will not be some catastrophic economic effect since these people make up such a small portion of the population.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"But if our children aren't working,  they might go to school and get exposed to liberal ideas, then they might not start having their own kids at 15.","title":"Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoes JD Vance by sneering at Kamala Harris for not having biological children"},{"text":"And apparently 100% of maga cultist are uneducated, ignorant, gullible.Again;But hey you want red states to continue to lag the world in education and continue to roll around in filth and ignorance go ahead","title":"Trump is a threat to democracy.

It is so filled with half truths and misinformation I have no idea why you bothered linking it. It was clearly not written by an economist or anyone with an actual understanding of the economy (or someone who fact checks what they're saying). I agree with certain points, but the biggest thing it misses is tax avoidance. You can actively use stocks to avoid paying nearly all of your income tax, so raising income taxes does nothing.Example: I made 6 figures last year, and I got money back on my taxes. How? Because everything that wasn't expenses went into a tax advantaged account that I can *loan* against (loans are also untaxable) if I need additional income. I don't feel great about it, but I'm not stupid enough to intentionally disadvantage myself vs my peers. Ideally, neither me nor anyone else would be able to do this. How to solve this problem? Tax the unrealized gains. Sure, if you do that unilaterally it is a terrible idea. But if you do that only on people who you know can afford it--say those with 100m net worth or more like has been proposed--then it actually closes that tax avoidance loophole for those that take advantage of it most. AdditionallyOne because it's a terrible idea (which is why no other nation has ever implemented a tax on unrealized gains),Norway, Switzerland, and Spain all have unrealized gains tax. And it has functioned exceptionally to reduce real world inequality, as well as has produced significantly increased tax revenue. In other words, \\"It's the ELITES bro! They control everything man!\\"Well, in this case the tax would just affect the elites. They don't control *everything*, but it would be naive to think the top 1% does not wield an unproportional amount of power. Political donations will go a long ways. And that's assuming there's no corruption, which there inevitably is in any system (though as a sidenote the American gov is actually one of the less corrupt, though it is commonly thought to be otherwise; however this may be partially because bribery isn't as necessary with the practice of lobbying).That conspiracy theories have become popular doesn't change the fact that they're conspiracy theories.I feel this applies to your argument more than mine.

This is all well and good if you are accepting subjective morality, but when people try to argue objective morality then they get into special pleading territory to excuse the immoral actions of their specific beliefs.

So, if you are able to buy 'Harris wins the Presidency' for 58c it means somebody is willing to sell their 'Trump wins' for 42c. PredictIt has a few other quirks which aren't that important but should be known which are:1) an individual is restricted to max $850 in any single contract (note that markets like the electoral college margin contain multiple contracts) 2) they restrict the maximum number of participants to 5k per contract3) All profits incur a 10% tax + withdrawal of funds incurs and additional 5%So, while I think it provides some value, markets can become distorted to the restrictions on volume (we saw that with crazy swings during the VP pick market).Edit: One other point that I realized I should have added is there is no built in functionality to support advanced trade mechanisms (though I suppose some people have built those capabilities offline). For example, orders can only be placed (like limit orders); however, there are no mechanisms to help hide or stagger orders (e.g., trigger orders, icebergs, etc.).","title":"Could there be a Kamala Harris landslide in November?

They get these answers from Discovery.  So yes, this is memorized, this is performative.  And Harris prepared, as a good lawyer always will.  The question is, why didn't Trump prepare, and is lack of preparation, leading to predictable failure, a good quality in a President?Yes, Harris has changed position on some things.  And that's important.  Trump has lied about 30,000 times in the past decade; and 30,000 position changes is not?  I would be more worried about a politician who didn't pragmatically change positions based on new information.If you pick a position, like fracking, you'll see that yes, Harris has changed position.  Can you guess why?  Maybe it's because we have only about 40-50 years of oil left, and then we're done and it's all gone.  The Biden administration has pushed hard for green industries, creating jobs and clean renewable energy for our future beyond this time.  Plan on having grandkids?  Global warming and contamination of groundwater from fracking will continue to plague our descendants for hundreds of years.  Trump is anti-windmill, anti-green, and has asked the petroleum industry for a billion dollars in exchange for deregulation of the industry and killing green alternatives, which will leave America as a polluted, impoverished desert with no plan \\"B\\" when the oil runs out.

This can lead to an increased risk of erectile dysfunction, which is defined as the inability to get or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. Lower testosterone causes a decrease in libido (sex drive) and can also cause difficulty reaching orgasm during intercourse. Studies have also found that excessive consumption of pornography can lead to delayed ejaculation (DE). DE is defined as when a man takes a long timeor is unable toreach orgasm during sexual activity. Its believed that certain types of porn may desensitize the brain, making it harder for men to become aroused by real-life partners.

Its Proof of Citizenship.

Also there are some forms of ID that have proof of citizenship on them.). Not Drivers licenses or State IDs. Now I would be less opposed to this bill if the bill grandfathered in all prior registrants and went into effect after the elections.But, there is also other things that are quite bad like:The bill allows for a private right of action against an election official who registers an applicant to vote in a federal election who fails to present documentary proof of U.S. citizenship.The bill establishes criminal penalties for certain offenses, including registering an applicant to vote in a federal election who fails to present documentary proof of U.S. citizenship.The first clause makes it so that private citizens may sue election officials for potentially registering a non-citizen. Which can easily turn into SLAPPs and reduce public participation in the election. The second clause punishes election officials who register a non-citizen. Knowingly or not. Deliberately or not. Which would encourage election officials to oppressively strict (think Jim Crow election officials) and could lead to understaffing of election officials as they dont deal with the new potential for lawsuits.Edit: [SAVE Bill](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/552/1) (P.S.

Easter and Christmas were very popular and front center. Even buildings in New York City lit up their buildings with the cross during Easter of 1954. I've been doing a study of the US during the civil war era and even then, communities were so diverse and divisive that what you're saying turns out to be inaccurate even by the 1950s. We're talking about an era when Italians and Greeks weren't considered \\"white enough\\" and Catholics were discriminated against. And that isn't even considering the fact that as a nation of immigrants, America NEVER had a unified cultural front. That was the strength of America, not a weakness. The American experiment was whether a diverse community of people could come together in a single democratic government as opposed to monocultural countries under a monarchySlurs arent nice to say, we get that but it isnt the end of the world if someone does say ityeah I beg to differ. If I heard slurs about my race once or twice in a while (which I do), its not much. If I were to hear them as normal parts of speech the way they were in the 50s, you can bet I'd be feeling oppressed. On the flipside, would it kill people to not use them? Its not, like you said, the end of the world, nor is it tip-toeing around verbal traps to not say the N wordAnd to be honest, I miss the Call of Duty lobbies which was filled with so many slurs that it became comical and legendary in its own right. I still remember the riot shield video and laugh about it to this day.Good for you. Those kinds of lobbies are the reason why I avoided multiplayer games for most of my life. I have better things to do in my life than listen to immature assholes be racist for the sake of edginess. Good riddance.I am a stranger in my own community when illegal migrants barge into shops so they can sell their tamales, blast their mariachi music in the middle of the night, refuse to learn English, and act like an entitled dick. Everything I said is from experience. I want to live in America, not South America. Citizens shouldnt also have to compete against illegal migrants for jobs, resources, housing, or spaceSo said conservatives about EVERY SINGLE migrant group going back a couple hundred years.

I am however an expert in global material sourcing, and what I'm saying is true.  China has things that we cannot get from anywhere else in the world.  It isn't a money thing, or a labor thing, or an infrastructure thing, it's a natural resource thing.  China has products that we literally cannot get anywhere else in the world.  The rest of the countries can't just throw a bunch of money at their production facilities and magically make raw materials appear in their country.  There are no other options for them, period.But back again to the OPs topic, regardless of how it's officially classified, the Chinese tariffs are in fact a burden on US consumers, as they ultimately pay for it, and it's had virtually zero effect on many sectors of China's exports.  I'm sure you can find a few instances where it hurt them in a few small sectors, but by and large it hasn't, and US consumers are paying for it.  Yes, SOME tariffs on Chinese products makes sense.  We've always had tariffs on all Chinese products, and have gone to the extreme with some of them to protect US companies\\\\manufacturers from ultra cheap crap from other countries.  And again, tariffs of any magnitude are passed onto US consumers, and putting a blanket 25% tariff on virtually everything coming in from China, especially the products I'm talking about with virtually zero options to get them elsewhere, is complete nonsense and doesn't affect China at all.  Meanwhile US consumers are footing 100% of the cost, period.   That's all I'll say about it.

Landlords convert rental units to other uses (commercial spaces, condos) since the value of renting the unit is now reduced. 3. landlords have less of an incentive to maintain rental units. Over time, some rental units will be taken off market because they are dilapidated and no longer habitable.We would observe the same kinds of effects by capping home values.The economic consensus on the causes of the housing shortage is basically that we have very strict land-use regulations which restrict housing supply as well as local activism that blocks new construction.

Yet, those people want to add an even greater strain to the system by forcing mothers to have children that they cannot or will not care for.  All without a single concept of what effects this might have and while refusing to vote for changes that might help to curb some of those effects.  It is this part that I like to focus on with them as it really points out that they are pro-birth and not pro-life, or in any way supportive of the issues children face after birth.Here is an incomplete list of problems that might arise, or increase as anti-abortion bills pass or are instituted:1. More mothers that are pregnant will mean increased health care costs.  Republicans propose no increase in public healthcare for expectant mothers.  They have not expanded medicaid/medicare in Tennesse, nor in many red states.  All because they still hate Obama.2. More expectant mothers will mean an increased strain on our hospital system.  Tennessee has 95 counties.  4 of those counties do not have a hospital at all, and hospitals in the state are closing at a higher rate than anywhere in the country.3. Those that have the child and cannot care for the child, or might have some sort of other issue in their life (i.e. addiction) may then either lose the child to the state because of abuse/neglect, or they might just surrender the child to the state.  That increases the strain on the foster care and DCS systems, both of which are overworked and underfunded.4. Those that have the child and cannot afford daycare will have to figure out how to live and care for the child without being able to work.  JD Vance suggests they ask their parents or grandparents to care for the child, but otherwise no real plan to help these people to work and live and care for a child have been proposed.  5. Without being able to work, these people could become homeless.  Tennessee has essentially criminalized homelessness and have all but turned homeless people into a new class of slaves as they can arrest a person for sleeping in a public place and then force them to work as a punishment for the person being homeless.6. Being homeless will likely lead to a parent losing their child to state's custody, at least until the person can find a place to live/stay.  Which leads us back to problem 3, listed above.7. Children who finally get into school may not be able to afford school lunches.  The GOP has regularly shot down attempts at making school lunches free and have even mocked that concept by alleging that it makes these children dependent on the system.  They'd rather have kids starve.8. Children who are hungry are less likely to be able to focus on school work and are more likely to get a poor education.  On top of that, a home life that is financially strained will likely mean that a parent is not home as much and the child is less likely to get educational help from home.  This leads to a less educated population.  Tennessee GOP has regularly attacked public schools and are pushing hard for school vouchers, which would do little to help people that are living paycheck to paycheck and couldn't even get a child to a private school to begin with.9. Poverty and a lack of education are two of the driving forces in criminal activity.  Having more children that are poorly educated and are impoverished will likely lead to those kids getting involved in criminal activity, both as a juvenile and as an adult.  TN juvenile courts are underfunded and can be corrupt.  One juvenile judge was arresting and jailing children as young as 8, most of those incarcerated were black children.10.  A lack of education, especially sexual education, and a lack of parental supervision, both of which are more likely to effect impoverished people is likely to also lead to higher teen pregnancy rates.  Which will compound many of the aforementioned issues and will put the lives of pregnant teens at risk.11. Those that become adults that are impoverished tend to fall into a circle of poverty that is hard to pull out of.  Tennessee and the GOP in general want to strip social safety nets such as welfare, which will make it more difficult for these people to survive and will have an effect on many of these other issues.12. Poverty increases the chance a person will turn to crime (or addiction) and will increase the crime rates in areas.  Tennessee already has an extremely overcrowded jail system and the privately owned prison systems are notoriously corrupt and cruel.I could probably keep going, but you get the idea.  The effects of this resonate deeply and I have yet to see a single anti-abortion person actually address any of these effects, and in the instances where they do address them it is typically in a way that would only make these issues worse.","title":"Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoes JD Vance by sneering at Kamala Harris for not having biological children"},{"text":"If you require that the ID goes to everyone who needs it, Republicans won't support it.

I came out in my 20's, and it was generally accepted by my family, which is positive.  However it wasn't until recently that he learned that he and I grew up in completely different households.  He got to be himself.  He got to discover girls, have relationships, have honest friendships.  The self-doubt he had was normal and universal for his peers.  His new experiences were well-trod spaces.  He could see himself in the stories we read, the movies we watched and the games we played.  Everything written for teens was geared towards him and his peers.  Even the curriculum was about him and what he could expect to experience.  I lived a lie.  I kept secrets.  I was not honest with my friends.  I did not feel certain that I was safe to tell my family.  The media I consumed, if people like me were mentioned at all, was negative.  There were no books, movies or games about going through puberty and finding yourself, as a homosexual.  The curriculum didn't mention people like me.  What I was, was a common insult used by children, teens, adults, friends, celebrities, teachers, siblings and even parents.  I couldn't date who I wanted to.  I couldn't even express idle interest amongst my peers about someone I fancied.  I grew up alone, surrounded by friends and family.  Despite being out to my brother for decades now, it never occurred to him how different my life was from his.  We lived in the same house, went to the same school, had the same parents, even had some of the same friends.  Yet my life couldn't be more different.  Courage is the right word.  I often wonder how many of the unexplained, no-reason \\"they always seemed so happy\\" teen self-ends were sexuality motivated.  It's been a long time since I lived that life, and I've more than moved on.  But I remember it.  This is why we have Pride.  Every homosexual or bisexual that is living freely and proudly went through a battle that their heterosexual counterparts have never experienced.  We all won a personal war before accepting who we are, often times as teens, on top of all the madness that comes with just being a teenager.  Those of us who are out, are the survivors of that battle.  Not all of us made it.    \\nI assume the trans experience is an even larger, harder battle.  They have my sympathies and support.  Courage is definitely the right word.","title":"Joe Biden: Gay people tend to have more courage than most people | \\"Its not what your sexual preference is, its what your intellectual capacity is and what your courage is,\\" the president said."},{"text":" Let's not pretend they think this about menPete Buttigieg was specifically named and slammed by JD Bedbug in his rant about \\"childless\\" people, even though he and his husband have been parents to twins since they were born.","title":"Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoes JD Vance by sneering at Kamala Harris for not having biological children"},{"text":"Anything can happen in the next two months.

How does this restrict supply?","title":"Opinion | Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Tina Smith: Our Solution to the Housing Crisis"},{"text":"The right longs for a time before gun control, when good guys with guns kept society under control, and everyone had the freedom to own a gun. Of course, this time never existed.Literally for many decades after country was founded, able-bodied citizens were required to own firearms and be part of their local millitias.? Police in the US didn't even exist until the mid-1800's, so you are just wrong on this point.  \\nUntil 2008, the second amendment wasnt even understood to protect an individuals right to own a gun.This is just not true, it literally says in the 2nd Amendment \\"the right of the people\\".? It doesn't say \\"the right of the militia\\".? Almost everyone was required to be in the militia back then, so there is no distinction at all.? English citizens were individually allowed to own weapons for a very long time, explicitly so at least by 1689, and America is an extension of English traditions.? The revolutionary war was fought for the colonists to gain the rights they thought they were entitled to as Englishmen. They wouldn't all of a sudden reverse this just to restrict the right to bear arms.Another time the right longs for is a time of morality, when abortions were illegal and divorces werent easy to obtain. The problem is, abortion being immoral is a relatively new construct within the history of humanity.Abortion being immoral is relatively new in the same way slavery is immoral.? In the past, you could only perform an \\"abortion\\" before the quickening, when the mother could first feel the baby moving.? This is because they didn't have ultrasounds (obviously) so they didn't know the baby was necessarily a separate living entity.? The first anti-abortion laws started around 1860.? Abortion was basically illegal everywhere in the US until from the late 19th century until the mid 1960's.? You say this wasn't religious, which in many ways it wasn't, but the religious reasons were implicit and agreed by everybody.? Modern medicine has definitively found that fetuses are distinct human entities with their own distinct DNA, so since the 1960's views have shifted for some people against abortion again.? It isn't just religious. Keep in mind, part of the reason slavery existed as long as it did in the US because black people were not considered human by many people.? It was hard to justify slavery morally if you consider black slaves to be human.? It is the same with abortion, it is hard to justify it if you consider an unborn child to be human, which they are.   \\n  \\nIn regards to marriage, no-fault divorce has objectively been a disaster for families, there is simply no argument against that.? If there is an issue in a marriage, then one or both parties should be at fault.? No-fault divorce means that a marriage agreement is meaningless, and that is exactly how people have treated marriage since then.? I don't know the solution, but no-fault divorce is obviously not the solution.? Families need to stay intact as long as possible for the sake of raising the next generation.  \\n\\"Abortion didnt become controversial until after the fall of Roe v Wade.\\"I don't know how old you are but this is just false on its face, maybe you do not remember.  \\n\\"Another thing conservatives long for is the time before LGBTQ rights. Again, just because you bury something in the sand doesnt mean it doesnt exist. LGBTQ people have always existed.\\"I don't really understand this one.? \\"Before LGBTQ rights\\"?? Every conservative I know believes that every citizen is entitled to the same rights.? None of them say \\"LGBTQ people\\" only just started existing recently.? There is evidence that currently there is a massive social contagion going on causing a huge amount of people to claim to be \\"LGBTQ\\", but not because of any natural reasons but solely for social reasons.? If they were actually \\"LGBTQ\\" we wouldn't expect the number of people identifying that way to go down as they get older, but it does go down, despite more \\"tolerance\\" as time goes on.? It is a phase that teens grow out of, in large part.??Conservatives might personally take issue with these lifestyles because they explicitly are a rejection of the duty of a person to propagate our the traditions of our society to the next generation.  I don't know of any conservatives that are saying adults can't do what they want privately.\\"And finally, pure white America is probably the worst thing they long for. Those good old times before minorities poisoned the blood of America.\\"This is a false strawman.? No conservative I know wants a \\"pure white America\\" with no minorities.? If you actually believe half the country believes this, you need to take a break from Reddit echo chambers and go interact with people in the real world who disagree with you. If you are talking about immigration, then you need to first ask yourself what the purpose of a nation is?? We organize ourselves into a nation to propagate our traditions to future generations and to compete with other nations.? If you bring in too many people of foreign nations at once, then your nation ceases to be the nation that was handed down to you, you erode the culture you have a responsibility to continue. I have a feeling you hate the idea of independent nations, so of course you would think there is nothing great about America being a nation in the first place.? Immigration is fine in manageable numbers, there is nothing wrong with adopting immigrants into our nation.? If immigrants come here with no intention of integrating into the nation, and in effect establish their own separate communities, then the cohesiveness of the nation will be damaged, if none of us have anything in common, why would we have a united nation in the first place?? And if we don't have a united nation, what is to prevent other, bigger, foreign nations from dominating us against our wills in the future?\\"Bottom line, this great America that the MAGA movement longs for has never existed. I believe that to make America great, we have to look forward, not backwards. \\"I will say that it is extreme arrogance to consider everything people did in the past as dumb, and to assume we know better now.?I am assuming you are a teenager, so I can't imagine how you can think you know better than people older than you now or better than the people that built the modern world in our recent past.  You haven't even lived your life yet.  Our country was never perfect, but our great achievements today are the culmination of hundreds and even thousands of years of achievements.? Our country is built on the shoulders of giants, America didn't just pop out of the ground yesterday.? You take so much for granted, the fact that we have so many rights and we live in such abundance is miraculous considering the absolute squalor humanity has been in for 99% of its existence.??In the 1880's America surpassed Britain to become the world's leading steel and manufactured goods producer.? Not long after, America had the highest GDP per capita of any country.? By then America was the most innovative country on earth, I won't list every invention, but I will provide a \\\\[link\\\\]([https://www.inventiongen.com/inventions-made-in-america/](https://www.inventiongen.com/inventions-made-in-america/)).? The end of the 19th century was characterized by explosive economic growth but also protectionist trade policies.? This is why some people call Donald Trump a late-19th century Republican.? By the early 20th century, we had made such progress in increasing productivity that the number of hours people had to work was down as much as 60%.? The growth of our economy is what would eventually allow almost anyone to live decently comfortable lives.? A poor person today definitely lives better than a King did 150 or 200 years ago.? Infant mortality also drastically declined starting in the late 19th century.? The Great Depression was obviously a set-back (history does not always move forward toward \\"progress\\" as you presume).? Post World-War II,? by the 1970's, the United States grew to represent 35% of the entire industrial output of the world. This is when our country was able to start transitioning into a well-educated workforce.? There is no question that America was \\"great\\" back then.? Every country on earth would have admitted that the US was unquestionably the greatest country.? Since the 1970's though, America has obviously been declining.? America's share of global manufacturing output is half of what it was, and significantly less than it was even around the year 2000.? Our GDP growth is half of what it was.? Wage growth has ceased increasing since the 70's.? Our government debt-to-gdp ratio has gone from 35% to 130% or more.? The divorce rate has gone from just above 20% to over 50%.? The out-of-wedlock birth rate has gone from under 5% to more than 40%.? Our violent crime rate is 3 to 4 times higher than it was in the 1960's.??  \\n  \\nMy point is, there is no one decade that conservatives want to go back to.? They just want to go back to a time when America was on top of the world, with the standard of living growing for everybody, and not stagnant or in decline.? They don't want to copy+paste every policy from back then into the modern day, they want to look back to what made is so successful in the first place, what made our country the one that created the modern world, and leave all of our mistakes behind.  This is actually how every society makes progress.  No successful country has ever \\"looked forwards, not backwards\\".  How can you know which way is forwards if you don't look backwards?  How can you know what the correct course of action is if we don't know what worked in the past and what hasn't worked in the past?","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"There's at least a couple major hurdles to SO2 injection:Countries have to [agree to major changes in rainfall patterns](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/22/6135/2022/) (section 4).

To be fair most of the people making the argument you're responding to are also conflating what is and is not \\"scary language,\\" and some of them are doing that hypocritically or in bad faith.So there are two kinds of \\"scary rhetoric.\\" The first is the one from the JD Vance quote about calling people \\"fascist\\" or whatever. A lot of complaints about this stuff fall under the umbrella of \\"there should be more civility/less partisanship is politics.\\" I think those complaints are stupid. But another kind of \\"scary rhetoric\\" is actually inciting people to violence. This tends to happen as a result of much more direct speech, i.e., actually saying or implying people should go out and do something. There's a meaningful difference between Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris a fascist and Donald Trump saying \\"If \\\\[Hillary\\\\] gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dont know.\\" One of these quotes is implying that people should go shoot a political figure, and one is not. And when people criticize \\"scary rhetoric\\" specifically -- and are doing it in good faith, whether or not Vance specifically is -- that's usually the kind of thing they mean.In other words, it's incivility vs. sedition.

The first woman i agreed to choke i GENTLY put my hand on her throat, and asked her immediately if that was too much pressure. She asked for more and more pressure until we found the sweet spot. Eventually i got the hang of it and found the sweet spot for most women that enjoy being dominated. Sometimes they ask for more pressure, and Ill oblige. Never have i choked anyone to the point she lost consciousness, had bruises, said it hurt during or after. Now i enjoy itas long as she enjoys it. My biggest turn on is seeing my partner turned on.Same thing with slapping. Now i know how to do it. If im with a girl who i think likes her man dominant, I will very very gently slap her in the heat of the moment. Most women tend to like some slapping during sex, and i am very open and focused on communication so when they dont i make sure they feel safe to tell me.I dont think either of those things are necessarily violent as long as its consensual and theres solid and open communication. I think i would only call it violent if theres an attempt to harm- either with unwanted pain or physical marks.I think people should embrace what they like and what turns them on, and never be afraid to explore. We should never judge our partner for being open and sharing their desires, and we should make them feel safe to share even if were not ultimately okay with doing it.We only have a small window of time where sex is the most enjoyable, were at our most attractive, we have strong libidos, and we have the abilities and skills to find partners. That window is 16 - 45 for most people, and many get as window as small as 16 - 30 before theyre obese and exhausted.We dont want to waste time figuring out what we like. Men need to figure out what women like as fast as possible, and not get hung up with their shame, fear, and insecurity. Women need to figure out what they like, figure out how their body works and responds, figure out how to orgasm in many cases, and not get hung up with shame, insecurity, fear, or from their past traumas.","title":"CMV: Hardcore porn is overall bad for society (especially with how it affects straight men's treatment of/attitude towards women)"},{"text":"Yep.

I've read enough material about the our amazing fresh water basins to make this comment.If you live near the Great Lakes and all of sudden your property is \\"waterfront\\", that means you are most likely no longer able to live there.The great lakes area is known as the great lakes basin carved out during the Ice Age. Each lake is a sub-basin. Basins are great because they hold a great deal of fresh water that eventually filters out. Basin's are kind of like natural bathtubs, you can fill them with water to hold as reserve, terrible if they are overflowing. If all of a sudden the great lakes were to say \\"flood\\" and you lost an amount of property to those lakes, you would be absolutely screwed and the rivers those basins connect to would flood as well all the way down into the gulf. The man made canals, locks and dams would fail, and you would witness historic level of flooding across the eastern and southern areas of the United States as well as in Canada. The chicago river, the hudson river, the Mississippi River, the Gulf of St. Lawrence all filter out and away from those basins. You, me and everyone else would be in fact screwed, as we don't have a man-made hydrological system in place that could handle that level of flooding. Entire towns and cities, New York City, Chicago, Toronto, Buffalo, Milwaukee, Toledo, Detroit, Cleveland, and the surrounding rural areas could cease to exist and an entire areas of the country would have to be evacuated. Not including southern areas that lie on those riverways. There would be unprecentend rise in water-borne diseases and more importantly a massive loss in the world's food production. Not even if you were a capitalist O&amp;G spewing scumlord would you want this to happen, Natural gas lines would flood, gas refinining plants would fail, power generation would fall to neglible amounts, there would be nothing you could do other than to flee such an event.Imagine Hurricane Katrina, but on a continental prolonged scale.So no it's not in fact a good thing. It would be an ecological castastrophe of such a magnitude that current math is that if such a thing were to happen it would send the entire world into a 20 year depression.

It's especially stupid and dangerous if they're doing it because they think the economy was better. There are ways that you can measure economic performance.  There is plenty of information out there made accessible.  I've done the looking and Trump's economy was not historic before COVID.  Also it is incredibly stupid that people can't factor COVID in.  I don't blame Trump for the economic damage of COVID But I also don't blame Biden for having to recover post-COVID.  So what is stupid is that the numbers don't show a great economy under Trump and the circumstances of the Biden economy show that he's actually done a great job. The next stupid and dangerous thing is this idea that immigration is a real issue.  You can say that there are too many Haitians in Springfield But those people are not illegal immigrants. You can say there's too many dangerous Venezuelans and whatever town that is in Colorado But is that really what's causing the difficulties in your life? No. The reality is that immigrants are being used as scapegoats.  I grew up in a community with a lot of agricultural workers.  They were not out there doing the things that Trump and the Republicans accusing immigrants of doing.  So if this black woman with four children in Pennsylvania thinks that a mass deportation is going to be good for her that's stupid and wrong and dangerous.  And the next stupid wrong and dangerous thing that she has become convinced of no doubt by watching Fox News or being influenced by our enemies on social media is that supporting Ukraine means that we are at war and that if you just let Putin win that means there's peace.  Also what's stupid wrong and dangerous about what this woman believes is that character doesn't matter.  That it doesn't matter that a guy with felony convictions for fraud, who surrounds himself with people who are explicitly white supremacist and people who have spread hateful vile conspiracy theories isn't going to have any negative impacts on your life.  Character matters deeply and a failure to understand that is stupid dangerous and wrong.  So not only is she stupid dangerous and wrong in her views about the economy immigrants and the war in Ukraine But she's failing to factor in the importance of character. I think that we collectively have started to view ourselves more like consumers than citizens.  In the same way that consumers are told you're right and everything needs to be made easy for you and spoon-fed to you and made appealing to you and if you have a complaint then we need to run as fast as we can to fix it. When the reality is that we are citizens and there is an obligation for us to inform ourselves and to think critically about things and to sometimes be told that our beliefs and ideas are stupid wrong and dangerous. We have gone on for too long letting people believe things that are dangerous and dead wrong because we don't want to offend anybody's sensibilities about their voting decisions.

Sex and orientation is inherently a gendered concept for animals with sexual dimorphism. As a general whole, males and females are different and our bodies are preset to develop in different ways. Its completely natural to expect the natural default to be the default. It comes down to the hormones in our brains that make us the animals that we are. In other words, it is natural to see gay or trans people as different and initially think it is weird. Recognize that there is a difference between people.However, bodies and brains are more complex than an innate binary. Deviation should be expected, and humans as a species are intelligent enough to be able to both recognize deviations and decide whether or not they pose any risk to ourselves. If there is no risk, then we should be intelligent enough to show compassion and decide to leave harmless things alone. People with poor eyesight are also biologically different, but we as a people dont ostracize them because we recognize the harmless nature of the deviancy.Long story short, people need to respect the fact that others are different from us. You cant lie or pretend they arent different. They are and thats just a fact. But we should be better than our base instincts and work past those differences. We are animals driven by instinct, but capable of higher thought.","title":"Joe Biden: Gay people tend to have more courage than most people | \\"Its not what your sexual preference is, its what your intellectual capacity is and what your courage is,\\" the president said."},{"text":"Except she doesn't.

Americans believed in funding public infrastructure, and understood that paying taxes was a part of it.  About one third of private sector jobs were unionized, allowing workers to fight for better wages and benefits.  Housing: The Levittown movement was funded by the government and GI bills.  We were able to build a lot of single family homes fast.  This increased the supply of housing and reduced the cost of owning a home.  A family could purchase a house on a single salary.  The HOA movement really started to expand in the 1960s.  Private sectors would build housing and use HOA fees to manage infrastructure in subdivisions.  This saved the government money because they didn't have to use tax payer's money to provide infrastructure.Marriage and family: almost 3% of soldiers died in WW2.  One million American soldiers married foreign women during WW2.  It was estimated that one in seven American women wouldn't find a husband to marry.  This put a lot of pressure on young women to marry fast, and to fit the mold of \\"perfect housewife.\\" Supply and demand was in men's favor, women had to work harder to be in a relationship than men did.  Because GI bills were so good, housing was so cheap, and unions were so strong, a lot of women could afford to stay home with the kids while their husbands worked.  People who are into the \\"tradwife\\" movement don't understand that 1950s housewives were an anomaly in world history, and it was largely due to so many young men dying, and socially progressive government policies.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"You shouldnt have taken the brown acid, man.","title":"What's been going on?

That idea came from the lessons they learned from 2016, that their extremist agenda can be foiled by the everyday people who keep the wheels of government running and don't answer to their every unconstitutional whim. Getting those people out and getting diehard MAGA zealots in is the new radical idea of Project 2025, and it's what makes all the old radical ideas in it much more potentially achievable. Think about how Trump's Supreme Court appointments turned that entity from something that was right-leaning, but still capable of sometimes making impartial decisions, into a blatantly partisan force whose only purpose is pushing the MAGA agenda and protecting Trump. Now imagine if *every single federal government organization* in the entire country had a similar makeover. That's what Project 2025 aims to do. The scariest part about it is, once they attempt it, we're fucked whether they succeed or not. If they do pull it off, then that's the end of \\"government for the people.\\" If they don't pull it off, then they've still fired all the experienced, competent, public-service-minded career government officials from all those vital organizations that were ostensibly built to support the general welfare. If it works, they turn the entire far-reaching machine of the federal government into one big single-minded Trump rally. If it doesn't work (but they still get as far as firing the people that don't toe the party line), then there is no far-reaching machine of the federal government at all anymore. If a far-right president and his cabinet are too incompetent to execute his agenda, that's kind of a good thing (not that there are no repercussions to having an incompetent president, of course). But if the far-right people who are too incompetent to pull of their agenda are filling literally thousands of positions across all the length and breadth of entities that actually make the government work, then you basically just don't have a functioning government at all anymore.","title":"Kamala Harris has neutralized Donald Trump's \\"high-dominance\\" advantage: \\"Its finally occurred to the Democrats that Trump and the Republicans are bullies and cowards who will fold\\""},{"text":"What is the connection between her death and the democratic process?","title":"Republican allies boost longshot candidate Jill Stein as Democrats try to remove her from ballots in battleground states"},{"text":"He is correct again!

While England was colonizing half the world, there were a bunch of English people who vehemently protested their governments atrocities against the colonies.When slavery existed, there were plenty of abolitionists pushing for freedom.

Its just that these writings and records have been actively suppressed because the idea that they were people who did dissent loudly and frequently makes the historical figures in charge look shitty. And thats not ideal for a nationalist bent narrative that frames your country as great and free and democratic. Its not the stuff that gets put in textbooks- instead you get radical activism wildly watered down to be more palatable.The way Helen Keller is portrayed is a great example. She wasnt oh wow this little blind and deaf girl learned to communicate! feel good story - she was a radical socialist and disability activist who was targeted by the government multiple times for her reporting and organizing.I think youre also looking at it from the framework of the oppressor being the moral majority.

Caveat on all this, I am not a lawyer, just doing research. I'm also not a parent.If it's child abuse for parents to not get help for their suicidal child, that implies the parents could be legally punished for it. There's some recent precedent for parents being convicted for not doing enough to stop their kids from committing crimes or violent actions. The big recent case was [in Michigan](https://apnews.com/article/james-crumbley-jennifer-crumbley-oxford-school-shooting-e5888f615c76c3b26153c34dc36d5436) earlier this year, when a high schooler's parents were convicted for not doing enough to stop their kid from doing a school shooting and killing 4 people. This has similar cases, for instance a mom ([also in Michigan](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flynn-mackrell-high-speed-michigan-crash-victim-family-wants-teen-driver-mother-charged/)) last month charged for not doing enough to stop her kid from recklessly driving and killing his friend in a car crash. (To be clear, I haven't fully figured out what my stance is on these.)Obviously those are higher-stakes situations because they involve other people being killed; the ramifications here might be more along the lines of losing custody. I couldn't find much about parents being held culpable for their children committing suicide, although it's been tried with [schools and doctors](https://legal-info.lawyers.com/personal-injury/wrongful-death/whos-legally-liable-when-someone-commits-suicide.html). But the same basic question applies, what is \\"doing enough?\\" What were the signs, and were they as obvious at the time as in hindsight? Were the parents even aware of the signs? What is \\"the necessary care,\\" and what if the care that was supposed to work doesn't work, or the child resists it? What if the parents can't afford that care? How much should parents do to prevent the actual means -- taking away the car keys, getting rid of weapons in the home, etc.? The case you mentioned in another thread is pretty cut and dried -- a kid is suicidal, tells his parents, asks to see a psychologist, and the parents refuse. In real life things are rarely that simple.","title":"CMV: It is child abuse to not get help for a suicidal child (as a parent)."},{"text":"Republicans are favored to flip the Senate.Voters want this.","title":"Republicans block Senate Democrats IVF bill"},{"text":"She's being a useful idiot","title":"AJC poll: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump locked in a tight race in Georgia"},{"text":"Either that or Brittany moves to the center.

I think porn, gets blamed for a lot of stuff it has little to do with... just like video games. Just for example, you mention choking a fair bit. Here's the thing. In my friend circle, the only people who have engaged in choking sex have been weirded out by it as the girl demanded it. They actually had a hard time with it. I'm not going to go into it, but that's a real thing. Don't ask me to psychoanalyze it. So let's not 'blame' porn here for what appears to be something some people want for some reason. Just like let's not blame video games for school shooters.However, I will touch on a part I do agree with. What is 'common' in society will be viewed as more normal. When I first came to Canada over 30 years ago, Canada was actually pretty conservative in retrospect. I was a kid at the time, but Madonna was actually threatened with being banned from performing because her performance was 'lewd'. Then in the 90s, 'gangster rap' was also treated as a public problem. Today, there is little to not public morality.And I just want to point out... that is basically what your post is about. Public/Common morality. Now let's not pretend the past was perfect because in the past, people might have kept a conservative public image; like a priest/rabbi/imam. Meanwhile they're molesting kids in the background. I genuinly don't know where I stand on public morality. At some level, I do think public morality and manners are a good thing. On the other hand, I also know it doesn't mean the society is actually moral.Should we limit 'rebelious' media so people have proper respect for teachers, parents, police?Should we limit media disrespecting men/husbands, so people have a proper respect for men?Should we limit the sexuality of Women like say Muslim countries enforce a dress code, so female sexuality is treated better?And even if we don't 'limit it'. Should we think of it as 'bad'And if you answer to all the above is:\\"of course not. That is silly.

Of course, this time never existed. A lot of the laws the right fear mongers about the left taking away are actually pretty new. Constitutional carry, or publicly carrying a gun without a permit, was only legal in one state, Vermont, just 20 years ago. This is not some right in our nations tradition. Its a right invented by the NRA in recent times, and theyve lobbied hard so that more than half our country now falls under state laws that protect it. Until 2008, the second amendment wasnt even understood to protect an individuals right to own a gun. Rather, it was understood to protect against a government monopoly on guns. This changed with DC v. Heller. All this fear mongering about how our gun rights are eroding just doesnt hold up to scrutiny. Our gun laws have loosened, and our gun culture has expanded, in recent decades.This is incredibly factually ignorant bordering on purposeful historical revisionism. There literally WAS a time before gun control. All laws protecting an individual's freedom to own guns literally only came about to combat draconian gun laws the left were trying to implement.Until 2008, the second amendment wasnt even understood to protect an individuals right to own a gun. This is incredibly false. The Second amendment was understood to protect an individuals right to own a gun on the day it was written. It's literally in the language of its own sentence.Another thing conservatives long for is the time before LGBTQ rights. Again, just because you bury something in the sand doesnt mean it doesnt exist. LGBTQ people have always existed.This is a strawman.And finally, pure white America is probably the worst thing they long for.?This is also a strawman and historically ignorant.

Thats why were introducing the Homes Act, a plan to establish a new, federally backed development authority to finance and build homes in big cities and small towns across America. These homes would be built to last by union workers and then turned over to entities that agree to manage them for permanent affordability: public and tribal housing authorities, cooperatives, tenant unions, community land trusts, nonprofits and local governments.Our housing development authority wouldnt be focused on maximizing profit or returns to shareholders. Rent would be capped at 25 percent of a households adjusted annual gross income. Homes would be set aside for lower-income families in mixed-income buildings and communities. And every home would be built to modern, efficient standards, which would cut residents utility costs. Renters wouldnt have to worry about the prospect of a big corporation buying up the building and evicting everyone. Some could even come together to purchase their buildings outright.To fund social housing construction, our development authority would rely on a combination of congressional spending and Treasury-backed loans, making financing resilient to the volatility of our housing market and the political winds of the annual appropriations process.\\nOur bill would also invest in public housing and repeal the Faircloth Amendment, which prevents the construction of new public housing. Passed in 1998, with the support of both parties, the amendment helped entrench a cycle of stigmatization and disinvestment. Our legislation would reinvest federal money in local public housing authorities to fund the backlog of much-needed repairs.","title":"Opinion | Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Tina Smith: Our Solution to the Housing Crisis"},{"text":"It's your location.

Also, traveling and mixing with people from such diverse backgrounds tends to make people *less* conservative than any baseline they start at, and football teams are very big groups with people and staff from a mix of backgrounds. These effects all would pull the group, in aggregate, to the left, at least a little bit.That said, it is men, and they are highly paid, even those with shorter careers who make the lowest salaries are still earning a mid-high 6-figure income. That will pull people *somewhat* right. The owners are frequently at-odds with the players. Of course the owners are conservative, they are billionaires and predominantly white and male. But this has little impact on the beliefs and views of the players as a whole. Remember the 2020 season, when whole teams were taking a knee during the national anthem in solidarity with black Americans trying to raise awareness of a lack of accountability of police around the country using excess force and unjustified violence against Black people? That was decidedly unpopular with conservatives. So I would agree that the mix of players in the NFL might be *slightly* more conservative than the general population, but the general population is more liberal than it is conservative so it's tough to predict exactly where they all fall.","title":"Brittany Mahomes now questioning her Donald Trump support after bestie Taylor Swift backed Kamala Harris.

Economists lean liberal for a reason.  Democratic Party policy (PAYGO) is more economically sound than any Republican Party policy, even if the Democrats blatantly ignore it all the time.  Republicans make no secret to the fact that [they regularly try to run in the red on purpose to force reckless downsizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast).There MAY be *arguments* that \\"reduce taxes and social programs\\" can fall under \\"fiscal responsibility\\" in some way or another, but it's not an obvious reality, and it's certainly not \\"good for the economy\\" since both tax cuts and reduced social programs have long-term negative effects on virtually all Indicators used to measure it.Nobody is saying that there aren't some economic theories or some cases where a person could argue Republicans are overall better for the economy.

If the government can ban speech as misinformation there's essentially no recourse because if they've misclassified something you can't address it without talking about it, and politicians have incentives to misclassify things that aren't aligned with their agenda.Platforms are different. Platforms can't ban speech universally, just on their platform. People can go on other platforms - competing platforms, smaller platforms, etc. -  and talk about the thing that got banned. If a platform gets too much of a reputation for censoring stuff along the lines of a certain agenda they lose credibility and users will go elsewhere. I think this is why we see some regular cycles of new platforms arising and old ones turning to shit - they get captured by people with agendas that want to control a narrative, overplay their hand, and audiences move from MySpace to Facebook to Twitter to Instagram to TikTok because they're frustrated with what they're allowed to say and how what they say influences how their content gets promoted or buried.That is to say I don't think platforms *should* ban misinformation, but I'm happy to vote with my feet rather than try to force them to allow content they don't want.","title":"CMV: Banning content classified as \\"misinformation\\" is wrong and against free speech"},{"text":"Yeah but he gets to have sex with Carrie-Anne Moss so it's not all bad","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Ive been surprised how quickly Zionist has become this socially accepted insult.

Think about how long it takes to compare sources, read through events, or dig through journal articles in order to counter the outright batshit stuff people say online and in person, then think about how long it would take for someone to come up with list of homophobic, antisemitic, etc lies that they can share around.

That's one small drop in the bucket of progress that we have made in human history. So to me it's strange that some people can't accept or understand how morals were different 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, etc. If I'm being honest most people who don't understand this seem to have main character syndrome and think that they are so special or different that if they were put into any of these time periods where \\"morals were different\\" that they would somehow change the system by themselves.

Up until a hundred years ago this wasn't even really questioned. It was just the natural order of things. This is the way that society evolved, for whatever reason. Porn is the cause of the problem, it is a symptom of the profound sickness which is the treatment of women by men. The truth is that we, men as a gender, are doing better. Men today are more sensitive to women's needs, less inclined to use violence, more respectful of women's consent, and in general treat women better than has been the historical norm.Porn doesn't cause the mistreatment of women. Society evolved in such a way that men were abusive towards women. This key aspect of gender norms is what causes porn to be so misogynist and degrading to women. We're slowly healing, as humanity matures, we embrace rationality, and collectively we better understand the core principles of human decency.","title":"CMV: Hardcore porn is overall bad for society (especially with how it affects straight men's treatment of/attitude towards women)"},{"text":"I'm somewhat sympathetic to conservatives complaining about the regulatory state stifling innovation or unions rent-seeking.Not wholly sympathetic, but I get that overregulation can be a drag on economic dynamism, and that unions can sometimes act contrary to the public good.But when they go into \\"we need to strip the welfare state because it makes people lazy and makes it harder for employees to maximize profits\\" - which they always do - then I'm like fuck off.The welfare state is good.

If you think they were not, please expand on that and I can challenge your view.That aside,  I think you are mis-applying \\"free speech\\" principles to private SM platforms. I have a few problems with that:1. Free Speech only applies to government controlling speech in the public sphere.2. Public \\"news\\" is accountable-ish for the content they publish (libel/slander), the FCC *could* take action if broadcasters intentionally distort the news (but there is a now a separation of what is *opinion, entertainment,* and what is *news*), but if they put it on the internet it becomes murky.3. Most \\"news\\" is now classified at \\"entertainment\\".4. Private SM platforms can regulate content and not run afoul of the 1st Amendment.Misinformation is dangerous, especially if espoused by someone with \\"public trust\\", like an elected official. For example, if a hurricane about to hit Florida, and Gov. DeSantis indicates that it is not bad don't evacuate, and people don't and die... it can lead to an extreme danger to society. Or when sitting legislator indicates that is an extreme danger to the public because immigrants are eating pets. It adds veracity to a claim that you may find silly, but people take seriously.I think you dismiss the danger to the people that take these sort of things seriously. But your point is well taken, care must be observed when considering how to police misinformation in the public discourse. But there should be a strong push for SM platforms to clamp down on it. The people are not *entitled* to post whatever they want on SM. There is no right guaranteeing it. If someone wants to do that there are multiple platforms that do not regulate speech at all (aside from the legal requirements for banning \\"inciting of violence\\").Until such time as we classify the internet as a public good/service and SM platforms as the \\"public sphere\\" they will continue to be private platforms and subject to the rules of the company that owns them. Just like employers, these platforms have a right, and I dare say obligation, to police speech within their confines. If we don't like it, we move to another company.","title":"CMV: Banning content classified as \\"misinformation\\" is wrong and against free speech"},{"text":"Play great, have fun; not in that order.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"\\"Kayfabe\\" Never heard this word before, looked it up it's spot on.
