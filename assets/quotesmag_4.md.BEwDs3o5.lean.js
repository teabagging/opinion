This echoes the infamous statement by Israeli colonizer Jacob: \\"If I don't steal it, someone else is gonna steal it.\\"2. **\\"Each sale needs to be approved by the Israeli Department of Defense\\"** C According to NSO's spokesperson, every transaction involving spyware like Pegasus is overseen by Israels defense authorities. This underscores how the Israeli government directly facilitates and controls the distribution of these tools, granting access to regimes and governments worldwide.3. **Western democracies are complicit too** C The documentary reveals that spyware abuse isnt limited to autocrats and dictators; even Western democracies are leveraging tools like Pegasus to undermine privacy, silence journalists, and target political opponents, showing how pervasive this issue has become.4. **Spyware isnt just in your pocketits on your laptop** C The Israeli company Candiru has also been implicated for its spyware found on laptops, highlighting how advanced surveillance tools are targeting an ever-expanding range of devices.5. **Spy in your pocket** C Pegasus spyware can turn any smartphone into a surveillance device, accessing calls, messages, and even activating cameras and microphones without the users consent. Its a literal spy in your pocket, eroding any sense of digital privacy.6. **Israels central role in global surveillance** C The rise of companies like NSO Group and Candiru, operating under Israel's regulatory oversight, places the country at the epicenter of the global spyware industry. This raises significant questions about its geopolitical motivations and the consequences of exporting such technology.7. **Global reach, local harm** C From silencing dissent to violating human rights, spyware like Pegasus and Candirus tools create widespread harm, illustrating the devastating impact of unregulated surveillance technologies.8. **Unchecked surveillance technology** C The lack of global accountability for these tools enables their misuse, raising concerns about privacy, democracy, and human rights. The Israeli governments approval process ties its national interests to the dissemination of these technologies.9. **The blurred line between security and oppression** C While marketed as tools for combating crime and terrorism, these spyware programs are often used to target innocents and activists, weaponizing the rhetoric of security to justify oppression.These takeaways underscore the significant role Israel plays in this complex and ethically fraught industry, along with the urgent need for international oversight to curb the misuse of advanced surveillance technology.","title":"Surveilled: How Israeli NSO Group's Pegasus Spyware is Redefining Privacy and Threatening Democracy (2024) [01:01:00]"},{"text":"Just pointing out what happened.

Well, what would stop Trump, and any other president afterwards, to declare by edict all of their family is pardoned for their crimes including ones not charged, indicted on, or accused of?

This used to be fairly common.?In fact, large age gap relationships between girls entering fertility (12-16 years old) and men with established careers (30-40 years old) was actually the norm. A less common scenario, was a marriage between two individuals of roughly the same age.\\nIn 2024, we (Americans/westerners) think that such a relationship is rudimentary, inappropriate, and grotesque. And I my opinion is that BOTH scenarios is ok. Culture adapts with the times. If there is one thing I am quite certain of, it is that in 100 years from now society will look back upon the the humans of today and have similar thoughts about our culture and how we treat each other.\\nThe point is that society adapts, and (in my opinion) the best way to make laws that reflect the current values of society is through a democratic voting system.?\\nThis of course leads to the issue of tyranny of the majority.?I will just say our founding fathers were much wiser than we give them credit for. A constitution limiting the power of government serves well to restrict majority rule. The constitution only allows the federal government to do like 7 or 8 things. If the citizens want the government to do more, it must be something so obviously necessary that a huge supermajority of the country must be in agreement on the issue.\\nAll other issues are left to the states. If one particular state has bad laws and is too restrictive/punitive, citizens have the freedom to move to another state. And voting with your feet is the ultimate method of voting.\\nWith that said, I think the Constitution has not been respected at all. In fact, it has mostly been ignored ever since WWII. I do not know what the solution is, or how to effectively reign in government overreach.

President Lincoln pardoned his wifes half-sister who was married to a confederate general, a man who committed literal treason against the United States.

The game is figuring out the best targets because the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has finite resources. Maine: Susan Collins is the incumbent and won despite trailing Biden in 2020. Harris won the state with a similar level of support in 2024North Carolina: Thom Tillis is the incumbent after a tight win in 2020.

Perhaps there are employers doing something awful with this, but in my experiences these jobs primarily exist to benefit those with disabilities, not to get work done. At some programs that employee a ton of folks, they are really set up often as a hybrid of organized activity with supervision and work. In these cases, the alternative is likely to cost money to make sure there is supervision. There are smaller things as well, where a single employee will be hired by a business to do simple tasks. Often times this is just to slightly lessen the burden on existing staff, but not actually necessary and the position could be eliminated. My cousin used to have a job like that at Wegman's (who, at least at the time, did a really great job of supporting folks with intellectual disabilities) where she would clean tables and do other simple tasks but wasn't able to handle things like stocking or certainly running cash register or preparing food or janitorial responsibilities that were more complicated like mopping the floor. She definitely made it easier on folks that would have otherwise had to clean tables and throw away trash along with the rest of their duties, but for her it was like her full effort job. Quite honestly, an teenage or adult employee could often do the work that is being done by half a dozen or more disabled employees at times. Probably some jobs its less, and some its likely far more. I worry that these sorts of programs, which are extremely beneficial for the employees, will either cease to exist or be sized down drastically and unable to serve a larger group. I understand the positive intent and position behind those supporting this, and perhaps it is the right way to go alongside broader changes that improve pay for workers in general, but I think in the short term this is likely to do a lot more harm than good sadly.","title":"Biden moves to end subminimum wages for people with disabilities"},{"text":"Based on Burdick v.

They aren't playing a game. They are at war with free thought and the people's right to choose someone besides republicans.

For 10 people.?\\nJane and her 4 friends think they should get 85 apples while the rest get 15.\\nSusan and her 4 friends think they should get 50 apples while the rest get 50.\\nWhat is fair??\\nShould Jane and Co get 67.5 apples while Susan and Co get 32.5 since that splits the difference? Or should both groups get 50 since obviously Susan's suggestion is naturally more fair??\\nBut would it feel fair to just use one sides proposal while completely ignoring the other?\\nIs it even \\"truly\\" fair? What if Jane and her friends were starving and need more food? Or what if Susan and her friends plan on selling most of their apple instead of eating them??\\nIs fairness solely about equal distributions based on population? Is democracy mainly about the elevation of obviously \\"fair\\" ideas and the removal of obviously \\"unfair\\" ideas?\\n?Or is democracy the battle ground of ideas, where ideas are selected through compromise or the sheer imposing of will?\\nThat was the philosophical considerations.?\\nBut to be more blunt: If (rightly or wrongly) Susan truly feels like her idea is most fair. Should she continue to fight for it, knowing there will be no compromise or the comprise won't be fair? Or should she fight for something more aggressive in hopes the compromise lands about fair??\\nOne could argue Susan can't take that approach as it will force Jane into a more aggressive approach and compromise cannot be reached. Of course I would respond, if either side could unilaterally distribute the apples, comprise was never needed, nor likely to happen. But if not, and an agreement was needed for any apple distribution, both sides are incentivized to come to some agreement, and game theory can help guide both parties to the optimal/equilibrium outcome.?","title":"NC congressman: Republicans stole fairness from the nation in giving GOP a House majority.

The agency will issue a proposed rule Tuesday that would immediately halt the issuance of certificates that allow employers to pay less than minimum wage and institute a three year phaseout period for employers that already hold those certificates.\\nBefore it can take effect, the rule will be subject to a public comment period, possible legal challenges and the scrutiny of the incoming Trump administration.  The public comment period is expected to conclude on Jan. 17, 2025, just days before Donald Trump takes office.

Patting himself on the back for  holding off on pardoning Hunter until now.\\nWithout aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form.What this leaves out is that while almost no one is prosecuted falsely answering \\"no\\" to the question asking whether they are a user of illegal drugs at the time of purchasing a firearm, most people also don't go on to publish a book that sells a million copies where they confess to being a drug user while purchasing a firearm. Also, this is where the right has a point about USA not enforcing the gun laws that it already has on the books.Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions.I'm skeptical that this is entirely true. Hunter pleaded guilty to felony charges. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son C and that is wrong.Yeah not buying this since it was a jury trial.

Beneficiaries include websites of television stations such as Romania TV and Realitatea Plus, as well as extreme right-wing publications and influencers. The investigation aims to establish the mechanism that propelled unknown presidential candidate Calin Georgescu, but also the new political party, POT (Party of Young People), in the recent presidential and parliamentary elections without an open pro-Russian rhetoric that would have reached resistance. AdNow was born in the same London house as a Russian state hacking firm GRU, a firm of a cousin of Vladimir Putin, and other companies with ties to the Kremlin. It was allegedly involved in spreading vaccine misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the shutdown of hundreds of Facebook and Instagram pages under its control.  Many of these narratives have resurfaced in the rhetoric of C?lin Georgescu, the Romanian presidential hopeful, and the far-right POT party C which made it to the Parliament with a score higher than that of the ethnic Hungarian party UDMR. AdNows influence persists, with Romanian websites and social media platforms recording over 440 million impressions in the last month alone from advertisements promoting natural treatments and online scams, Snoop said.

The necessary contracts, including a land lease agreement and a supply contract for the procurement of 155mm ammunition, were signed at a ceremony held on 29 November 2024. The Prime Minister of Lithuania, Ms Ingrida ?imonyt?, the Lithuanian Minister for the Economy and Innovation, Ms Au?rin? Armonaite, and the Lithuanian Minister of National Defence, Mr Laurynas Kas?inas, attended the event. With the start of construction in Baisogala, Lithuania is taking a further step towards strengthening its defence sector. A state-of-the-art production facility, including a shell manufacturing and load assembly pack, is being built in the municipality on an area of around 340 hectares. The facility will begin operations from mid-2026 and, once completed, will be able to produce tens of thousands of 155mm calibre artillery shells per year. 180 million euros are invested directly in Lithuania. Around 150 jobs will be created locally. Local companies and the local economy will be integrated into the value chain. From day one, the dialogue between the Lithuanian Government and Rheinmetall has been based on a mutual understanding of this project's necessity and urgency. I am very pleased that today, this cooperation has enabled the beginning of construction of the artillery ammunition production plant. Our defence needs, the importance of the shortest possible supply chains, and strong allied partnership between Lithuania and Germany underscore the need to maintain the momentum as we continue to work in the same spirit of cooperation, says Ingrida ?imonyt?, Prime Minister of Lithuania. We at Rheinmetall are very grateful for the trust Lithuania has placed in us. It is and remains our aspiration at Rheinmetall to be one of the pillars of national and international security provision. This long-term partnership with Lithuania confirms this once again, says Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall AG. In light of the growing security challenges, we must move beyond words and take concrete steps to strengthen our nations defence capabilities. By fostering large-scale investment projects and enabling local production of weaponry, we not only address national security needs but also reduce our dependence on arms procured from international markets. I have no doubt that Lithuania is moving in the right direction, and it is promising to see global leaders like Rheinmetall choosing to be part of this progress, says Au?rin? Armonait?, the Minister of the Economy and Innovation.  The establishment of the German defense industry company Rheinmetalls ammunition factory in Lithuania is not only significant in the context of the defense industrys development but will also address the needs of our armed forces. It was quite a complex process, but I am pleased and grateful to my colleagues that, through joint efforts, we managed to reach an agreement on this historic and important project for our national security, notes Laurynas Kas?inas, the Minister of Defence. As recently as June 2024, Rheinmetall and the Lithuanian Minister of Economy and Innovation Armonaite signed an agreement regulating the establishment of the German defence company Rheinmetall in Lithuania. The project was granted the status of state significance. As a result, the Lithuanian Centre of Excellence for Ammunition will benefit from special investment and business conditions to speed up the construction of the plant.!ping MATERIEL&amp;EUROPE","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Im not talking about his right to remain silent Im saying he cannot be compelled to speak words if he chooses not to.

I also don't doubt that he probably agonised over the decision, rather than just rubber stamping it.I think anyone up in arms over him \\"lying\\" about it is kidding themselves - either a) he changed his mind, or b) he didn't want to kick off a shitshow in the press by daring to suggest he was thinking about it, while he was thinking about it. If he'd decided to do it ages ago, he would have done it ages ago, if nothing else straight after the election, if he didn't want to make it an election issue. And sitting on this until after the election was absolutely the right call. Anyone with some purity test, clutching their pearls that he might have made this decision a while ago but not wanted to absolutely fuck Harris' chances by tying this around her neck (rightly or wrongly) is the sort of person who likely lost Harris the election by not turning up in the first place.

A provision preventing those people from accessing medical assistance in dying (MAID) had been due to expire in March. Holland said he had introduced legislation to extend that period by three years. Canada legalized MAID in 2016 for people with a terminal illness and expanded it in 2021 to people with incurable, but not terminal, conditions. The procedure, which usually involves an injection, is carried out by medical professionals in the 10 provinces and three northern territories.","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"Go off Jon!

They're people that are showing you tricks where you can't fathom how they do it, the further back you go the more prevalent magic is because people simply couldn't grasp how it works and without a magician telling you how it works, you might never understand it. So you could go to whatever BC and simply pull slight of hand trick, nowadays we start thinking \\"maybe they got it in their sleeves\\" but among most people this is because they previously had such experience or got explained to them otherwise, by a friend for example. But again back in the days this didn't happen, when there was a guy and he showed you a trick that was never seen before then it's magic, simply because you don't know how they do it.You can just use modern examples of it, e.g. David Blaine, he cannot cast magic spells but he's pretty good at illusions and manipulating people, even when someone would explain you his tricks you might not be able to understand it due to how tricky the guy is.Or sword suckers, nowadays we know how it works, these people train their body to be able to push swords down their throat without damaging themselves, the thing is tho there're people who do this who absolutely damage themselves because they're not skillful enough. But back in the days if you were to gulp a blade, you'd probably be named magister of the kingdom or whatever.If you're a person of science, you know that people just use whatever explanation sounds easier to them solely because they cannot understand what's happening, happened before christ and happens nowadays too. So someone's body is sick but eventually heals for \\"no reason whatsoever\\", it must be a miracle. Remember Jesus was a miracle right? Mary getting pregnant \\"without ever having sex\\", she's a \\"virgin\\" and the birth of Jesus is a miracle, but with todays knowledge the most plausible answer to this is that Mary either was unfaithful or got raped and thus impregnated, but in those times cheating can get you killed so instead just lie to save yourself from certain death.See [Deuteronomy 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2022&amp;version=NIV) which I love to quote to point out the nonsense of the bible: 13 If a man takes a wife and, after sleeping with her, dislikes her 14 and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity, 15 then the young womans father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin. 16 Her father will say to the elders, I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. 17 Now he has slandered her and said, I did not find your daughter to be a virgin. But here is the proof of my daughters virginity. Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town, 18 and the elders shall take the man and punish him. 19 They shall fine him a hundred shekels[b] of silver and give them to the young womans father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives. **20 If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young womans virginity can be found, 21 she shall be brought to the door of her fathers house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death**. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her fathers house. You must purge the evil from among you.So if Mary was promised to Joseph and as we know Mary was a supposedly virgin, but in fact gave birth which means she can't be a virgin, it would've meant her death.Miracles and Magic are the same thing, events where we don't understand what happened and can't explain those events, if I stand in the room and pull off a silent fart am I a magician because I made the air smell but no-one can actually tell whether I farted or not because all they can do is assume?","title":"Magic: where did this knowledge come from?"},{"text":"Hell yeah.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"He has over 45 days to pardon people, chill the fuck out.","title":"Democrats openly criticize Bidens pardon: No family should be above the law"},{"text":"back with the BS","title":"1503/--Right on schedule---as I predicted-- Dec1 = 12/1-- Blood Sacrifice= 121"},{"text":"Would you argue that recent supreme court decisions have largely been beneficial for long term growth?","title":"CMV: Current democracies lack continuity in decision-making and they need a long-term body to ensure that it exists"},{"text":"Hey Trump pardoned a family member THEN HIRED THEM!

That I also read a bit of what roughly amounts to \\"Donald Trump used executive powers in a self-serving manner so Joe Biden should be allowed to as a treat\\" or \\"I don't care any more\\" I think is pretty shameful. I was hoping that kind of \\"blue team good, fuck principles\\" sentiment would at least peak during the US election.Tangentially related, I also find the suggestions that what would be ideal for the US as a society would be for Democratic Party aligned interests to set up a propaganda bubble, a la Fox News and that ecosystem, to downplay negative stories and spread outright misinformation to be rather disturbing, even if I doubt that it would be effective in the medium-term.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"No , Hunter Biden is a little shit who's been making money for years by convincing people he had dad on speed dial.

I'd be a strong proponent of MAID even if it were mega-expensive like open heart surgery, and I don't think any other proponent of MAID would disagree. Moreover, generally those expensive fancy surgeries are the cases where financial incentives DO have a more direct result on medical practice - because Doctors can bill the State big money for performing them.

Communists were the largest party in France in 1945 with 25% of the vote, in West Germany they were winning 5% even with East Germany being a thing, and even in the US the party peaked with 75,000 members in the late 40s. While they declined from the peak going into the 50s, Soviet-aligned movements remained a big thing until the later part of the cold war. On the far right side, there were far right terrorist organisations blowing stuff up around Europe and fighting the communist ones. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, there were big overtly far right movements in places like the UK, where a neo-nazi party became one of the largest in membership and grassroots support, reacting violently against early large-scale non-white immigration. Polls showed most people at this time were against civil rights laws banning racial discrimination.I think overt, violent political extremism is probably still a lot lower than it was in most of the 20th century.

These are slow-moving and slow-changing institutions, which are part of the legislative process and that can put restrictions on the executive. The same is true about many constitutional courts, which are empowered to limit what both executive and legislative bodies can do by reference to a body of laws that takes a great deal of effort to change (usually super majority or two consecutive elections).You are clearly not sufficiently convinced these institutions are strong enough or operate well enough to fulfil that function you imagine.However, I will try to change your view in the following way: what we need are many organic civilian institutions, and real stakes understood by the voting population, that way longer-term projects become feasible.To convince you of the problems of your view I point to the European Commission, part of the European Union. This is an executive body, non-elected, with a large institution of administrative staff around it. The EC is very slow to change. The Commissioners have very long tenures and very few are cut short (Thierry Breton's tenure was cut short because he did not get along with Ursula von der Leyen, not because of some popular pressure). My point is: the EC in many ways fit your model.However, the EC has arguably been captured by various self-interests and tend to get stuck in regulating ever smaller and more annoying things. With the tensions and later war in the east, the EC was not the body that took action, that was far more up to NATO and individual nations.I think this is part of a larger dynamic where institutions that are shielded from popular forces and supposedly expert-run, tend to become internally corroded and concerned with their self-interests. There can be too much protection from popular back-and-forth.It is a delicate balance. However, we have in the past managed it. I think the population must somehow be brought into the process. That is, they need to both feel they have a stake in outcomes and that the dopamine rush of just complaining is itself harmful to their self-interest. Also, in traditional society, civilian institutions, like scouting, community groups, volunteering, certain churches, amateur sports, the local knitting clubs, are ways in which some of the popular passions are muted because of engagement elsewhere in the community.I don't say these things are easy, but I think they are more durable. If the US and Canadian Senates or the European Commission are not able to play the role of calming and responsible and constructive political actors, despite their slow-moving and relatively protected status, I am doubtful there is some additional government institutional fix that would solve the problem you point out.","title":"CMV: Current democracies lack continuity in decision-making and they need a long-term body to ensure that it exists"},{"text":"Well if worse comes to worst Hunter can drag Kash Patel or whoever Trump appoints to the FBI or AG through civil court after Trump is done.

This created fear in the people who then rushed to the banks to retrieve their money. Just to find out it was already stolen. Then the banks had to balls to foreclose on homes and farms when the people could no longer pay. Why the people thought SS run by the govt was a good idea right after ?Edit to add- I love being consistently gaslit by ChatGPT. Just change some words around and poof, nothing happened. ChatGPT-This comment reflects a popular but somewhat inaccurate or oversimplified view of the events leading to the Great Depression. Lets break down the key elements of the statement:1. **The Federal Reserves Role in the 1920s:**\\n   The claim that the Federal Reserve created the Great Depression by significantly counterfeiting the currency during the Roaring Twenties is not entirely accurate. While the Federal Reserve did increase the money supply during the 1920s, it was primarily aimed at stimulating the economy. However, there were also some poor policy decisions, such as keeping interest rates low in the late 1920s, which fueled a speculative stock market bubble. When the bubble burst in 1929, it contributed to the onset of the Great Depression. The term counterfeiting is misleading here; the Federal Reserve was not creating money out of thin air, but was managing the money supply and credit conditions.2. **Bank Runs and the Collapse:**\\n   Its true that during the Great Depression, many people rushed to banks to withdraw their money after the stock market crash of 1929. This led to widespread bank failures, as banks didnt keep enough reserves on hand to cover all depositors withdrawals. This was exacerbated by the lack of deposit insurance (which would come later with the FDIC in 1933). However, this was not because the money had been stolen, but because many banks had made risky loans, and when the economy collapsed, they couldnt pay back depositors.3. **Foreclosures and the Struggles of the People:**\\n   During the Depression, banks did foreclose on homes and farms as many Americans couldnt pay off their loans. This contributed to widespread economic suffering, but its important to note that the foreclosures were a result of a financial system in crisis, not a deliberate scheme by banks or the government.4. **Social Security and the Government:**\\n   The comment suggests that people supported Social Security (SS) because they trusted the government after the Depression. While its true that Social Security was introduced in the 1930s as part of the New Deal under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, its creation was not directly a response to the banks or the financial system. Rather, it was a response to widespread poverty and suffering caused by the Depression, aiming to provide financial support to the elderly and vulnerable. People supported Social Security because it provided a safety net after the devastating effects of the Depression, including widespread unemployment and poverty. In Summary:\\nWhile the Federal Reserves actions in the 1920s contributed to some of the economic instability that led to the Great Depression, the comment oversimplifies the complex factors involved. It also mischaracterizes the bank failures and the origins of Social Security. The Depression was a multifaceted crisis, and while government intervention (including Social Security) was part of the response, it was driven by the widespread suffering caused by economic collapse, not just a reaction to bank misdeeds or a sudden trust in the government.","title":"Of all the deceptive sales techniques the U.S. government has used on the American people, one of them  the Social Security Act  gets far too little attention.

The state doesn't have to be coercive to the people. Almost all people have shown willingness and even eagerness to use the governments services. If the social contract operates more like an actual contract, we might have a functioning an-cap(no violent coercion)society. What if, instead, taxes were a voluntary payment? The legal system could make more than enough in fees and service payments, especially with low voluntary taxation, so they wouldn't be gone. The roads? The government could justify a toll road setup like they already have, but you could also go down the route of private roads. Criminal fines could go towards funding prisons and police as well, which would encourage more felony arrests and more successful convictions, considering how high of a fine they can get(of course this could be further improved via a jury system and selective merit-based hiring of judges). This would add on a layer of punishment and incentive to not commit crime. Basically, don't limit yourself to the idea that unjustified coercion MUST exist, even for an agency of justice(which the government is much more than that nowadays).

How often do you or others speak up about a significant amount of men not being bad? Personally, I have?*literally*?never?seen a feminist argue that men are naturally and inevitably bad (like, rooted in their biology, men are just?bad), but if I did - I would call that out.That sort of biological essentialism is something that I only see in men's rights and right-wing spaces.I have seen feminists make harsh generalizations about men that are descriptive in nature. What I mean by that is something like \\"Men are incapable of hearing criticism of masculinity without feeling like its a personal attack\\" or \\"Men are violent\\" or \\"Men support rape culture\\" etc. Are those generalizations universally true? No. #notallmen /s  However, those generalizations always reflect frustration with the **typical socialization** of men, not with some biological, innate trait that is intrinsic to men. It is very difficult for some people to understand that **it is possible to support and perpetuate an immoral system passively or unintentionally**. Most contemporary feminists agree that men **and women** are socialized to support the patriarchy and it would be unfair to blame them for the socialization they had no part in choosing. But socialization is not intrinsic. Men can change, and often do. Women can change, and often do. A better world is possible. Some feminists (such as in the [1960s political movement \\"political lesbianism\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_lesbianism)) do seem to think men are the enemy. That's not the sort of feminist I'm hanging out with and they are considered extremists. How are you actively encouraging feminists and men to support men and help others become good men?Whole lot of we dont hate men. Not a whole lot of we are doing x, y, z to help men feel more supported and grow.This is a bit like asking the fire department \\"What is your department doing to reduce the rate of heart disease?\\" In principle, it is a good thing to reduce the rate of heart disease. However, the fire department exists for a different primary purpose and it would distract from that purpose to pour disproportionate time and money into heart disease prevention. Women need help right now. Men need help too, but feminism is a movement generally by and for women. Men benefit indirectly from women's liberation (because men are oppressed by the patriarchy too), but it isn't feminists primary job to help men.

These remain in the State and ensure the voice of most voters has a place in proposing/adopting, amending and passing legislation.  Not being in the Capitol and with less access to bureaucrats, they lack the committee and other opportunities to change legislation more effectively, but can not be totally ignored.Each State's Congressional delegation must meet the following:State population/(Senators+Capitol Reps+Domestic Reps)Must equal as closely as possiblePopulation of least populous State/4 [since each State gets at minimum 2 Senators, 1 Capitol Rep and 1 Domestic Rep]This would result in approximately 1 Congressional rep for every ~170,000 people in 2024, which, while significantly expanding their number and budget, still has them significantly less representative than, say, the 1 rep per 80k or so in Canada, nationally.Then, the EC, as Senators plus Reps, would roughly equal population distribution.

The reasons for this may tie in with larger implications for the lore, including questions surrounding the existence of Club Penguin as a single technologically-advanced island nation and the possibility of some cataclysmic event in penguin history.Regardless, I do believe that the saurian hypothesis is the most likely. We know that dinosaur puffles coexisted with caveguins and saw that caveguins were seemingly in the process of domesticating them during the Prehistoric Parties. We know that dinosaur puffles disappeared at some point and were replaced by modern puffles, who look extremely similar and have fluff on their bodies that strongly resembles that of the dinosaur puffles. We can assume that rapid change to dinosaur puffles through domestication and selective breeding is plausible, given real-life humanitys history of doing something very similar with dogs.One issue that raises additional questions about the saurian hypothesis, though, is the existence of puffle creatures, such as rabbit puffles, dog puffles, and cat puffles. The development of blatantly mammalian traits like rabbit ears in reptiles would be quite unusual. The domestication component of the saurian hypothesis may explain this, however. Since modern puffles already appear quite mammalian, it does not seem like a stretch to assume that caveguins specifically found mammal-esque qualities cute and selected for them when breeding puffles. That could mean some of them created breeds of puffle that had traits convergent with those of rabbits, raccoons, etc. This would definitely be an oddity, but in my admittedly non-expert opinion, it is not outside the realm of possibility. One might even be able to construct plausible models for the evolution of certain puffle creatures from their more reptilian ancestors- for example, perhaps rabbit puffles apparent ears are merely ornamental and evolved out of Triceratops puffles horns, their real ears being hidden somewhere under their fur just like every other puffles- but I will not delve into that here.Overall, it seems most likely that modern puffles are domesticated (and then feralized and redomesticated) dinosaurs with their most outwardly reptilian traits bred out of them by Pygoscelis sapiens for cultural reasons. The mammalian hypothesis, while interesting, seems to fail when Occams razor is applied. The idea that rodents converged heavily upon dinosaur puffles to the point of having extremely similar body plans and appearing very closely related to them is, to me, less plausible than the idea that dinosaur puffles were pushed by Pygoscelis sapiens to lose some of their saurian traits and gain some new mammal-like traits. However, we cannot know for certain unless we are given answers by the Club Penguin loremasters. Perhaps one day they will deign to grace us with those answers.Or perhaps Club Penguin itself will return in glory and host a Paleontology Party in which players can explore the fossil record of Club Penguins Earth and discover the truth behind some of these enduring mysteries. For the time being, though, those mysteries will remain.

If true, this would be mind-blowing. I always assumed puffles were mammals, but could they actually be dinosaurs just like modern birds (because being descended from dinosaurs means youre still a dinosaur) This doesnt make sense. Does that mean their fur is actually feathers that converged on fur?Since I cannot find an official source stating that dinosaur puffles are indeed the ancestors of modern-day puffles, it is difficult to accept it as truth. However, the fact that ancient puffle-like dinosaurs strongly resemble modern-day puffles is a strange coincidence regardless if the two share no relation.The first theory that springs to mind is that we are looking at a case of convergent evolution. Perhaps there is something about the puffloid form that makes its evolutionary adoptees highly suited to living at and around the South Pole- and if we assume that the theory of Prehistoric Parties having taken place only a few thousand years ago, as detailed in my comment about Club Penguin penguin evolution on yesterdays DT, is true (which, I just realized, is lent further credence by the fact that Club Penguin Island- the original, not the sequel version- existed and looked very similar to modern-day Club Penguin during the time periods of the Prehistoric Parties, which would be very strange if a 65 mya dating is true given the enormous tectonic shifts that have occurred since the Mesozoic Era- a fact that I should have also considered earlier when speculating about dinosaurs surviving in Antarctica, as Antarctica did not exist as a distinct continent during the Mesozoic), then dinosaur puffles existed in the Club Penguin archipelago fairly recently.I am guessing that some of the non-avian dinosaur remnant populations that somehow survived on or at least around Antarctica evolved to take on these small, round, limbless shapes because of some unknown evolutionary pressure. There is likely an ecological niche suited to this form somewhere within the archipelago that has remained constant since at least the time of the caveguins (as the time period of the first Prehistoric Party is the earliest known moment at which dinosaur puffles existed, although they certainly may have existed for much longer than that), and this niche was filled by the dinosaur puffles until they went extinct (or, possibly, shrank drastically in population and perhaps became limited to Dinosaur Island, but that is conjecture), and mammals evolved to fill the niche. It must be a very odd and specific niche to produce the exact same unusual body plan twice, first in dinosaurs and then in mammals.And its not as though dinosaur puffles and modern-day mammalian puffles look only vaguely similar- they really do look as though they should be closely related somehow. And even the different colors of dinosaur puffle have the same universal personality traits (which is a very odd characteristic of puffles, but thats a discussion for another time) as their modern counterparts of the same colors. Additionally, it would seem as though, according to the mammalian puffle hypothesis, mammalian puffles arose quite rapidly after the extinction/reduction of dinosaur puffles. Remember that caveguins coexisted with dinosaur puffles, so mammalian puffles would seem to have arisen within the lifespan of the sapient penguins as a species (Pygoscelis sapiens, as I propose they be called). That strikes me as  quite a strange proposition.We do not have enough information about the Club Penguin universe to speculate on possible mammalian ancestors for modern-day puffles, unfortunately. It is plausible that they are descended from rodents who rapidly evolved in recent history to take advantage of whatever niche was left vacant by the disappearance of dinosaur puffles- or perhaps these rodents were already beginning to compete with dinosaur puffles to fill that niche before caveguins even arrived on the scene. Perhaps early modern puffles actually outcompeted dinosaur puffles and were responsible, at least in part, for their extinction or population shrinkage.The alternative is that modern puffles truly are dinosaurs, descended from the more recognizably reptilian dinosaur puffles of the recent past and covered with downy feathers that strongly resemble fur. We do see what appear to be such feathers on some of the dinosaur puffles, so it may not have required an impossibly enormous evolutionary leap for them to come to resemble modern puffles by simply losing their horns, tails, and other stereotypically dinosaurian traits. If the saurian hypothesis is true, though, the rapidity of that change (which, much like one of the mammalian puffle evolution scenarios mentioned earlier, would seemingly have had to occur after the appearance of Pygoscelis sapiens) suggests that some strong evolutionary pressure pushed them away from the more reptilian forms quite urgently.If modern puffles are indeed descended from dinosaur puffles, I propose that Pygoscelis sapiens was responsible for this shift. In the real world, humans began domesticating wolves tens of thousands of years ago, giving rise to many different dog breeds that often bear little resemblance to their lupine ancestors. It is plausible that caveguins did the same with puffles and selectively bred them over time to match a standard of cuteness that entailed the removal of puffles more reptilian traits. Over the course of several tens of thousands of years, caveguins could have bred horns, tails, and sharp teeth out of puffles entirely, leaving only fluffy, fur-like feathers all over their companions bodies. The various puffle breeds in the modern Club Penguin world do not vary nearly as much as dog breed in the modern world, which suggests a cultural tendency among Pygoscelis sapiens to homogenize the appearance of puffles, making most of them essentially identical save for slight variations (such as the buck-toothed appearance of orange puffles).","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"We have regular armies \\\\\\\\\\\\_()\\\\_/","title":"National security advisor Jake Sullivan says Biden told him to oversee a 'massive surge' of weapons deliveries to Ukraine before his term ends"},{"text":"How am I going to study the blade when Trump keeps me from my 1000 times folded Nippon Steel","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Transfer stations are still hideous but at least the Farragut stations are shown connectedAlso station names are still way too long","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"awwwwww going with the insults because its so hard for you to think clearly and cant comprehend what i was talking about. im so sorry the topic was about something and then led to something else and then something else. sometimes, in discussions, that happens. but usually youre not having discussions with educated adults, just children so you would understand that. maybe one youll understand multiplication tables.   \\nkeep trying though lol","title":"Obama needs to be like George Bush and just leave politics,  his urge for power is destroying America"},{"text":"Who?

Like lets be real here, he's a shitbag, definitely feels weird with his connections in Ukraine and China, but you've got to see that Trump has been running saying that they're coming after him because he's their political opponent. The optics of going after your opponent's kid after this campaign, even though I think he's up to no good, looks quite bad. The damage to hunter has been done, if a state wants to try to go after him for anything on that laptop, they'll get their chance to do so quite soon.I don't think anyone in a position of power actually gives a damn about Hunter Biden or his crimes, other than as a tool to get at his dad, either for influence (if you're in the Ukraine, or a shitty painting buyer somewhere in china) or for political smears if you're on the right. He was literally just a chess piece for each side of the political aisle to use to get at Joe. As his dad is now almost completely brainless due to his age, all of this potential criminal activity is probably about to cease, and more than likely that is going to be permanent. Hunter is permanently politically non-viable because of that laptop, theres no benefit to be had by pumping money to him at this point, and theres no benefit to continue prosecuting, they lost, its over. Whats the upside here though? We just got another bit of shit to sling, 10 minutes of footage of Biden himself, his administration, and the democrat establishment at large saying they wouldn't do the thing they just did. This was his final middle finger to the party that fucked him over. He just shredded what little credibility the democrats still had. That's a useful tool to be gifted, its a secret tool to help us later, keep that safe for a while, it'll come in handy.","title":"People need to understand the full extent of Hunter Bidens pardon"},{"text":"Self-described non-practicing Muslim","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":" Political party RepublicanPar for the course","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"these Dems going after Biden for this are gonna be the death of us all.

In 1935, the American people were sold a bill of goods. They were told, Pay into this system, and it'll be YOUR money for retirement. Sounds great, right?3. But here's where it gets juicy, in a really ugly way. Two years later, when the Supreme Court was considering the constitutionality of the Social Security Act, the government did a complete 180.4. The governmentthrough Assistant Attorney General Robert Jacksonargued in essence, Oh no, this isnt YOUR money at all. This is a TAX, and we can do whatever we want with it. Classic bait and switch.5. Lets not forget the ruling in Helvering v. Davis, where the Supreme Court upheld the Social Security Act by embracing the governments argument / admission that what people pay into Social Security is tax revenueavailable to be used as Congress may directand not at all money belonging to those who paid it.6. So, to summarize: the proponents of the Social Security Act told American workers that what they paid into the system would remain *their* money, not the governmentsto get Congress to pass itand then told the courts the exact opposite when defending the Acts constitutionality. The Supreme Court accepted the governments argument, to the great detriment of the American people.7. Now, lets talk about what happens to your money once its in the government's hands. Spoiler alert: its not managed like your IRA or 401(k).8. First of all, this money doesnt sit in a nice, individual account with your name on it. No, it goes into a huge account called the Social Security Trust Fund.9. But heres the kickerthe government routinely raids this fund. Yes, you heard that right. They take your money and use it for whatever the current Congress deems necessary.10. Every few years, theres talk in Congress about saving Social Security. Ive introduced and cosponsored a number of measures over the years that would fix it. But most in Congress show little desire to fix it, and are instead constantly looking for ways to borrow from itwith no plan to put it back.11. And the returns? Forget about compound interest or stock market gains. Your investment in Social Security can give you a return lower than inflation.12. If you had put the same amount into literally ANYTHING elsea mutual fund, real estate, even a savings accountyoud be better off by the time you reached retirement age, even if the government kept some of it!13. Do the math: with Social Security, youre looking at a return that's pathetic compared to market averages. Its not even an investment; it's a tax.14. And lets talk about how this system is set up to fail. The demographic shift? More retirees, fewer workers. Its almost fair to compare it to a Ponzi scheme thats running out of new investors.15. Every dollar you pay into Social Security, only to see it gobbled up by the government itself, is a dollar you cant invest in your own future. Its government dependency at its worst.16. Remember, this isnt just about retirement. Its about independence, about controlling your own destiny. With Social Security, you control nothing.17. The government promises you security but gives you dependency. It promises ownership but gives you a tax receipt.18. And dont get me started on the management. The Social Security Administration is a bureaucratic behemoth, not exactly known for its efficiency or innovation.19. If you think your money is safe there, youre in for a rude awakening. The mismanagement, the waste, the deceptionits all on display.20. So, whats the solution? We need real, genuine reform. Within the Social Security system, Americans should be able to invest in their own future, and not be shackled by the worst parts of this outdated, mismanaged system.21. Its  time we acknowledge the truth: Social Security as it now exists isnt a retirement plan; its a tax plan with retirement benefits as an afterthought.22. We were sold a dream, but received a nightmare. Its time for a wake-up call. We need real reform.23. Its time for Americans to know the true history of the Social Security Act. The more people learn the truth, the more theyll start demanding answers, options, and real reform from Congress. Please help spread the word.24. The history of the Social Security Actwhich sadly must include the deceptive manner in which it was sold to the American peopleis yet another reason why Americas century-long era of progressive government must be brought to a close.Credit: Senator Mike Lee on Xhttps://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1863771172485104124?t=PIGVz2LdfeckJIjkt-O79Q&amp;s=19","title":"Of all the deceptive sales techniques the U.S. government has used on the American people, one of them  the Social Security Act  gets far too little attention.

These efforts were far from perfect, but they showed a willingness to address the crisis head-on rather than sweeping it under the rug.\\nBlaming shutdowns solely on state leaders without acknowledging Trumps role in creating the conditions for those shutdowns is ignoring the bigger picture. Leadership matters, and the failures of 2020 had consequences were still dealing with today.","title":"Meghan McCain Slammed for Criticism of Nepo Baby Hunter Biden | \\nThe irony of the statement was apparently lost on the daughter of the late Sen.

Trumps approach, from downplaying the virus to promoting unproven treatments, made the situation worse and delayed critical measures. His administrations mixed messaging cost lives and trust in public health institutions.\\nAs for Biden, calling him a 'puppet' overlooks the significant efforts his administration undertook to clean up the mess. Vaccine distribution, securing economic recovery through relief bills, and restoring alliances were no small tasks. If you disagree with the decisions made, thats fairbut dismissing them outright ignores the complexities of managing a global crisis.

Higher Taxes for Regular Citizens: Trumps tax cuts heavily benefited corporations and the wealthiest Americans, while the long-term effects shifted the tax burden onto the middle class. Under his policies, regular people like you and me would likely see our taxes increase as the wealthy continue to enjoy loopholes and lower rates.\\n2. Skyrocketing Grocery Costs: Mass deportations would devastate the agricultural workforce. The reality is that most Americans dont want to work low-wage, labor-intensive jobs on farmlands. Without enough workers to harvest crops, food production would shrink, leading to higher grocery prices and potential shortages.\\n3. Inflated Prices on Retail and American-Made Goods: Trumps tariffs on imports, particularly from China, didnt just hurt foreign businessesthey raised costs for American manufacturers and consumers. 'Made in America' goods would become even more expensive, making it harder for everyday people to afford essential items. Retail prices would also climb as businesses pass these increased costs onto us.\\n4. Higher Costs at Dealerships: Tariffs on imported materials used in manufacturing vehicles would drive up the price of cars, even those made in the U.S. Dealerships would have no choice but to increase prices to cover their expenses, making car ownership even less accessible for average Americans.\\n5. Increased Domestic Crimes and Social Division: Trumps rhetoric has emboldened racist and extremist groups, leading to spikes in hate crimes and social unrest. A divided society isnt just morally wrongit also increases instability, which affects all aspects of daily life, from safety to economic growth.\\nThese are just a few of the likely consequences. The policies may sound good on the surface, but when you dig deeper, its clear they disproportionately harm working and middle-class Americans while further enriching the elite. This is the future wed be voting for if we choose to go down this path again.","title":"Meghan McCain Slammed for Criticism of Nepo Baby Hunter Biden | \\nThe irony of the statement was apparently lost on the daughter of the late Sen.

Militiamen bearing Russian weaponry but no insignia began occupying several key regions and airports of Crimea, and later on Ukraine. A Crimean referendum was held, with polling stations monitored by those very unmarked militiamen, and thousands of prefilled ballots were found indicating favor of joining Russia. The result was a staggering 95% vote in favor of joining Russia. Regions not monitored by these militiamen did not indicate favor for joining Russia. So no, not CIA involvement. An independent, sovereign, nation wanting to increase its ties with the EU is not a justifiable reason for invasion.

Yes, it's as if Americans voted for 9/11.  But 85 percent of Americans barely follow news at all.  You can un-stupid them. My list of problems with both Biden and Harris would be four times the length of this post, and that wouldn't even get into my own personal take on \\"_where do Dems go from here_\\" which everyone seems to have.They should have done better.  I was wrong, and will be wrong, about a lot of things.  But the constant round of backbiting and the weird need to re-write everything Biden did as somehow all wrong and meaningless the day after the election strikes me as falling for the fallacy that attributes all agency to Democrats and a country looking anywhere but in a mirror.The market isn't always rational, voters far less so.  Betamax was the superior product.  Tesla has been wildly overvalued for years.And even taking into account every success and every failure, in the final tally Biden still did a great job and the voters being simply wrong about his tenure doesn't change my take.  I don't care if this sub is treating him like Bush in 08 where nobody who cheerlead the president for years will admit they even knew the guy.","title":"National security advisor Jake Sullivan says Biden told him to oversee a 'massive surge' of weapons deliveries to Ukraine before his term ends"},{"text":"Probe his ass.

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Departments decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. \\n \\nThe charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room C with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunters cases.   \\n \\nNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son C and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter C who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break me C and theres no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. \\n \\nFor my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. Theyll be fair-minded. Heres the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice C and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.

He doesn't have any real power, and he's known since he was briefed before his first term that he is to know his place.Obama is hell bent on protecting that frail legacy of his.  How do I know?

This part jumped out at me, and explains a lot of why women from lower socioeconomic classes might support Trump:Women with more social, economic, or educational capital are much more likely to support the activities of women making their own way in the world, to be proud when they see powerful women who stand up or who are getting ahead of men in any way, and theyre also much more open to supporting social policies that reward individual initiative even if they know that its not always rewarded equally.Women with less economic or personal autonomy are often drawn to a culture of family values that emphasizes mens responsibility to look after women. Women who have a shot at achieving or competing on their own emphasize equality, supporting the kind of policies that make it possible for them to move up in their jobs and combine work and family.Women who want to be protected in the private sphere or need to be protected in the private sphere tend to emphasize the need to protect and privilege womens special capacities for nurturing. I think its a big factor in the debates over contraception and sexuality and abortion. The flip side of women having all these freedoms from male control, they believe, is that it actually threatens womens entitlement to male protection.To me, it says a lot about how patriarchy keeps going among women - because a lot of them believe it's necessary, and depending on how a community is, they might actually need those protections.It also makes me re-think some of the talking points about how class intertwines with racial and gender politics.  I tend to roll my eyes at the commentators who think we should just talk about everything in terms of class, and write off racism and sexism as class problems.  I still think that oversimplifies it, but clearly it's a mistake to ignore how lack of opportunity does allow those ideas to fester.  Policies that give women more opportunities will also help them be more open to supporting equality, as well as being good ideas on their own merits.And who knows?  Maybe some of the guys will do the same thing.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 2, 2024"},{"text":"Im glad he did it","title":"White House says Trump wouldnt let go of Hunter Biden in defending pardon"},{"text":"Well she did marry the owner or CEO or whatever of The Federalist.","title":"Meghan McCain Slammed for Criticism of Nepo Baby Hunter Biden | \\nThe irony of the statement was apparently lost on the daughter of the late Sen.

Biden's permission for Ukraine to use medium range missiles could have been a game-changer had it happened months ago, but it's likely too late to make that kind of difference now.            It seems to me the Biden Administration tried to use as much leverage as it could to try to get Ukraine to either devote more of its existing military to the fight (which I somewhat agree with), or to get the Zelenskyy government to conscript more, and younger, people. The fighting force has been around 200,000 (there have also been around 100,000 deserters) while about 500,000 more regular military troops haven't been involved in the conflict. Ukraine has said having more or their soldiers on the frontlines won't make a difference if they don't have materiel with which to fight, while the U.S. has sort of been \\"If they come, we will build it\\".                As sad as the plight of Ukraine is probably going to be, the worse thing is the Putin regime may have been no more than four or five months from collapse. Russia is suffering crippling stagflation as the war drains their treasury and sanctions have trashed the economy. The unrest in Georgia and Syria were going to be unwelcomed additional pain points that may have gone unanswered. Trump's re-election wasn't just a new lease on life for him, but it's going to save his boss, Vladimir and Putin isn't going to let Trump off the hook.               The Ukrainians have been brave and innovative fighters and they deserved our total support from Day One. The overcaution from Biden, and the Republican collaboration, allowed the clock to run out on Ukraine in the same way the clock ran out on Agent Orange.
