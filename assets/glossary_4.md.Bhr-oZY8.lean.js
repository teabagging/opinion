Except Hunter Biden (its own conversation) the family and government employees President Biden is getting flak for pardoning have not been meaningfully investigated or accused of *any* specific crimes, nor has any probable cause or substantive ever been presented for investigation of any crimes, nor have they ever been accused of any sort of *criminal collaboration* with President Biden.  You admit this and somehow try to use it *against* these people by saying \\"it suggests they DID commit a crime\\".If you had stopped at his pardon of Hunter Biden, one could have started a possibly challenging conversation.  At one point, I felt Hunter should not be pardoned, and I later changed my mind and even criticized Biden for not pardoning Hunter back in the summer.  But I could see the staging point of an argument.  I can even imagine (sorta... it's a stretch for me) someone considering a person committing reckless acts while drunk to be the same league as conspiring to take senators hostage and murder a Vice President. Biden granting preemptive pardons... suggests they have committed crimes and liedBiden granted these pardons because Trump was outspoken against these folks and promising illegal and unjust responses to them.  As you admit regarding a lack of indictment, *there is no evidence they committed crimes*.  There's no reason to say him pardoning the target of a (perceived) insane president's hatred is suggesting those targets are criminals.Whether YOU think Trump is a dangerous maniac or not, it is clear that most Democrats DO.  We're fucking terrified of him because he has promised to use the military to take us out because he thinks we are evil by our very nature... And people who can are taking actions they think will protect innocents from that.  You can't read in any deeper than that without actual evidence.  In fact, I would like to point out Biden reminding the military of their oaths *because Trump has implied he will use the military illegally*. You cant have it both waysWhy not?  Other than the fact that the word \\"pardon\\" was used, I see no possible similarities between any of the people we're discussing and (for example) Eric Munchel, AKA \\"Ziptie Guy\\".","title":"CMV: Trump pardoning 1/6 rioters is proof that Trump and other MAGA leaders knowingly lied to the public about Antifa being responsible."},{"text":"To be fair I've been stopped by the CG a number of times on the Great Lakes and they literally have never done checks on my name, unless they remembered everyone's names and then did it later (unlikely).

He didn't just jump into poisoning critics and declaring himself president for life (while he effectively is, he still hasn't even made that last one official). He courted the Russian public and by the time he was ready to make his move they were demanding their representatives overturn the amendment restricting presidents to two term limits and cheering as he arrested his opposition.The same with Hitler. It was nearly a decade into Nazi rule before the actual concentration camps got underway. The early years of Nazi Germany were spent rebuilding the damage from WWI which was still around after over a decade (seriously, ready about the Weimar Republic if you haven't - it was an absolute mess) and rebuilding the economy.There's this idea that the autocrat thrives in chaos, but that's not the case.

But later that day, amid a rush of executive orders, Trump seemed to betray his own vision of peace. He lifted Biden-era sanctions aimed at curbing Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. He also rescinded a policy that had blocked sanctions against the International Criminal Court, putting those who try to hold the U.S. and its allies accountable for war crimes at risk of a new round of financial penalties. Within hours of lifting the sanctions, Israeli settlers attacked Jinasfut, a Palestinian village in the West Bank, injuring at least 21 Palestinians and setting fire to homes, cars, a nursery, and workshop, according to village officials. Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli military had been raiding homes and mosques, detaining dozens of Palestinians across the occupied territory, including children and journalists.And on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a new military operation into the northern West Bank city of Jenin and an adjoined refugee camp where several Palestinian militant groups are based. The Israeli offensive, backed by drones and helicopters, killed at least 10 Palestinians  including a 16-year-old boy  and wounded 35 others, health officials said. The campaign is known as Operation Iron Wall, an apparent reference to the Zionist writings of Zeev Jabotinsky that argued for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians to secure an Israeli state.It was all political theater.Experts were quick to note that the rise in Israeli military attacks in the West Bank shouldnt be viewed in isolation from the ceasefire in Gaza. Its a continuation, they say, of a broader campaign; some view it as Netanyahus attempt to appease extremists in his Cabinet and in Israel who were upset over the cessation of fighting in Gaza, which failed to eradicate Hamas.It was all political theater, said Muhannad Ayyash, a policy analyst at Al-Shabaka and professor in Palestine studies at Mount Royal University, referring to the ceasefire, which went into effect days before Trump re-entered the White House. It was never that Trump wanted to actually put pressure on Israel to stop its settler colonization of Palestine  whether that be decreasing settlement activity in the West Bank, or realizing the two-state solution on 1967 borders, or ending the military onslaught against the Gaza Strip, Ayyash said. What he wanted was just the appearance of peace and order to boost his political capital and then allow the Israelis to continue with their project of annexing large swaths of the West Bank and in their project of basically eliminating the Palestinians ability to live in Gaza and to resist Israeli settler colonialism.","title":"Trump Halts Sanctions on Israeli Settlers, Threatens to Seize Assets of War Crimes Investigators"},{"text":"Nicely done!  \\n  \\nI recognize that the majority of the electorate who actually bothered to vote either wants them to suffer, doesn't care, didn't think about it, didn't believe it would be possible, etc. This is certain.

Share this idea. I don't know who needs to hear it. Trans rights are fundamentally tied to the principles of the social contract, historical precedent, and constitutional protections. The social contract obligates us to protect each others freedoms, even when we dont fully understand or agree with them. Its a mutual agreement that ensures we all have the right to live freely without interference, as long as we dont harm others. This includes transgender individuals, who, like everyone else, are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.Historically, transgender people have existed across all cultures and eras, from ancient Egypt to Native American \\"Two-Spirit\\" traditions. While theyve often faced persecution, their existence has been well-documented, creating a clear historical precedent. This isnt a new conceptits a group of people whove been marginalized and are now fighting for the same recognition that other oppressed groups have achieved over time.As Christians, we should recognize this struggle because our own history shows how vital protections are. Early Christians faced persecution and ridicule in societies that sought to suppress their beliefs. It was only through constitutional protections, like the First Amendment, that Christians in America could freely practice their faith and thrive. Transgender individuals face a similar struggle for dignity and equality today.Under the Constitution, the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law for all citizens. While transgender peoples rights may not have been explicitly recognized in the past, the broader principles of liberty and equality apply. Just as women, racial minorities, and religious groups like Christians fought for and gained their rights, transgender individuals are seeking the same protections.This isnt about agreeing with someones identityits about ensuring that the freedoms promised by the Constitution are applied equally. If we fail to uphold trans rights, we violate the social contract and risk setting a dangerous precedent that undermines the liberties of everyone. Protecting their rights is about more than just their community; its about reinforcing the principles that keep our society free, just, and grounded in the values we claim to uphold.","title":"Rep.

At this point sanctioning the Russian government to try and fuck their economy is like throwing water on someone who just got out of the pool to try and get them wet.  Why would Putin make a deal now when he has all the momentum?But of course, dear leader thought he could just be best buds with Putin and that would lead to a deal.  As usual hes getting taken advantage of and being made to look stupid because he is not smart enough or strong enough to do this job.","title":"Trump tells Putin to end Ukraine war or face more sanctions"},{"text":"Except there are people who weren't following the official sites added to them so they claim.","title":"Meta pushes back on claims that it's boosting Trump on Facebook and Instagram"},{"text":"its becoming a time honored tradition in America\\"We had come to the stage where for our people what was needed was a real democracy; and of all forms of tyranny the least attractive and the most vulgar is the tyranny of mere wealth, the tyranny of a plutocracy\\"Teddy Roosevelt","title":"Even Most Millionaires Think the Superrich Influencing Trump Threatens Global Stability"},{"text":"If not now, when does it end?

I am of 2 minds right now.\\nOne is, Its not bad because people should hire based on skill and not race, I feel like this was needed back in the day when people were still EXTREMELY racist and discriminatory to anyone who wasnt white. But I think nowadays, while this is still some hate, its a commonly accepted fact to hire people based of qualifications and not race or gender. So I dont believe in a modern setting that people need these laws anymore. That being said, Im also thinking that We dont live in a perfect world, things arent just cookie cutter like that. I also think that some people DO hire solely/mostly based on race and now this law will allow them to do so more easily. But I also think that as long as a majority of business and employers hire based on Qualifications (because its become the norm now) then we shouldnt worry about this law. I am a short, large, Hispanic male and Ive gotten tons of job offers, interviews and have been picked to work at many places since Ive started working. So far Ive gone through 4 jobs, have had 10 interviews and 2 other jobs that have asked me to start working for them, but Ive turned down since I was employed by others at the time. In the span of a year and a half this all happened. Currently I work at an HVAC company. Then again, Ive also heard many people is the Hispanic community saying that I look more white, but other whites definitely know Im Hispanic, so idk. TL;DR \\nMy point is, I think it doesnt matter either way if he removes them or not, I think when it was implemented it helped prop minorities up and get them started, but nowadays (as its more widely accepted) race doesnt matter as much and so people dont look for that in employees (unless they have too many white people) \\nIm here looking to make conversation, if you think my viewpoint is wrong, Id like to hear yours, if youre respectful to me Ill be respectful to you","title":"Trump rolls back bedrock civil rights measure in sweeping anti-DEI push"},{"text":"man i wish there was a service that translated things like this to make it more accessible, they should put it on google too.Man...I wish rando redditors would not justify this willful and racist obstruction of communication for other persons with stupid comments that punt to other web services on Google.Also, following the \\"logic\\" in your comment...MAGA lemmings could simply and immensely help themselves by learning the definitions of basic words as well basic scientific facts via Google.But here we are...MAGA lemmings do not want to learn anything that does not confirm their biases and they will say any obviously absurd nonsense to defend their *dear leader'*s racist cessation of communications with demographics who are not white.","title":"Trump administration shuts down White House Spanish-language page and social media"},{"text":"LFG!","title":"Tom Homan says ICE arrested 308 criminal illegals on Trump's first day in office"},{"text":"I would simply not post pictures online if it meant supporting fascism.

It seems to me that Jesus ( who Christians are supposed to follow ) really took care and concern very seriously.So the bishop saying this should not be controversial.I mean like come on, it is like if a Burmese Junta member went to a Buddhist temple and hear a monk say, Killing is not good, maiming is not good, deliberately beating and harming another is not good. One should not kill, not maim, not beat and not harm another. Is that a political statement?

The decade of the 2010s placed the American constitutional system under the greatest stress it had known since the New Deal crisis of the 1930s. President Donald Trump demonstrated that he felt none of the veneration (to quote James Madisons 49th Federalist paper) required to sustain the norms of constitutional governance. Worse still, however, was the behavior of the Senate and the Supreme Court. Under Republican control, the Senate blithely ignored the well-documented charges under which the House of Representatives had impeached Trump. For its part, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court fulfilled its long-frustrated agenda: In two leading decisions in June 2020, it gutted the Affordable Care Act and authorized individual states to impose severe limits on the right to choice secured in the 1974 decision in Roe v. Wade.The events of the 2010s thus set the stage for the Great Constitutional Revision of 2025. Although Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, Republicans held on to the Senate and the Supreme Court retained its conservative majority. With the national government in a state of near paralysis, a coalition of blue states coalesced to demand a constitutional convention. A phalanx of 18 solidly red states, representing less than a fifth of the nations population, quickly rejected this proposal, keeping it two states shy of the two-thirds margin that Article V of the Constitution required. Invoking the precedent set in 1787, when the first Constitutional Convention threw out the amendment rules laid down in the Articles of Confederation, the blue states insisted that the meeting must be held. Rather than side with the smaller bloc of solidly red states, the now hotly contested states of Texas and Florida sent delegations to the Chicago convention. The dominant theme of the Convention was to make constitutional decision-making directly responsive to the one person, one vote standard. That was also how votes were allocated in the Convention itself. The resulting deliberations led to a radically revised Constitution. Among other changes, the president would now be elected by a single nation-wide popular vote. The House of Representatives was enlarged to 600 members, with all its districts designed by an AI process to be as competitive as possible. The Senate became an advisory body that could no longer vote down legislation enacted by the House, and senators were now elected on a regional basis, rather than by individual states. The Supreme Court was enlarged to 15 justices, who would serve 18-year terms on a staggered basis. When the bloc of small red states balked at ratifying the results, they were told they could form their own separate confederacy. A few months of considering how costly it would be to sustain their states government without the financial support of the far more economically productive blue states quickly led them to abandon their position.","title":"Mike Johnson Says Hes Ready to Commit Political Blackmail - The House speaker now seems open to conditioning disaster aid over immigration policy."},{"text":"I doubt they'll track down my reddit post history lol.","title":"22 states, including IL, WI, MI, challenge Trump's executive order cutting birthright citizenship"},{"text":"It's not illegal if it's an official act duh","title":"Trumps Trans Ban Defines Everyone as Female  But Thats Not the Problem"},{"text":"you are not wrong read the thread UK Starmer doing it and Putin too world is doomed","title":"Trump Announces $500 Billion For Untested AI-Made Personalized mRNA Vaccines For Cancer/ Pandemics"},{"text":"Just another crime for the wiki page I guess.","title":"Trumps Trans Ban Defines Everyone as Female  But Thats Not the Problem"},{"text":"It's as if The Onion has taken over the world.

They entered legally and then did not leave when they should have. That is also not a felony. And as far as sanctuary cities are concerned, I think if we are seeking to abide by a federal govt than their law needs to be what states and local govt follow.They have been. The local PD is following local, state, and fed law.  If we are seeking (what I think) is a govt system where the states have more say, than we should accept that, in which case the federal law is like the marijuana laws - it shouldn't have an effect on you unless you REALLY screw up. Not that that is how it works but probably should be. In which case, if Ca wants to look the other way unless the fed govt has a case against an individual, great. If Texas wants to patrol their border and send anyone crossing back, that's their choice. Than we live where we agree with :/States do not have the power to enforce federal laws. The border is a federal issue. Texas can not patrol the border. This is why they were pissed at Biden for not taking action on the border.

But it didnt stop there. This deliberate rollback of trans and other LGBTQ+ rights and protections also includes a section with definitions that belies basic biology: claiming that female means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell, and male means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.Its especially egregious that this order defines sex as starting at conception, which is impossible, says Ash Lazarus Orr, press relations manager at Advocates for Trans Equality. While its possible to know chromosomal information, human embryos dont show sexual differentiation at that stage  and all embryos initially develop along female lines until later in development.So, according to this definition, all Americans are female.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-trans-ban-executive-order-1235243876/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-trans-ban-executive-order-1235243876/)","title":"Trumps Trans Ban Defines Everyone as Female  But Thats Not the Problem"},{"text":"Firing the TSA head is based, the other two aren't though.","title":"Trump fires heads of TSA, Coast Guard and guts key aviation safety advisory committee"},{"text":"Some \\"dear leader\\" bullshit going on","title":"Meta admits some people cant unfollow Donald Trump on Instagram"},{"text":"Its nice to have a strong leader again.

Three of which are unquestionably parliamentary states. And France is very close to one.The UK, France, Germany, and Japan are not great powers. They are almost incapable of action independent of the USA.The closest thing to a fourth great power is India. They are a pretty strong force in their neighborhood, but have no capacity for power projection.In WWII, the British government did fall. And a new one was in place a day later that won the war. If parliamentary democracy can survive that, it can survive most crises.The British got lucky. It's easy for a government to fall in a way that requires new elections to resolve.That said, I'm less concerned about existential war and more concerned about the maintenance of the world order. The President has broad powers that can be invoked without the approval of Congress, enabling the American government to be more responsive to crisis events in other states. He is still constrained by domestic politics, but he doesn't immediately disappear from power if he deems an unpopular action necessary.A concrete example of my concerns is the Suez Crisis.

Pritzker is loaded and no longer at the helm of a company that can be squashed by targeted government efforts.Given the way campaigns are financed, it's hard to see a path forward for the left outside of an independently wealthy class traitor like FDR. Basically, \\"billionaire savior\\" is the most viable path forward given the Democrats addiction to corporate funding (if corporations would still fund dems in this climate) and elevating candidates based primarily on their ability to fund raise (which is another way of saying... not piss off the corporate donors).For the rest of the Democrats, hopefully they are taking a different path this time. They had some direct power in Trump's first term which the wielded ineffectively, supported by the media with daily 'bombshells' on Trump's latest \\\\[*insert bullshit here*\\\\]. They \\"resisted\\" and got nowhere. This time, they have no direct power. The lost the presidency, the senate, the house, and the judicial branch. The leaves them with two choices:1/The Fetterman: AKA, accept the reality of the situation and try to position themselves to where they have as much influence as possible. If they can make it to the table, then Policy X might be slightly less shitty as a result. Something like... \\"give us this one thing and I can get you 10 Democratic votes so it looks to be somewhat bipartisan\\".2/The Schiff: Position themselves as the resistor-in-chief, clutch pearls and vocally attack every policy that comes out of this administration. These people will not be at the table, so Policy X is going to be the exact version Republicans propose. In short, shittier.Given these two choices, I think option 1 is the most reasonable path forward given Dems have no power. We've seen the results of 4 years of pointless squawking once before. The cynical perspective goes a step further and says that anyone taking option 2 basically has given up on governance and it just trying to create sound bites that can be used on the campaign trail.Sidenote: I think the oligarchs are a similar situation to Fetterman. Corporations have been writing public policy since the 1980's. Given how financing works, they indirectly owned the government. They too see that the Government now has the upper hand and can choke them out with the snap of their fingers. Better to sidle up and try to have some influence than to preach to the choir by endorsing the opposition, watch that half-baked candidate flame out, and then find yourself in the immediate crosshairs. While we all wanted to the government to start regulating corporations, I don't think we wanted it to happen this way.Bring on the billionaire saviors.","title":"Anyone else find it creepy how the majority of the Democrats have gone complete radio silent?"},{"text":"They literally replied, well, I didnt see it","title":"Man who stomped on officers' heads among Jan. 6 prisoners pardoned by Trump"},{"text":"You can but it takes months and can't just happen over night","title":"Trump administration puts federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff on leave"},{"text":"The old Pet cemetery switcheroo.?","title":"TikTok users allege censorship, altered algorithms after Trump saved platform"},{"text":"At least he's close to 80.

It was on the Dark Web specifically so its users could be anonymous to the FBI and other law enforcement.The purpose was for selling stuff that is highly illegal. Drugs, fake IDs, murder for hire, etc.If you tried to sell that stuff on Craigslist:1. Craigslist would take down the ad because its illegal.2. Even if Craigslist didnt take it down, the FBI would still come knocking at your door, because they would get your IP address. They would either get a warrant and go to Craigslist. Or if Craigslist refused to respond to the warrant (which would get Craigslist in legal trouble), they would go to Craigslists upstream ISP.So Silk Road was already in legal trouble for purposeful non-compliance with warrants. But theres an additional factor that made Silk Road (and Ulbricht) more liable than Craigslist.You see, Craigslist doesnt take a fee for whatever is sold. Thats why people on Craigslist  use cash, which is arguably more anonymous and better for drug deals than Bitcoin. But you cant send cash online. You can send Bitcoin online.So Silk Road was more like Amazon/eBay than Craigslist, and Ulbricht got rich off of every illegal transaction on his platform by taking a cut. This elevated his legal status from being merely complicit in the crimes to being a participant, which is why he was in so much trouble. I still think the sentence was overkill though.If his platform HAD been like Craigslist, I dont believe DOJ could give him much more than a slap on the wrist. He would still have some legal liability for ignoring takedown notices and warrants, but not nearly as much as the liability of directly enriching yourself from crime.","title":"Trump expected to commute Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht's life sentence"},{"text":"\\"He\\" can make it a \\"Job\\" but unless Congress authorizes it, they can't get any government funding.

They're making the assumption that they somehow \\"deserved\\" the bullying and need to fix things about themselves to not get bullied again. I think this is like that - they assume that, because their party lost the election, there must be something wrong with their party and that they deserve to be beaten up.It's better to look at the situation for what it really is - bullying is always the fault of the bully and stems from the bully's deep inner flaws - it doesn't have and doesn't need a logical reason, and there's nothing anybody can do to avoid being picked on by a person who is mentally and emotionally sick.Similarly, American voters made a horrible choice in voting for Trump because they've got a lot of mental and emotional problems, ignorance and bad understanding about both how government works and what it can and can't do, and they're terrible judges of personal character. Many of them have dysfunctional personal relationships with other humans in their lives and surroundings and personal histories of picking bad romantic partners because they don't know how to accurate assess someone's character and don't/can't control their own personal behavior. What I'm saying is that their voting choices reflect who they are as people, where they are in their lives (for too many, that's not a good place), and their own mental and emotional skills and education. Democrats could potentially do a lot for them in the form of providing social safety next and cracking down on some of the more toxic influences in society (like businesses that take advantage of people or function in ways to drive bad economic circumstances for the general population and a healthcare industry that gouges people and drives them to the brink more often than it helps them - all valid concerns that put people into desperate circumstances and unhealthy states of mind), but the fact is that no political party can entirely fix what's wrong with them, and some are probably angry that they can't. People can't control the genuinely bad circumstances around them that influence them for the worst, but they can still choose to accurately understand the sources of their problems, who and what to blame, and who or what would be most likely to help, as well as dropping some of their own preconceptions and personal preferences that drive them to choose toxic and destructive influences over more constructive ones.","title":"Trump starts new term with 47% approval; Jan. 6 pardons unpopular, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds"},{"text":"Now this is a zany retort, but without the /s I can't determine your degeneracy","title":"Convicted US Capitol rioter turns down Trump pardon"},{"text":"It was very normal if you live in a police/Nanny state like China or North Korea where praise of dear leader is compulsory.","title":"Is TikTok blocking anti-Trump content?

Hannity asked.Yeah, were talking about conditions to this disaster aid. Look, they are natural disasters, but there are man-made disasters as well, Johnson said. And they made terrible decisions, you know? They knew exactly what they were doing.That reservoir outside the Pacific Palisades, 117 million gallonsit was empty for a year. Why? They were trying to save a smelt fish or something, Johnson said.Hannity, who often acts as MAGAs shadow policymaker, asked a question that was ripped straight from the pages of Project 2025. A chapter written by Ken Cuccinelli, Trumps former deputy secretary of homeland security, suggested that funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency could be withheld from places that fail to comply with immigration laws, such as sanctuary cities.But even the authoritarian handbook added one caveat, noting that post-disaster or nonhumanitarian funding could be exempt from the immigration policy requirements.It seems that Johnson is way past concessions for the sake of humanity now. While its unclear from his answer whether he plans to use the wildfires to impose immigration policy, its clear he views it as an opportunity to reform liberal policies he doesnt like: namely environmental regulations.Johnsons line about smelt is one that Trump has been using to complain about Californias water conservation efforts since he was on the campaign trail. In reality, the reservoir was offline for repairs.By shifting the lions share of the blame onto the California government, Republicans seem to think they can buy themselves more time to play politics with money for struggling families who have lost their homes, businesses, and belongings.(Ghouls would have more common sense)","title":"Mike Johnson Says Hes Ready to Commit Political Blackmail - The House speaker now seems open to conditioning disaster aid over immigration policy."},{"text":"A Reichstag fire style emergency.","title":"Trump declared a national energy emergency.

Posts calling attention to the matter have racked up millions of likes.TikTok denied any difference on its part. Our policies and algorithms did not change over the weekend, a company spokesperson told Semafor.

We know from studying the psychology of crowds that it can usually only take a few negative members to take a tense mob and cause a riot. So when it was done and the government just arrested anyone involved, the majority of them were innocent for the most part. Pardoning them would actually be exactly what someone who believed that would want, as their view was that it was a tiny minority that actually caused the trouble and everyone else shouldn't be punished, but since they cant pick out who was antifa and who wasn't, they just blanket pardon everyone to prevent the innocent from being harmed. So I think it was just an excuse, not realistic in the slightest, but if you did believe this, you would reasonably believe that because it was only a small portion acting malicious you don't arrest everyone. Better to protect the freedoms of the innocent when you cant point out the agitators. And this logic was argued the same when people called on entire Black Lives Matters protests to be arrested because a small portion was looting nearby shops. Unless the government could target those specific criminals it would be madness to arrest everyone else who didn't. I don't buy the Antifa did it claims, but if I did, what Trump is doing would seem reasonable, and that is the point, Trump is doing what his voting based thinks is reasonable. If you think he is just blatantly lying about Antifa, this isn't him showing his true colors, he's acting as someone with that mentality would do, he's keeping the act up. Interviews of him saying that those innocents shouldn't be imprisoned for the crimes of Antifa and other agitators are consistent.   \\nMy point is that if you think he is grifting, he's keeping the grift going with this action, not showing the truth.","title":"CMV: Trump pardoning 1/6 rioters is proof that Trump and other MAGA leaders knowingly lied to the public about Antifa being responsible."},{"text":"What does that actually mean?

He doesnt believe there should be compensation for past injustices or for the stereotyping and discrimination faced by Black and Brown people.When Lyndon Johnson signed executive orders aimed at equalizing opportunities, they led to affirmative action and opened doors for many people to access jobs and education. However, Trump has repealed those orders, sending a clear message that he wants to undo those efforts.The great irony is that while we see nepotism and privilege benefiting the wealthy and well-connected in society, many disadvantaged kids are left behind. Trumps actions resonate with his base, who see this rollback as red meata fulfillment of their desire to return to a past they idealize.KK - With the UK, unless this sparks a broader shift across Europewhere people feel we've gone too far in levelling the playing field and helping those whove historically been disadvantagedthe impact might remain limited. However, if Americans take this approach, it could influence trends worldwide, particularly if corporations follow suit.This executive order primarily targets government agencies, but if multinational corporations begin rolling back their diversity initiatives, such as efforts to diversify leadership, it could have a significant global impact. Thats how I see it potentially affecting the UK and beyond.","title":"Hi r/politics! We're Anthony Scaramucci and Katty Kay, the hosts of The Rest Is Politics: US podcast.

President Tusk of Poland, for example, has already stated that this is not a time for Europe to skimp on its own security.

This belief extends beyond Trumps presidency, with the realization that future U.S. presidents may also expect Europe to shoulder more of the burden.However, this perspective is not universally accepted. Some European politicians argue that increasing defense spending to five percent of GDP would strain already tight budgets. They warn that such a move could lead to cuts in essential social services like healthcare and education, undermining the social contract that many European countries rely on.These cuts, they argue, could provoke widespread discontent among citizens and result in far-right populist governments gaining power across Europe.

Ive watched the video several times, and while its initially shocking, it seems more like a moment of exuberance. His hand is slightly off to the side, not directly in front of him, and he doesnt say anything resembling a Nazi phrase. It comes across as a spontaneous gesturean arm thrown out while feeling expansive, especially since hed just been talking about going to Mars.Twitteror Xdefended Musk by sharing numerous images of celebrities, including Taylor Swift and AOC, making similar hand gestures in the past. However, reactions were mixed. In Israel, Haaretz referred to it as a Nazi salute, while the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in the U.S., which defends Jewish rights, took a more measured stance. They called it \\"unfortunate\\" but didnt believe it was an intentional Nazi salute and were willing to give Musk the benefit of the doubt.Ive reviewed the footage multiple times, and I dont think he deliberately meant it as a Nazi salute. Some may disagree, and I might catch flak for saying thisespecially from the leftbut I believe Musk can plausibly argue that this wasnt his intent.AS - I agree with you, and it seems Im not alone. Jon Stewart, from The Daily Show, spoofed the whole situation but ultimately gave Elon the benefit of the doubt. He joked that Musk was probably just trying to share his heart when he snapped his shoulder and forearm.In his humor, I dont think Stewartor anyone watching closelybelieved Elon was genuinely trying to emulate a Nazi gesture in that moment.KK - I think this is another instance where opposition to Donald Trumpor, in this case, Elon Muskgets overly worked up. As weve often said, you need to watch what Trump does, not just what he says. The same principle applies to Musk.Dont get distracted by moments like this. Personally, I give him the benefit of the doubt hereI dont think it was intentional. People can make unfortunate gestures without meaning to, as countless videos are now showing us.Instead, focus on the bigger picture. Theres a lot happening that is genuinely alarming, unconventional, and far from normal. Its important to keep attention on the things of real substance.","title":"Hi r/politics!

That's on you. The law is better suited to create a safe and stable society. It succeeds in some ways (murder, theft) and the government has vastly over-extended it in other areas (the war on drugs).Murder is wrongI think murder would be far from uncommon if it were legal. Every murder leaves a hole in a community and having a law against it with severe punishment helps minimize the instability that it creates.I did the math on the war on drugs for a living for several years. We arrest people for the drugs and the drugs keep happening and the only thing that really happens that we've creating a huge underclass of people who are locked out of being productive members of society because of their convicted felon status. Eradicating addiction would make us a more safe and stable society but it's pretty obvious that the legal system is not up to the task.Law enforcement- police and the courts both- work hard to maintain a good relationship with the community. If stop and frisk taught us anything it's that you probably can arrest your way out of quality-of-life problems but it strains the courts and causes the community to resent the police on a deep level. Which doesn't help the police when they need to solve serious crimes that basically require someone to come forward. If you want to convict someone of murder and there are no eyewitnesses, nothing on a camera, no weapon, just a body then the case goes cold fast. 1/3 murders are ever solved.As they say in the military, never give an order that the soldiers can't follow.Which brings us to abortion and the law. Abortion prevents children from being born into less than ideal, less than loving situations. It's interesting how crime dropped dramatically in the early 1990s- 18 years after Roe v Wade and 14-20 years after the birth rate started dropping hard in the United States. If we're learning anything from Texas's abortion laws, bans on abortion put women's health at risk because what doctor wants to become criminally liable for making the wrong call?To me, abortion laws are closer to drug laws than murder laws in that they don't seem to contribute to the stability of a community and they create paths to criminality rather than justice. More children born into tenuous situations means more children who are likely to turn to crime. It means more people, probably women, whose lives are frozen for decades in the suspended animation of young, poor parenthood. I grew up under the boot of Catholicism and if I made these arguments, the Catholics would fire back with talk about how I'm not giving the children or parents a whole lot of credit, I mean, that kid could be the next Barack Obama or something but the fact is the law of averages is a law for a reason; most of us don't live more than 100 miles away from our birthplace.what exactly is the value of that \\"potential life\\" relative to an actual baby being born?All things considered, it tends to zero. We all have so much potential, but we live finite lives.

Unless someone like Don Jr. or Ivanka steps in, the personality cult associated with Trump wont be a factor in the next election. This gives Democrats an opportunity to shift the narrative away from Trumps influence.That said, lets not forget that Trump didnt win a mandate. His victory came from a narrow margina slim electoral outcome, with just one additional House member, a few more senators, and 50.5% of the vote. His success hinged on a few hundred thousand votes in swing states. While he did win those contested states, it doesnt equate to broad support.A savvy Democratic politician could capitalize on this. For example, Ro Khanna, a Democrat from Silicon Valley with a compelling backstory and policy vision, could be an intriguing option. So, its far too early to write off the Democrats.One more point about the American electorate: they often gravitate toward what they feel theyre missing. After the bombastic and unpredictable Trump presidency, they opted for the seasoned, stable \\"grandfather\\" figure during COVID. But as that figure has faded, theyve returned to the \\"crazy uncle.\\"However, the electorate may eventually tire of the chaos and look for something new. That shift could open up significant opportunities for Democrats moving forward.KK - One thing the Democrats have mentioned to me a few times is the significance of 2026. Theyre feeling confident about their chances of taking back the House in two years, especially given what you just said, Anthony. If Donald Trump overreaches, the polling suggests an interesting dynamic: while many Americans support his policies, they prefer a \\"MAGA-lite\\" version, not the extreme \\"ultra-MAGA.\\"Democrats are focused on 2026 but are also doing a lot of soul-searching. One Democratic congresswoman I spoke to this week was very candid. She said theyve had extensive discussions and presentations about understanding where they went wrongwho they failed to reach, how they didnt communicate effectively, and where they didnt listen.However, she admitted they havent yet adequately addressed how to counter Trump. That said, the Democrats are more unified than the Republicans, which could work to their advantage.We havent heard much from the Democrats recently, but itll be interesting to see how they frame their strategy as developments unfold in the Trump administration.","title":"Hi r/politics!

I've got 2 questions, one for Mrs. Kay, one for Mr. Scaramucci:\\nTo KK - Do you think the euphemistic coverage of the controversial Musk salute(s) by the American mass media (eg. NYT - \\"Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture\\") was par for the course, or is it an early example of media self-censorship during the Trump presidency??Most foreign media were describing \\"Nazi salutes\\" (in Germany the term was \\"Hitlergr?e\\") and the difference seemed pretty stark to me. And if yes, is it a recent phenomenon or was there always editorial pressure not to press the sitting administration too hard?\\nTo AS - You often talk about the strength of the Biden economy, but are impersonal indicators like GDP or stock market growth a sign of a healthy real economy? I presume someone working 3 jobs and paying exorbitant amounts of money for insurance premiums, childcare, etc. would statistically contribute to GDP growth, but would personally probably feel like the economy isn't working for him.","title":"Hi r/politics!

There's a reason why it's usually conservatives who are complaining about liberals not wanting to be their friends to the point of calling them narrow-minded, close-minded, whatever.

I ended up doing an official Jewish conversion in my 20s and I vibe a lot better with the Jewish philosophical stance. So I'm gonna ground this argument within a spiritual context which I think is maybe the best avenue given your personal stance and background. Abortion is zero percent immoral or sinful or anything like that within Judaism AND Judaism also holds the preservation of life as the absolute highest standard there is (every commandment can be broken if doing so would preserve life period the end). This might seem like a contradiction but it's really not bc simply put a fetus isn't a whole entire alive person like someone who's been born is. Adam didn't become alive until the creator breathed the breath of life into him, in the same vein none of us becomes alive until we take our first breath. Before that point we are essentially in the process of being constructed but we are not yet a fully alive person until we are born. In this framework it's not a moral issue to remove a fetus from a pregnant person bc removing a fetus is not murder bc the fetus is not alive yet, it just isn't, and there's not actually a spiritual reason to believe that it is. There is no point in any biblical teachings for any of the Abrahamic religions where a fetus is considered the same as an alive person and definitely it doesn't say anything about life beginning at conception, that's a human invention. So if you're coming at it from a religious perspective why would you choose to base your concept of morality on a human invention that has nothing to do with the word of the Creator? Isn't that the opposite of what we're supposed to be doing? Perverting the word of G-d with man-made inventions is something we're directly and explicitly told not to do and, unfortunately, Christianity has a whole lot of that (which is one of the reasons I personally do not vibe with it). If you value your own personal religious connection it might be worth examining why this is even a thing in the first place. You can definitely have a personal relationship with the creator without strongly believing in the things humans have made up to add on to it. The other part of this is that sin and morality is a personal thing, which is to say it's a choice individuals make. We were all given free will as a gift from the creator, we have the right to make whatever choices we want no matter how immoral they are. The creator himself didn't even intervene with \\"origin sin\\" bc we are supposed to make our choices ourselves. So if abortion is immoral, OK fine, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't be allowed to make that choice for themselves. If this is coming from a religious perspective then one of the key things there is that we each get to choose and we each manage our relationships with the divine all on our own. Why try to prevent people from making their own moral choices when even the Creator would never do that? The laws and commandments don't exist to tell us what to do and what not to do, they exist to give us a framework for evaluating our own choices, and those choices always remain ours. Morality only matters within the context of free will, without the ability to choose morality is irrelevant. So even if abortion is immoral (which it arguably isnt), just as the original humans were not prevented from eating from the tree of knowledge bc choice is a fundamental right of our species gifted by the creator, so to must we all be free to choose everything else. Even if abortion is immoral the free choice of it all makes the most sense within this religious context.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"How can any police person support this man?","title":"Trump defends pardons for rioters and suggests Proud Boys could have place in politics"},{"text":"15 years of our government being sold to the highest bidder.Even Warren G.

Whether abortion is wrong depends on how you place value on all life and/or whether you conceptualize of fetuses as people.

We don't grant citizenship upon conception, but live birth. Murder is defined by state and federal laws. If abortion was murder, then abortions bans wouldn't be necessary as they would be treated as any other murder case as all of the states banning abortion have laws against murder.Additionally, the result of overturning *Roe* and the addition of new abortions bans only resulted *in more abortions nationally.* Is a public policy that causes more abortion truly in opposition to abortion? I'd say no. A policy that opposes abortion is one that reduces abortion: rigorous sex education, easy access to contraception, access to reproductive healthcare. If someone doesn't support these things, they are in favor of more abortions, regardless of supporting any bans, because the outcomes are what we examine, not the intentions.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"There are other things that happen to your body because of pregnancy than death.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"Indeed.","title":"Musk bashes Trump-backed Stargate deal: \\"They don't actually have the money\\""},{"text":"You realize that all these plans a policies are what Trump ran on.

We know from Steve Bannon's approach during Trump's first termflooding the zone with news stories and outrage to shock and overwhelm people. This tactic throws opponents off balance, leaving them unsure of what to focus on. I think we're seeing some of that again this time around.However, I also believe theres a more deliberate and thoughtful approach this time. They've spent more time carefully considering the policies they want to implement early on and strategizing how to advance his agenda quickly. These executive orders are, in a sense, a way to get a head start.Trump understands he has only two years to make significant progress, so hes moving fast. Hes also more aware now, compared to his first term, that the machinery of American government moves slowly, which makes this early push all the more critical.AS - You know, I think theres a bit of a shell game going on here. In addition to confounding his adversaries in the media, Trump enjoys doing the same with his staff. He often pits one person against another, saying one thing to one person and something entirely different to another. Then, he sits back, snickering as he watches them argue.The resulting infighting distracts from their productivity, but in his mind, it somehow elevates him. For Trump, theres only ever one star on the stage, one spotlightand thats him. So yes, I do think theres a level of premeditation in all of this.","title":"Hi r/politics!

Naturally, he relies on aides and lawyers to review these executive orders, ensuring they have a solid legal foundation.Input also comes from various sources, including contributors to Project 2025. While Trump distanced himself from the project during the campaign, its clear that many ideas from it have influenced these executive orders.During the campaign and transition period, a dedicated team worked on crafting these orders, enabling Trump to appeal to his base while articulating his vision. These ideas werent created in isolation; they were thoroughly vetted by legal teams to ensure they could withstand scrutiny.AS - Trump is highly intuitive. While he may not be as literate as some of the people around him, he has a knack for quickly deciding yes or no when presented with an idea. He is also meticulous.

It isn't magic. Exploit development isn't just a matter of writing code and hitting a green upload button or banging on a keyboard and announcing to the camera 'I'm in'. Nothing about it is basic. Even if someone wrote the modified firmware and plugged a USB key with the firmware on it and hit 'flash firmware' on the machine, firmware typically comes with a checksum and cryptographic signature on the checksum verifying it came from someone with the cryptographic key and the machine would reject the bugged firmware.\\nInstead, to do what you're talking about, someone would have to open up each machine and make significant hardware modifications to it using either a hot air rework if the chips are on as QFPs or more likely BGA rework which is a royal bitch involving X-ray machines and other things. It is very unlikely that they left JTAG or serial ports exposed and active in a way that'd allow someone to compromise it.\\nAnd let's say they managed to do one. They'd have to remove it from the premises, modify it, and return it. Or they'd have to compromise the repair shop in a way that wouldn't be detected and apply a procedure on hundreds if not thousands of machines that were otherwise known to be working in a way that'd raise red flags with engineers such as me that'd look at the number of reported malfunctioning machines or the standard maintenance procedures needed on them and sound an alarm about abnormal shit happening, or they'd have to have a gun to the head of the folks who make the machines and having it done in-house and then having it applied only to those machines. Which again, a regional-specific update would have raised red flags and it's very likely the machines don't know where they are, so nationally pushing compromised firmware that did what you're saying it does wouldn't work.\\nI was just in a thread where people were talking about dumbasses 'doing their own research' on Youtube instead of talking with experts. Hi. I'm a PCB engineer/software engineer specializing in HPC, currently on disability and coming off of it by freelancing in high performance computing/kubernetes/cloud engineering and programming.
