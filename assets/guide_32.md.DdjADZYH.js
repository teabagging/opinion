There were quite a few voters who seemingly voted Trump for president and then for progressives down ballot.  This tells me at least some of those voters were trying to send a message about being tired of the status quo in the presidency.  Sure, some of those voters were deceived on who/what Trump is but many were just sick and tired of how things are and are hoping that ANY change will be for the better.2. The Democratic party absolutely HAS to change how it views policy and strategy to remain relevant.  The GOP feasts on Dems trying to stay centrist or even center-right.  We will NEVER win over republican voters en masse by trying to be conservative because the GOP will ALWAYS be more conservative.  We WILL demoralize and lose progressive voters but failing to represent them meaningfully.\\n3. First-past-the-post election systems have to go.  I will never quit pounding the drum for ranked choice voting or some other similar change.

To an authoritarian, power and status are the same thing so despite brining them no material benefits you are effectively elevating your supporters onto a pedestal by putting those they hate and despise \\"back in their place\\". That's why so many of the people targeting racists, misogynists, fascists, religious fundamentalists, ..., are effectively scammers (this is true throughout history). This works (at least on them) because, once you believe social progress is impossible and undesirable, social change must be a zero sum game, i.e. other people's loss becomes your gain and vice versa, other people moving towards equality is an attack on your privileges, ..., and so on. So when your supporters are reactionary and authoritarian, taking away the rights of others is an effective substitute for actual socioeconomic gains (at least for a while).","title":"Trumps Pro-Corporate Populism Cannot Last"},{"text":"Orwell.","title":"Trump vows to hire American.

Yes, they've received some money but the vast amount of support has been in equipment. Equipment that needed to be replaced, which resulted in money being spent in the US creating jobs/supporting the military industrial complex.

The irony of this fight happening in the same week Trump gave an interview where he was asked how he responds to the press releases from retailers like Walmart and Home Depot that his tariffs will raise prices for consumers and he basically said, \\"the market will figure it out,\\" but no one would dare suggest the market should figure our the value of agricultural products. Somehow making food isn't a profitable enterprise without government money? Give me a break. If a democrat suggested using taxpayer dollars to pay grocery chains to keep prices low on eggs, milk, bread, and produce republicans would LOSE THEIR MINDS, because that money would directly benefit you and me, but if you just move the money further back on the production chain they love it because that money instead goes to Cargill, Smithfield, Bayer, JBS, and Syngenta because those politicians have stock in those companies or want a seat on their Board of Directors when they leave Congress.","title":"Johnson faces brewing GOP rebellion after farm aid deal collapses  Speaker Mike Johnsons team is scrambling to find a fix.

It's a blatant display of cronyism and corruption, reminiscent of the Gilded Age or even ancient Rome, where emperors would hold court and grant favors to their loyal subjects.The parallels to history are striking. I mean, think about it - the robber barons of the late 19th century used to hold similar gatherings, where they'd flaunt their wealth and influence, and curry favor with politicians. And now, we're seeing the same thing play out with Trump's corporate coronation. It's like we've learned nothing from history, and we're doomed to repeat the same mistakes.What's even more disturbing is that this is all happening in plain sight, with the media and the public largely complicit. It's like we're living in a bad satire, where the absurdity of it all is just too much to bear. I mean, who needs satire when you have Trump holding court at Mar-a-Lago, surrounded by his sycophants and admirers?

They provide insulation from financial risk by pooling risk across a number of people. In selling their product they have already factored in a profit margin and are able to do this because they have a significant information advantage. The average consumer of health care is not able to accurately predict how much health care they will need, while the insurance company insuring 100,000 people does know how much healthcare a group of 100,000 people is going to need.This is only part of it. The first is correct, in broad numbers, insurance companies know how to predict claims. This is quite easy because you have a large number of people and statistics work.The part you missed was the individual. This is a sample of one. All the statistics in the world aren't going to give you a very good prediction because of the standard deviation. This is why individuals pool resources and pay a premium to transfer risk to the insurance company.You insurance premium consists of two parts. The first is the expected or planned amount of healthcare needs. The second is the premium paid to transfer risk of having *more* healthcare costs than expected. But recently insurance companies want to have their cake and eat it to. They want to sell you health insurance that already costs you more than your health care (on average) will cost, but then when you use health care, turn around and say \\"actually we aren't going to pay for that health care you recieved.\\" So they still get paid, but they haven't done what you are paying them for (decreasing your risk of massive healthcare bills).This is called managing costs. It is a requirement to keep premiums low. Insurance companies are mandated to return 80-85% of premiums collected to claims. The remaining is for administration and profit. An insurer who denies all claims would be shut down by the insurance commission for violating this rule. One also needs to look at the denials with more detail. Initial denials can be for a lot of reasons - including the requirement to try other treatment options (lower cost) first. They can also be because paperwork is missing or justifications are missing. What is more interesting  is what is the rate of final denials or rate of denials that go to arbitration/court to be settled.Yes, there are other valid critiques of every aspect of how health care is delivered in our country, but insurance companies that don't actually cover your healthcare costs are purely parasiticExcept they are required by law to do this. What you are not happy about is companies who don't just 'pay everything' and instead refer back to the plan documents for what is and is not covered and what procedures need to be followed for preauthorizations. Cost control must be done to keep insurance affordable. There is no way around it.","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"I hope this guy is given the job to liaise with the House for bills Trump wants to pass","title":"Trump hires former official who allegedly participated in January 6"},{"text":"Trump will never be in the office.

That's why they're going to cheat.Reactionary populism \\"works\\" because the reactionary idea of a social and moral hierarchy based on identity can be used to placate normal people by giving them an underclass to look down on and oppress (often by proxy) as they are being looked down on and oppressed in turn (and for real) by the rich people eating all the pie. But that only works for the true believers. To keep the support of disaffected moderates you can't just make life for someone else worse and tell them how lucky they are for not being those people. You need to actually improve their lives, which can't be done because, as a reactionary movement, you exist to serve the socioeconomic elite who will not compromise on getting every more profits and owning ever more assets. They want it all.So you need to tilt the playing field, make competitive elections impossible, turn democracy into oligarchy. Since your reactionary base will be hostile to both: when push comes to shove, they don't want a king; they want *to be* the king. So you need to distract them. The strategy will therefore be full on oligarchic socioeconomic policy to keep their paymasters happy while attempting to turn the resulting rage towards minorities and other acceptable targets. Secondly, because that's not enough, they will subvert the USA's electoral system, which is not very hard since you only need to cheat in some places and in comparatively low numbers. Thirdly, they will politicize its security and legal apparatus so they can turn it on the populace when the latter refuses to accept the falsified results and starts protesting.Unless they are really stupid, they will do any of those things and stand a pretty good chance to keep power for a while. The USA is particularly vulnerable to these tactics due to various aspects of its electoral, political and economic systems (ossified two-party system, politics revolving around personalities who can be targeted, suppressed unions, large bloc of reactionary religious voters who can be easily mobilized, history of executive overreach, politicized legal systems and police force, dysfunctional electoral system, existence of large propaganda outlets, an economy that is already fairly oligarchic, lots of legal corruption, ...). On the flip side is the fact that the USA has a tradition of militant democracy at least equally as strong as the religious / reactionary / fascist tradition on the other side.

I think that your connection between UFO belief and religions is an apt one.To be vulnerable, I can identify with this. I grew up in a Christian cult, and though Ive been an avowed atheist for years now, I can feel that learned desire for a savior figure inside of myself. Ive always been fascinated with aliens, and when I was young and in the cult, there were many around me who believed that UFO or alien sightings were encounters with angels or demons, often pointing to biblical narratives as proof. I can find the exact same arguments in all of the UFO subs right now.I can definitely sense a lack of critical thinking in myself when I watch one of the more believable drone videos. It IS comforting to feel like a non human intelligence is coming to save the day or at least provide enough conflict that it helps redirect the energy of human civilization to fight a common enemy. More than any of that, though: its fun. Its just fun to consider, even for a minute, that aliens are on earth. It produces a sense of wonder (also a religious phenomenon), and when engaging in that belief with other believers, helps one find a sense of community. Thats exactly why so many people embrace evangelicalism and other styles of fundamentalist religious beliefs. Frankly, thats why people join any sort of movement. A feeling of groupthink and the recognition of others is extremely powerful.Thanks for sharing.

I mean, you dont even have to stretch what he said at all to try and make it fit into that narrative; he just outright said that. I believe him. I feel pretty comfortable saying that he was likely the puppet master over the past four years. As for whats going on now, Id put my money on the deep state and rogue agencies running things and trying their hardest to do as much nefarious shit as they can before Trump gets inaugurated. Again, it isnt really a stretch to believe this theory either. So ultimately, Biden has been a figurehead for the last four years, Obama got his third term, there more or less isnt an acting president at the moment, and bureaucrats in corrupt agencies are trying to sabotage Trump as much as the can before his is back in office and hopefully scatters their corruption into the wind.

You wouldn't kill someone you love, you wouldn't steal from someone you love, etc etc. Jesus emphasizes so much the importance of brotherly love and kindness towards others, how greed is the root of evil, how people should hate the world in order to receive the new world of Christ...yet people don't do any of this? Many people are hypocrites consumed by the world and spearheaded by their flesh. It's sad. Worst of all, they lack the strength of will to make any attempts to repent because they're enjoying the 360 VR dopamine goonfest that this world is, essentially.If people want to weaponize, or highlight, Christianity, then it needs to start with the most prioritized verses: Matthew 22:36-40^(36)?Master, which is the great commandment in the law?^(37)?Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.^(38)?This is the first and great commandment.^(39)?And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.^(40)?On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.Something so simple, yet so effective, and despite over **TWO THOUSAND YEARS (24,000 months+**), people have not changed. Psalms and Proverbs are FILLED TO THE BRIM with the **same** problems we see **today: greed, injustice, inequality, power abuses, etc.** AND GUESS WHAT? Many times in the Old Testament, God has warned, and then completely and utterly *annihilated* MANY cities because they were just unloving and selfish people. Read the book of Jeremiah and while you're at it, the Sermon on the Mount.The church puts so much emphasis on irrelevancy. People don't even read the word for themselves. Heaven is going to be oh so sweetly empty as Jesus casts out the lukewarm \\"christians\\" who he never knew!!!!!*the funniest part is that I'm not even christian (anymore) yet i follow Matthew 22:36-40 100% because it literally makes so much sense to be a kind and empathetic person. sermon on the mount literally encourages everyone to be kinder than the evils of their enemy. again: empty heaven*","title":"Reversing the \\"weaponization of Christianity\\": How \\"religous freedom\\" can be used to fight Trumpism"},{"text":"Fuck me, elderly care on that list is a whole problem in itself.

He still thinks project warp speed was a good idea.  He made a few good cabinet picks, but only a few out of the hundred picks he has, and every pick has been very pro-Israel.  Also, I think it was in his speech at the RNC though I can't find a video of it, where he talked about two Israeli activists coming to visit him while he was in office, giving him some information, and then, without checking with anyone else to verify the information or ask about the other side of the issue, he gave them the Golan Heights, more than they were even hoping to get from him.  This is something he was proudly telling the audience like it was a great achievement.    \\n  \\nSo is he really going to go in there and burn Israel's blackmail operation, when probably most of those people are probably still active assets?  Even if that's somehow his honest intention, it seems likely that some Israeli assets will visit him, suck up to him, give him some false information, and without bothering to talk to anyone else, he'll not only agree to not release the list, he'll also give them more than they were asking for by burning it so that it can never be released.It's debatable what Trump's intentions are, but he's so easily manipulated that it doesn't really matter what his intentions are.  He almost might as well be the deep state himself.  For example, where did project warp speed come from?  Did he think of it, or did he have a meeting with a bunch of deep state people like Dr. Fauci that he never bothered to replace, they proposed it, and he ran with it as his idea?  If he'd come out and say \\"that was a mistake, I shouldn't have listened to those people\\" then I'd think we have hope, but he still to this day thinks he made the right decision.  So has he really learned anything?  It seems so natural to say \\"but now he's learned\\" in a situation like this because basically anyone else would have, but Trump, other than a small fraction of his cabinet picks, which may well be lucky accidents more than wisdom, hasn't done anything to demonstrate that he's learned anything.Another example:  When Twitter basically forced Trump to commit to not putting Mike Pompeo in his cabinet, what would have happened if Twitter hadn't done that?  If Trump had learned anything, Mike Pompeo wouldn't have been a possibility.","title":"Taking a chance and sharing my magnum opus here.

And farther, he saw that the covering fire from the maze itself had long since halted. He was alone as he knew he would be.He struggled and kicked out at another ant, sending it sliding and at the same time pushing himself and his cargo further up the slope.

He reached for Bolov's forearm and began to work the relays.Bolov, seeing what he was doing, began to sob. He tried, feebly, to struggle out of Felix's grasp. But Felix held him firmly against the slope, slapping away his futilely waving arms. Grimly, he continued to work the relays.

Certainly, the company policy introduced by the CEO has much more severe effects on many more people than the actions of doctors/hospitals.I could agree if you argue that pharmaceutical companies are at a similar level of guilt to the CEO because they artificially inflate drug prices, but I don't think you can compare them to the rest.","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"Awesome","title":"Another Obama-appointed judge rescinds senior status and becomes third on federal bench to pull reverse retirement on Trump since he won the election"},{"text":"UK here, we've got conservatives larping as social democrats, conservatives, insane conservatives, neoliberals, and the scots.

Many countries have different tax years to the US, so even just getting the documents needed to file US taxes isn't always easy.Then there's the tax treaties that often don't line up very well. Like in Australia, there is a mandatory retirement savings account that by law the employers must put a percentage of their workers income into. The IRS however doesn't view these as qualified retirement savings accounts so tries to tax these Australian earned, Australian based retirement savings accounts that US citizens in Australia had no choice about even having in the first place. Then there's things like phantom taxes where you could end up owing US taxes on the sale of your non-US assets such as your family home even if you made a very modest gain or even a loss in your actual local currency.All in all getting professional help is often what's needed to help navigate the pitfalls but you can't use any run of the mill US accountant. You need a specialised cross border tax advisor who is knowledgeable in both US and the local tax code. These usually start at a few hundred USD but even doing something as simple as driving for Uber or selling products on Etsy can suddenly make you self employed and add complexity and therefore cost to your US tax filing. A US citizen living abroad owns their own business that has no connection to the US other than the owner being a US citizen? Well the IRS may view that as a foreign subsidiary of a US corporation so they'll try and get you on corporate taxes too.So even if no US tax is actually owed it can still cost US citizens abroad thousands each year to remain US tax compliant either directly through hiring tax advisors or indirectly through being unable to make certain financial decisions due to potential US tax and reporting issues.It's not just the filing though it's other related laws like FATCA which means that many non-US financial institutions limit or outright deny services to US citizens because they aren't worth the potentially bankrupting sanctions for even inadvertently not complying with FATCA. So when a US citizen abroad gets fed up with dealing with all this and decides that moving forward that giving up their US citizenship is the best option the US gives them a final burden to get over. While most countries don't make it so difficult for their citizens to live abroad to the point that they feel they need to give up their citizenship, if for some reason they want to give it up it can usually be done by mail and for free or a small nominal fee at most. The US on the other hand requires a visit to a consulate so you better hope you live close to one. Then appointment times are limited and there is often an 18 month+ wait for the appointment. Then there's the fee which is USD2350, the highest in the world by a large margin.So the country that likes the claim it's the freest in the world (which should include the freedom to live outside it's borders), makes it increasingly difficult for its citizens to live abroad and fully integrate into their new life abroad and then puts up barriers and makes it cost prohibitive to many people to actually give up the one thing that will allow them to full integrate into their life abroad.","title":"Universities warn international students to return before Trump inauguration"},{"text":"Same thing it always meant.

I agree with your post but I do think I should note that an insurance executive being \\"guilty\\" of helping to perpetuate a system of immorality is almost entirely powerless to control that \\"guilt\\", thus the guilt actually falls on the company itself even though the executive is technically \\"guilty\\" by association.My personal views on this issue are very complicated. As a Canadian who has observed multiple glaring failures in our so-called \\"universal\\" healthcare system, as well as misconceptions from Americans about how our system here works and also having known several people either die or get progressively worse waiting for healthcare to the point where some Canadians are selling their assets and travelling to foreign countries (including America itself) for timely, efficient healthcare, I find that I'm too emotional when it comes to debating anything healthcare-related. I also have a number of American friends who could have received free healthcare through various charities and hospitals but refused because the charity was affiliated with a religion they didn't like or because they felt like they weren't \\"sick enough\\" to need to rely on charity even when their illness or injury was very severe.This being said, my basic view is that while the responsibility doesn't directly fall on the shoulders of insurance companies, insurance companies are at least partly \\"guilty\\" in the sense that they present themselves as a safety net there to help average Americans in a sort of gaslighting while simultaneously doing everything in their power to make getting coverage as difficult, cumbersome and overcomplicated as it can possibly be, while fundamentally they must know that they are doing this to people who are at their most exhausted and vulnerable. Insurance is a product and like any product there's a cost, but insurance companies essentially get you to pay up-front for a product that doesn't yet exist and will only exist if you meet their never-ending sea of terms and conditions. The shift away from paper to digital applications has made things even more complicated - some insurance companies now require multi-factor authentication, are incorporating the usage of \\"bots\\" in lieu of customer service from a real human being, use flashy web graphics that don't work properly or display properly on older devices... even from a capitalist standpoint, it makes no sense to be paying for a product that you'll only receive if the seller (the insurance company itself) approves your claim to it under their terms and conditions. To be fair universities run on a similar model wherein tuition is paid up-front with the promise of an education, but in this case there's a good faith mutual agreement and the student is actually in the active progress of receiving the education unless they do something wrong or fail to study and do the work. It's a little different when you're paying an insurance company for something intangible until the point at which you actually need it, after which you have to jump through hoops to prove you really need it at a time when you may be severely sick or injured and in no position to be haggling. There's an episode of the crime drama TV series Cold Case that I would argue everybody interested in the healthcare debate should watch titled \\"Sabotage\\" (yes, it also focuses around a vigilante who took the law into his own hands). It illustrates very well the trajectory the average American may soon be facing in an increasingly globalized dog-eat-dog world and how the problem is the system more than it is any one individual or even corporation. Still, it does illustrate very well that the increasing apathy within the corporate world to the plight of the individual is ultimately going to lead to apathy back in turn. What the insurance company probably perceives as \\"nothing personal, just business\\" is of course perceived as very cruel and personal to the man who just held his little girl's hand as she died from what could have been a treatable cancer had the insurance company approved his claim, or the parents who have to use the money they'd been saving for their son's college tuition to pay for dad's shoulder surgery because his claim was denied. It feels especially personal if you've been actively making insurance payments to that company so that you could access that safety net when you needed it.I don't wish to debate vigilatism either, but look, we do need to address the elephant in the room but only in a very indirect way. I don't think it's ever moral or justified to murder or cause harm to a person simply because they're high-up in a corporation (and I am extremely disturbed by the number of people who find it justified or even comedic that a husband and father was gunned down in the street by a mentally unhinged assassin). Why I bring this up is because I don't believe the average American is aware of just how little power and control a CEO or CFO actually has over a corporation, especially if that corporation is publicly-traded. A corporation's legal mandate is to make money, as much money as it possibly can, not to lose money. If a CEO does the moral thing but not the moneymaking thing, he/she will simply be voted out of their position by their shareholders and replaced, and the corporation will continue doing whatever makes the most money, essentially continuing the exact same immoral behaviour. Even if a company is private, its goal is still to make money and if any employee or representative of that company decides to infringe upon this pattern in order to do the moral thing, they'll eventually just be terminated, demoted or replaced, or they'll keep their position until the company hemorrhages money and another company will just move into that space and keep perpetuating the same pattern as before. I would argue that this does make the insurance company itself \\"guilty\\" and that admitting this reality doesn't have to mean supporting vigilantism or hurting individual people.","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"I think thats another way to say what I tried to say.

His lawyer, Tim Parlatore, told CNN last month that Hegseth settled because it was during the #MeToo movement and he didnt want to lose his job at Fox News if the accusation became public.That's sugarcoating it.Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in California after a speaking engagement. It's been reported that he barred the door to her hotel room and took away her cell phone before assaulting her.  Although Hegseth denied the allegations and was never charged, he did pay a settlement to the accuser.The settlement also included a confidentiality agreement.And while Hegseth was under investigation for the assault, his account of the events that transpired kept changing.In the end, Hegseth's explanation/rationalization wasn't as tactful as the article is making it out to be. He's a well-known sexist, so he just ended up resorting to victim blaming, lambasting the metoo movement and cancel culture for him being held remotely accountable. I don't even know if you can call it accountability, but at least it's catching up with him now.And this isn't the only time he's tried to blame things like \\"wokeness\\" for him receiving pushback due to his misconduct.Hegseth has been accused of being an extremist. A fellow service member once called him an \\"insider threat\\" after seeing a tattoo of his that's associated with white supremacist groups. The Army considers an insider threat someone who is a malicious threat to an organization that comes from a person or people within the organization.Hegseth blamed these criticisms on \\"wokeness,\\" and even wrote a book about it titled, The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free. The War on Warriors uncovers the deep roots of our dysfunction C a society that has forgotten the men who take risks, cut through red tape, and get their hands dirty. The only kind of men prepared to face the dangers that the Left pretends dont exist,He has also been pretty vocal in the past about his opposition to women serving in combat roles. There are a lot of concerns among women in uniform right now related to fears that Hegseth will hinder efforts to prevent sexual assault and harassment in the military.Back to the article: Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the accuser would need to make her claims publicly for them to be considered. If people have an allegation to make, come forward and make it like they did in Kavanaugh. Well decide whether or not its credible, he said, referring to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was confirmed despite accusations he assaulted a woman when they were teenagers in the 1980s.Are you kidding me? This is so disingenuous because first of all, It didn't change anything for Kavanaugh's appointment and it won't change anything for Hegseth's. What's more, judging by how Republicans typically handle these situations, if the accuser were to speak out publicly against Hegseth, they would face significant backlash, harassment and death threats. Like, c'mon, we all know you're inviting this person to be berated by Trump supporters who will just double down and then go on to rationalize why Hegseth is the victim in this situation. E Jean Carroll anyone?And outside of being held liable for sexually assaulting Carroll, over 40 women have spoken out against Donald Trump, accusing him of sexual assault, harassment, even rape going all the way back to the 70s, while many of these incidents shared noticeable similarities. And by the way, one of these accusers was Donald Trump's ex-wife.But did any of these allegations change your mind about Donald Trump? No... And what's worse, In some cases, they helped galvanize support for him.You're just asking for a bunch of misogynists to terrorize this woman. Republicans aren't going to have a change of heart after hearing these accusations go public, they'll just continue to deny and make up excuses, and while never giving a democrat the benefit of the doubt. it's always so convenient isn't it? When Tara Reade, who is as shady as it gets, accused Joe Biden of assaulting her, these same conservatives suddenly started to \\"believe all women.\\"Here's more on Hegseth:Hegseth previously led a partisan organization called \\"Concerned Veteran for America,\\" which has strong ties to the Koch Network. Hegseth was eventually forced out of the advocacy group due to \\"mismanagement of funds, sexual impropriety and reports of intoxicated behavior.\\"It's very likely that this isn't the only incident Hegseth has been involved in.He was also booted from another conservative group, \\"Veterans for Freedom,\\" for similar complaints. Which raises questions about his suitability for a position that oversees the countrys largest federal agency that employs more than 2.8 million people.A report about Hegseth's time as president of CVA describes him as being \\"repeatedly intoxicated while acting in his official capacity and sometimes needing to be carried out of the organizations events.\\"Remember the tasteless smear campaign against Tim Walz and his time in the National Guard? Well, not a peep from conservatives this time despite Hegseth being pulled from his National Guard duties due to concerns from members of his unit. Oh, and the concerns were raised when Hegseth was assigned responsibilities for Joe Biden's inauguration.Then there's his outspoken and controversial support for the Blackwater contractors who killed 14 unarmed Iraqi Civilians during the 2007 Nisour Square massacre in Baghdad. Hegseth lobbied President Donald Trump to pardon these contractors, which Trump ultimately did at the end of his first term.Shockingly, Hegseth has also downplayed January 6th, particularly the violent role that any veterans played during the attack.Hegseth is just another example of the rampant cronyism, corruption, misogyny, and extremism we will come to expect from the next Trump administration. an administration that's already estimated to be the richest in U.S. history and filled the brim with sexist, chauvinistic members of the \\"manosphere\\" movement who are constantly blaming women and liberals for a \\"crisis of insecurity,\\" oops, I mean \\"masculinity.\\"","title":"Sen.

Theyll encourage both the right and the left to engage in adventurism, selling each side the same narrative: that the enemy is mobilizing, so you must get in the streets to fight back. Like last time, major targets of this agitation propaganda will be the most conspiratorial elements within MAGA; the ones who believe in QAnon, or in the psyops that have replaced QAnon. This time, though, the feds will also focus on agitating another element: the antifa anarchists. The psyop directed towards the left will be that a unique fascist threat has arisen, and that we have to resist it through violence if necessary. And an inverse psyop will be directed towards the right; ultraviolent leftist groups, cultivated by the intelligence agencies, will be used to demonize Palestine supporters while spreading anti-communist paranoia.What I find is that a lot of \\"revolutionaries\\" and \\"left wing\\" types forget their history and want to help foster a world of violence which is usually called [Ultra Leftism](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-7/basoc-20-years.htm)Ultra-left (or left) errors generally involve overestimating how close the country is to revolution. Typically, a left framework pictures the spontaneous resistance of the working class as an indication of revolutionary class consciousness; isolated militant actions or individual advanced workers are regarded as representative. Ultra-leftists downplay the contradictions within the working class (such as racism, sexism, homophobia) or between the working class and its potential allies. The influence of communists (or of the particular organization making this analysis) is exaggerated: the roots of communists in the working class, the respect of the people for the communists, the development of revolutionary program, tested leadership, committed cadreCall are overestimated. The road to revolution is envisioned as relatively smooth (and the turns and twists of revolutions in other countries are regarded with disdain).Some ultra-leftists think that they live in permanently revolutionary conditions that only await bold action by revolutionaries; others anticipate a spontaneous act of popular resistance that can be turned into a revolutionary uprising by ingenious communists. The different variations of this perspective all amount to thinking that we are in a situation where a single spark can start a prairie fire.[Lenin called it adventurism:](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/jun/09.htm)The history of Russian Social-Democracy teems with tiny groups, which sprang up for an hour, for several months, with no roots whatever among the masses (and politics without the masses are adventurist politics), and with no serious and stable principles. In a petty-bourgeois country, which is passing through a historical period of bourgeois reconstruction, it is inevitable that a motley assortment of intellectuals should join the workers, and that these intellectuals should attempt to form all kinds of groups, adventurist in character in the sense referred to above. While there's far more, consider that Vladimir Lenin's own brother [was executed for such schemes and machinations](https://www.executedtoday.com/2008/05/08/1887-alexander-ilyich-ulyanov-brother-vladimir-lenin-alexander-iii/)Counter gangs and Ultra-Left adventurism are tactics to keep imperialism in power and should be understood exactly as schemes of the ruling class to maintain the current order.","title":"On a history of Violence..."},{"text":"My deeply unpopular opinion:\\nPeople don't hate the time change as much as they LOVE complaining about it.","title":"Trump Vows to Eliminate Inconvenient Daylight Saving Time"},{"text":"How about those that shut down Langley last year and Wright Patterson this Friday?Who is flying them above our military bases and not facing any consequences?https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-ohio/drones-shut-wright-patterson-air-force-base-down-for-several-hours-late-friday","title":"Shoot them down!

For example the former CEO of Boeing created a culture at the company that caused the quality failures that recently plagued the company.  By moving the headquarters away from where the product was being built, out sourcing without great oversight, pushing flight software out too quickly; the CEO created an environment that caused the death of hundreds in two plane crashes. Health insurance CEO do the same thing with there companies.  They set the environment with in their company.  They help mold the policies on how the approval process will work.  The CEO can make the approval process very tough for expensive treatment programs.  This denial of service can create outcomes that people die before being able to get treatment or die because the treatment was delayed.  Thus like the Boeing CEO, they are responsible for many deaths. It is unfortunate that insurance companies do not publish data on the denials and it is hard to know if those delays/denials result in deaths that otherwise would have people living significantly longer. There are enough people who believe that an insurance company denial has caused the death of someone close.

I'd more or less agree that hospitals have a large amount of culpability for the current state of things, but basically what you can say about the hospital is that in the current system they set the price of services and goods very high knowing that the insurance company will negotiate it downwards. The assumption of the system is generally that you will be covered by insurance, when you get an insane bill it's often because your insurance refused to cover it so they also did not negotiate the price. I'd like to see hospital systems stop treating individuals like they are massive insurance companies but that's also the current system.At the end of the day what you can say is different about the above two groups is that they actually provide the services and goods they say they will provide.On the other hand, insurance companies regularly look for ways to reject claims, or shift more of the bill to your responsibility regardless of the terms of your policy. They literally try not to provide what you pay them for at every turn and are a large part of the reason why prices are so high in medical systems. Where the hospital systems have many things wrong with them largely because they are for profit as well, many of those problems are the direct result of the current expectations that medical care will be covered by insurance companies.","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"The question, apparently, is whether you owe allegiance to another state.

Meanwhile, UHC has been making $20 billion, roughly, every year. Is there financial waste at my hospital? Definitely. But I guarantee theres plenty of financial waste at UHC too.

Trump sued the original accuser (aka the woman he raped) for defamation because she said he raped her. The judge, based on all the evidence and the jurys ruling, threw Trumps defamation case out. His words are as follows: The finding that Mr. Trump digitally raped Ms. Carroll is conclusive because it was\\nnecessary to support the judgment in Carroll II. It accordingly is the truth, as relevant here, that Mr. Trump digitally raped Ms. Carroll.\\nThe ruling is documented here: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24370395-kaplan-august-ruling-trump-counterclaim/The quotes I took are on page 17.So in a legal setting, it was determined that Trump digitally raped E. Jean Carroll. Digital means he used his digits, aka his fingers. The definition of rape in NY where the case took place, at the time of this trial, did not include digital penetration. Therefore, since the jury found that Trump forcefully digitally penetrated Carroll, they found he sexually abused her. The judge explains that if the jury found Trump guilty of any of three options, then Carroll wins the case. So the jury only had to choose one option. The options were forcible touching, sexual abuse, and rape. The jury found there was enough evidence that he sexually abused her, because of the digital penetration. The judge is very clear that this finding is NOT saying Trump did not rape her (with his genitalia). The finding is only saying there IS enough evidence of digital penetration and the jury didnt see enough evidence to PROVE genital penetration. There was more evidence of digital penetration than genital, so the jury picked that option. The judge said the jury could have not even responded to the rape question and the verdict would be unaffected. There was testimony that he did actually rape her with his unwanted penis. There was argument during the trial about how far in counts as rape. Did it fully go in or was it just thrust at her vaginal opening? The jury did not find this testimony to be enough proof that he raped her with his penis.In January (2024), New York updated their definition of rape to include digital penetration, via nonconsensual contact.The following is a quote from an announcement made by the New York State Assembly:This critical legislation, which has passed in the Assembly for 12 years, redefines rape in New Yorks penal law to include nonconsensual vaginal, oral and anal sexual contact.https://nyassembly.gov/Press/?sec=story&amp;story=108933#:~:text=This%20critical%20legislation%2C%20which%20has,oral%20and%20anal%20sexual%20contact.In summary, Trump may or may not have forcibly genitally penetrated her. A jury found that he DID forcibly digitally penetrate her. In NY law at the time, that did not count as rape. In regular conversation and currently according to the NY amendment, it does. Trump sued her for defamation for saying he raped her. The judge threw his case out with the reasoning that the statement that he raped her is substantially true (also page 17). She sued him for defamation for claiming she made up her story. She won.If just the act of denying her story got Trump on the hook for $2 mill, how can he suddenly be allowed to deny it in this case? If the woman accusing Trump of rape is legally allowed to say Trump raped her, why cant a news network? If the law as it has been amended now counts what the jury found Trump had done as rape, isnt it semantics to say the phrase found guilty of rape by a jury is defamation? The judge ruled the statement he raped her is substantially true. The judge based this ruling on the finding of the jury. Therefore, wouldnt it also be substantially true to say he was found guilty of rape by a jury?  Regardless of whether what he did counts as rape, our elected president is a sexual predator. Truth can be very difficult to find these days and it is important.","title":"Trump discovered new infinite money glitch"},{"text":"there where more farmer bankruptcy and suicide under trump than Biden .

National Parks are one thing, but these National Monuments have gotten ridiculous and aren't even preserving truly unique lands in need protection any more than the lands right next to them.

Trump's McCarthyist Tendencies**Populist Rhetoric and Demonization**\\nTrump, like McCarthy, has built a base of support among working-class whites by combining populist criticism of elites with exaggerated depictions of foreign threats[1]. Both figures have used inflammatory language to polarize the country and pit Americans against each other[2].**Attacks on Critics and Media**\\nSimilar to McCarthy's approach, Trump frequently attacks his critics and the media, often singling out reporters by name[5]. This tactic of intimidation aims to stifle dissent and control the narrative.**Loyalty and Purges**\\nTrump's administration has shown a propensity for demanding loyalty and removing those perceived as disloyal, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths and purges[4]. The proposed \\"Project 2025\\" initiative aims to identify and remove federal employees seen as hostile to Trump, echoing McCarthyist blacklists[4]. Amplified Threat from the Executive Branch**Unprecedented Power**\\nUnlike McCarthy, who was a senator, Trump's potential return to the presidency would grant him executive powers far exceeding those of McCarthy. This includes control over federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and FBI[4].**Technological Advantages**\\nModern technology and social media provide Trump with tools for surveillance and information dissemination that far surpass what was available during the McCarthy era[4]. This could lead to more targeted and effective campaigns against perceived enemies.**Armed Support**\\nTrump has the backing of armed militias and has promised to pardon January 6 participants, suggesting a potential for violent intimidation that McCarthy lacked[4]. Potential Consequences**Widespread Intimidation**\\nA second Trump administration could see McCarthyism-like tactics applied on a broader scale, targeting not just government employees but also elected Democrats, liberal organizations, and individuals[4].**Constitutional Concerns**\\nTrump's statement about potentially \\"terminating\\" parts of the Constitution raises serious concerns about the rule of law and democratic norms[8].**Economic and Social Impact**\\nAs with McCarthyism, many Americans could face job losses, blacklisting, and social ostracism based on political beliefs or associations[9].In conclusion, while the parallels between Trump and McCarthy are clear, the potential for a Trump-led McCarthyism from the executive branch presents a more severe threat to American democracy and civil liberties. The combination of executive power, modern technology, and a polarized political landscape could lead to a period of political repression and social division far exceeding that of the original McCarthy era.Sources\\\\\\n[1] [PDF] Donald Trump's Foreign Policy: McCarthyism as a Cautionary Tale https://css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/pdfs/PP4-10.pdf\\\\\\n[2] The Apprentice: Donald Trump and Joe McCarthy https://www.cjr.org/politics/trump-mccarthy-time.php\\\\\\n[3] McCarthyism | Definition, History, &amp; Facts - Britannica https://www.britannica.com/event/McCarthyism\\\\\\n[4] How a second Trump administration would bring back McCarthyism https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/7/5/2250160/-How-a-second-Trump-administration-would-bring-back-McCarthyism\\\\\\n[5] GOP silence on Trump's false election claims recalls McCarthy era https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/01/politics/gop-silence-trump-false-election-claims-mccarthy/index.html\\\\\\n[6] Decades before Trump's election lies, McCarthy's anti-communist ... https://www.npr.org/2021/10/18/1046648461/decades-before-trumps-election-lies-mccarthys-anti-communist-fever-gripped-the-g\\\\\\n[7] McCarthyism - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism\\\\\\n[8] Is this Donald Trump's Joe McCarthy moment? - The Hill https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3771516-is-this-donald-trumps-joe-mccarthy-moment/\\\\\\n[9] Broadside for the Trump Era: McCarthyism 1947C1960 | Verso Books https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/news/3681-broadside-for-the-trump-era-mccarthyism-1947-1960","title":"'This is actually how democracy dies': Experts denounce ABC's settlement of Trump lawsuit"},{"text":"I'm not in disagreement with you, but we are dealing with a group of peoples that feel an education is only an indoctrination into the 'woke' world.

Rescind legality thereof.If anyone even remotely close to being a nutbag of *that* level is able to ascend to such positions (that they have NO business having in the first place), then **yes** there, by definition, must be unprecedented response systems to deal with a) mitigating the damage and b) working to prevent catastrophes borne from ineptness and incapability.Federal judges *rescinding* their retirement should have been expected. That's part of the said unprecedented response system. There are people in positions of great power who *do* want to prevent horrible nonsense from being a literal legal demand and as such are rescinding something, too, just like R's aim to, as well.I.E the reason Trump required unprecedented legal responses from his myriad of crimes is because, well, the crimes were unprecedented. You can't go after unprecedented crimes with NO investigative or charging powers because then the investigation is simply theatre and thus; it's implied to have it be actually legal to do the things they claim are illegal. The fact that Republicans were stunned by the investigations and charges is flat out ridiculous. They damn well know the difference between (for example) Biden's document case and Trump's:Biden gave them all back without any intrusion or obstruction. Trump did the opposite and actually went out of his way to prevent the Govt. from acquiring what's actually theirs. Only reason he really got charged. Had he given them all back and did no obstructing, he wouldn't have been charged. The DoJ did NOT want to charge a President (clearly, given Garland's worthless ass sitting on the investigation for an eternity) and it's clear he would have been given a \\"warning\\" if he just. gave. them. back.Whole lotta idiots over there.","title":"Another Obama-appointed judge rescinds senior status and becomes third on federal bench to pull reverse retirement on Trump since he won the election"},{"text":"Oh ye of little faith.

Orban poses an increasingly threatening posture in Europe.Orban has visited Trump at mar-a-largo three times this year. Read the quote below if you want to know what Orban is up to in Europe. It tells you a bit about Trump knowing that he is allied with a leader with these extreme views and positions. From the very outset of Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn has systematically disrupted European decisionmaking. His unpredictable positions on geopolitical issues and confrontative comments have become commonplace.Orbns recent interview, given on the morning of the November 7 informal European Council meeting, may provide some insights into his true ambitions and future behavior. He declared that Hungary has successfully resisted judicial activism from Brussels because it is always prepared to revolt against interference in national actions. He called for rebellion against the laws and court rulings that are currently in force. This complaint relates to the European Court of Justice, which has imposed a 200 million ($213 million) fine and further daily penalties of 1 million ($1.1 million) on Hungary for its failure to comply with EU asylum rules.Becoming a transformative actor on the international stage and shaping the future of the EU has always been Orbns political aim. This approach emerged back in 2010, with his pursuit of an Opening to the East--a policy aimed at economic diversification, including through increased business and friendlier political relations with Russia, Turkey, and China-. Orbns ambition is to thrust Hungary, a small Eastern European country at the periphery of transatlantic cooperation, to the heart of Europeaneven globaldecisionmaking. This foreign policy agenda is an essential part of his nationalist, illiberal, populist regime.In NATO, Orbns ambition is to boost business deals and make himself heard. Within the EU, he wants to shape the organizations future, and get it to provide the maximum institutional and financial backup for Hungarys economic progress while accepting his illiberal rule. For this, it is necessary to weaken the blocs ideological consensus and political competencies.Since gaining constitutional power in 2010, he adopted a confrontational posture within the EU to push back against criticism of his countrys systemic democratic backsliding and growing autocratization. Until 2020, however, he played by the EUs terms. The rebellion attitude, which openly undermines the blocs ability to act in unity, is new. It aims to both pressure the European Commission to release some of the frozen EU funds to the Hungarian government, and to demonstrate that no important decision can be made without Orbn.\\nhttps://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2024/11/orbans-rebellion-against-europe-gains-momentum?lang=en","title":"Another Obama-appointed judge rescinds senior status and becomes third on federal bench to pull reverse retirement on Trump since he won the election"},{"text":"Ya know...Democrats (and especially progressives) - didn't come out in enough numbers to give Democrats power to do anything.
