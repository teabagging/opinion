"},{"text":"I absolutely get your point. And I think this is honestly the best, most thoughtful, pro-Republican 2024 election answer I've read on Reddit. Thank you for writing this!\\nFirst of all; I'm sorry about your friends who overdosed. Fentanyl is a growing problem, and it's getting to the point where I would want there to be Naloxone (opioid overdose reverser) in every household just in case. Though there has been a great number of seized fentanyl in the U.S the last 3 years, with over 70 million pills being confiscated by the DEA in 2023 alone. Now TO HIS CREDIT Trump has not said he will cut DEA funding - but with Elon saying nothing is off the table I wouldn't be at all surprised. House republicans have consistently lobbied for budget cuts around the Justice department the last 2 years.As for Afghanistan... what I am always mad about is that all this blame falls on Biden. It was Trump who started that whole process, and Biden (for better or worse) honored the deal Trump made with them.In 2016 people were willing to give him a chance. And his own rhetoric wasn't as harsh back then either. He wasn't talking about holding camps for illegal immigrants who were actually born on american soil, wanting to tear apart the Jus Soli (birthright from land) and incarcerate his political rivals (except for Hilary, so there were signs).\\nI absolutely agree that Kamala was less clear in the messaging than Trump was, but she didn't just run on abortion. There were plans; raising taxes on the top 0.2 % of the population to be able to greatly cut taxes from 95% of americans, increasing child tax credit (which republicans blocked in 2024, but was still what Kamala worked on most last 4 years), lowering prescription drug costs and (most importantly for me personally) reducing carbon emissions by 40%, while not completely removing oil and gas. In contrast, Trumps campaign either did not address these issues or had Vance speak about it, and Trump did not confirm that were his policies (Vance also wants child tax credit). Or, as in the case of tax cuts, cutting it from bottom and top at the expense of the middle class and other budgets, which just doesn't make sense. (Not sayimg middle class would not also receive tax cuts, but low and not on par with profitable). She failed getting this info out to a majority of voters, and I agree that she often leaned in to the abortion question to much. But there were great plans.\\nI also want to highlight that Biden/Harris has had huge problems getting anything to pass in the house. When democrats are in power, republican politicians go out of their way to ensure the country will not improve, and that nothing gets passed. Fox News always highlights the opposite in a way that I wish left-wing media did against the republicans... but they won't. Now democrats will probably lower the bar and start using the right-wing media tactic, so that should be interesting...As for Trump, everything you said people are calling him, except being literally Hitler, is most likely true. He was never officially convicted of rape but the evidence speaks. He also throws out baseless pedophile accusations towards Biden and Walz, but NO ONE in the right-wing media even mentions how he himself bragged about going into the dressingrooms of 15 and 16 year old girls when they were naked just to look at their young bodies. There's an interview, look it up. There are other signs aswell, but not gonna go down that rabbit hole to further increase this wall of text.There's more, like Trump moving the embassy in Israel triggering the attack by Hamas, his **rumored** communications with Putin during the Ukraine-Russia war and please, look into Tulsi Gabbard (Trumps pick for national intel director, and to me the worst cabinet pick there has ever been).\\nI'm glad we can atleast agree on Fox News being harmful (I think?) and I will say I also felt disgusted by the rhetoric used by media in regards to the first assassination attempt. People saying stuff like \\"2 inches right\\" and \\"Soo close\\" and stuff, that was completely unacceptable. Also worrying that the rhetoric even became more hostile. But I don't think they should have lowered their rhetoric in regards to threat on democracy, since republicans has had that rhetoric towards the left-wing for as long as I can remember.Long story short; I never hold it against voters who vote. You voted for trump and you clearly thought it through and don't just blindly believe what Fox News says. I respect that. And we should be allowed to vote for who we want.\\nTo me Kamala was in fact the better option, but that's not saying much.

Here you go:North Carolina is a state of balance, a true purple state. With our nearly 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans, North Carolinians expect fairness when it comes to how their voices are represented in Congress. But the Republican-controlled legislatures latest gerrymandered election maps did more than just silence voters in North Carolina. They reshaped the balance of power in Washington D.C., costing Democrats control of the U.S. House of Representatives.Heres the reality: the congressional map we used to have, with a 7-7 Republican-Democratic split, reflected the true political makeup of our state. It was fair. It gave voters on both sides confidence that their voices mattered. But that wasnt good enough for legislative Republicans in Raleigh. They threw fairness out the window, forcing through a mid-decade map that handed Republicans an unfair 10-4 advantage in the next Congress. Thats 71% of North Carolinas seats in the U.S. House going to Republicans and those 10 bright red districts were not even close.It doesnt take a mathematician to see whats wrong with that. And now, with Adam Grays apparent victory in Californias 13th District giving Republicans a bare three-seat majority in the U.S. House, its clear that gerrymandering in North Carolina tipped the scales in their favor and cost Democrats control of the US House of Representatives. My district along with the districts of Jeff Jackson and Kathy Manning were turned into safe Republican seats where Democrats had zero chance to win. Had North Carolina sent the three of us back to Washington, under fair maps, then New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries would be our next Speaker of the House with a one seat Democratic majority at 218-217.Lets be clear. This wasnt an accident. This was by design. Republicans in Congress can give North Carolina Speaker Tim Moore a big wet kiss when he gets to Washington. Not only did he draw himself a safe Republican seat, but he gave Republicans the three House seats that became the difference in control of Congress.The MAGA Republicans in Raleigh who drew these maps didnt care about reflecting the will of the people. They cared about power. They used the redistricting process to rig the system, taking advantage of their supermajority to draw lines that would give them three more seats  no matter what the voters wanted.But voters deserve better. They deserve a system where their voices are heard, where their votes matter, and where their representatives are chosen by the people  not by politicians drawing lines behind closed doors.Thats why Im fighting for my bill, the Fair Maps Act, which would establish independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions in every state across the country. These commissions would take the power out of politicians hands and ensure that congressional maps are drawn fairly and transparently.The research proves it works. Studies from Duke Universityand other nonpartisan institutions show that independent redistricting will create maps that better reflect the actual political makeup of North Carolina. This isnt about giving one party an advantage. Its about fairness. Its about restoring trust in our democracy.When gerrymandering silences voters, the consequences are devastating. Look no further than this years election. A gerrymandered North Carolina map didnt just strip fair representation from our states voters  it changed the course of history by giving control of the U.S. House of Representatives to Republicans instead of Democrats.We cant let this happen again.While I wont be going back to Congress because of extreme, partisan gerrymandering, Im not giving up or going out quietly in the fight for fair voting maps. The people of North Carolina and across the country deserve better. They deserve fair maps, a fair system, and a democracy they can trust. Its time to end gerrymandering once and for all.Wiley Nickel represents North Carolinas 13th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.","title":"NC congressman: Republicans stole fairness from the nation in giving GOP a House majority. - Rep.

Inflation and inflation rate are two different things. Touting this as a success is like driving your credit card to the max two years ago and then boasting that credit spending has been lower over the last 24 months. Home ownership...? The reason why so many mortgage rates are locked at low rates is because the majority of home owners have been in their mortgages for greater than four years, when interest rates actually were low. Mortgage rates are 4-5% higher than they were in 2020. And since existing homeowners have such low rates, they aren't selling their homes. Which is keeping younger buyers out of the market, which, despite your dubious unemployment claim, those under 30 have huge barriers to home ownership. The top two barriers being interest rates and market availability. Both of which are far greater barometers for economic health than the stock market. Employment without strong wages only creates a new class of serfs, which Bidenomics has created. Credit debt is currently through the roof.And high tech? Despite Intel currently building the largest chip plant ever in Ohio (yes, red state, why is that? Hmmm) they just laid off a huge number of employees,  along with Amazon and Google.

Its a hugely creative blend of drama and documentary that unpicks the reasons behind a civilisational catastrophe.Its called The Event in the film and we never find out what it was C nuclear war? climate collapse? C but Kapadia follows a thread that weaves together populist politicians, demagogues and tech billionaires to show how close to this disaster we already are.The twist is that this isnt the future. Much of the footage is archive taken from the present day: women and children on the Hong Kong subway being beaten by armed officers, drone shots of street after destroyed street in Gaza, biblical floods sweeping away blocks of flats.And in between these dramatic scenes with Morton, isolated and alone, able to trust no one, are documentary sequences that Kapadia calls time capsules. Its the time capsules that transport us squarely back into the present. Kapadia interviews dozens of journalists, activists &amp; technologists that he interlaces with clips that take us from the populist politics of Farage, Trump &amp; Modi to the Silicon Valley bro-sphere C Musk, Thiel, Zuckerberg.How did we get here? How did we let that happen? asks Ghost as we see her walking through New San Franciscos streets, the sky a deathly orange, real footage from the fires of two years ago.  \\nIts a dazzlingly creative work.

But jon, candy, mongoose and carrie are right too. Theyre not seeing the bigger picture either. Everyone stays in their own lanes and has their own personal feelings on the political pony show based on their own interests and research.I dont think you should hate the super rich, either. Theyre just people like you and me. Dealing with the cards they were dealt or stacking the deck for themselves. It doesnt matter. Theyre also just trying to make a living, or in Trumps case, a legacy.But theyre just puppets all dangling on strings for deep state. Trump will be ostracized like he was last time, but on a globally political scale. Musk is probably the inside man. And yeah, this last election was a game to all of them. Harris was the fall guy. She made promises she knew she couldnt keep, went back on her ideals more than a few times and said some really bizarre things when she was put on the spot. She was meant to fail. Are they still taking donations? Very little of that 1.5 billion they made during their few months of campaigning was actually put into advertising. And they kept asking for donations months after they knew they lost, if theyre still taking donations now that is. And that money isnt going into Harris private bank account. If it is then its just confirmation that it was the biggest scam in American history on the working class Americans.Lets think about good old fashioned communism. Strange that the deep state keeps attacking Russia and they would do nothing to retaliate when Putin is one of the most powerful and richest men in the world. By your and most peoples standards. Ukraine was a good example of that as Hunter Biden was named a chairman at a private gas company just as the war kicked off from another leaked and failed CIA operation to mess with Russia. But thats what Russia wanted, isnt it? To own more land and deport or send in more people into the United States. Trump says our problem is coming from Mexico and gets weird when he talks about refugees a d illegals, and if youre right, an army of drones are coming. Maybe it is for national security?He failed to build his wall last term he was elected. He could build a virtual wall to monitor and protect the southern border. Id say hes welcome to it. But what about all those people that have been evacuated from war torn countries over the last, say sixty years? Elon Musk has over hundreds, as of right now, satellites orbiting the Earth as we speak. Perhaps we could point some of those with cameras down at some of these states in the United States. Have we enough people in these states now to create separate states? And what would that do to the Federal government? Theyre already paying for budgets in fifty of them. That budget would double. Scary thought. Rats, snakes and all the rats in the room get twice as fat. But a well fed animal is less likely to strike.Theyre all fighting each other and looking to eat one another. And the lions tigers and bears are all just watching to wait and see who will win. A few of them are in the ring with Trump. If random social media posts you read online are actual news of the times. Musk would be a tiger. You never know if hell turn on you and just strike you down. Can you imagine him angry? Thats a scary face, just like a tiger. Hes poking at RFK with his conspiracy post about the right wing and six months. Giving him the paw because maybe he doesnt even believe his approach to the election. Maybe hes competitive and hes looking for more views or attention. My sister-in-law devoutly worships him but I dont see it. My brother-in-law hates him religiously and I dont see why. He said he wants to regulate AI. So hes going to control three major technologies that are going to flourish across America. Or he plans to. That would be nice. Hes got the eye of a tiger.Either way, I can definitely see the analogy Candy_Store_Pauper makes. And agree that Trump, is going for Legacy. And his legacy will be built on the tigers, lions and bears. If one of them doesnt kill him first. Because were all just human. And Trump is just one of us, man. He we dealt a hand, hes deep into credit and owes more than a few favors. You see that picture of Trump kissing Musks ring like hes the president of a fraternity club, OP? You ever do that for someone, knowing that cameras are watching your every move? Hes appeasing that tiger man, because he felt that powerful too at some point when he was getting fat media coverage his first term. All that power/fame goes to your head sometimes.But hes also like the AI that hes promoting at the same time. Almost could be if that scar on his neck is an inguinal brain surgical implant and he has a chip in his brain too. He could be getting real time advice from a team of experts on just about every subject, hence the apparent need to pause before he answers questions. My brother-in-law thinks that hes feigning a social anxiety disorder to appease to the masses. I can tell you that no one on my wifes side of the family is schizophrenic and I can imagine that youre not either, OP, because you sound very sane and logical. I might be a little schizophrenic but in a good way. I just think of concerning things and I tend to judge people too. But people with money are of no concern to us and never have been.That CEO was a coverup by one of the deep states or the federal government is the general consensus from most of the conspiracy group that Ive seen. Its not the weird pictures that keep getting posted or the size of his eyebrows. Its just logics and rhetoric and the way it was preformed. Its textbook. Ironic after looking at the length of this reply. Sorry about that but I cant break things up and place them into organized groups like you can OP.Pandoras box is already open. Its been open since Covid. Everyones sick and miserable of it all. But the national guard isnt going to round up its citizens and ship them out because of it. Thats not very American and people like you or me would stand outside in the capital while Trump just sits there. Some of us starving ourselves on purpose and literally giving him a deadline to change things, wont we? If you give at least some flying F-bomb for this country then you should be. And Ill bet you some of the bears, lions and even tigers would join us. If anything more than a little publicity, right? Its just a shame we cant do that for the deep states.

Corporate capture of government (though campaign contributions) and media (though sponsorships) alike incentivizes coverage skewed toward downplaying both climate change and humanity's role in it. Lawsuits have established that fossil fuel companies were outwardly downplaying humanity's role in climate change at the same time as their internal documentation suggested they knew it was a bigger factor than they let on.B. Environmentalists themselves haven't been doing environmentalism any favours, crying wolf about \\"GMO rat tumors\\" or \\"rainforests are the lungs of the Earth\\" (tell that to phytoplankton). In my undergraduate years, I too sometimes wondered if climate scientists were just pandering to eco-zealots. This opinion of mine has somewhat waned on entry to consulting work in the physical sciences, where the laws of physics have to be right for us to do our jobs well, and I care no more or less about Al Gore than I did back then. If blaming those outside the field is fair game, there are those who've done enviromentalism far dirtier than Al Gore ever has.Al Gore is just one person. Using Al Gore as an excuse to deny the obvious ramifications of greenhouse gases' absorptance of infrared rays is ridiculous, and using it as an excuse to deny what climate scientists tell us those ramifications will be is only a few steps better. Even \\"climategate,\\" while it had its own problems, at least tried to attack the credibility of the climate scientists themselves, making it a step more respectable than the idiotic attacks on Al Gore in particular.","title":"CMV: An Inconvenient Truth ultimately did more harm than good for climate change because of its ties to Al Gore"},{"text":"They are allegations, and she's denied them.

There is no database containing rows of data that it is querying to put together replies. Nothing about the system is brute force. When you communicate with it, the words you give it are broken down into abstract chunks, and those cause certain synthetic neurons to react, which cause a subsequent layer of neurons to react, and so on and so on. These abstract neurons with connection weights is nothing like what we would describe as a brute force algorithm in other contexts. It is intentionally much more analogous (but also very different) to the what the human brain does, with its own physical neurons that get exited by certain kinds of stimuli and fire off signals to subsequent neurons. \\"Training\\" AI is just pre processing so the brute force answers are quicker.Training is the process of forming new and more complex connections between raw tokens, the words they represent, the sentences they form, the abstract concepts those sentences represent, and the higher level ideas those concepts feed into.

We're talking about a party that struggles to beat _Republicans_ in elections.The shitlibs that make up their core voters certainly won't change. They believe the voters exist to prop up the Dems and owe them their fealty; the idea that the Dems have to earn votes, or that they have to do something for people, is incomprehensible. Anyone who doesn't support the Party for any reason gets put in the basket of deplorables, which probably has a label on it reading \\"Horseshoe Theory\\".

They don't view themselves as being working class, or having kitchen table issues, or being concerned about corruption, or anything that could possibly give them common ground with anyone outside their cult.The Dems are tremendously useful for spoiling the left and generally sucking all the oxygen out of the room, and necessary for our distracting two-party slapfest that ekes out on mainstream and social media, so we can assume the elites will keep them propped up forever, or for as long as possible.

Im not even an a massive Trump supporter, this is actually the first election I voted in. But do you really think Harris wouldve done a better job? I get people hate the guy but its pretty simple. We need to secure our border, deescalate wars abroad. Do you really think its a coincidence that Russia chose to invade Ukraine as soon as Biden took office? They had been trying to take Ukraine from the inside for over a decade. As soon as Biden comes in they start mounting troops on the border. Then Israel happens, plus escalations with Iran and China. You can hate Trump all you want but the fact is they DO respect him. If they dont respect him theyre scared of him. You achieve peace through strength, if you dont wanna call it strength use fear. Biden asleep at the wheel has been a free ticket for escalation. And Kamala wouldve made it 2x worse. I mean look how weak we looked pulling out of Afghanistan. It was an absolute shit show on par with Vietnam. Theres nearly 2x more fentanyl overdoses per day than there were in 2019. I personally know people who have died. We need more BP agents, with better pay, better screening methods  and doing a hell of a lot more of them. Trump has 400million dollar plan for that, Kamala just visited the border for the first time a few months ago (as border czar) and said we may need to start from scratch.. The Border patrol has fully backed trump, and leaders have openly criticized Kamala. 15million illegal immigrants, 13,000k have been convicted of murder btw. The presidency isnt a popularity contest. I get you despise trump but there is no way that Harris is the better candidate. And because people are brain washed watching Fox News, its common sense. We were better off with Trump, until COVID. Biden/Harris has been an utter disaster, she ran a horrible campaign and she herself said she wouldnt have changed anything. She also never gave a clear plan, it was all political buzzwords and scripted bullshit. Shes flipped on policies like banning fracking and defunding the police. Were still not really clear where she stood there, she couldnt even announce how she voted on prop 26 (which basically made shoplifting ilegal again, 70% voted yes lol) and mainly ran on abortion. It was just the most tone deaf shit Ive ever seen. And NO I didnt just guzzle Fox News. Its common senseWhat really drove me to even vote or support Donald Trump was the way he was treated after almost being assassinated twice. The hateful rhetoric was ramped up even more and its clear that its had an effect. I dont remember anyone calling Trump LITERALLY HITLER, a fascist, rapist, sexist, racist dictator in 2016. Or people literally cutting off friends or family because they chose to support a horrible evil racist man. Is Donald Trump a great man? No, but hes not anywhere close to the monster some of yall make him out to be. Its rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. Especially when you see all of that hate while countries going backwards.

The government tried to make up for the shortfall by issuing bonds and hiring these people to public service. The problem is those bonds United States government made triple tax exempt and when shit hit the fan in 2008 puerto rico was hit hard.  The US also decided to restrict Puerto Rico from declaring bankruptcy so the economic crisis only got worse. Then in their eternal wisdom they stripped Puerto Rico of any semblance of democracy when it esablished the fiscal oversight board(called la junta in pr)  Now add-on the rampant corruption of the prostatehood party And their policies which have spurred all gentrification and destruction of the environment.

Enter Ole Richie Branson, and he wants a piece of that action, too!It's pretty cutthroat at the top of the pyramid.  It's like playing the children's game \\"King of the Hill\\" on mega steroids.  There's only one spot at the very top, and there's a whole bunch of others trying to take it.  So, you have to fight them all off for as long as you can.  Depending on how hard you're pushed, that's how far you'll fall when unseated.  Then, the other guy gets to stand atop the hill, but, the crowd continues to come.  The crowd is always coming, and the person at the top is always changing.Those are the quadrillionaires.  Not the billionaires or even the trillionaires.  The real wealth.  The real controllers of everything in town and the sheriff.  BUT, even they own individual towns and individual sheriffs, not a collective in lockstep that owns them all.Sure, it's rigged.  But, not for the billionaire, typically.  For the trillionaire, possibly.  For the quadrillionaire, definitely.  However, remember, they all want a spot at the top.  They're all fighting for it.  As they battle, you, with some gumption, can get yours.  Maybe even to the tune of millionaire.  Or, if you do it well enough and quietly enough, to the billionaire level.Forbes publishes their wealthiest list every year.  Trust me when I tell you that not everyone is on there.  There's a shit-ton of quiet wealth out there.  And many of them ARE doing good and altruistic things.  And the quadrillionaires are never named.

Don't be all butt hurt about it, do something to put yourself in a position to make as much of a positive difference as you can.

Use that second trimester well.  Or, don't.  And we can go back and forth about those evil fuckers, but, again, I really don't have time.

That left four seats without confirmed nominees that Trump could try to fill upon taking office on 20 January. But two vacancies were contingent upon two Democrat-appointed judges following through on their plans to leave active service.Those judges included Wynn, 70, who in January announced plans to take senior status contingent upon a successor being confirmed. He told Biden he had changed his mind. I apologize for any inconvenience I may have caused, Wynn wrote.The Article III Project, a group run by Trump ally Mike Davis, announced it had meanwhile filed judicial misconduct complaints against the two trial court judges who likewise rescinded retirement plans post-election.Those judges are the US district judge Max Cogburn in North Carolina and the US district judge Algenon Marbley in Ohio.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/14/judge-revokes-retirement-decision","title":"Judge revokes decision to retire, foiling Trumps replacement plans.

This author starts off by quoting Matt Gaetz.First of all, populism is dead, Donald Trump and his MAGA coalition made sure of that. They parade around as populists, but they are far from it. Trump's Administration is expected to be the richest in US history, It can be summed up as billionaires funding billionaires who are helping billionaires.This wave of pseudo populism is attractive to conservatives because it's really authoritarianism and culture wars disguised as populism.What's more, Donald Trump presents himself as an outsider, but he has spent his entire life trying desperately to worm his way into the elitist boys club of New York City. He's an outsider in the sense that he's been ostracized by people he wants to emulate. Trump represents everything that populism is *not*. He cares far more about his public image, his ratings, his wealth, and his legacy than anything he rattles on about incoherently at rallies. There is no true populist appeal because it's all steeped in lies, political theatrics, demagoguery, grievances and ill will.In fact, this new administration is ushering in a modern age of the robber barons with corrupt ties to politicians, and vice versa for that matter. Hell, sometimes the two are practically synonymous. And yes, a populist uprising emerged last time, but it won't this time because Trump, his allies and his ardent followers are unflinchingly loyal, sympathetic and obedient to Trump, and in favor of this right wing authoritarianism.This is the *real* appeal. Donald Trump and company have spent the last eight years indulging the fantasies and delusions of their supporters.Trump panders to the lowest common denominator, to his supporter's *feelings*, to their many grievances and fears, their hate and phobias, their paranoia and prejudices, and he does it by rallying them into a patriotic frenzy over the desperate need to eliminate a number of perceived threats. These \\"radical leftist,\\" \\"woke\\" enemies and scapegoats are a unifying cause. This is what emboldens Trump and mobilizes his supporters, among other things of course.And if MAGA has its way over the next 4 years, a new \\"establishment\\" will emerge. One under the umbrella of a unitary executive, a president with unchecked powers and broad immunities, a government made incompetent by rampant cronyism, and fashioned by and for conservatives who will have the best opportunity that they've had in decades to consolidate power, cripple the independence of most government agencies, practically rewrite the Constitution, or at the very least, interpret it as they see fit, all the while slowly establishing a one-party system and state.And make no mistake, Donald Trump is dangerous because he's an idiot, and a useful one at that. His so-called allies have exchanged their undying loyalty for either a spot within his administration or a position where they can exploit Trump's narcissism, his mental instability, his ignorance, to enact of far-right agenda with deep roots in the causes of Christian nationalists, special interests, dark money groups, right-wing extremists and factions of wealthy elites, donors, power brokers and political players who have been waiting and preparing for this eventuality their entire lives.","title":"A MAGA Left-Right Coalition? | Trumps second term could present an opportunity for principled conservatives and progressives to team up in challenging the establishment."},{"text":"After they robbed him of nearly a billion dollars in the last two years.","title":"Top minds of reddit predict the result of Trump's lawsuit against ABC"},{"text":"My mom too.

The extent to which such corporations might relocate from Puerto Rico is unknown. Consequently, GAO produced an alternative set of revenue estimates to account for some businesses with activities in Puerto Rico potentially relocating under statehood: this range was -$0.1 billion to $3.4 billion\\".Also statehood is dead. I will send you the polling that shows it has almost no support among young voters. I will send you the polls that showed 54% of voters under 45 backed the pip in 2024. Also statehood would Erode our culture. Not to mention the fact that the pro statehood camp is 0 plans to develop the economy. Ask them yourself they can't answer that question.

So if youre going to privatize USPS, you might as well eliminate it entirely.Id like to see the opposite, where USPS receives more government funding.

I challenge them to look inside themselves and ask three questions:1.  Do you want to have a billion dollars?\\n2.  Do you want to do the hard work to earn it and the hard work to keep it?\\n3.  How much do you think having a billion dollars would affect your current values?I'm a huge fan of Ayn Rand and agree wholeheartedly with her allegory of Producers, Looters and Parasites.  Of course, I would add Consumer and Failure to the mix.  Her allegory addresses those in the positions of higher power, leaving everyone else not categorized.Our time here in \\"life\\" is short, and it is up to the individual to decide which category they will choose to motivate themselves to pursue.  They can choose to produce, or conversely, never rise above consume, loot (in allegory, or, conversely, criminally), or parasite.  Or epically parasite and be categorized as failure.But, the consumer and the failure, in fact all of the other categories outside producer are in some real trouble without that production.Personally, I pride myself on chasing the title of Producer, and the ultimate reward of billionaire.  Although I probably won't get to that level, I'll make a difference along the way, to a degree, on a micro scale.  And, as the book relates to altruism, I would side on my moral code to guide me to what degree I can comfortably be altruistic.  It is my choice to make.The billionaires surrounding Trump are Producer level people.  Heavily critiqued by the parasites and the looters, who produce nothing.  For those consumers and failures that choose to join their chorus, know your place.  How does one consume without producers?  How does one fail when the producers succeed?I've grown weary of a government chock-full-o' parasites and looters.  They have done little to nothing to \\"Make America Great Again\\".  Because it was.  Back when the producers produced the living shit out of things.  The industrial age.  The rail barons.  Sure, there were robber barons, too.  But the consumer, the parasite and the looter all benefited from the production.So, let's let the billionaires have a chance to MAGA the country.  In spite of their varying degrees of altruism.  However, I suspect that Trump will watch them closely, since he's from their circle, and limit or eliminate the low altruism money grabbers from the crowd.  They'll derail the Trump train towards the legacy station at the end of the line.[https://allegoryexplained.com/atlas-shrugged/](https://allegoryexplained.com/atlas-shrugged/)I am John Galt.

I'm a social media content moderator, and we flag down people disassembling or cleaning firearms if there's no indication they aren't trained for it.

Many states require mandatory training, and a significant number of gun owners are current/former military or law enforcement. Then you add in the number that get training on their own. Criminals are not barred from getting training too. Even Everytown, a notorious anti-gun institution, admits that 61% of gun owners are trained.!deltaI was unaware training is often mandatory.

I had a machine that I needed to procure bulk mail off of to do my job, and the person running the machine was at break. All I had to do was go pick the bulk pack off the machine and take it. I wasn't going to wait around for someone to do my job when it was right there and just had to be grabbed. I got written up by a union rep for touching the machine. I overheard a supervisor talking to the union rep about trying to get a full-time employee to come back to work. He had taken a leave of absence and had been missing for 3 months. All they could do is call him every week to see if he was going to come in that week. I eventually got laid off, as on paper the location was over strength, but in reality, employees weren't showing up, and it was falling on the senior temp employees to pick up the slack. I was supposed to be working a part-time position, but I was easily doing 6-10 hours a shift depending on need. The senior temporary employees that were remaining after the newest temps were going to have to adjust their schedules to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week to make up for the slack. My peer group suggested I use my protected status to try to fight to keep the position, and I told them they could have it.","title":"Trump eyeing privatizing US Postal Service: report"},{"text":"Is this the case where he was found guilty of sexual abuse though?

The regime wielded virtually every tool at its disposalprivate and public, state and federal, legal and politicalto stop him. And yet they failed. Why? Because the regime is a Liberal regime.Its entire legitimacy rests upon the illusion that there is no regime at all, but rather merely a set of politically and ideologically neutral processes playing out within social media platforms, state and federal law enforcement, the courts, and nearly every other institution. In short, the Liberal regime rests upon belief in the Rule of Law. Its obviously a perversion and manipulation of the Rule of Law, but the regime nonetheless relies on at least the pretense that whats happening is merely procedural rather than political. For all the talk from leftoids demanding that Biden unilaterally arrest or drone strike Trump, at no point could the regime consider such a drastic action, because doing so would have undermined the very procedural illusion that grants them legitimacy. And this exposes a fatal flaw within the Lefts own strategy for acquiring power.  Now you can try your best to rig that framework in your favor and weaponize procedural neutrality to your benefitas the Left certainly hasbut the procedures nonetheless remain. And no matter how much rigging or manipulation you engage in, procedural outcomes will not always go your way. Even if one side has bribed the referees, the other side can still score. In short, the Left have painted themselves into a corner. Theyve declared Trump and his supporters the enemy, but have constructed a regime whichby its very natureis incapable of taking the sort of decisive action necessary to stop them","title":"Top minds of reddit predict the result of Trump's lawsuit against ABC"},{"text":"Are you *entitled* to see that game?

This will force us to buy the steel all over again, resulting in tremendous delays and added expense. So why would this administration green light these drone exercises to help effectuate rounding up illegal immigrants? Trump cant demand that they get everything up to speed, and I dont see anyone with any authority in this White House saying, Lets make sure Trump is good to go with his mass deportations on day one. This White House has done nothing but drag its feet on immigration; not only that, theyve been proactive in flying illegal aliens into the country. I think this is treason, by I digress. More broadly, I havent seen any indications that Bidens puppet masters are doing anything that might possibly help expedite Trumps policy goals. This is the same group who did anything and everything they could to derail his presidency in 2016 -2020 and prevent him from even running in 2024.

Keep it clean (needs training to perform safely).No, it doesn't. I've cleaned every single one of my firearms the first time by following a YouTube tutorial. Guns are mechanically simple and very straightforward. Dirty guns aren't any less safe than clean guns until you get to the point that the firing pin can't fall, which takes thousands of rounds and months of neglect.Keep it unloaded when not in use (esoteric, not immediately obvious).Not required for safety. Millions of home defense guns are loaded and ready for use at all times nationwide.Use the correct ammunition (not immediately obvious).It's all over the packaging and even written on the frame/barrel and in the manual. Even if you somehow miss all of that, incorrect ammunition generally won't chamber. The only common screwup is 300 Blackout and 223, but even then, most modern rifles have a headspace too tight to chamber them. I've tested this myself with my own AR.Even if you do use a rifle with very loose headspace that does manage to chamber 300 Blackout, the most common result is that the that the rifle contains the explosion with minimal damage. Serious injuries aren't particularly common.Wear eye and ear protection when possible (not immediately obvious).Failure to do so is only a danger in the long term; entire wars have been fought by soldiers with machine guns and no hearing protection, most of whom came whom with only mild to moderate hearing damage. It's very obvious that firing a gun without hearing protection is unsafe after the first round.Keep the barrel clear of obstruction (not immediately obvious; gun could blow itself up otherwise)The only possible negative result is destroying your barrel. This is obviously undesirable, but not a safety hazard unless you continue to shoot, since the rifle will no longer be accurate.Keep the Safety on when not in use (esoteric, not immediately obvious).Not required for safety.

But your premise oversimplifies to the point of cartooning the opposing view.First you make it sound like people are against the idea of free healthcare and free education if it were truly free. But these are misnomers - these services are actually massive industries that cost lots of money - theyre never actually free. The more correct characterization is whether one wants the state to pay for it; and going further, because state services also dont come for free, its a question of whether one wants _other peoples taxes_ to pay for it. It may be more correct to say: some conservatives dont want to pay for other peoples healthcare or education, and think it should be an individual or family unit responsibility.Second, even assuming you dont mind paying more than your fair share, its still not clear you want the state to _administer_ those services. This is why you often see conservatives (the richer ones at least) giving privately to hospitals or school. This is an indication they want to provide to society but they dont believe the government is capable of doing a decent job of satisfying that mandate - making it an ineffective and inefficient use of tax money. Consider that much of primary education already _is free_, and in fact cost our governments billions of dollars annually, yet we rank pretty low in terms of education metrics internationally. For additional comparison, the per pupil cost of public school is often higher than the per pupil cost of private school, and private school yields vastly better results.Third, its not universally agreed that these things should be human rights. Theres multiple theories of human rights, and not one of them is obviously more correct than the others. One popular one states that the rights are inalienable and pre-political. ie they arent granted by another human, even if that human is the government. Put in simpler terms, something cannot be a human right in this sense if it requires the labor or provision of another human being.Its much better and correct to say conservatives lack a cohesive vision for universal human progress than to say theyre unempathetic or soulless.","title":"Cmv: Most Republicans/conservatives are either soulless, un empathetic creatures or have a mental deficiency."},{"text":"Facebook don't care either.","title":"Mark Zuckerberg Continues Sucking Up to Trump as Meta Gives $1 Mil. to Inaugural Fund"},{"text":"Concept of a vow","title":"Trump vows to end 'very costly' daylight saving time"},{"text":"In other news, water is wet","title":"Trump now says bringing down grocery prices, as he promised, will be 'very hard'"},{"text":"Did the \\"libs\\" vote for that guy?","title":"Trump Wins Millions In Defamation Suit Against ABC News, George Stephanopoulos"},{"text":"Dude, Trump isnt going to sleep with you.

There are three separate regulators that do the same thing for banks with different charters. Sensationalized News articles use the headline \\"abolish\\" to do exactly what these comments are feeding on. Consolidation of the OCC, FDIC makes sense, as they have the same role under the same laws and same interagency guidance letters. \\nThe FDIC works with state level regulators to monitor banks who have bank charters in their state level for financial safety and soundness. The OCC monitors national level charters, but doesn't normally work with state regulators, since those banks are charters nationally.The FED works with member banks and with state level regulators. There is a lot of repetitiveness in this process as it stands, and having a two division single agency would make sense, but execution is most likely going to be rough and messy, given the longevity of the FDIC. In my opinion, it makes more sense to keep FDIC and just move the supervisor fully to them, since almost all of the banks are insured, and let the OCC have a much smaller roll, or consolidate it into the Treasury/FED.","title":"Trump aides Mull Abolishing FDIC"},{"text":"Didn't mean to make you mad.

You're saying that, inside of 21 feet, having a gun or a knife makes little difference to your mortality. I'm saying that it does. If you have a knife, you're going to lose the fight and die. If you have a gun, you have a chance.I didn't say knives can't inflict nonfatal wounds. I said it isn't as likely.No, what you actually said is that knives are sometimes lethal, guns are always lethal:*Misuse a knife, and the victim might survive. Misuse a gun, and you're looking at second- or third-degree murder and a very long jail time, not to mention the psychological trauma of having killed someone.*That's strictly not true.Well, then you can argue with IntrepidJaeger, an active police officer/crime scene investigator, who explained:You're misreading his quote. He's saying that gun injuries are more immediately incapacitating, not lethal; a stabbing victim is more likely to make it off the scene.

All the different new local brands tasted pretty bad initially... Flavorless and rubbery. But after a few years, they got a lot better and now they don't really need to import foreign cheeses. It was a huge boost for the local dairy industry. I believe that tariffs would work the same way but change would be more gradual.\\nWhat the west needs aren't more products, we don't have the money to buy them. We need more opportunities to earn money.

It takes FAR less training to effectively use a gun in defensive situations than a blade. The gun's penetration can simply damage organs or cause severe bleeding regardless of physical strength. I'll have maybe one fatal stabbing a year that ends at the scene, versus many with guns.

I care about drunks firing their guns into the sky and hitting random people when the bullets come back down.Sure, a kid with a knife or a bat might break the skin or a bone, or at most slice something off, but a kid with a gun is more likely to kill himself.So I stand by my point that knife injuries are *comparatively* less serious, regardless of whether they're numerically more common.

But that's really just splitting hairs. Let's take something like universal healthcare. Our current system is so mired down by regulations that you don't get a lot of benefits from the free market (e.g. certificate of need laws, restrictions on the number of residencies basically being a market cap, etc.). It's at least a reasonable question to ask if making healthcare a freer market system with just the necessary regulations would end up with better healthcare for everyone, and very affordable private healthcare (perhaps with some level of government help for those who truly can't afford it), being better off for everyone than the potential poor incentives of a universal healthcare system. You can disagree that that's actually the best path forward for healthcare, but do you think it's a soulless, unempathetic, or mentally deficient point of view to hold?This is a bit more of a libertarian position than a republican one, but my point stands that not everyone who disagrees with the positions you hold is inherently evil or mentally deficient. (About the healthcare point specifically, I do believe that a universal healthcare system could be *better* than our current system, which combines many of the negatives of a free market and regulations, but I'm not convinced that a free market approach couldn't be better yet.)","title":"Cmv: Most Republicans/conservatives are either soulless, un empathetic creatures or have a mental deficiency."},{"text":"It's going to be built in Florida and a hurricane will take it out.?","title":"ABC agrees to give $15 million to Donald Trumps presidential library to settle defamation lawsuit"},{"text":"I'm Canadian.

A middle-class person who has savings will probably prefer the American healthcare system to the UK's. A rich person will *definitely* prefer America's. But to a poor person with no savings, their decision in America would be: \\"Do I want treatment, and in getting treatment lose my home, job, and safety net (worse if you have dependents), or do I want to suffer with this condition indefinitely, knowing it will only get even WORSE with time?\\" And they usually choose the latter. It sounds to me like in the UK, they don't get much of a choice; their condition WILL get worse, but they have a chance of getting treatment even if they have nothing. A poor person will prefer the UK's, in general. It evens the playing field somewhat.So I think the question is, should everyone get bad healthcare, or should only some people (the wealthy) get good healthcare? I would prefer the former, but I could see an argument for the latter. It's just a view I would disagree with.","title":"Cmv: Most Republicans/conservatives are either soulless, un empathetic creatures or have a mental deficiency."},{"text":"Thank you that's really interesting!

This can be either be in the form of cultural change in accepting people who are different than them, or it can be a societal change toward a more chaotic and disordered world. Conservative media loves to capitalize on these fears, but they don't completely come from nowhere.The second is fear of an oppressive government. This can be in the the form of increased taxation, increased commercial regulations, or simply that the rules enforced by the government don't line up with their personal belief system. This can also be easily exploited by conservative media, but again these fears don't come from nowhere.People are likely to be empathetic towards people who are like themselves, but when fears like these are exploited, they become less empathetic towards people who they consider as different.

I've spent a lot of time studying various healthcare systems worldwide, and it's way more complex than \\"universal healthcare good, opposition bad.\\"Take Australia - healthcare isn't purely public. It's a hybrid system with both private and public options, which actually works better than a fully public system. Even the Nordic countries you probably admire have significant private sector involvement in their healthcare.The real debate isn't about whether we should help people - it's about HOW. I've seen how government-run programs can become incredibly inefficient and expensive. The US universities are a perfect example - government involvement in student loans has actually driven up tuition costs dramatically.The only people that are against these things seem to be rich fcks that don't give two shts about anyone else.This is just factually wrong. Many conservative voters are working-class people who've seen well-intentioned government programs fail in their communities. They're not against helping people - they're against solutions that they've seen fail before.Also, focusing on Trump supporters is a massive oversimplification. There are plenty of conservatives who support market-based universal healthcare (like Singapore's system) or school choice programs. These aren't \\"soulless\\" positions - they're different approaches to solving the same problems you care about.You're making the classic mistake of assuming bad intentions when someone disagrees with your preferred solutions.

In retribution for getting cornered, in defense because they are cornered, or, in offense, to escape and gain better position for fighting.I've done some reflection on the Trump decade (2015 to present).  If I was reading this in 2017, I'd be apt to agree with OP.  Trump is just one of them, billionaire corporatocracy doing their thing, two wings of the same bird flying in an optimal direction for their own well being, etc.But, Trump is an ego, and he is rich.  He is a super-egotist and not a multi-millionaire, a billionaire.  Next level money.I now contend that the yacht sized ego he has would never stand for having his name dragged through the mud for this long because he went and got himself \\"compromised\\" and was paying the price.  That ego would not allow the shame of the name as part of the game.  Or the reduction in his wealth to be listed in the history books as one of the many negative things they've said about him.I contend that this is about legacy.  The egotist's end game is almost always legacy.  How will I be remembered?Go back and look at the July 4th fireworks at Mt. Rushmore.  He had to do some major gymnastics to get the US Parks to allow the show on Federal land.  Look at some of the camera cuts to his face as he's looking at those chiseled POTUSs up there.  He was measuring his spot.But, the only way he'd ever get up there is by doing not bad things, or good things, only great things.  The \\"establishment\\" screwed him royally in Trump 1.0, Trump 2.0 is chasing legacy.  Hard.  And he's going to get it.Here's the problem.  There really is a bureaucratic deep state.
