Rescind legality thereof.If anyone even remotely close to being a nutbag of *that* level is able to ascend to such positions (that they have NO business having in the first place), then **yes** there, by definition, must be unprecedented response systems to deal with a) mitigating the damage and b) working to prevent catastrophes borne from ineptness and incapability.Federal judges *rescinding* their retirement should have been expected. That's part of the said unprecedented response system. There are people in positions of great power who *do* want to prevent horrible nonsense from being a literal legal demand and as such are rescinding something, too, just like R's aim to, as well.I.E the reason Trump required unprecedented legal responses from his myriad of crimes is because, well, the crimes were unprecedented. You can't go after unprecedented crimes with NO investigative or charging powers because then the investigation is simply theatre and thus; it's implied to have it be actually legal to do the things they claim are illegal.

Trump did the opposite and actually went out of his way to prevent the Govt. from acquiring what's actually theirs. Only reason he really got charged. Had he given them all back and did no obstructing, he wouldn't have been charged. The DoJ did NOT want to charge a President (clearly, given Garland's worthless ass sitting on the investigation for an eternity) and it's clear he would have been given a \\"warning\\" if he just. gave. them. back.Whole lotta idiots over there.","title":"Another Obama-appointed judge rescinds senior status and becomes third on federal bench to pull reverse retirement on Trump since he won the election"},{"text":"Not gonna happen Bernie.

Anti-Black racism, the core social cleavage in America, is not confined to non-Hispanic whites. Further, the desire for social inferiors is not limited to racial expression. In all the groups Trump gained with (young people, Hispanics, middle-income) most of the defections came from men. I think anger (sometimes self-aware, often subconscious) at women increasingly succeeding in the world, not always being beneath men socially, is one of the big things that attracts people of all backgrounds to Trump. Finally, economic position itself can be a source of dominance. The feeling of anger at a door-dash driver charging $20/hr for their time, or at service staff who are not desperate, or anyone you feel is beneath you claiming some dignity for themselvesthat is not unique to any group of people. It is sadly just human.Aristocratic contempt for the lower orders is nothing newjust ask the Greek and Roman authors. Throughout history, this impulse has not just been cruel, but petty and irrational. Elites will often undermine their own position and tear apart the fabric of the state to lash out at others. To not just dominate but humiliate them. America has now achieved such broad prosperity that this aristocratic brain rot is infecting, or at least within reach, of huge swathes of the voting electorate.

Harris was the epitome of this problem. Authenticity in general was a huge problem. Very few interviews, hilariously sanitised appearances. I see why after her disastrous performance on The View, with a panel that couldn't have been friendlier to her. It gets worse when adjusted for young men. Young men don't watch The View, after all. But they do go to McDonalds, where Trump did a visit serving fries that was plenty mocked in liberal spaces but probably went down a treat with the people it needed to. The US isn't used to young men voting, I get it. It's not like here in Australia, where compulsory voting equalises demographic turnout to a much greater degree. I'd suggest the Democrats hire some Australian Labor consultants; whilst I think they're far from on the money personally, I'm also not exactly the average young man or a swing voter. To their credit, they do much, much better with young men than just about any other centre left party in the West. Personally, I think that's because young men are a key swing demographic (the most crucial being older women) and their margin shift can swing elections, so their messaging is much better tuned to them. !PING AUS","title":"Have the Democrats Become the Party of the lites? | The sociologist Musa al-Gharbi argues that the Great Awokening alienated normie voters, making it difficult for Kamala Harrisand possibly future Democratsto win"},{"text":"Heather Cox Richardson is another highly trustworthy, independent writer fighting for democracy","title":"Media still fighting for democracy"},{"text":"For now, you dont think theylll try to reintroduce this in states without union?

People feel that as these people will never be made to pay, that its right that someone finally has.If you deprive people of justice for crimes made against them and theirs, they will eventually either seek it for themselves, or quietly celebrate that it has been found by others.Not saying its right tbf.

People should generally be prosecuted for their crimes. Though there can be a fine line between criminal prosecutions and political prosecutions. Part of me believes you shouldnt prosecute prior administrations. For one reason, the administration was elected to represent the people for the time they were in office. So any acts they committed in any official capacity were at the will of the electorate. Thats why when many people were upset with the Supreme Court Ruling protecting presidents official acts I wasnt as bothered by it. Though I dont think that means elected or appointed officials have free rein to operate flagrantly to the law. There has to be a line drawn somewhere.

Orban poses an increasingly threatening posture in Europe.Orban has visited Trump at mar-a-largo three times this year. Read the quote below if you want to know what Orban is up to in Europe. It tells you a bit about Trump knowing that he is allied with a leader with these extreme views and positions. From the very outset of Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn has systematically disrupted European decisionmaking. His unpredictable positions on geopolitical issues and confrontative comments have become commonplace.Orbns recent interview, given on the morning of the November 7 informal European Council meeting, may provide some insights into his true ambitions and future behavior. He declared that Hungary has successfully resisted judicial activism from Brussels because it is always prepared to revolt against interference in national actions. He called for rebellion against the laws and court rulings that are currently in force. This complaint relates to the European Court of Justice, which has imposed a 200 million ($213 million) fine and further daily penalties of 1 million ($1.1 million) on Hungary for its failure to comply with EU asylum rules.Becoming a transformative actor on the international stage and shaping the future of the EU has always been Orbns political aim. This approach emerged back in 2010, with his pursuit of an Opening to the East--a policy aimed at economic diversification, including through increased business and friendlier political relations with Russia, Turkey, and China-. Orbns ambition is to thrust Hungary, a small Eastern European country at the periphery of transatlantic cooperation, to the heart of Europeaneven globaldecisionmaking. This foreign policy agenda is an essential part of his nationalist, illiberal, populist regime.In NATO, Orbns ambition is to boost business deals and make himself heard. Within the EU, he wants to shape the organizations future, and get it to provide the maximum institutional and financial backup for Hungarys economic progress while accepting his illiberal rule. For this, it is necessary to weaken the blocs ideological consensus and political competencies.Since gaining constitutional power in 2010, he adopted a confrontational posture within the EU to push back against criticism of his countrys systemic democratic backsliding and growing autocratization. Until 2020, however, he played by the EUs terms. The rebellion attitude, which openly undermines the blocs ability to act in unity, is new. It aims to both pressure the European Commission to release some of the frozen EU funds to the Hungarian government, and to demonstrate that no important decision can be made without Orbn.\\nhttps://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2024/11/orbans-rebellion-against-europe-gains-momentum?lang=en","title":"Another Obama-appointed judge rescinds senior status and becomes third on federal bench to pull reverse retirement on Trump since he won the election"},{"text":"Ya know...Democrats (and especially progressives) - didn't come out in enough numbers to give Democrats power to do anything.

There's no way around that.

Which, if we're being totally honest, is how and by whom the country was founded. So he's shitting on the shooter without acknowledging that a *lot* of people feel that the victim was some kind of tyrant who so thoroughly broke the social contract that these people don't want him in their society. A lot of those same people really feel like UHC's actions, and Thompson's influence on them, were met with violence because they are also violence. So when you have a group of people who feel like someone's committing violence against them and a politician who says people shouldn't fight back (but also he intends to do nothing about it via the legal process), a lot of those people are going to feel like that retaliatory violence is justified.","title":"Blunt Democratic senator roasts those cheering CEOs killing"},{"text":"Oop where'd their response go!?","title":"Even Bernie Sanders believes Hunter Biden Pardon sets dangerous precedent"},{"text":"Thanks haha, I couldve sworn I just had my cake day.

If it mentioned the Russian money being funneled to rightwing podcasters rather than blaming Harris for not going on one particular podcast with outsized rightwing influence, then it may have had a valid point.

It also wanted to absolve white men from voting for Trump and blame black women instead when black women voted for Kamala at somewhere around 90%.

In fact, more harm and harassment is likely to occur without it (I am saying this as a matter of fact, not what should occur in an ideal world where all men resist sexual urges).

In 2016, white men are the only gender-race combination to overwhelmingly favor Sanders over Clinton. White men back Sanders by 26.4 percentage points more than do white women (who prefer Clinton, on average). In 2008, white men voted more for Clinton than Obama  but were 20.6 points less supportive of her than white women. https://archive.is/otx1zMen, especially white men, won't vote for a woman. That's the reality of the situation.","title":"Progressives should defend Bidens legacy to protect their future"},{"text":"And when we treat them like celebrities.

The best progressive piece of media in history was Modern Family. That show single handily did more for normalizing gay relationships than any other piece of media in history. They did this by treating being gay as normal, they didn't make it a big in your face thing, it was just 2 characters in the show having a family. They were treated as normal people. However, almost every other piece of progressive media just shoves it in your face. The most blatant example of this that I will always remember is Mass Effect Andromeda. That game had a literal character who's entire point was to remind you that they are trans every time you speak to them. It wasn't just a small character trait, it was literally their only reason to exist in the game. This has for some reason been the way that all minority and women characters are now treated in the media. A character can't be a normal person that is gay, trans, or a woman. They literally need to make that their entire personality. There also needs to be a discrimination angle, even when it is completely out of place in the media. Ironically, Destiny (the game) had a really good trans character that I wish more games would copy. I forget their name, but they were a character that just uses male pronouns to the point where you can just play the game without ever realizing that they are trans. The only way to find out is if you read old communications about them. At some point, the pronouns used just changes. They go from female to male pronouns. No one mentions that they are trans, it is just an organic thing. That is what more games should do. Don't make the entire character that they are trans.","title":"Have the Democrats Become the Party of the lites? | The sociologist Musa al-Gharbi argues that the Great Awokening alienated normie voters, making it difficult for Kamala Harrisand possibly future Democratsto win"},{"text":"By certain measures, such as [income concentration](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality) (See Fig. 4), things are already as bad or worse than the Gilded Age.

You entire response at this point seems to be about muddying the waters by pushing a vaguely slippery slope argument that runs along the lines of well current social convention is womens breasts are obscene and the idea that they arent invites or tacitly supports the complete erosion of any laws or norms regarding clothing. Which feels particularly bad faith to me - youre confused that in a discussion about a very specific instance about the obscenity of female nipples why any limits on clothing or perhaps any limits on total anarchy arent accounted for in the discussion. That feels a bit ridiculous doesnt it? Still I assume the earnestness of the discussion so will lay out the discussion and argument as I see it.\\nI think the argument Im making is this:1. It is disingenuous to try to present or imply that OPs position is fringe or as ridiculous as your first response implies via tone and examples2. That appeal to authority and majority on the obscenity of female toplessness arent compelling give there isnt historical or cultural agreement on it.3. If society is meant to change or have the opportunity to change in the contexts you suggested such as pools and beaches, then the laws have to allow that rather than impose norms. The current legal code around female toplessness locks in the norms as they are and does not allow for change. In some spaces, such as social media there is wiggling in regards to the laws such that rather than full censoring we see less and less over time - which is part of groups and movements pushing for acceptance and equal treatment. These groups and movements have a historical context reaching back probably to the Suffragette movement but at least the 60s and the wave of the feminist movement at the time.4. At least within the US there is at the least an expectation of equal treatment under the law. Male nipples and female nipples are treated differently. The legal standard in the US related to the limiting of rights is based upon harm and infringement. Since female toplessness doesnt no more harm or infringe on others more so that male toplessness it makes little sense that it is treated differently. The burden is placed on women based upon the perceptions and beliefs of others. This seems unreasonable. The laws regarding nudity should be equal in their treatment of the human body. 5. The discussion is specific. In discussing the obscenity of one thing, one does not need to discuss the obscenity of all things. There isnt a need to discuss the what about. And if the change in the laws regarding female toplessness did lead to a social push to change laws regarding clothing that would be a separate issue to be dealt with at the time, not a counterpoint to the discussion of should female toplessness be treated the same as male toplessness under the law. If we wish to go the other direction and force the female standards on men that is acceptable though seems archaic and prudish, it would be acceptable. Though it would be necessary to argue a compelling reason for the loss of freedom grounded in some logic free from religious morals, appealing to some secular morality or demonstrable harm or infringement on rights of others.6. While not relevant to the discussion I dont find the human body obscene, I dont believe it needs to be hidden or covered in general. Clothes are only as useful as the purposes they serve but I dont care strongly enough that I think clothing laws should be abolished - as long as they are equal. If one person can take their shirt off in a context, anyone can. I would further take issue with any decency law tied purely to a religious code of morals. What people choose to do within an equal legal frame is up to them. The restraint on rights is always meant to be a light as possible, respecting the rights of others and limiting potential harm. But with respect to creating laws to govern society and guard rights - that is far from a cry for anarchy.","title":"CMV: Womens Toplessness Should Be Legal and Not Censored Online \\n"},{"text":"Almost everyone who plays on a proper 18 hole course will use some mode of transportation other than walking.

The word \\"implicit\\" is, again, the key word. The law here, via the 1915 SCOTUS, is saying that you can *reject* an unconditional pardon for the reason of it being construed as an implicit admission of guilt, not necessarily that accepting a pardon is *always* such. If anything, the court said to George Burdick \\"you're allowed to feel that way about Wilson trying to pardon you\\", not \\"this is what every pardon is from now until the end of time\\".This is where Kalt's op-ed comes into play. Should a completely innocent and exonerated man reject a pardon for a crime they were wrongfully convicted of? What if they're still incarcerated? If it were me I'd certainly rather be a free man than a stubborn wrongfully incarcerated man.The problem here is the court decision doesn't actually go into the cases Kalt is talking about. And I blame that on the fact that Article II doesn't even actually mention it. The Constitution simply says the following:and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United StatesConsidering this was written in the 1780s, I don't think the founding fathers ever considered, in a new country of only four million people at the time, that an innocent man could ever be railroaded so hard by a complex system of district attorneys, attorneys general, public defenders, and some thirty thousand judgeships across the country.","title":"Dozens Of Democrats Ask Biden To Free Leonard Peltier"},{"text":"CEOs will be done. ??","title":"Sen.

We know our country is being controlled by the rich and we know they dont care about doing the right thing and doing things that will help the majority and not just the rich minority, but the fact still remains, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Talking about it during speeches and in your tweets is great but it doesnt change shit, how about actually doing something that will actively change or at least challenge that narrative for once?! Its only going to get worse if we as a collective just sit by and complain all the time but dont actually fight for the change we so desperately need. Its obviously not going to be easy or happen overnight, but anything is better than just sitting by and saying this isnt right, this sucks, something needs to change, we gotta fix this, but then not doing anything about it. We need to start electing people who will actually do something about it instead of complicit sheep who fall in line every time we need them to stand up to these corps and all the massive wealth lobbying happening in our gov. I wish more regular ass people who live regular ass lives and went to regular ass schools would get into politics and fight for what is right instead of being consumed/controlled by corp greed and pay offs. But thanks to Citizens United and now all this money in politics, it only allows those with huge pockets and major donor backing to get elected and do the same shit the person before them did, aka, nothing for regular median citizens, yet we make up the biggest portion of the voting population. There is a massive disconnect between our politicians and the majority of the American population and if we keep letting money control election outcomes, its only going to get worse.","title":"Bernie Sanders Warns U.S. Is Becoming an Oligarchy"},{"text":"And genocide","title":"Progressives should defend Bidens legacy to protect their future"},{"text":"Are tech workers petite bourgeois?","title":"Have the Democrats Become the Party of the lites? | The sociologist Musa al-Gharbi argues that the Great Awokening alienated normie voters, making it difficult for Kamala Harrisand possibly future Democratsto win"},{"text":"Unnecessary whataboutism","title":"Asians are a Model Democracy"},{"text":"You mean Biden the coward?

In almost every other one Id say the Democrats did worse than they couldve or even lost elections that they really shouldve won if they had campaigned competently. And I suspect 2008 and 2012 have much more to do with Obama being an incredible candidate than any of his staffers being all that competent.The Democratic Party has good, electable candidates. The problem is weve only managed to win this century with Obama and Obamas VP, and Obama was a great candidate. Meanwhile the Republicans were able to keep Bush in the White House for two terms, and hes an incompetent oaf who doesnt have any of the once in a generation appeal of Obama and (sadly) Trump. We need a campaign infrastructure that can win with candidates that arent Obama or Obama adjacent, and we need to be able to win with candidates who arent once in a generation miracles. Josh Shapiro is absolutely someone who could win a Presidential election, but whether he does or not is dependent on either the economy being so catastrophically bad Republicans are completely unelectable, or Josh Shapiro being a once in a generation wonder kid.

In social media 10-20 years ago any kind of topless woman would have been censored or pulled down and now we have  minimum of nipple blurring and allow body art.Society has changed in how it perceives female toplessness and it has done so as the result of a consistent pressure by movements and arguments for equal treatment of the human form under the law. Society is stalled in changing to allow women to go topless because of the laws around it, more so than public perception or opinion. Changing the law allows society and individuals decide what is appropriate by providing equal legal opportunity to do so.There either is or there is not equality under the law. Changing the law does not invite full nudity or even toplessness in all contexts but it allows individuals and society to decide when and where we will allow all people to be topless. There isnt anything wrong in womens physical bodies being visible. The issue is in how others interpret that. The rule of how rights are limited is famously summed up in your right to swing your fist ends at my nose. In the unequal treatment of male and female toplessness it seems the right of the first is extended. Being topless does nothing to anyone else, but because of moralistic judgements by others applied to the body, morals not even necessarily shared, women are forced to conceal themselves in contexts men are not. \\nPeople still would have to abide by the rules of various private institutions when visiting them and this desire for equal treatment under the law is a far cry from let people be topless anywhere. Its largely just seeking the same contextual freedom of men - pools, beaches, yard work, etc.","title":"CMV: Womens Toplessness Should Be Legal and Not Censored Online \\n"},{"text":"Actually people really need to stop focusing on reacting and defending and start actually thinking about how they are going to attack, attack,  attack Republicans and put them in the back foot.When are you people gonna learn.

Musk just recently matched the percentage of GDP (1.5%) that John D. Rockefeller controlled during his heyday. They fucked it all up then too, leading to the Great Depression.This country was built on the backs of slaves, indentured servants, and the exploitation of the working class. Most people alive today have only known the brief period following the New Deal in tandem with the WWII industrial boom, which created the middle class by accident (from an oligarch's point of view anyway). The wealthy elite have been systematically dismantling the New Deal ever since, and all modern Conservatism is derived from that unifying goal. This is true of both political parties, the difference being the Democrats having a modicum of restraint because they understand that long-term stability and placating (and just barely at that) the is better for them in the long run, whereas the Republicans just smash and grab everything they can, future be damned.That's why we'll always have Progressives amongst the Dems, because that's the token bone they throw us. Republicans realized a while ago that this is no longer necessary. Both sides aren't the same, but neither side gives a flying fuck about the classes beneath them. Dems would rather lose to Republicans than give the keys to Progressives or the people. Case in point, what's 84 year old, filthy rich Nancy Pelosi doing right now (besides hip surgery)? Trying to tank AOC's bid for a seat on the Oversight Committee, instead of fighting the incoming administration.

Turns out most of them and the vast majority of the country agree now it was a bad idea, *including Trump,* who despite saying he was against the war, was at best lightly for it when asked in '03. Yet it goes back even further: NAFTA? That was *Reagan's baby* and dream, and a *conservative dream*, it's just that 1) Clinton was a stupid \\"Third Way\\" Democrat, an idea that only took off after Democrats got obliterated by Reagan in '80 and '84, then lost to his VP in '88, and 2) far more Republicans were in favor, regardless, while Democrats were insisting on inserting things like worker protections, etc., into the bill, stalling its passage. Guess what \\"both sides\\" now agree was a bad idea, including Trump? NAFTA.Now what are people on the left saying is a bad idea?

Mens breasts are not the same as Womens breasts. Our society and culture views womens breasts as sexual objects. Bodily autonomy is irrelevant because you can choose to wear (or what not to wear) whatever you want in your private life you still cant go to a local restaurant without a shirt on. Having some level of standards for public decency is not an equality issue. 2. Womens breasts ARE viewed in our society as sexual objects this is not a debatable talking point. You are arguing that they shouldnt be viewed in this way, but this is an open self-admission that they already are considered sexual. Your view is definitively the minority one on this. Walk around with a photo of a topless woman and show it to people on the streets of America see how they respond to that. 3. Self-expression can, should, and always has been policed by society. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre has never been free-speech. We have expectations regarding how people are supposed to carry themselves in their every-day lives your right to self-expression does not give you the ability to do whatever you want whenever you want. 4. Censorship is not an inherently negative thing. We censor movies on television during the day for sexual content and over-the-top violence all the time, because we dont know WHO might be watching the tv. Nobody wants to live in an X-rated society where the most depraved obscenity, gore, or porn is constantly being thrown in your face. What you do in private is your own business so long as it doesnt harm others One of my biggest pet peeves is when people bring their fetishes into the real world and expose people who did not consent to being around that in public. 5. Social media is owned by private companies. Not the government. Even if toplessness became legal for women, many social media platforms would still refuse to allows these types of posts. Too many children, too much liability, and too many digital stalkers and online predators. Addressing your counter-arguments:1. Womens Breasts ARE considered sexual. See response #2. 2. This would not lead to exploitation unless youre talking about people having photos of themselves be posted and shared online unconsensually. Its not illegal to film or take photos in public after all, and if social media allows it then theres nothing breaking TOS to post photos of half-naked women online right?3. I hate this argument so much. The human body IS sexual. You cannot remove that aspect of the human experience. Minors, specifically when they are going through puberty, are in a very sexual part of their lives where their bodies are noticeably changing, they are beginning to feel things they have never felt or experienced before, and they are beginning to notice certain urges and interests that they didnt have before. They are also dumb due to a lack of life-experiences minors DO need to be protected while also being taught how to have a healthy relationship with their own personal sexuality. 4. If you want to see topless women or post photos of yourself, you can just type that in to google. There exist THOUSANDS of websites that will allow you to post topless photos of yourself without question. The option already exists but you understand what those websites are for and why people use them. Maybe, the type of attention that comes with these types of images and the type of people that search the these spaces out are why these spaces are so toxic, exploitative, and misogynistic the content informs the culture. Social media already sucks, lets not make it a worse place by only further empowering online pervs and incels.","title":"CMV: Womens Toplessness Should Be Legal and Not Censored Online \\n"},{"text":"The Confederacy wanted slavery.

Yes you can say if you explaining your losing, and Kamalas team tested 100 different response ads and none of them worked! Both of which are true. But its undeniably that her not taking a firm stance against her transgender prison soundbite was a shit move. Basically voters saw that in the past she was super liberal because she thought thats how she could win the primary, then in 2024 they saw she was moderate because thats how she thought she could win. Voters thought that the real Kamala was 2020 and she was just saying moderate things, but once in office the real 2020 Kamala would come out.?Finally, combine this all with a candidate who couldnt go off talking points, rarely traveled into adverse interview environments, and seemed glued to the hip of the least popular modern president of all time and yeah, its starting to seem a little more clear why she lost.?Now, is this all 20/20 hindsight.

Its not that there was none: Clintons post-convention bus tour took her through Youngstown, Ohio, as well as Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, where she tried to eat into Trumps margins with his base. In Scranton and Harrisburg, the campaign aired a commercial that featured a David Letterman clip of Trump admitting to outsourcing manufacturing of the products and clothes that bore his logo. And at campaign stops in Ohio, Clinton talked about Trumps reliance on Chinese steel.\\n But in general, Bill Clintons viewpoint of fighting for the working class white voters was often dismissed with a hand wave by senior members of the team as a personal vendetta to win back the voters who elected him, from a talented but aging politician who simply refused to accept the new Democratic map.

I know she's Pro abortion. I know she came from San Francisco where police don't bother if you steal something. I know she hasn't ever done anything to fix housing other than suggest rent controls. And Dems had zero plan for the border until mid-summer when Biden finally shut down the border for asylum seekers. It's like they could've done that the whole time but they were banking on the Hispanic bloc.She didn't give me the warm-and-fuzzies that she was going to represent my economic best interests, but instead I got a load of cultural war stuff and insinuation from her voters and people here that I must be racist or transphobic if I don't vote for her.","title":"Democrats fundraising tactics arent just annoying.

It's actually less of a big deal than people think because Democrats can still win under this alignment.What happened was that the Democrats went further left on social issues after Trump was elected as a reaction to Trump. They leaned heavily on the mainstream media and expert opinion as Trump fully abandoned those things. At first this worked tremendously well during COVID but as COVID dragged on it dragged them down. Particularly policies that came out of the BLM movement were policies that were pounced on by Republicans. An increase in petty crime as homelessness in the post pandemic era was also really pounced upon by Republicans and people hate inflation. So basically people got quickly tired of the Democratic coalition that was elected during COVID and BLM in power. This coalition was a reaction against Trump and was formed from 2016-2020 and was a mixture of anti-racist policies and progressive economic policies.  The public saw this coalition as overreaching as blamed them fairly or not for inflation. It should also be noted that the electorate seems to have made up their mind well before Harris actually lost. Inflation was significantly down, crime was down etc and people were still mad that these things increased in the first place. They blamed Democrats their anger didn't subside as the negatives subsided. It was also a messaging problem. Going back to COVID Democrats abandoned their conspiracy theorist anti-science types in favor for experts. There was increasingly no place for populist and anti-authoritarian conspiracy theories within the Democratic Party. Reacting to this some very influential people with media platforms went from being politically mild or neutral to very much pro-Trump.  Mainly Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, but many others as well. This caused the Democrats to completely lose control of the national narrative. Between explicitly conservative media that is rarely if ever pay walled vs. legacy media which often is pay walled and just not engaging with the right wing podcast and social media arena and dismissing these very influential people, that's they lost the narrative. Beyond that Biden was old and unable to use the \\"Bully Pulpit.\\" He was not good at controlling the narrative through his presidency. Modern presidents need to be attention grabbers and able to compete with the entertainment media and all the things trying to draw people's attention. Biden is/was the opposite of his. Harris had no chance to reverse this.","title":"Have the Democrats Become the Party of the lites? | The sociologist Musa al-Gharbi argues that the Great Awokening alienated normie voters, making it difficult for Kamala Harrisand possibly future Democratsto win"},{"text":"Itll be like all the French people who were suddenly joining the resistance in 1944","title":"ABC Faces Anger After $15M Trump Settlement: 'Democracy Dies'"},{"text":"The question is about health insurance, people are not shooting up schools because of a lack of insurance.People with mental health issues are not getting them addressed because of cultural issues that don't address mental health.

Foreign adversaries want to keep people dumb and complacent in case they ever decide to invade.

That's just the way things work. The opposite is true when Conservatives mention reducing government control and Liberals carry on like it would be the end of the world (like healthcare or now the Department of Education).I'm sure you don't listen to Conservative outlets, but I do. And Liberals are actually sitting on a winning issue, but as usual, you've gone nuts with it. The larger Conservative position isn't that global warming isn't happening, but that the various proposed solutions to it would be worse than if it just happened. You could tone down the rhetoric and make \\"solutions\\" less drastic, but if course you don't. Instead you keep pushing your fear tactics that Florida and NYC will be underwater by 2020 unless everyone does what you want. And Conservatives just aren't buying it, particularly when prediction after prediction comes and goes. And specifically Al Gore's powerpoint video was full of predictions like that.Also nobody buys it because you're hypocrites. There was a study done a couple years ago on D vs. R personal habits toward environmentalism. It showed that Republicans actually practiced more recycling-type conservation habits than Democrats. So you guys tell us the sky is falling yet do nothing but sit back and wait for Big Government to do everything for you and we're not supposed to think this is just a plan to make government bigger?And adding onto the hypocrisy, you also lie about your findings. The \\"hottest day in London's history\\" was a temperature recorded at an airfield the second that a couple fighter jets were taking off. Or the NOAA re-averaging historical weather data specifically to make the past seem colder. Lots of such examples. If you have to lie to push a narrative, why should anyone believe what you say?During the Global Cooling scare of not too long ago, there was a plan to cover Greenland with coal dust, with the idea the earth could then absorb more heat. Gonna guess you wouldn't be in support of that plan now. If a crazy plan from only 40 years ago was terribly wrong, what makes the crazy plans of today so right?Today, US republicans operate even more fervently on tribal mentality. If Kamala Harris stormed into a burning house on live tv and saved a baby, we all know Fox News would spin it into a sinister hoax.Yes, of course you guys are above it all. Trump wins Time's Person of the Year and the resulting news articles are quick to note that Hitler once won it, too. Funny I don't remember those articles when Obama won.

When asked about protecting trans healthcare we need to say that we are protecting privacy and autonomy. Same with abortion. We need to pursue deregulation when it has no critical benefit to the environment or public safety. I think Democrats need to look at the more libertarian leaning members of the party like Jared Polis and use that as a roadmap to take the entire concept of choice and freedom away from being a Republican talking point. I actually thought Kamala did this pretty well, but it was unfortunately a departure from some of her rhetoric in the 2016 primary and I think that hurt her.

The successes on things like gay marriage came as a by-product of Obama's win.

I think a fair amount of the population said that was a bit too far left, and the devil we know (Trump) may be better than the devil we don't know.  So they stayed home. Trump promised jobs, lower grocery prices, and to end the war in Ukraine, and a whole bunch of other nonsense. But that resonates more with \\"everyday Americans\\" than giving puberty blockers to 8-year olds and shaming people for saying their ancient ancestors probably owned slaves.Yet everyone here on the Reddit echo chamber is perplexed on how Kamala lost.

A few years ago I offered them to option of getting a stipend for health insurance so they could purchase it on their own. I initially did this because I found a better option myself for my family. Today none of my employees are on the company medical insurance. Everyone took the option. They all still get vision and dental from the company but everyone gets their medical on their own.The problem with medical insurance (and insurance in general) is that the insurance companies profit incentive is out of alignment with the customer. The health plan I use for my family is different.Of the $500 per month we pay to cover the four of us, $200 ($50 per person) goes to the company itself. Thats their revenue. The rest goes into an account in our name is used to help other members pay for their medical expenses. It works just like insurance but isnt insurance. Rather than there being a high yearly deductible, its $500 per event. Need a colonoscopy? $500. Break your arm? $500. Your annual physical is included so  you dont pay for that. But if you want to see your doctor outside of that, youll pay for it because it will be far less than $500. They dont include prescriptions but we dont have any expensive ones and we save so much it doesnt matter. If you have a preexisting condition they dont cover it for the first two years. After that they cover up to $25K. My wife went through breast cancer several years ago and her follow up appointments are considered preexisting but its still a better deal that anywhere else. They are also great to work with. We have had several medical events and they have done everything they said they would.

Womens toplessness and bare breasts are only contextualized as obscene in certain cultures. This argument ignores that norms and the institutions around them are entirely man made and malleable. In the US there has been a consistent effort to change the legality of those since the 60s because in changing the legality you would reshape the normative cultural perceptions. So the argument breasts are currently seen as sexual and obscene so thats how it is falls flat for me since the solution to that is to alter the way breasts are treated legally to effect the cultural behavior.\\nFurther in both of your responses you make a lot of appeal to majority thats what society agrees on and try to isolate the OP with ridiculously singular examples like eating bananas via deep throating. This undercuts a lot of your argument as it ignores that free the nipple, bra burning, the feminist movement, etc have long been at work communicating that society at large does not agree on this or gender inequality. Laws and norms from decades past have persisted in many systems which are slow to change and there is another group in society that is very much in disagreement but they, nor is the fact of what you consider current is legally framed - mean that the there is a majority that has right or that the social compact forces anyone to abide by or be dismissed of.I apologize if my tone is more aggressive than I intend but seeing what is part of a long standing effort to acquire equal treatment under the law trivialized in such a way is just galling.","title":"CMV: Womens Toplessness Should Be Legal and Not Censored Online \\n"},{"text":"Just do contracts.

I am not going to look up the exact estimate -- and it is an estimate since Dominion is privately held and not required to disclose earnings, etc. -- but the settlement was equivalent to some 20 years of yearly income to the company.

If you can find someone who works in \\"infection control\\" you'll find a bunch of nurses who write insurance reports about medical malpractice in your local hospital.

This is why we have teachers aides, custodial, and maintenance workers that are literally on food stamps and housing assistance while almost all the pay increases go to teachers and administrators who are already making $80k+ by the time they get tenure, and $120k+ by the time they are vested for retirement.

That is the kind of thing you can handle with two years. I bet a system could be set up that the courses are offered during summer vacation as well. If we set up a teacher program so that they take one course at a time, during the school year, and then two courses over the summer, we can get them qualified in 2 years.There are other options as well as redefining science teachers. And we can split science teachers into chemistry teachers and physics teachers, and then it's a couple less courses. We can also split them up into Grade 9 10 courses versus grade 11, 12. I work as a teacher in the private school system, so it works a bit differently, but I am fairly confident I can teach Grade 9 science at all levels. I am certain that I can not teach grade chemistry. Perhaps there's a way to break it up into groups.Some key things that need to be considered for starters are who's paying for it? I would definitely not want the teacher paying for it. The second is how we set up these degrees to be independent certifications on the topic so the teacher is continually building their resume.I know that for me as a teacher, I would love it if my school were paying for my continued education. I know that I and one of my co-workers are both in grad school, each studying our own thing, and would love it if the school would be paying for more education for us.If I can get my high school to pay for me to take all the core courses for chemistry and physics and biochem, that would be amazing. And yes, I get that my particular situation is very different. For one, I work in the private school system, not the public, and for second, I'm not in the United States.But I wonder how many teachers would want to get that continuing education paid for by the school district. I imagine you would not get so many first - to 5th year teachers who are taking you up on this option. But somebody who's been teaching for 5 years maybe interested in advancing their career. I know one of the complaints teachers have is a lack of career Mobility and having all this extra training can help their careers any extra certifications might make them more competitive and make other school districts more interested in having them, as well some teachers may be interested in just learning the subjects for personal growth and others may be using it as a way to eventually find a new career.So we're clear this only works if the government is paying for the continued education and the teacher doesn't have to pay out of pocket.I also agree it would probably be more economic for the teacher to spend the time getting a part-time job but this seems more fun.","title":"CMV: Teachers in subjects that are in higher shortage/demand should receive higher pay on the salary schedule"},{"text":"Brain damage lol","title":"Joe &amp; Jill Bidens Christmas White House vs Donald &amp; Melania Trumps Christmas White House"},{"text":"Lmao we lost to the biggest conman in history, fuck off","title":"Illinois lawmakers furious after Biden commutes sentences of state fraudsters"},{"text":"This pretty much sums up the their entire reign.\\nIts all glitter and great because they tell you it is. \\nThe reality couldnt be further from the from it.","title":"Joe &amp; Jill Bidens Christmas White House vs Donald &amp; Melania Trumps Christmas White House"},{"text":"I don't know how the work at all. 90% of texts get sent to spam on my phone without any input from me.","title":"Democrats fundraising tactics arent just annoying.

Countries could hate each other alot but as long as there is no sense of a deadline the conflict could be allowed to simmer or freeze. India Pakistan have an incredibly hot relationship with a ton of friction. They even flirted with war, but there has always been some sense of resolution or equalibrium reached because there never been a sense of \\"do or die\\". Same thing with Korea rn. Offically they are still at war, but practically there is no rush to fight a war so both sides just wait. When you look at conflicts in history you realize there is a deadline to alot of them. Sinwar knew that Israel was making massive inroads with the Arab world thus he knew he had to do something to break that relationship. Putin knew everyday Ukraine  was getting stronger and closer to the west and every day he was getting older. Reason why US war planners view late 2020s as the highest risk of China invading Taiwan is because that's when China population will peak due to one child policy and when China will be at their strongest. Due to the energy, expense, and slowish communications in 1914 Europe an assassination gets blown up into a continental war. This lack of time I feel is the most critical aspect of why conficts happen, and why conflicts freeze then thaws.

Even Casey for a while was a pro-life democrat- PA politics has always had an element of splitting the differenceI didnt always agree with him, but I thought he was a reasonable step forward for the state and clearly better than Oz. Im under no illusion that PA will vote for an actual progressive, so this guy who seemed to sympathize and do well with western PA rural voters seemed like a good option. Ill never voter for him again though. He has been extremely disappointing and downright awful.  It does not bode well for the future of PA, which is already disgustingly divided.","title":"John Fetterman calls for Trump pardon in Truth Social debut, cementing progressive pariah status | \\nCant believe I ever liked this dude."},{"text":"Trump is part of the gameshow","title":"The most cynically plausible drone explanation that of contemplates the socio-political most people are missing"},{"text":"His attention span isn't that long but his unelected controllers knew.","title":"It Turns Out That Biden Never Considered the 'Specifics' of the 1500 Clemency Cases He Commuted ??"},{"text":"He fucking bragged about it later.

All it does is make FGM seem \\"not that bad,\\" as opposed to make circumcision seem bad.Female circumcision exists in a variety of forms. Of the 4 total categories, 1 is objectively less damaging than the average American circumcision and another is roughly equivalent. The other 2 are worse.It is not accurate, nor fair, to apply points about a single and uncommon type of female genital cutting, to all types (which also includes ritual pinpricking and bloodletting ceremonies, in which NO tissue is removed). All forms of FGM are banned, but male circumcision isn't, despite the fact that even MUCH less invasive forms of female circumcision are also banned! Think of ritual pinpricking or hoodectomies.It's because with male genital mutilation, we apply a damage principle, saying that if it is performed correctly, it isn't damaging and therefore totally okay to do, despite it removing the foreskin and its functions.When it comes to FGM, we don't even consider to think whether it damages the girl, because we don't apply this damage principle onto girls and women. Whether FGM is allowed or not is based on women (and girls) having rights over their bodies - Had this not been the case, then forms of FGM that are milder than MGM would still be allowed.The Dutch Ethicist, Gert van Dijk, of the Royal Dutch Medical Association did a presentation on this.There are millions of circumcised men who are absolutely fine and are able to live normal lives, have regular pleasurable sex, and reproduce normally. Meanwhile, women who are forced to undergo FGM usually suffer from lifelong medical problems, serious infections, have shorter life expectancies, and often can't have sex?*at all*?without it being painful. It's also worth noting that women who underwent it overwhelmingly rally against FGM, while circumcised men overwhelmingly don't care.You are so incorrect yet so confident. ; Circumcised women are the primary proponent of FGM, just like how circumcised men are the proponent of MGM. Just like how circumcised men overwhelmingly don't care, uncircumcised women overwhelmingly don't care either. They use the EXACT justifications that we use to justify MGM. https://www.taskforcefgm.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hast81.pdfResearch by gynecologists and others has demonstrated that a high percentage of women who have had genital surgery have rich sexual lives, including desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, and their frequency of sexual activity is not reduced.The widely publicized and sensationalized reproductive health and medical complications associated with female genital surgeries in Africa are infrequent events and represent the exception rather than the rule.Female genital surgeries in Africa are viewed by many insiders as aesthetic enhancements of the body and are not judged to be mutilations.Customary genital surgeries are not restricted to females.The empirical association between patriarchy and genital surgeries is not well established.Female genital surgery in Africa is typically controlled and managed by women.Most circumcised women are also satisfied with their circumcision and support circumcising their daughters for religious, health and hygiene reasons and it being preferred by the husband... Does that make FGM okay? [92% of Indonesian mothers support Type IV FGM for their daughters](https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/departments_sbsr-rh/34/) and [82% of Egyptian mothers support Type I FGM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134892/)","title":"CMV: Medically unnecessary circumcision is unjustifiable child abuse"},{"text":"Finish paperclose 40+ tabsopium hit","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/o00qk03w707e1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26c997ee93357148604a7d23d7a4bafba09c6b7Americans are fat and eat cheeseburger","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Fascism is the most unsuccessful loser ideology and people who propose it unironically shouldn't just be hated, they should be genuinely embarassed","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"He's up for re-election in 2026.

The religious purpose is, God said it is better for Men.

Also it makes some of the female nurses less comfortable having to pull down a man's foreskin to insert the Foley cath or having to pull it down to clean a man's penis (like jacking them off, and some pts do get turned on by this).You're also not considering how much more difficult it can be to keep clean for someone who has a disability like an amputated arm, or someone who had a stroke and loses function of an arm, a person with arthritis, or an elderly person etc. increasing the risk of UTIs.Your whole argument is based in emotion and subjectivity. You haven't explained how circumcision is \\"abuse\\", the sexual organ still functions as needed.

Here you go:North Carolina is a state of balance, a true purple state. With our nearly 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans, North Carolinians expect fairness when it comes to how their voices are represented in Congress. But the Republican-controlled legislatures latest gerrymandered election maps did more than just silence voters in North Carolina. They reshaped the balance of power in Washington D.C., costing Democrats control of the U.S. House of Representatives.Heres the reality: the congressional map we used to have, with a 7-7 Republican-Democratic split, reflected the true political makeup of our state. It was fair. It gave voters on both sides confidence that their voices mattered. But that wasnt good enough for legislative Republicans in Raleigh. They threw fairness out the window, forcing through a mid-decade map that handed Republicans an unfair 10-4 advantage in the next Congress. Thats 71% of North Carolinas seats in the U.S. House going to Republicans and those 10 bright red districts were not even close.It doesnt take a mathematician to see whats wrong with that. And now, with Adam Grays apparent victory in Californias 13th District giving Republicans a bare three-seat majority in the U.S. House, its clear that gerrymandering in North Carolina tipped the scales in their favor and cost Democrats control of the US House of Representatives. My district along with the districts of Jeff Jackson and Kathy Manning were turned into safe Republican seats where Democrats had zero chance to win. Had North Carolina sent the three of us back to Washington, under fair maps, then New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries would be our next Speaker of the House with a one seat Democratic majority at 218-217.Lets be clear. This wasnt an accident. This was by design. Republicans in Congress can give North Carolina Speaker Tim Moore a big wet kiss when he gets to Washington. Not only did he draw himself a safe Republican seat, but he gave Republicans the three House seats that became the difference in control of Congress.The MAGA Republicans in Raleigh who drew these maps didnt care about reflecting the will of the people. They cared about power. They used the redistricting process to rig the system, taking advantage of their supermajority to draw lines that would give them three more seats  no matter what the voters wanted.But voters deserve better. They deserve a system where their voices are heard, where their votes matter, and where their representatives are chosen by the people  not by politicians drawing lines behind closed doors.Thats why Im fighting for my bill, the Fair Maps Act, which would establish independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions in every state across the country. These commissions would take the power out of politicians hands and ensure that congressional maps are drawn fairly and transparently.The research proves it works. Studies from Duke Universityand other nonpartisan institutions show that independent redistricting will create maps that better reflect the actual political makeup of North Carolina. This isnt about giving one party an advantage. Its about fairness. Its about restoring trust in our democracy.When gerrymandering silences voters, the consequences are devastating. Look no further than this years election. A gerrymandered North Carolina map didnt just strip fair representation from our states voters  it changed the course of history by giving control of the U.S. House of Representatives to Republicans instead of Democrats.We cant let this happen again.While I wont be going back to Congress because of extreme, partisan gerrymandering, Im not giving up or going out quietly in the fight for fair voting maps. The people of North Carolina and across the country deserve better. They deserve fair maps, a fair system, and a democracy they can trust. Its time to end gerrymandering once and for all.Wiley Nickel represents North Carolinas 13th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.","title":"NC congressman: Republicans stole fairness from the nation in giving GOP a House majority. - Rep.

Calling anything that is arguably an issue \\"abuse\\" isn't going to raise the level of horror to actual abuse, its just going to lower the value that the word \\"abuse\\" has.Trying to weasel out of being called out for abusive behavior by making a contest of who has it worse is pathetic, and your logic doesn't even hold considering messing with a child's genitals is high up there as the most horrific type of abuse.It's like comparing being stabbed with a steak knife to being pricked with a pin. Sure, both cause harm, but they're so functionally different in scale that its kind of ridiculous to compare, and actively harmful to treat with the same level of concern when triaging.Your entire argument is a defense of MGM, from using the worse cases and types of FGM as the normal while pretending MGM has no downsides, making a zero-sum game out of it, while at the same time arguing that fucking with a newborn's genitals isn't the kind of abuse only the most depraved or the most disgustingly ignorant practice.","title":"CMV: Medically unnecessary circumcision is unjustifiable child abuse"},{"text":"Male chests are also sexualised in pornography, is my point.

Like....everything you said here has been debunked: # 1Intact men can simply pull the foreskin down and it will look exactly like a circumcised penis (minus the scars, discolorations, missing veins, missing nerve-endings and keratinized glans). If he has phimosis, he can deal with it with safer and less intensive options like stretching. Only the most severe cases of phimosis actually need circumcision.Plus, cosmetic surgery is supposed to make things look better. But circumcision does not make anything look better. An intact penis with retracted foreskin looks like a circumcised penis (minus the scars, discolorations, missing veins, missing nerve-endings and keratinized glans). About the children:It is cruel, vain, and disgusting to use circumcision as a cosmetic surgery on your small children. Attempting to 'beautify' your children's genitals by forcing cosmetic surgery, either non-reversible or reversible, on your small children is immoral and severely abusive.If it is illegal to give your newborn daughters cosmetic surgeries, then it should be illegal to give your newborn sons cosmetic surgeries. If you have read my post, then you would have known the similarities between the clitoral hood and foreskin. Circumcision is likely to leave scars, and discolorations. The risks of botched circumcisions exist. Either low or not, it exists. In severe cases, the child might lose his penises, get left with deformed penis and scars. You think uncircumcised penises are uglY simply because either you yourself don't have a complete penis, or simply grow up in a country where having an incomplete penis is the norm. # 2I debunk that myth in my post already **Circumcision is proven not to prevent STDs**?**nor penile cancer.**?**It is harmful to spread this 'circumcision prevents HIV' myth.**?It is possible that many circumcised men out there believe this myth and have unprotected sex because they think they are immune to STDs. Condoms are cheap and effective.**So the 'it prevents diseases' reason falls flat**. Also, it is unethical and harmful to surgically remove a healthy functional part of an unconsenting healthy human's genital because you want to prevent them from cancer and diseases.* ?[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00809-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00809-6)Conclusions: In this national cohort study spanning more than three decades of observation,?**non-therapeutic circumcision in infancy or childhood did not appear to provide protection against HIV or other STIs in males up to the age of 36 years. Rather, non-therapeutic circumcision was associated with higher STI rates overall, particularly for anogenital warts and syphilis**.\\"* ?[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36286328/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36286328/)Conclusions: Results matched earlier observations made in South Africa that?**circumcised and intact men had similar levels of HIV infection**. The study questions the current strategy of large scale VMMC campaigns to control the HIV epidemic. These campaigns also raise a number of ethical issues.# 3. Your logic is very similar to people who put sedatives into others' drinks! Just because someone can't remember something, that does not mean it is more acceptable to do harm to their bodies without their consent. The scars, the discolorations, the missing veins, missing nerve endings,... they are still there....for the rest of your life. It leaves physically scars. It has a life long consequences.

Increased pain sensitivity, decreased immune system functioning, increased avoidance behavior, and social hyper-vigilance are all possible outcomes of untreated pain in early infancy. Although an individual may not preserve a conscious memory of an early painful event, it is recorded elsewhere in the body, as evidenced by the previously presented long-term outcomes.

It was a defeat for the Axis of Resistance, but there's little to suggest that it will cut Hezbollah off from smuggled munitions.None of the \\"pundits\\" I listen to suggest this is an Israeli victory in the long term.  Short term, yes, Netanyahu is able to cling to another couple of weeks of power.

Doesn't mean the Black Flags won't continue supplying Hezbollah, but will it be enough to continue the fight directly against Israel.  None of this suggests \\"Ritter is Wrong\\" or that \\"Krainer is right\\".

It's also worth noting that women who underwent it overwhelmingly rally against FGM, while circumcised men overwhelmingly don't care.Similarly, even calling it \\"child abuse\\" is kind of demeaning to children who are actually abused.

Hes feeling it again. Its a month or so after the 7 October atrocities &amp; invasion of Gaza. Every day feels like a new chapter in a global horror show.Its a plot twist I hadnt seen coming, but the whole film is a plot twist: an urgently prescient and genre-defying sci-fi film set in New San Francisco in 2073. Its a hugely creative blend of drama and documentary that unpicks the reasons behind a civilisational catastrophe.Its called The Event in the film and we never find out what it was C nuclear war? climate collapse? C but Kapadia follows a thread that weaves together populist politicians, demagogues and tech billionaires to show how close to this disaster we already are.The twist is that this isnt the future. Much of the footage is archive taken from the present day: women and children on the Hong Kong subway being beaten by armed officers, drone shots of street after destroyed street in Gaza, biblical floods sweeping away blocks of flats.And in between these dramatic scenes with Morton, isolated and alone, able to trust no one, are documentary sequences that Kapadia calls time capsules. Its the time capsules that transport us squarely back into the present. Kapadia interviews dozens of journalists, activists &amp; technologists that he interlaces with clips that take us from the populist politics of Farage, Trump &amp; Modi to the Silicon Valley bro-sphere C Musk, Thiel, Zuckerberg.How did we get here? How did we let that happen? asks Ghost as we see her walking through New San Franciscos streets, the sky a deathly orange, real footage from the fires of two years ago.  \\nIts a dazzlingly creative work.

The site, managed by the National Trust, welcomes more and more seals during each winter breeding season. Matt Wilson, the trust's countryside manager for the Suffolk and Essex coast, said he hoped the site would rival other UK seal colonies. The breeding season at Orford Ness is under way with many more pups expected to arrive over the coming weeks This winter's breeding season, which began in November, has seen 80 pups already born with many more expected. Since 2021, when the seals first arrived, their numbers have been steadily increasing. The site is now home to about 400 seals, up from about 200 three years ago. \\"We're really lucky,\\" said Mr Wilson. \\"It's part of their natural movement of colonies anyway, so they've moved down, we think, from Lincolnshire and Norfolk colonies. \\"They've formed a breakaway group, found this site and moved into the space we've got here. \\"It's a real privilege to have them on this site and a responsibility, too, for the team here.\\" The shingle spit is currently home to 400 adult grey seals with this number potentially increasing in years to come Orford Ness is a 10-mile long (16km) vegetated shingle spit, joined to the mainland just south of Aldeburgh. During the 20th Century it was a military testing site. The public are able to visit during the summer but not allowed to get close to the colony. Mr Wilson said he believed this was a \\"major factor\\" in the colony's success. \\"Even during our open season for visitors, the public aren't allowed on to this section because the seals are still here through the summer,\\" he said. \\"It's a great factor for them, this lack of human disturbance, for what is a really amazing occurrence on this site.\\" Mr Wilson said the spit's ridges and dips also added a \\"natural shelter barrier\\" against bad winter weather. Matt Wilson believes Orford Ness has a range of benefits for the grey seal colony He said the success of the colony was a good indicator of the health of both the species and the marine environment, because the seals would not be there unless there was a good food source for them in the North Sea. \\"We're certainly hoping it will become one of the hotspots for grey seals around the UK coast,\\" he said. \\"It is such an enormous potential; it is a great environment for them.\\"!ping ECO&amp;UK","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"They do say that the devil is the prince of the power of the air ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Yeah but even the Earth is mostly ocean, desert, frozen waste, and another chunk is France.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Other than in the USA I think this is the standard position in more western countries. \\nIt is child genital mutilation.","title":"CMV: Medically unnecessary circumcision is unjustifiable child abuse"},{"text":"Honestly don't think I'll change your mind.

Comparing male and female breasts is not an adequate comparison, because male chest has never been sexualised or perceived in any way similar to female breasts. A more adequate comparison would be comparing balls to breasts. Because they fulfil a reproductive function (creating / sustaining a child) and thus both are deemed NSFW. 2. Out of all reproductive (or accessory reproductive organs, if we want to go into semantics), female breasts are already the most exposed in media. Just compare how many boobies vs. dicks you saw in Game of Thrones! I would argue that to level out the equality, there should instead be far more dicks being shown. One pair of balls for every pair of titties! 3. Female genital area is far less obvious or visual when compared to male genital area. Due to this, breasts serve a major function in intimacy - being privy to something usually covered. Again, just like a set of balls and penis for men. Exposing breasts will create more inequality, as the most looked at sexual organ will be visible for women, but not for men. 4. Lastly, I think its also super important to note that exposed body parts are generally perceived as more open to touching (and are physically accessible to touch!). Women already suffer from extreme levels of unwanted touching. Exposing a sensitive and vulnerable part of their bodies to possible harassment does not seem appropriate to me. \\nHope this gave some food for thoughts!

I've concluded that criminal justice reform (in favour of evidence based policies and away from personal retribution) is a failing goalpost that is better off abandoned by the left \\nI'm currently studying criminal justice philosophy and one thing I've learned is that many of the policies that have wide support among the population such as punitive measures have very mixed or limited evidence when it comes to effectiveness at deterrence. But the problem is that evidence often isn't enough to convince people because 1) people attach more importance to what's at stake rather than risk of losing what's at stake , for example even if someone or some group of criminals are low risk to not warrant severe deterrence from a risk perspective that still doesn't matter in certain crimes because for example one person murdered or sexually assaulted would still be one too many, not to mention  people generally distrust academia and instead of judging evidence on its merits. People often judge based on things like if the researchers have a political affiliation counter to them or not. Not to mention that it's much easier to market harsh penalties because people care more about retribution than rehabilitation and see it as a waste of resources or a further burden on taxpayers. I also feel like this is an issue which will cause even more significant divide among the whole academia vs people narrative With these facts in mind , is it still possible to market policies that aren't black and white and focused on retaliation only ?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Same with the acid rain scare.
