As far as Kamala helping middle class and lower class no offense I don't know what class you are but as someone who is in that class the last 4 years been TERRIBLE. All the stats that biden administration uses are BS. Right now its so hard to find a good paying job. I will be voting for trump this time. My main reason is I am not happy with last 4 years. Everything become more expensive. Not only that the packages of things have become smaller too. Its hard to find jobs, I have family who are in tech and they been looking for jobs in CA for 1 year now and cannot find anything decent. I myself am in Healthcare field and the jobs I am finding are paying 18 dollars per hour which is a joke!I don't know if Trump can fix all of this but all I know is we went from having friendly relationship with North Korea to now having 2 wars that we are supporting. Also no offense but Kamala 100% isn't fit to be a president. I never like her as a Vice president much less a president. Hell I didn't like her in CA as attroyney general. The people who live in CA can you tell you all the illegal and BS things she did. 0% chance anyone should be voting for her. Sadly the other opinion is Trump. So now its back to 2016. Which person do you think can do 4 years without trashing the country. I pick trump since his last 4 years wasn't bad and also this will be his 2nd term. Anyhow I can go on and on about Kamala but we are wasting time.

As a kid, I had a friend who was from the Blackfoot nation,and she mentioned day schools where children were sent to learn English. I am a child of immigrants, born in Canada, spoke English at home but was put into ESL (English as a Second Language) class, so I as an kid assumed it was something similar, even though it confused me since Indigenous people were born in Canada, and are the ORIGINAL Canadians and Americans.I attended an Elder's conference in 1999. I remember when residential or day schools were being discussed, there was a shift in the mood. The negative feelings were never discussed or explained. I am not Indigenous so I thought it was just about forcing religion and conversion. I did not know about the abuse or murders. In 2020, I took a course and one of the units talked about colonization and how it happened in Canada.

This is what happens every time you create an \\"us\\" vs. \\"them\\" that has two distinct set of values. The unfortunate truth is that the group that historically has been wronged won't ever have a retribution. Equality can feel like a loss for both parties. We have seen it in the States in the last 30 years. Racial relations are perceived as worse than in a long, long time, (since the 90s) despite the massive efforts to reach racial equality. The oppressor/oppressed model, while amenable for so many reasons, and historically correct in several ways, simply doesn't work if your object is to reach equality and harmony. It fails to achieve that goal. Nobody wants to talk with people that have different values than you. You need a blanket of shared values in order to be able to disagree. Otherwise you can only wage war and conquer and destroy. Both men and women need to have shared values. The men and women group has to fall under the same \\"people\\" group. Nobody would say \\"I don't talk with brunettes because they are xyz and they are the reason for why us blondes are seen as stupid\\". It's a cosmetic difference that carries no functional value. Even cosmetic differences that does carry a functional value, like height, or curly vs bald hair, don't have this kind of value difference. And if you go in the curly hair subreddit you will see people complain about other people giving them grief for their \\"unprofessional\\" hair, but it is different in the perception. Again, arguing that the wrongdoings that women had to endure by men are worse than what people with curly hair go through, while true, is just unhelpful. It is not the way to deal with this. It only creates divide and group mentality instead of focusing on the rights of individuals. I genuinely think \\"colorblindness\\", but with all groups, is the way to go. Again, looking at the states. The groups that integrate are groups that maintain their individuality (for example, Irish, Catholics, Italians) but are not seen anymore as the \\"outgroup.\\" Trust needs to be higher, which includes trust in the individual. If you are a woman too (and you sounds like you are lol), then you are probably wary of men as a group. That seems okay to me, but I think the problems incur when you start to be wary of every singular individual man you encounter. That poison your interactions, and believe it or not, men can pick that up, in the same way in which I am sure you can pick up when a man talks down to you because you are a woman. There are singular men who don't talk down to women. Treating men as a group hurts them and risks radicalizing them. A common argument I hear is \\"fuck them, they should all behave well\\" and yeah, this is true, but this is just unhelpful. Again, I am assuming you are a woman, which is why this comment is focused on what women can do. But the same applies to men. The problem start when one group believes the other group is at fault completely, so they have to do nothing but sit down and wait (and complain). It doesn't work for romantic relationships. I don't know why it should work for the relationship of massive groups of people. Also, I have found that the number of good men in my western country has been increasing consistently in the past 15-20 years, and now it seems like there is something going wrong. We can't just sit back and blame it all on men because men were getting better.

I didn't know it had happened in Canada as well though! That's crazy! Apparently they tested the lungs of everyone who was sick or died &amp; found the toxic byproducts they were looking for. Although this is coming from the CDC who I'll admit, I don't trust very much myself. *\\"The CDC announced that vitamin E acetate has been detected as a potential chemical of concern.

One of the biggest misunderstandings people who haven't done a lot of comparative religion studies have about religions is that religious traditions somehow have some 'foundational principles' that come from some founder or text. Admittedly, many religious practitioners have themselves pushed this myth. In particular, those who've been exposed to fundamentalist movements in either Christianity or Islam are often under the misapprehension that religious beliefs come from sacred texts, and if the text says X it kind of 'infects' the faith community. But if you look at how religious traditions actually operate, that's not what you see. Religious communities develop their beliefs and practices out of a complex web of social interactions over long periods of time. For religions with a scripture, the relationship between scripture and practice is complex and bidirectional - scriptural tradition informs practice, but even more than that, practice informs how scriptural tradition is interpreted. Modern mainline and evangelical protestantism both display this vividly. Both traditions, in principle, share scriptures. But their moral doctrines are almost entirely opposed. This is because both traditions have developed a set of beliefs that align with their particular identity politics and power structures, and have chosen to center or decenter parts of their scripture to conform to those beliefs. For an American Evangelical a gender hierarchy and loyalty to ones ethno-racial group and decentering of social care come first, and the Bible is read through that lens - the parts of it that don't conform are reinterpreted or ignored. For a mainline protestant, egalitarianism comes first, and the Bible is read through that lens, the parts that don't conform are reinterpreted and ingnored. Islam is no different. The spectrum of Islamic belief is vast, and different communities relationships to their scriptures are very fluid. The result is that simply identifying which broad religious tradition someone belongs to tells you almost nothing about their actual beliefs and practices. To figure those out, you need to look at at minimum the more particular religious community they belong to, and sometimes even what they, individually believe and do.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"Treasonous Trump is a threat to democracy, bill of rights, constitution and everyones freedoms","title":"Harris paints Trump as threat to democracy as Election Day draws closer"},{"text":"As an American, this hits hard.

Heres how the situation would be addressed under current laws and the U.S. Constitution:The Role of the Vice PresidentThe Vice Presidents role in certifying the election results is largely ceremonial, as specified in the 12th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Electoral Count Act of 1887. The Vice President presides over a joint session of Congress where the electoral votes are officially counted and certified. While the Vice President oversees the process, they do not have the authority to unilaterally reject or alter the results.Electoral Count Act of 1887The Electoral Count Act provides the framework for counting electoral votes and addressing objections:During the joint session, members of Congress may raise objections to individual states electoral votes. To be considered, an objection must be submitted in writing and signed by at least one member of the House and one member of the Senate.\\nIf an objection is raised, the House and Senate separately debate the objection for a maximum of two hours and then vote on whether to uphold it. Both chambers must agree to reject the electoral votes in question for the objection to be sustained.\\nWhat if the Vice President Refuses to Act?If the Vice President refuses to perform the ceremonial role of presiding over the certification, there are mechanisms to continue the process:Presiding Officer Replacement: Congress could appoint another official to preside over the certification session. For example, the President pro tempore of the Senate or the Speaker of the House could step in to fulfill the role.\\nCourt Intervention: If there is a refusal to certify, lawsuits could be filed to compel the Vice President to perform their duties, and the courts could order compliance.\\nCongressional Action: Congress itself holds the power to proceed with the count and certification of the electoral votes even if the Vice President does not preside over the process.\\nThe Constitution and Legal PrecedentThe Constitution does not grant the Vice President discretionary power over the certification of electoral votes, meaning that refusing to certify would likely be challenged in court and overruled. Historical and legal precedents reinforce that the Vice Presidents role is to facilitate, not to determine, the outcome of the election.In conclusion, if Vice President Harris were to refuse to certify the results, legal and procedural measures exist to ensure that the election results are certified according to the law. Congress would likely proceed with counting and certifying the electoral votes regardless of the Vice Presidents actions.The biggest concern that I have is if the house or senate makes a motion to disqualify electoral votes from a state. Both chambers of congress need to agree, which they wont. This could lead to a significant delay in the certification process. The good news is that Kamalalalalalalalas role in certifying the election results is ceremonial at best. Speaker Johnson had better step up and volunteer to certify because I know chucky will be chomping at the bit to do that same. That said, at the end of the day, its congresses job and they alone have the authority to certify the election results. The bad news is that each chamber sees the other as the guy with the huge horse cock that fucked their wife.","title":"Democrats are going to steal this election ."},{"text":"more immigrants = more girls under the age of 25 for him","title":"Leonardo DiCaprio endorses Kamala Harris for president"},{"text":"Traitor is explicitly known with this.

While $3.8 million had been transferred to the state parties, 88 percent of it was transferred back to the national committee, usually within 1C2 days, by the Clinton staff member who led the Fund.

The wider explanation that quotes finds itself in is that people are upset because \\"they see themselves as being derided and mocked for their current pratices or, worse, coerced and bullied into followed the new norm.\\". The quote you gave is an extensive of this, arguing that from the above assumptive it would be \\"natural\\" to view \\"wokeness\\" in such a way.This, notably, is not an argument that \\"wokeness\\" decires authoritarian or fascist leanings. Rather, it is an explanation given for those that feel \\"upset\\" and from the assumptions made by some of those are \\"natural\\".  In other words, for those that feel mocked or coerced by moral progress, it is natural to view such mocking and coerceion as having \\"authoritarian and fascist impuslses.\\"What this doesn't say is whether the initial feeling of mocking and coerceion is itself sound, and therefore whether the following assumption is also sound. All it is saying is, to those that \\"see themselves\\" as being mocked and coerced, it is natural to have the following reaction. For a moment, forget we are talking about moral progress and pretend we are talking about abortion rights. Removing abortion rights from women could be viewed as being coerceive towards woman, and this coercive action could be characterised as labouring authoritarian impulses. I would imagine this is something many on this sub would agree with. The argument in that part of the article is identical as it is only reliant on the validity of the thought process, not it's soundness. In philosophy, validity means that an the premises of an argument logically guarantee the conclusion presuming they are true. In this case, the article is only concerned with arguing that, presuming those people are being mocked and coerced, it's natural to feel like those coercing them habour authoritarian and fascist impulses. It is not concerned with investigating whether the feeling of being mocked and coerced is sound in the first place.TLDR: the article does not argue wokeness harbours \\"authoritarian and fascist impulses\\", a part of the article offers an explanation that believing such is part of the behaviour of some that are upset and annoyed by moral progress.

It is easy to discredit someone by calling them a Nazi and associating their ideas and opinions with the scum of the Earth. Most folks arent able to truly distinguish the real characteristics of fascism because the waters have been so muddied. This topic and its complexities are something Ive taken notice of and have chosen to educate myself so as not to engage in inflammatory rhetoric.I will attempt outline below the contributing factors that make up the fascist movement with how best to understand and spot fascism in todays tumultuous and often weird political landscape.Ive found that author Umberto Eco most enlightening in this endeavor because of his direct experience with Mussolinis fascist regime growing up. He wrote about his experience in his 1995 essay: Inventing the Enemy.The 14 points of Fascism:\\nPowerful and Continuing NationalismFascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.Disdain for the Recognition of Human RightsBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of need. The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying CauseThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, illegal immigrants etc.Supremacy of the MilitaryEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.Rampant SexismThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.Controlled Mass MediaSometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.Obsession with National SecurityFear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. Immigration and border security are common talking points when enforcing this fear.Religion and Government are IntertwinedGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the governments policies or actions.Corporate Power is ProtectedThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.Labor Power is SuppressedBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.Disdain for Intellectuals and the ArtsFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.Obsession with Crime and PunishmentUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.Rampant Cronyism and CorruptionFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.Fraudulent ElectionsSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\\nMaga comfortably embodies 12 of these 14 characteristics.","title":"Harris paints Trump as threat to democracy as Election Day draws closer"},{"text":"Reading isn't their strong suit","title":"The Nation Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"God damn hes even older than we thought!","title":"Biden visits Indian Country and apologizes for the sin of a 150-year boarding school policy"},{"text":"Democracies fail because people are stupid.

I find it more frightening than infuriating that two billionaire owners of major national newspapers are seemingly worried what Trump (or more accurately, those around him) will do if given the power the Oval Office again. They have seen how tight the polls are and are *this* worried that he possibly win. Personally, I think the polls are off. I think after 2016 and 2020 when they vastly underestimated Chump's support (because those people won't do polls), they have now gone too far the other direction.

Thanks for posting. I think one of the drivers between how men and women think differently about sexual assault is how one predicts the issue will affect them. Women obviously want better protections and recourse because when they look at the issue, they only see themselves as potential victims and not as perpetrators, which is generally a fair assumption (though not absolute) based on statistics and personal experiences of friends, family and themselves. Alternatively, when men look at the issue, they do not think they themselves might be a victim of sexual assault, nor do they (typically) view themselves as a perpetrator (even if some may be). Therefore, the only way they predict this issue will affect them is if they're falsely accused, no matter how unlikely that is. This means they'll be averse to any changes that increase the harm to the falsely accused. While certainly selfish, this is a rational view for an individual to hold. I think you raise a good point about the importance of discussion and close friendship between men and women. Personally, the strong friendships I have with women in my life certainly helped form my views around sexual assault and domestic violence. Their stories and experiences helped me understand that whatever additional harm I might endure in the unlikely event I was falsely accused was completely dwarfed by the existing unseen harm to all these women in my life who have not received any justice or live in constant fear.Having said that, I'm not saying women should feel a moral responsibility to fix men and share things they're uncomfortable sharing. The women in my life who have shared or even hinted at their experiences are generally very good friends.Anyway.

Yes, they sucked. Everybody knows it. But do you even know what Christian sect is their modern day descendants?  Probably not. The faith of Plymouth did not endure. The bigger influence is the Calvinism of the Robber Barrons: the Gospel of Wealth. They insisted that they were better than the rest of us because they were Gods Elect. There is a lot of money still supporting this blasphemy (for all wealth is the product of theft, not the result of any deitys blessing).  The Gospel of Wealth has justified, sanctified, and enshrined capitalism as a divine order. But also look at the history of the Southern Baptist Convention. They went into schism over slavery and have yet to repent. The institution is essentially the Klan at prayer (though the founder of the OG Klan was a Southern Methodist, a body that no longer exists). Also look into why the Evangelicals became pro-life. It has a lot to do with the fact that most Evangelical churches were founded as a means to create segregation academies. Religion in America is not all religion, and Dennett has some reductionist takes on religion with which I disagree.

However, if you've ever talked to any group of people in the field, the bias pretty much rears its ugly head on the spot. It's unavoidable. It's almost impossible not to see it everywhere, and as someone with a background in neurosciences, even as a liberal with progressive leanings myself, I've always been very suspicious of the extreme amount of rejection of non-progressive psychological exploration in the field among practitioners. They are not even willing to entertain ideas that do not lead to non-progressive conclusions in most of cases. This is hardly surprising if you ever talk to a group of undergrads getting a degree in this field.Neuroscience has this problem as well, although to a lesser degree. A lot of cognitive neuroscientific conclusions based purely on evidence do NOT sit well with established progressive ideologies. A very core idea within progressive ideology is that nurture is a lot more important than nature; that people can change, can be rehabilitated, can be taught to be better, can be given better education or better environments to build within or towards, that the carrot and the stick matter more than the clay we are molded in, etc. If you even hint at the idea of questioning that orthodoxy, you will be looked at suspiciously, despite the mountains of evidence that suggest that humans are probably even MORE driven by nature than nurture. It's not even a little bit, it's VAST evidence to suggest that a lot of us simply are or are not going to be some kind of way the day we are conceived, but its so fucking disempowering and ideologically frustrating that there is vast rejection of that simple truth in related fields like psychology, evidence be damned. And this is just one example, many similar examples exist across where many other fields intersect with psychology and sociology.I suppose I've seen it first hand so I have an anecdotal perspective, but it certainly prevents me from being surprised by any of this.","title":"2024 Study Reports Most Psychology Professors Censor Their Findings In Fear Of Backlash From The Public - Progressives Should Worry More About Their Favorite Scientific Findings."},{"text":"All that matters is that Trump and his regime never get into power ever again","title":"Biden insists he would have beaten \\"loser\\" Trump"},{"text":"In that industry?

He wasn't getting enough sleep, which at his age was really affecting his performance and memory when he needed them. He was making big gaffes nearly every week, and people who are trying to smooth over his debate as not being that bad need to watch it again. He may have eventually got his sentences out but his stuttering and stammering have never been THIS bad in the past. Watching him going \\"um um um I'm sorry...\\" for the entire hour as he was trying to remember what he was supposed to say was painful to watch. On a visual level he was projecting a high amount of weakness and frailty as a person. For all of Harris' problems (and she does have a few), there's never been a point where she's really looked weak or vulnerable as a person. Voters need to have assurance that their President is strong enough as a person to represent them. To me that's the biggest box that Harris checks in 2024 that Biden doesn't.And it would have happened again and again had he continued. Being a president is hard enough as it is without having to campaign on top of it. It's not for an 81 year old. I'm fairly confident in saying there's no way he would have recovered his campaign, because the odds of him not screwing up again and again were low.It's frankly a miracle this is competitive as it is with Harris now dragging the numbers back into a virtual toss up.

They still continue to underestimate the continued resurgence in anti-immigration sentiments, they continue to make perfect the enemy of good, and seem on track to lose another election that would otherwise be a slam dunk because they just won't solely focus on the top issues.Had COVID not happened, it's very likely Trump would've won re-election as an incumbent in 2020 given the economy and stock market he inherited from Obama, despite all his scandals and crimes. Had COVID happened a year later in Trump's second term, and inflation hit, then you'd be looking at a massive shift back to Democrats much like you saw with 8 years of Bush into Obama.The latest polls putting Harris tied or behind by 1 in *national* polls are horrific, and I think show that, in the end, the undecided have gone back to the Republican party, in large part due to inflation and immigration.Harris might have more of an advantage if on day 1 of the Biden administration they had curtailed immigration, but they waited until election year, and waited for the bipartisan bill from congress which became torpedoed by Trump, so sadly, many voters just aren't convinced because they're easily deceived.So of the 3 big issues facing Americans, Inflation, Immigration, and Abortion, Trump leads *massively* on two, and Harris on one.","title":"Biden insists he would have beaten \\"loser\\" Trump"},{"text":"Not taking a Trump victory sitting down, even if legit win.","title":"Democracy Dies In Cowardice - Jeff Bezos Kills Washington Post Endorsement days after LA Times Refuses to Endorse"},{"text":"https://www.factcheck.org/2024/08/posts-mislead-about-harris-romance-with-willie-brown/This fact check confirms the sexual relationship.

Now, in a sane and logical society, that simple fact would keep him out of the running in this, or any other election. But alas, we don't live in a sane and logical country where the entire legal voting population votes, and the concept of one person, one vote, is more closely adhered to. Instead, we live in one that has the Electoral College, a system that was outdated almost the minute the ink dried in 1787. This garbage system has been debated into oblivion, but still has denied the will of the people more than a few times. The most we can hope for is an energized base that is willing to drag, kicking and screaming, the apathetic masses to the polls where their consciences will hopefully kick in. If I prayed, which I don't, this election would have been on my knees faster than... I won't finish the joke in the hopes of constructive comments. If you can and have not, please try to take someone you don't think will make it to the polls, given their own devices, and together go vote. The will of the people matters; it's the only thing that matters. Even with our screwed-up system, enough people voting can override those mechanisms. It's tired at this point and massively overplayed, but our very freedom is at stake with this election. He envies dictators and praised one of, if not the worst person in history. He has displayed that he loathes the common person and is incapable of empathizing with anyone, including his family. His plans and ideas are stupid, impractical, fiscally insane, and worst of all, most of them are based in good ol' fashioned bigotry and hate. He is the reason that the pandemic numbers were as high as they were. I blame him for the worst of the pandemic; his inaction and mind-blowing incompetence drove us further into the pit, one that many of the citizens of this country are still fighting to climb out of. His lies infect our society with hate, confusion, and division. We will make it through this, but we all have to do our part and to be honest, we may need to do a little more than our part. Because of the MAGAnitude of these racist, sexist, classist, and debaucherous, democratic-subverting ideas and policies, our children, partners, siblings, parents, cousins, and other loved ones are all at stake in this election. Almost everyone has cared, does care, or will care about someone that is a woman, a person of color, an immigrant, a member of the LGBT+ community, all of which these toxic dumpster fire of ideas would be horendeous for. For those of you who have made it this far, that last part was as tedious and inclusive as possible to show just how many groups this election will demonstrably impact. The choices we make now will affect everyone. I voted yesterday, less someone think I'm a hypocrite, and I really hope whoever is kind enough to read this takes a minute and think about my words.

There has been a concerted effort to divide our country into two \\"teams\\" so that the populace is distracted by the other side, and not what is really going on.  I believe we have had several Manchurian candidates in the last 20 years, probably starting with Obama.  The globalists are wanting the downfall of america so we become more dependent and desperate over time. Historically speaking, I have not been a conspiracy theorist, but I am starting to change in that regard.   I have NEVER seen campaigning this bad, but it is worse this time, and every cycle is worse than the last.  I honestly feel that although Trump is flawed in some ways (bombastic at times), I have seen his dedication over the decades to this country.  The reason he stepped in was not to gain power, but to  honestly be the lone ranger in a dire situation that he could clearly see happening.  He donated his salary as president to charities.  He lost net worth as a result of being president (unlike most politicians).  He has been attacked physically, legally, and literally every way possible, and yet, he persists.  I hope and pray he wins, but I am unsure of his ability to be as successful as he wants to be because the media is SO corrupt, and he has many enemies that will do everything to thwart his efforts.  It is a VERY sad time in America, and I pray he wins.  It IS this bad, you are correct. None of us want it to be like this. Now don't get me started on Kamala.

It didnt stop some from trying though and some disappeared just trying to get back to their families.Imagine some poor native kid scared out of his wits and being brought to one of these schools where they took everything:  your belongings, your clothes, your *hair* (they would hold down scores of kids and hack off their long hair to make them presentable) then told they couldnt speak their language, couldnt worship their deities, and literally being told everything they may have held dear is wrong.Yea they got to learn trades and got education and inevitably after decades the schools themselves became their own bastions of Native American art and independence once they started relaxing the hard lines they started with.  But god damn, those poor kids at the beginning.

Because that's what it's come to - agree Trump is an evil dictator or be punished. Alternatively, I submit to you a counterargument to contest your points.The examples you gave rely heavily on substantial evidence that just isn't there. It's more regarded as hearsay, slander, and allegations, because anyone can say anything, and this is a nation where you need definitive evidence to reprimand, punish, or apply consequences to someone.* The 34 counts of falsifying business records were delivered in a court that used an openly biased judge, telling the jury that they could only vote one of two ways, where a relative of said judge was found gloating online that the sentencing was done before the jury even finished deliberating. This, along with convicting him 34 times for the exact same thing, where no illegal action was taken given \\"hush money\\" isn't illegal, leaves the entire trial easy to appeal.\\n* Many big names had connections to Epstein across the business and political world. He was a big player. Trump held him in high regard as a friend and partied with him. Said he was a good salesman. However, in 2004, they clashed over a property and had a falling out. He never went to his island and ultimately distanced himself from Epstein, later saying he'd have no problem releasing the Epstein files. There's no evidence of wrongdoing on his part, or on the part of many who associated with Epstein. Those that actually went to the island are another story, yet still for some reason remain unquestioned.\\n* Many don't call January 6 an insurrection, for multiple reasons. How on earth could a crowd of unarmed idiots storm the capitol without any resistance? Is our government and security that pathetic? For Trump's personal involvement in the event, he called for a peaceful protest via social media, non-violence. He offered Nancy Pelosi extra protection, which she declined and openly stated doing so. When things got out of hand, he told them to go home. The video footage that was kept in secret and eventually exposed thanks to a media reporter that was immediately fired for doing so, the people who \\"stormed the capitol\\" simply walked in, walking around in a line with flagpoles and such, as if on a tour. They didn't destroy anything. Even if you take it to its worse and say it was mishandled by Trump, in the same sense of how Biden mishandled pulling out of Afghanistan, you can't argue malicious intent, or that his claim was to storm the capitol with viva insurrection - it makes no sense. It doesn't help his cause and would amount to nothing. Even if you did claim that, how would you prove it?\\n* Again, scandals need to be evidence-based if you want to convict anyone. Scandals are a dime a dozen with anyone in the spotlight; this is hardly exclusive to Trump. Honestly, if you're going to come down on him for the allegations against him, should you not apply the same pressure to, say, Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation?But you did ask for consequences. So, here's a few:  \\n\\\\- Extreme media and big tech bias.  \\n\\\\- Silenced and deleted on social media.  \\n\\\\- Arrested with mug shot.  \\n\\\\- Threatened imprisonment.  \\n\\\\- Two assassination attempts, one of which was an extremely close call.All of these are consequences provided by liberal disagreement and attack, and each one gained him massive popularity and support because they're just that outrageous given the context. With this, the more you try take him down with such petty tactics, the more he will gain power and influence. It's not Trump beating liberals, it's liberals beating themselves.For your edit, punishment is exacted upon the nature of the offense. If the offense isn't \\"that bad\\", it will, in fact, affect the punishment. This is apparently objective, so the very essence of your CMV is laced with objectivity from the start.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is literally immune to consequences"},{"text":"\\nTrump could start wearing a Nazi pin on his lapel and none of his supporters would blink and I in fact theyd go out and buy some for themselves or better yet Trump would start selling them on his website.

Thats why Im voting for Kamala Harris.Glad to see climate change being the reason, and its tie to economy. I think climate change is a major contributor to the inflation. For example, the inflation report found that housing cost contributed highly to this year's inflation. One of the major causes of higher housing cost is higher home owner insurance premiums. Insurers suffered significant losses due to massive payouts caused by climate change worsened disasters, so they have been hiking the premiums by a lot. Regular food price increases can also be attributed to climate change induced losses. Electing trump will worsen inflation precisely because he disregards climate change science and he will doom our fighting climate to mitigate the crisis.","title":"Leonardo DiCaprio endorses Kamala Harris for president"},{"text":"List of newspapers and media endorsing Trump/Vance as of October 24:- Maxim\\n- Washington Examiner\\n- Las Vegas Review\\n- Laurel Leader-Call\\n- New York Post\\n- Ouachita Citizen\\n- Republican-American\\n- Rhino Times\\n- St. Joseph News-Press\\n- The Jewish Press\\n- The Jewish Voice\\n- The Washington Times\\n- KHTS\\n- Human Events (website)\\n- Law Enforcement Today (website)\\n- New Boston Post (website)Newspapers and media endorsing Harris/Walz as of October 24:- Addison County Independent\\n- The Advocate\\n- The Atlantic\\n- Bay Area Reporter\\n- Bay Windows\\n- The Berkshire Eagle\\n- The Boston Globe\\n- Boston Irish\\n- The Capital Times\\n- The Charlotte Post\\n- Daily Herald\\n- Daily Kos\\n- The Denver Post\\n- The Dominion Post\\n- The Everett Herald\\n- Falls Church News-Press\\n- The Guardian\\n- Honolulu Star-Advertiser\\n- Houston Chronicle\\n- Irish Independent\\n- Kazoo\\n- Las Vegas Sun\\n- Las Vegas Weekly\\n- Le Monde\\n- Los Angeles Sentinel\\n- The Nation\\n- The New York Times\\n- The New Yorker\\n- OB Rag\\n- The Oregonian\\n- Palmer Report\\n- The Plain Dealer\\n- The Republican\\n- Rolling Stone\\n- San Francisco Bay Guardian\\n- Santa Barbara Independent\\n- San Antonio Express-News\\n- Savannah Tribune\\n- Scientific American\\n- Seattle Gay News\\n- The Seattle Times\\n- The Shepherd Express\\n- The Source\\n- The Star-Ledger\\n- Storm Lake Times\\n- The Sun Chronicle\\n- Tennessee Tribune\\n- Times of Malta\\n- Vogue\\n- Winston-Salem Chronicle\\n- Wisconsin State Journal\\n- Word in Black\\n- The Atlanta Voice\\n- Baltimore Afro-American\\n- The Dallas Weekly\\n- Houston Defender\\n- Michigan Chronicle\\n- New York Amsterdam News\\n- The Sacramento Observer\\n- Seattle Medium\\n- The St. Louis American\\n- The Washington Informer\\n- xkcd","title":"Jeff Bezos Proves Hes a Coward With Washington Post Endorsement News | The Democracy Dies in Darkness paper just made a pathetic decision that can only be explained by Jeff Bezos bowing to Donald Trump."},{"text":"True point, but nuclear meltdowns are not in the interest of anybody, including the power companies.","title":"The Democratic Party Is Pro-Nuclear  and Ready to Talk About It"},{"text":"Why would trump keep in his nightstand a book of speeches by that leader?

They will try to do it again but this time in a form of a nucler conflict.Links[https://jamestown.org/event/register-now-russias-rupture-and-western-policy-a-joint-jamestown-free-nations-of-post-russia-forum-event/](https://jamestown.org/event/register-now-russias-rupture-and-western-policy-a-joint-jamestown-free-nations-of-post-russia-forum-event/)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJ4t0\\\\_HAHs&amp;list=PLRcKaIDL7H4ljDwVdEg0uR7E4LSLU4TGl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJ4t0_HAHs&amp;list=PLRcKaIDL7H4ljDwVdEg0uR7E4LSLU4TGl)[https://news.yahoo.com/julian-assange-wikileaks-cables-bombshell-221520198.html](https://news.yahoo.com/julian-assange-wikileaks-cables-bombshell-221520198.html)","title":"Jamestown Foundation, a war mongering think tank founded by CIA, run by ex-CIA head James Woolsey and Bidens puppet Michael Carpenter and funded by neocons (Dick Cheney), is pushing US toward WW3 and nuclear holocaust.

It isn't that empathy is bad, it's that we have a cult like devotion to it that should only be appealing to 14-year-olds, who just discovered Beatles lyrics. Sometimes, instead of cultivating radical empty, we need to cultivate radical apathy. \\"Hey, look at all those special rights they want to give trans people, Black people and women.

Ancient caliphates were actually very liberal in their practice of Islam after the religion had spread to as far as Southern Spain. Likewise, while Christianity has traditionally been against homosexuality, several Christian countries have embraced the concept of gay marriage and even the Catholic church has made steps to recognize it within its institution. That is not to say that, at the same time, there are multiple other Christian institutions working against gay marriage and the like.Religion is not an unchanging thing. Like any other ideology, they go through changes and reforms, specially at the institutional level. It is the reason why both Islam and Christianity have multiple versions and institutions instead of just following a single monolithic authority.Furthermore, religious leaders don't represent the average believer. Again, you are choosing to look at the most extreme voices as an absolute representation of all followers of said faiths. You tell me to do a little digging, but I think you are the one that needs to do a lot of digging here. There are practicing muslim women today, protesting muslim oppression in Iran, There are married gay couples who practice Christianity, There are openly gay muslims. These facts alone should contextualize the difference between individual believers and religious institutions.I understand your view on Muslim extremist advocating for against things like homosexuality in the west and I also don't like it. However, we live in a democratic country that has progressed socially by allowing people to express themselves. Labeling all muslims as problematic because of the extremist minority, is just oppression and then we just find ourselves turning into a fascist country.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"The 2024 GOP platform is racism, hate, fear and a shit load of projection.","title":"Trump, once again, threatens to lock up anyone he deems cheated and anyone who donated to the Democratic Party."},{"text":"And MSM and snowflakes lap it up as they make up new rules.","title":"CNNs Phillip: Harris Getting Nomination Without Primaries Has Absolutely Nothing to Do with the Democratic Process"},{"text":"Seconding this option.

They won't mention tariffs. Theyll say \\"lower taxes\\" because that's been the Republican soundbite for 50 years. There's a video going around from Jimmy Kimmel Live where one of his reporters asks attendees at a Trump rally their thoughts on some basic political hot buttons. And they have no idea what the reporter is talking about. Now obviously the video cherrypicks the funniest ones, but I honestly think most voters answers would be the same. With the bombardment of information from constant Trump speeches, social media, conflicting news stories, etc, it is a lot of mental work to wade through it all to pick out what is relevant. Most people just aren't willing to do that work. So they vote feelings because it takes less work. Trump - by nature of being a white male boomer narcissist - makes them feel a little more empowered and a little less left behind. So they'll vote for him.","title":"Hillary Clinton says Trump's Madison Square Garden event is a 'Nazi rally'"},{"text":"Yup","title":"Colorado early voting numbers show Democrats with slight edge over GOP voters"},{"text":"They dont see his movies lol.

They're simply not financially secure, emotionally adept, or mature enough to handle raising a child. However, if your end-all solution for unwanted pregnancy is abortion, that's incredibly shallow and dangerous thinking.We have first world privilege here. Birth control is readily available and affordable; often entirely free. It's not 100% accurate, but it is extremely effective. To ensure you absolutely do not get pregnant, simply stay abstinent. If you choose not to, you should accept the risk that comes with that.I feel like you're taking personal responsibility and throwing it out the window; a reoccurring trend in today's world. Abortion shouldn't be some easily made decision; it should be weighed heavily, yet so many people use it as a primary form of birth control. Abortion should be a last resort option that takes into account your typical form of birth control, how many previous abortions you've had, and your overall situation.Accidents happen even with precaution, but at the rate we're going, most of these are no accidents: people just don't care because abortion is no longer seen as killing an unborn child. Instead, a fetus is regarded as just a pack of nerves, easily disposable. Multiple abortions can hurt a woman's reproductive capability and cause other issues, but the implications for the fetus itself is what horrifies the other half of the US and first world nations.This is why, split right down the middle in polar extremes, states were given the power to vote on how to handle abortion. While one half of the nation thinks abortions should be federally legalized and funded, the other half thinks they should be limited and individually funded, if not outlawed outright. People can disagree with that decision all they like, but when you take into account the extremely polarized ideologies behind what a fetus is or isn't, it's the best solution. No one's happy about it; no one has federal power dictating what is or isn't right - you vote in your state to determine that for yourself and no one else.","title":"CMV: Im pro-abortion.

If anyone is arguing from a position of fear, it is not the person making a principled stand for basic due process rights.You pretend to want to close the gender gap and foster **mutual** understanding, but everything in your posts makes it clear that you assume the women's position on every single one of those issues to be the correct one, and only lament the fact that men are not being good enough allies in pushing women's preferences.","title":"What's Wrong With Men"},{"text":"Shameful.

Kennedy,[29] followed by Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980,[27] the party changed its nominating rules again.[27]The Democrats had some incredibly bumpy years that led to them turning away from the common person and gradually deciding to stay that way.

It was from one city, and one black market distribution network. Basically, they took weed carts and cut them with vitamin E acetate. They likely chose this chemical because they 1) figured it was a vitamin (thus harmless) and 2) it has the same color and consistency of weed carts. The problem is, they aren't doctors and they didn't do proper research, and inhaled vitamin E acetate is very, very damaging to the lungs, and a handful of people got pretty sick. It was pretty much an isolated incident, but the media ran with it (like they do with everything) and fear mongered and made it seem like it was some widespread issue. It wasn't. It was a couple of dumb asses. But then the government(s) stepped in and it \\"gave\\" them a reason to try and ban all vape (since it can't be taxed like tobacco can be). Alternatively, you could be referencing the \\"concerns\\" over \\"pop corn lung\\" from vaping. It's been frequently used (by companies that will profit from the downfall of vaping no less)  as a fear mongering news story about the dangers of vape. Thing is, those concerns are 1000% over blown. First of all, the chemical that causes popcorn lung (diytel. The chemical that has a buttery/creamy flavor) needs to be inhaled at very, very large amounts for a good length of time in order to be harmful (as in, say, in an industrial setting in a pop corn factory where they are using super concentrated forms of it to flavor 1000s of pounds of popcorn on a daily basis, hints the name of the condition). In the concentrations it used to be found within vape (more on this in a second), like .0001% of the total 60 mL, its completely harmless (and we know it's harmless at those levels, because the food industry has studied it extensively for many decades). But even still, well before the government decided to step in and regulate vape (at the request of the tobacco companies) pretty much every single reputable company out there removed diytel as a flavor in any of their formulations, because there was a *small* concern within the community that prolonged, low dosage exposure may be damaging to the lungs (no science was involved in this situation). This never made the news.  And it stayed that way for 5-6 years. It wasn't until the big tobacco companies and the government shut down all the small ecig companies out there (by regulating them to death and making the cost of operation so expensive that only the biggest companies could compete) that this concern ever became news worthy. I could continue to rant about the history of the ecig community (of which, I've been a member of since 2006) and how it's a perfect example of a conspiracy, and how almost everything out there about it today is propaganda.  In one of my university chemistry courses I did a whole laboratory study as well as meta analysis of the data currently available about vape and it's health impacts (we have been conducting studies of the major compounds found in vape, i.e. PG/VG since atleast the 1920s. The actors guild did an extensive, years long study on the effects of stage fog on actors, and the chemicals they use for stage fog is the same they use in vape, and they found no health impacts even with long term (decade+) exposure). But I won't. Cuz I'm sure that would bore people.","title":"Does anyone remember right before COVID? There was the vaping pandemic?

I wasn't a part of the movement but knew people who were, and it's not as simple as them being brainwashed by Fox News, anymore than some people on the right reduce left wing groups to \\"paid protestors\\". I would encourage you to read this writeup from the american conservative, one of the select few reliably antiwar and anti establishment right wing groups, and their piece written in 2018 which discussed the factions in the movement https://www.theamericanconservative.com/a-lament-for-the-tea-party/It was 2013 and I was sitting in my office when one of my co-workers shuffled in. He had a headache, he said, the result of a campaign he was running for a position in local Republican politics that had unexpectedly turned rocky. The problem was the voters: they had tagged him as an establishment man and no matter how many times he touted his conservative bona fides, he couldnt seem to dispel their skepticism. Only one thing matters now, he said, immigration. Theyre just livid about that.Looking back, that conversation marked, for me anyway, the moment that the Tea Party began to change, from a loosely woven coalition of activists worried about big government to the right-wing nationalist force that would eventually elect Donald Trump. (The brightest indicator of all would come a year later, when Dave Brat knocked off House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary by running a campaign obsessed with immigration.) The causes of the Tea Partys mutation were many: anger with Washington intransigence, the imprint of charlatans like Sarah Palin, the sheer tedium of subjects like budget supercommittees, **an ethos of libertarian populism that perhaps inevitably saw its latter element consume its former.**So RIP the Tea Party. It had lost causes, compelling ideas, andyesunseemly street theater and sometimes daft outbursts. That enabled its opponents to tag it as a crazed ideological front, but was it really? Which is more inflexibly ideological: to look upon the failed compassionate conservatism and wars of choice during the Bush years and decide its time for a corrective, or to keep doing the same thing a decade later? During times of elite insulation and recklessness, sometimes a populist movement is just the medicine, and the Tea Party at least for a few years was one bracing dose of castor oil. Alas, it will probably be remembered as little more than an interregnum period of parliamentary chaos between Bush and Trump. Still, as Congress indulges its diabetic appetite once again, its worth remembering that the guy standing on the National Mall wearing a tri-cornered hat and waving a Gadsden flag is still in possession of far more sense than is your average Republican senator.","title":"If Harris loses, expect Democrats to move right"},{"text":"For real.

For example, making higher education more accessiblewhether by expanding trade programs, making community college free, or providing student debt reliefcould help close the gap in male college enrollment. When people dont feel like their economic prospects are crumbling, theyre less likely to scapegoat each other or be swayed by divisive rhetoric.We could also implement programs to improve work-life balance, such as shorter work weeks or incentivized paternity leave. These measures would give men the opportunity to engage more fully at home and in caregiving, reducing the resentment sometimes felt when theyre solely seen as providers. For women, stronger workplace protections and pay transparency laws could help address discrimination and the wage gap, ensuring that equality isnt just a talking point but a measurable reality.Another piece of the puzzle is investing in education that fosters emotional intelligence and respectful social dynamics from an early age. Comprehensive sex and relationship education in schools, which includes discussions on consent, gender equality, and conflict resolution, would go a long way toward building a foundation of understanding and respect across genders before divisions start to take root.Of course, its true that policies alone wont magically heal divides or replace the need for empathy and dialogue. But if people feel like their society is structured in a way that supports them fairly and equitably, theyre less likely to turn to polarized ideologies or view others as threats. In other words, rather than making individuals responsible for patching up the fractures, we should focus on policies that prevent those fractures from forming in the first place.","title":"What's Wrong With Men"},{"text":"As long as you are not voting it's fine with me","title":"DJT - Controlled Opposition - Elementary Level"},{"text":"When you don't actually want to help voters, attack the other guy!

Its another if youre actively making content or engaging in a space to further the goals of a movement. When that happens, you *get* to educate people.

Any mythology they sustain is done to provide symbolic or metaphorical value to the ritual.  But the important thing is that incidents of historical reality in the mythology are generally happy coincidences.  In America, religion is not about community rituals because were so individualistic that we do not care about community.  We have been primed to see ritual not as resonant, but as empty and vain. No, American religion is about opinions youre unwilling to reconsider.  This is why American churches seem to be such revolving doors, with most Americans having changed their religious affiliation at least once in their lives.  Were not there for the ritual or the community, were there to be affirmed that our chosen in-group is good and that out-groups are evil.  Were there not for challenges to our na?ve utilitarian morality, but rather to be soothed that were good enough for paying our taxes and not getting caught when we do something wrong, simply because our opinions and intentions were good.Thats why we get people raising a stink over evolution, even now.  Its not because their practices require a young earth and special creation.  Its because they heard a young earth story first by people they had to rely on, and now they cannot bear to face the consequences of trying to evaluate that belief against the evidence.  Its why they make such a stink about abortion: they are once again trying to avoid serious thought and double down on an opinion that felt good in the moment.  Its why they care so much about trans people despite the subject just not being mentioned within their mythology or rituals: it isnt because God condemns it, but because it makes them uncomfortable.

Kamala Harris doesnt have the same appeal as Scranton Joe, so shes underperforming in places like PA and MI. Shes an empty suit Cali democrat that was polled to be the most left-leaning senator in the Senate, even to the left or Bernie Sanders.2. She didnt do interviews for like a month after replacing Joe, and Joe is pissed about getting shafted, which he openly voiced to Obama a few days ago, saying Harris isnt as strong of a competitor as he (Joe) is, which is true.3. Trumps been unhinged and saying shit for years, thats all baked into the cake at this point, for both republicans and independents voting for him, so his rhetoric isnt doing much. 4. Harris chose Walz as her running mate becauseI dunno, fuck Josh Shapiro I guess? If she went with Shapiro she wouldve almost certainly got Penn in her pocket to win the election, but she went with Walz because hes not jewish. And no, I dont mean Soros or Sanders Jewish, I mean orthodox Jewish.5. Many people find the cackling unbearable but thats more of a personal qualm.6. Her momentum really died after the DNC. Just from watching both national polls and battleground state polls, shes slipped behind Trump in most of them. Polymarkets been shifting towards Trump, Nate Silvers model has been doing the same, the spectrum of polls from Quinnipiac to RCP have momentum shifting from left to right.7. The issues most people care about have been consistent: shit costs too much and illegal immigrants are flooding the country.

It suggests that cross-gender friendships and empathy could solve complex political and social rifts that stem from deep-rooted historical, cultural, and economic forces. However, empathy alone wont resolve the larger systemic issues that fuel political and social divides between genders.The claim that men and women are drifting apart socially and politically isnt new, but saying that the solution lies in liberal men and women reaching out across the aisle to their skeptical male peers might oversell individual responsibility over structural solutions. When men disproportionately gravitate toward conservative platforms, it isnt always because they lack a compassionate friend to nudge them. Its often that they see their own identities and interests better represented by these platforms, which have increasingly marketed themselves around issues that speak to anxieties about masculinity, economic disenfranchisement, and cultural decline. Meanwhile, in the same cultural context, women align more with liberal policies that address healthcare, education, and economic supportpolicies more likely to resonate with concerns about family and community stability. Expecting friendship to bridge these gaps without addressing the issues that give rise to these different priorities risks only a superficial kind of understanding.The emphasis here on dialogue, while well-meaning, is out of touch with how political identities are often deeply entwined with social identities. Most people do not want to debate their values with people who fundamentally oppose them on core issues; they want to feel secure and understood in their own convictions. Forcing understanding on people who have conflicting interests, goals, and lived experiences might actually deepen divides, not lessen them.For South Korea, where cross-gender antagonism has reached the point of intense public campaigns against perceived feminist gains, the problem isnt that individuals arent empathetic enoughits that men and women are pitted against each other in a society thats competitive and unforgiving. Suggesting that individuals should bear the burden of creating empathy when the structures that shape their lives are incentivizing antagonism ignores the larger forces at play.Its commendable to want to build understanding across genders and political lines, but we shouldnt let this idea distract us from pushing for policy changes that could actually address the reasons why people feel insecure and threatened in the first place. Conversations and friendships are wonderful, but they are no substitute for social policies that foster true equality and security for all genders.","title":"What's Wrong With Men"},{"text":"  I told Barack, if you really, really want to remake the Supreme Court, nominate Cruz.

The worst of both worlds. The second time I was assaulted happened when I was in college. A student at a nearby, but different, university assaulted me. We lived together in a large housing complex, think housemates but not roommates. Penetration was not involved, thankfully, but it was still an hour-long ordeal of terror. He could've done anything that he wanted. Following my release from his room, things got worse. When I reported it, I was ostracized by many of his friends. One of them told me I was a drama queen making shit up, and that he couldn't have done it because he was \\"straight.\\" It was a nightmare and the housing board let him stay because (a) I wasn't penetrated, and (b) he claimed his alcoholism made him do it and he should be given a chance to get treatment. Well he got that treatment, and then to celebrate finishing the treatment program he had a drink. Then a second. Then a third. Then he date raped another resident of the house and that got him evicted.A year later, I was living in a different house that was owned by the same housing board. I was then falsely accused of sexual assault by another resident. Now stay with me here because it gets a touch confusing. My accuser had himself been accused of sexual misconduct against his girlfriend. For some reason, he thought I was involved in the accusations even though I didn't even know he had been accused. So he retaliated by accusing me of assaulting somebody else. The described assault was what I had endured a year earlier. I was then summoned to appear before the housing board. I had to listen to each point of his accusation, described in disturbing and imaginative detail, then enter a \\"plea.\\" I was told that I was not presumed innocent and that the determination would be made on a preponderance of evidence. I was not told who had accused me, nor who I had allegedly harmed. I was told character evidence was non-admissible and that I needed to demonstrate to the committee that I hadn't assaulted anyone. I only found out who accused me because the idiot gladly announced it to me when I returned. I was eventually found \\"not responsible\\" and my accuser was himself evicted after his own case became a mountain of accusation against him. But it lasted two months. Two months of wondering what the hell was going to happen. Two months of reliving the nightmare of the year before. Two months of wondering if I would need to find another place to live mid-semester. The fact that the system could not tell the difference between a normal accusation and one that was so blatantly malicious was mind boggling to me. The procedures of the hearing, which I was told were based on the procedures of the university's disciplinary committee, were appalling. I had no right to confront my accuser. I had no right to know who my alleged victim was. I was expected to disprove the allegation. I was told I was not allowed to have an attorney. The system was not well designed, nor was it staffed by people qualified to do the job. If this system was being used by my state-funded university, I can see why some men are afraid even if it isn't statistically likely that they'll be accused. I know that being evicted or expelled isn't the same as a criminal conviction, but these consequences do have real ramifications and their application felt capricious.","title":"What's Wrong With Men"},{"text":"Get out and VOTE and try to get everyone you know to vote for the rational, sane, non-Russian asset candidate!

So yes, your mum who is 60 and spent 10 years as a housewife will probably never catch up on earnings, which kind of distorts the average.The gender wage gap will solve itself, it's just that it's going to be mathematically impossible for that to happen until like the 2040s.","title":"What's Wrong With Men"},{"text":"Elections are turning into \\"what billionaires are on what side\\" a little too quickly for my liking","title":"Jeff Bezos killed Washington Post endorsement of Kamala Harris, paper reports"},{"text":"His supporters are unwilling or even refusing to accept inconvenient truths.","title":"We endorse Kamala Harris for President of the United States"},{"text":"This is actually a great analogy lol","title":"Ben Shapiro Took on 25 Kamala Harris Voters in a Debate, and the Results Were Incredible"},{"text":"There may have been some \\"wild covid\\" kills mixed in fall 2019.","title":"Does anyone remember right before COVID?

You make some good points throughout about engaging with men and understanding the problems that they face without dismissing them offhand, but imo you fall short in how this is framed.Part of what drives men to the right IMO is the rhetoric that men are the problem. Theyre tired of seeing opportunities that specifically exclude them and of being  told that the problems they face are secondary to the problems women face. On some level its understandable why this occurring and the uplifting of women is great, but too many times Men are told that they arent allowed to have a voice in certain issues and are talked at rather than talked to. So instead of engaging with people that dont want to engage with them, they find a sense of belonging in the conservative parties who champion men.Titling a post Whats wrong with Men is the type of thing that feeds into this line of thinking. Its framing Men as the other, as something that is broken and needs to be fixed from the outside instead of framing them as people who are experiencing difficulties and giving them a voice to be heard.And yes, I understand that this lack of a voice is something that women have faced for far longer than men. That doesnt mean that the script should be flipped to take away platforms from men (as many as liberals seem to be ok with), the discourse should be around finding solutions that are best for everyone and ensuring that everyone has an equal voice.","title":"What's Wrong With Men"},{"text":"No mensch would ever make fun of a disabled person.","title":"Exclusive | Holocaust survivor rips Kamala Harris for boosting Trump-Hitler comparisons, says ex-prez is a mensch"},{"text":"They've been moving right my whole life.

As part of this proposal by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), for the first time, most group health plans and health insurance issuers would be required to cover over-the-counter (OTC) contraceptives without cost sharing or requiring a prescription, a key action taken by the Administration to expand access to and awareness of coverage for birth control and other critical health services. In addition, plans and issuers would have to provide consumers with more choices of covered contraceptives, such as a broader array of contraceptive drugs (for example, a wider selection of covered oral contraceptive pills) and drug-led combination products (for example, a wider selection of covered intrauterine devices (IUDs)). The proposed rules also further reinforce plans and issuers responsibility to cover Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, -cleared, and -granted birth control methods without cost sharing. This proposed rule comes in response to reports that many plans and issuers continue to impose barriers to contraceptive coverage, such as requiring patients to satisfy step therapy protocols, imposing unduly burdensome administrative requirements, or requiring cost-sharing for services that are integral to the application of the preventive service provided.  \\n...  \\nThe proposed rules would build on previous guidance - PDF and require health plans and issuers to provide an easily accessible, transparent, and sufficiently expedient exceptions process for all recommended preventive services. An exceptions process can be crucial for people who face limits on medically necessary care or coverage and would ensure they can access all medically necessary, recommended preventive services, including contraception, as well as certain immunizations, screenings, and other critical services for infants, children, and adolescents.Since its inception, the ACA has required most group health plans and health insurance issuers to provide coverage for preventive services recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Health Resources and Services Administration, without any cost-sharing requirements, such as a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible. The proposed rules would strengthen these existing consumer protections by requiring plans and issuers to cover OTC contraception without a prescription and without cost sharing.Millions of people continue to face barriers to obtaining preventive services, like contraception, even as access has become more critical. In the wake of the Supreme Courts decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization to overturn Roe v. Wade, these proposed rules represent a direct response to President Bidens Executive Orders on Protecting Access to Reproductive Healthcare Services\\nand Strengthening Access to Affordable, High-Quality Contraception and Family Planning Services.The rules would require plans and issuers to add a disclosure to the results of any online Transparency in Coverage self-service tool search for covered contraceptives that explains OTC contraceptives are covered and include phone and web contacts for additional information regarding contraceptive coverage. These proposed rules would not modify federal conscience protections related to contraceptive coverage for employers, plans, and issuers.The Departments also released additional guidance addressing plans and issuers coverage of other recommended preventive services, as required under the ACA. This guidance focuses on coverage of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medication that reduces the risk of HIV infection, reiterating the requirement to cover preventive PrEP and related services without cost sharing. The guidance also responds to continued reports that, in some cases  including where plans and issuers have not provided clear guidance to network providers on how to code preventive services  plans and issuers are denying claims or imposing cost sharing for recommended preventive items and services because of how a provider codes for those services. The guidance released today seeks to clarify how plans and issuers can mitigate challenges with coding and processing of claims for recommended preventive services to ensure that individuals are not improperly charged for important preventive care. In addition to the ACA requirements, the guidance addresses coverage requirements of chest wall reconstruction with aesthetic flat closure, if elected by the patient in connection with a mastectomy, under the Womens Health and Cancer Rights Act.  \\n...Statement from HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra:From day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has made clear that every woman should have access to the health care she needs. That includes contraception and other family planning services, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. The proposed rule we announce today would expand access to birth control at no additional cost for millions of consumers. Bottom line: women should have control over their personal health care decisions. And issuers and providers have an obligation to comply with the law.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Proposes Expanding Coverage of Birth Control and Other Preventive Services | Proposed rules would further bolster coverage of certain recommended preventive services, like over-the-counter birth control, without cost sharing for millions of consumers."},{"text":"It conflicts with her average of 1.25 events per day?","title":"Kamala Harris Bails on Joe Rogan Due to 'Scheduling'"},{"text":"Or the Los Angeles Times.
