That highlights the importance of training data. Without it, an LLM is literally useless.

Because all of those things have to happen by a human with biases. And don't you think that anyone selected to gather the training data for the AI model that will literally lead the country will probably want to include data that supports their personal beliefs? Using an LLM to govern would necessarily lend itself to corruption and manipulation. Now you could argue that we just have to have a big enough group of people curating this training data and running the AI to make sure that it is impartial and fair, but if we're going to have a large group of people run the AI, why not just have a large group of people run the government, and why not have that large group of people be voted for in elections?

Anyone who thinks that fluoride should be added to everyone else's drinking water either has not studied this issue or else wants to damage people's health.Note that once it is put into our drinking water, fluoride is highly resistant to filtration. Even if its supposed benefits in preventing cavities outweighed its deleterious neurotoxic effects, there would still be far more justification for adding literally hundreds of vitamins, antioxidants, far less toxic and more nutritious minerals, and health supplements to our drinking water. I mean, if you actually think supposedly preventing a dental problem is a justification for adding something to our drinking water, why not add Vitamin D, Vitamin C, and fish oil as well? Why not add naloxone while you are at it? Just think of all of the lives you could save!!!And if anyone actually wants fluoride in their drinking water, why don't they just add it in themselves? Fluoride drops are readily available for anyone who is dumb enough to buy them. And at least that fluoride is pharmaceutical grade instead of the industrial waste that they pollute our drinking water with.The idea that there is some magic, perfect amount of fluoride at which its supposed cavity fighting properties will **always** outweigh its negative health effects for every individual is one of the most bizarre and non-scientific claims in human history.

In case people missed it, there were tons of memes about Walz coming over to ask for your vote, and helping you rotate your tires and change out your air filter. This podcast goes into the currently problems with young boys and young men:  [https://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-are-boys-and-men-in-trouble/](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-are-boys-and-men-in-trouble/)Basically, we gave women more options (which is great), but this started changing the expected roles. Women could be homemakers, OR all this new stuff. And men could be breadwinners, or, no, maybe not anymore, men should feel fine if the women are breadwinners. But also don't be stay-at-home-dads bc that makes you kind of a loser. And slowly but surely, the narrative for young men became thinner and thinner, not because we took anything away, but because women expanded into their domain and nobody gave them a new narrative of what that could look like in a good way. Someone like Walz, a teacher, football coach, governor, memes where you do manly things that aren't toxic, etc. That could have courted these young men. Of course it would have been hard; dems were so far behind the curve in this demographic that it might not have mattered. But someone like Walz could have phrased abortion in a way that resonated with young men. \\"You're 23. You're in college. Are you ready to be a breadwinning father? Do you know this girl enough to commit to 18 years of raising a kid? Do you want her to feel trapped or forced to be with you forever? Or do you still want to explore the world a bit.

They'd sit empty for a while, then finally someone would buy into their inflationary balloon mortgages and buy one. The smaller starter home they left got scooped up by landlords or investment firms. The result was a net loss for new home buyers looking to enter the market. We needed to build 4 houses on average to create one new homeowner.What we need is rezoning to allow for the building of smaller, starter homes and incentives for builders to actually build them. We need restructuring of tax laws that restricts investment firms from buying residential properties, and to increase taxes on vacant property. We also need to outlaw property valuing algorithms like RealPage which artificially inflate housing and rental costs.Building new homes is great, but we can't build our way out of this mess without legislation to fix the underlying diseases that make those new builds unobtainable.","title":"The Democrats' Refusal to Break With a Broken System Cost Them Dearly"},{"text":"I was born in 82, I remember as far back as elementary school kids making up shit about Bush and Dukakis.

As gaming exploded through covid, and continues to explode, and as outside opportunities to find people to play with continue to diminish, the alt-right has positioned themselves in the discord groups and in the gaming community for A DECADE. Not only were they using this to spread subtle misogyny, but they were also there talking to these boys and finding out what problems they had in their lives, and discovering a message (authentic or exploitative is irrelevant) that resonated with them. Democrats as a whole, and progressive families individually, have essentially abandoned these kids to the gaming community. There's nothing wrong with gaming itself. But the fact that the alt-right has essentially taken over the narrative in those communities makes it a brainwashing pit of casual racism, sexism, ableism, and more. Again, they TOLD us they were doing this A DECADE ago. And we did nothing, as a society. We just let them have that territory.

Trump's track record on policy does not support, at all, a belief that he can achieve any of this (or is even interested in it). Trump could barely manage the debt (which he blew up) and his administration was woefully inefficient across the boardSo, this is just a very pessimistic take on Trump, and I suppose that makes sense if you mostly hear negative perspectives on him. Last time around Trump was not able to achieve what he wanted to in large part because his administration got filled up with establishment cronies (he said he now regrets picking many of them) and he was strongly opposed by the establishment in general. The whole Russia Gate hoax also limited what Trump could do. So sure you could interpret his inability to do this previously as him being unable to ever do so, but that's not at all an unbiased assertion. Also, this time around Trump has already tasked Vivek and Elon with identifying wasteful spending and identifying aspects of the bureaucracy to cut. And he is bringing in people into his administration who are much more aligned with his anti-establishment views and with reducing the size of the government. If anyone will be able to do it, it's an outsider like him. Certainly, Kamala would not have done this.   \\nOn top of that, nobody that knows anything about public health is reassured to see RFK Jr., a crazy person, \\"reform the FDA\\".?So, let's talk about RFK Jr. He is a lifelong democrat who focused strongly on environmental safety and the health of the American People. He is anti-Big Pharma and is opposed to the mega corporations in the food industry that are making ultra-processed food. Yes, he also has investigated vaccines and was convinced to be a vaccine skeptic by a group of moms who came to him with both personal stories of vaccine injuries and a mountain of evidence of the harm they can cause. I've listened to him go on hours long podcasts and articulate everything with evidence and statistics. This is not some raving lunatic. So, what are you to make of it when the Mainstream Media says he is crazy and completely wrong? Well, the Mainstream Media gets a lot of money from Big Pharma and Mega-Corporations through ads and who it often aligned with the corrupt D.C. establishment who profits from relationships with these same corporations. The most simple explanation (and the most logical) is that he is at least partially correct, but that what he is saying threatens Big Pharma and Big Food and so they pressure the media and politicians to make him out to be crazy. What benefit would it serve RFK Jr. to go around saying untrue things about vaccines, food chemicals, etc.? None- if anything, it has made his life more difficult. But there is a massive benefit to Big Pharma and Big Food if he is ignored, as they can keep making profits unimpeded. So, I think it is fairly delusional to believe that RFK Jr. is just simply crazy. If you actually believe that it just goes to show how effective the media can be.  \\n4 is more pablum. Trump couldn't even negotiate with his own government to get wall funding and some of the people in that government liked him. Meanwhile, he's an international laughing stock. There's no real reason to believe he'll manage to negotiate Putin out of a war, especially since he's shown to be a big fan of him (something that's apparently not worrisome at all for his voters). Again, there's no ground for positive coverage of these things. They're fantasy.Again, just an extremely pessimistic view of things, and factually untrue as well. Trump did get much of the border wall built. The fact that Democrats opposed his domestic agenda says nothing of his ability to manage foreign policy. And no he's not an international laughing stock, that's just more bias. Trump was able to keep any significant wars from starting while he was in office, and managed to develop enough of a relationship with Kim Jong Un to deescalate what Obama had described as the greatest threat to American security (the nuclear threat from N. Korea). Upon his re-election Zelensky and Putin have already signaled willingness to negotiate an end to the war, and Trump is at the very least a skilled negotiator.   \\nSo, what fair coverage of Trump should look like is replacing very pessimistic coverage (such as saying Trump is an idiot and will not be able to negotiate an end to any war) with more balanced coverage (such as saying Trump has shown he is sometimes able to successfully negotiate de-escalation before but may have a tough time in this instance). Reality is not so wholly biased towards your political beliefs that it makes sense for the Media to give him 95% negative coverage. That just isn't how political issues work.","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"Both of these comments in this chain are right on the money imo.It was establishment/status quo vs. massive shake-ups via tearing it all down.

And while it might not be possible for a journalist (or publisher, editor, etc.) to step outside their own political views, it's definitely possible for them to not be bought. Some examples: Reporting that is influenced by pressure to suppress stories or to accept talking points because you might lose access to your sources or because you're getting financial incentives or gifts from them. This is pretty common with White House reporting regardless of the party -- there's a lot of criticism of reporters on the Trump administration being too cozy with them, but not just him; the Obama administration was [notorious for being hostile to the media](https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/cjp_report_on_us_press_freedom.php), as were the Nixon, FDR, and Wilson administrations and many others. There's an argument that the whole White House Correspondents' Dinner is a form of this since it injects a fun socializing/fraternizing element between reporters and sources that they might not want to give up. But it's also common in local journalism as well, you see this sometimes for instance with publishing police comments verbatim so the police chief will still talk to you. Reporting that is influenced by personal and/or romantic relationships with your sources. Some of this is based on speculation and some of that speculation is sexist -- i.e., the assumption that female journalists are usually sleeping with sources -- but it does happen sometimes, like with [Olivia Nuzzi and RFK](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/olivia-nuzzi-leaves-new-york-magazine-rfk-jr) or [Paula Broadwell and David Petraeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petraeus_scandal).

But all this happened and worse. Americans were lied to and abused on a massive scale, and RFK was one of the first to tap into the publics anger. And thanks to his Childrens Health Defense, he already had an established platform to promote his jeremiads (which focused heavily at the time on the erosion of constitutional rights, not always on vaccine-related issues). Though the Covid event was hardly discussed during the 2024 presenting campaign C largely because the corporate media that got almost everything wrong wanted the issue to disappear C it loomed like a heavy cloud. RFKs presence as a Trump surrogate enabled 47 to channel the simmering anger, giving rise to the Make America Healthy Again movement, which became a magnet for alt media-oriented independent voters. Now RFK stands to take over a gargantuan federal agency that has traditionally served as an instrument of Big Pharma and the agribusiness lobby, and which is currently led by a Democrat political operative with no medical or scientific background. The pundits who paint RFKs ascension as an unfortunate triumph of the paranoid style in American politics are whitewashing the failures and sordid deceptions of the credentialed class they represent, while denying the experiences of the millions who paid the price for them.

How often do most characters in novels spend on the toilet? How much does Harry Potter spend on the toilet? Given the character of moaning Myrtle, we actually get far more bathroom time in HP than almost any other major series I can think of.?\\nWhen you said human nature, you jumped right to the meaning of right and wrong. But is that really human nature. Eating, sleeping, pooping and fucking. That's human nature. HP actually does pretty good relative to other books. We actually see our characters eat and eat reasonable things. We see our characters have to go to their bedrooms. We don't have implied sex yet (because target audience is too young) but we get plenty of age-appropriate dating. As stated above, we even have scenes in the bath and on the toilet.?\\nIf you aren't interested in the view of human nature above and you want to discuss morality - again HP does a great job. But as you said, the lines in HP are often arbitrary and vary by character. But that is precisely human nature. People tend to inherit their moral compass (arbitrary lines and all) from parents and mentors and then proceed to never seriously challenge it. People sticking to their moral ideals, even when presented with alternatives, even when the situation doesn't call for it - that's human nature.?","title":"CMV: Harry Potter depicts human nature poorly"},{"text":"Curious for any examples of Trump using the FBI for personal or political advantage.

That's a huge damage to Democracy that will now forever be ignored.  Republicans are allowed to coup, Democrats are not.We also normalized that Republicans can be violent and attack institutions of Democracy like voting centers and ballot boxes.  But Democrats cannot.  So now Republicans are allowed to destroy ballots they don't like and get away with it.We also normalized Republicans allowed to be racist, xenophobic, and bigoted all around.  They are allowed to say/do the most awful things and get more support from their party for it.  Republicans face no consequences for this.Republicans are allowed to steal national secrets and sell them to allies.  Or give them away publicly for free.  They can do this to the enthusiastic support of their base.  Democrats cannot.Republicans can commit blatant federal crimes and get away with it.  Trump, Gaetz, and the rest of the MAGA criminals are all guilty of various crimes but get pardons/case dismissals with roaring approval from Republicans.  Democrats face consequences for crimes but Republicans are all above the law.We have normalized 'sports teams politics' where Republicans happily vote explicitly against their own interest.  Sometimes they're even intelligent enough to see it and don't care.  Whereas Democrat voters pick over their candidate with a fine tooth comb, and will absolutely sabotage their own candidate whereas Republicans will vote anyone in with a pulse so long as they're Republican.  The more crimes the better it seems.These are the things we have normalized and more.  Republicans are allowed to be piles of absolute garbage and win elections.  Say the wrong thing a decade ago as a Democrat and you will lose.  We expect perfection from Democratic candidates from both sides of the aisles political lens.  But for Republican candidates there is no such examination, any loud criminal who lies enough will win.This means that Republican candidates will get even worse then Trump in the future but Democrat candidates will become increasingly scarce in victory as their own base tears them apart and let Republicans win.  That is what I see for the future, and it's rather bleak.","title":"It could take America 90 years to recover from the damage Trump is going to inflict on Democracy (also ditch X and go to BlueSky - spread the word!)"},{"text":"but a stablecoin like the SDR is?","title":"Donald Trump, Digital Currency and the March Towards a Digital and Financial Prison Planet"},{"text":"Hope is for children and suckers?","title":"The last actions the Biden administration will take before Trump takes over"},{"text":"No, a group of experts released a letter saying it *had the hallmarks of being a Russian operation,* which it did.

He didnt understand Narcissa's love for Draco, which is why *she* betrays Voldemort immediately after Harry resurrects.

The vast majority of these points are just pure fantasy that no reasonable media outlet would report positively on. 1, 2 and 6 are just weird pablum for low information voters.

On top of that, nobody that knows anything about public health is reassured to see RFK Jr., a crazy person, \\"reform the FDA\\". There's no positive coverage of these things because they might as well be farts in the wind. I guess I'll grant 3 to an extent. 4 is more pablum.

No President could get 76million+ votes and win an election if they were a complete disaster. Trump does have a lot of things going for him and a lot of popular policies. But if u listen to these Mainstream Media outlets you would think he has no actual positives to a reasonable person. This has actually led to unfortunate takes such as that people only support Trump because they are brainwashed, or stupid, or just racist, etc. But no there are many reasons to support him, they just aren't covered fairly by these media outlets. And in fact these media outlets often give bad-faith takes on things where they assume the worst of Trump. For example, let's look at the instance where Trump's team's came up with a plan to follow procedural steps in selecting alternative electors so that if his legal challenge to the 2020 election succeeded it wouldn't be too late to \\"correct\\" the results at that point due to a technicality. The Mainstream Media has portrayed this as a scheme by Trump to trick people and cheat to steal the election, which leads to the claim/belief that Trump is a danger to democracy and tried to outright steal an election. But in truth he was only trying to win a legal challenge to the election results. Do u see the issue? People like yourself have a worldview in which Trump is an unbelievably terrible and dangerous person due to the media you consume, and yet this doesn't line up with the fact that so many people support him. It's delusional to still believe that no all those tens of millions of people are wrong/crazy and you are still clearly right. And I worry that it's this kinda perspective- created by the Mainstream Media- that will prevent our nation from coming together going forward","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/nzf6bi6v531e1.jpeg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23736cb093dcd3fedc1f9206454f69825927eb4f","title":"Why the Democratic Party should embrace the politics of Bernie Sanders"},{"text":"The military requires a minimum IQ.

Many people including liberal economitst say it will cause prices to increase with little benefit. Others say the price increase concerns are overblown and the tariffs will create more jobs in the U.S. The Tarriff plan will likely be clarified over the first months of the presidency.\\" Isn't it much more entertaining to hear \\"Trump's plan is so dumb! What an idiot! It's going to tank the economy!\\" Or \\"Trump's plan is secretly brilliant! It'll bring in lots of reve  ue and create a booming American economy!\\" - both said confidently?So I understand why many media sources prefer to only give one perspective- it's what makes the shows entertaining for their audiences. But the result of this is that people begin to have vastly diverging worldviews due to only ever really hearing one side of the story. I think there need to be some prominent media outlets  that actually strive to be as objective as possible as I outlined above so that people can get the full picture and better understand why other might have a differing perspective. Idk for sure, but I believe CNN and the NYT used to be fairly close to that standard, but now no longer are unfortunately.","title":"cmv: \\"Objective\\" Journalism isn't real and never was"},{"text":"Nah, the voters believe the lie that we need to protect the rich from paying their fair share.

Aside from the obvious  over the throwaway claim that Trump hasn't radicalised the right, the article constantly changes what it means by the Democrat party. Most of the analysis is devoted towards pointing out the completely obvious fact that the base of the party has views that are out of kilter with the average voter - this is more or less true by definition of all political parties - but casually just takes it to mean the party as a whole. An article devoted to the views of the Democrat party that does not even mention the views, rhetoric or policies of single Democrat politician isn't a serious analysis.The political reality is that people on the left - as do people on the right - have some batshit views, and will occasionally obtain a small amount of political power to try and implement their views and inevitably fuck up. For whatever godforsaken reason, voters (and journalists) believe (or pretend to believe) that this is a reflection of the party as a whole, regardless of the reality that a) it isn't, and b) the vast majority of Democrat politicians actively reject politically toxic shit like defund the police. Any serious analysis of the image problem the Democrats have really ought to take in account the reality of what Democrat politicians do rather than just go hurr durr progressives are so woke.I suspect the solution we all want is for Democrats to more aggressively punch left when shit like defund the police happens again, but we should perhaps take into account the possibility that with a conservative propaganda network devoted to portraying Democrats as out-of-touch woke hippies - and a liberal media that loves to self-flagellate - this might not work.

Ivanov wrote and corresponded extensively about the creation of this painting, which took him five years to complete. He wasn't trying to communicate any deeper truth or dark secret. He was moved by the passage and the complex emotions and circumstances he imaged were at play here.Mary had seen her friend and teacher die brutally, and now is seeing him alive again. She is in awe, she is overjoyed, she is in a state of disbelief. At the same time it is something of a cold reunion because Jesus is a man on a mission. There's no tender embrace. He's no longer the man she knew just a few days prior. It's obviously joyful, and her next action is to run to all the disciples and proclaim to them that the Lord is risen, but you can also imagine in the moment that she might've felt confused, maybe even unworthy or dismissed.That's ultimately the message translated into the painting. Do not cling to Earthly things and memories of the past--they will only bring you sorrow.

The global economy has been facing headwinds since covid that it has not recovered from, and the US has been doing quite well.

At the same time, real wages are mostly still behind where they were in 2018. Salaries have risen but not enough to match 2 years of high inflation. More importantly, US economic growth is increasingly concentrated in discrete areas.  Wages and employment prospects in California are very different from wages and employment prospects in iowa or alabama. Further, the economy can be good, while people are still struggling with unresolved issues regarding the costs of housing, medical care, child care, and education.   Trump was promising the voters of free pony.  The president has limited ability to fix these issues at all and they definitely cannot be fixed overnight.

Before radio, journalists had to do everything by press. They were removed from circulation and silenced. Before TV, journalists had to get word out by radio. They were taken off the air. Once we got to TV, the CIA realised the easiest step to counter this was simply to co-opt journalism. This was called operation mockingbirdBy capturing every news outlet and employing every journalist, they could say whatever they wanted and it would be truth. This is the single biggest destruction of actual journalism that holds people to account, what followed was a theatre performance where a few little scandals were dropped to keep the act upThe fact they arent going after and silencing mainstream journalists shows that those journalists arent threatening their narrative. The fact that they did before this, shows they used to threaten the narrativeIn the days of social media there is far more openness because its so decentralised, so once again you have journalists being murdered at scale rather than the odd one or two, because they are once again putting out journalistic discoveries that run against the ruling classs interests.

The reality is more nuanced.When people talk about \\"objective journalism,\\" they mean following established methodological principles: verifying facts with multiple sources, presenting different viewpoints fairly, separating facts from opinion, and being transparent about methods and limitations. It's similar to how scientists strive for objectivity through rigorous methodology while acknowledging their own potential biases.I worked as a court reporter for 15 years. When covering trials, I had to report exactly what was said and what evidence was presented, regardless of my personal views on the case. Was I completely \\"objective\\"? No. But by following strict journalistic standards, I could produce coverage that accurately informed readers about the proceedings.Even if the manner in which the subject is dealt with isn't overtly partisan, the subjects that are chosen to be presented themselves IS a political choice.This is a cop-out. By this logic, we should abandon any attempt at objectivity in any field because humans make subjective choices. Should we throw out the scientific method? Academic peer review? The justice system? All these institutions acknowledge human bias while still striving for objectivity through established procedures.The solution isn't to abandon objectivity as a goal - it's to be transparent about methods while actively working to minimize bias.

One is that they spend less time checking the accuracy of their stories to make sure theyre true and the other is that they are having to rely less and less on their their own investigative journalism and more and more on other sources of information. Now the normal pipelines of information, the local newspapers and independent journalists, have been cut and replaced by new kinds of service providers.One of the big ones are the wire agencies like the Press Association. These are the people that the Queen or an MP or the police service or government departments speak to if they want to make a national or an international statement. Every news organisation of any sizes subscribes to them. All the national papers, all the major regions, all the freesheets like the Metro, all of the BBC national and regional outlets, all the commercial news and radio stations, they all subscribe to it and they all rely on it. A study into the major Fleet Street publications, the respected ones like The Times, The Guardian, The Independent and The Daily Telegraph, as well as the Daily Mail because its a monstrously well-selling mid-market title found that about a third of their articles were direct rewrites of Wire material where at best theyd just slightly changed the layout. Another fifth were largely reproduced from the Wire and another fifth on top of that contained elements of wire stories but had a fair amount of original material added on top. Thats about 70% of major uk stories either wholly or partly rewritten from wire copy. Its completely replaced the national network of local journalists as the major pipeline of stories into the big papers. A typical journalistic rule is that you need two sources for every story. For a lot of media organisations, including the beeb, a Press Association story pulled off of the wire doesnt need a second story to go on the waves, its considered good to go as is.  The problem is that wire organisations just arent up to the job, either in terms of coverage or accuracy.This means that the unique selling point of media is no longer the unique stories they've investigated and scooped their competitors on, because they're all really just regurgitating the information from the same sources. So how can they stand out? What can they do to attract attention now? It's to give their paper a spin to target a particular demographic, which is usually a political segment.Journalism in the past wasn't perfect, but it also wasn't inherently based on political division as it was in the past.2/2","title":"cmv: \\"Objective\\" Journalism isn't real and never was"},{"text":"I do agree with what you've said, but does the idea of \\"objective\\", which a lot of people understand to mean, apolotical journalism, not go after the idea of journalists having an antagonistic relationship with the powers that be, which is a very political stance to take?","title":"cmv: \\"Objective\\" Journalism isn't real and never was"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/t5mrih1ce21e1.jpeg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89fa239ac5565be0aabc9e758305720be61a33af","title":"I personally hope dems push this BS even harder next election, itll be an even bigger red ??"},{"text":"Its just a painting bro, the real Jesus didnt even look like that.  in fact the real Jesus was a carpenter who spent a lot of his spare time hanging around prostitutes, druggies, vagabonds and threw big ass wine/dine parties with poor people.

An example of this is a couple of years before when the miners strike was ongoing, the Sun tried to run a front page of Arthur Scargill waving to miners in a way that looked kind of like a nazi salute with the headline Mine Fuhrer in a fairly obvious attempt to slur him in an obvious politically motivated attack co.  Well I dont know if anyones seen the picture of The Sun from the day they went with the story, but theres no photo and no headline. The printers just werent willing to put it together. Instead there was a large print statement saying that the Sun production chapels had refused to print the headline or picture. It wasnt just basic morality and a sense of decency which lead the printers to do this, but also a recognition that if Thatcher succeeded in breaking the miner strike then they could be next and thats basically what happened. At the time however, collective action from labourers served to hold media accountable and stop gross politicisation. That's disappeared.Murdoch built a new print plant in Wapping and tried to reach agreements with staff which would limit their ability to organise as a union, like the end of the closed shop and a no strike clause. After months of negotiation the employees went on strike and with military precision Murdoch had all 6,000 of them fired, convinced enough journalists to work as scabs to carry on publishing and got new workers in from EETPU (which was a catchily named electricians union that got expelled from the TUC a couple of years later) to run their new presses. The strike managed to last over a year under a lot of criticism from the government and newspapers as well as police suppression, but in the end it was broken. After that, the rest of the Fleet Street papers followed suit.From there there was little resistance as journalists were fired and not replaced on a massive scale. Before the Wapping change Murdochs titles made 35 million in profit. Three years later and this had quadrupled but during the same period their total staffing had dropped from 8,731 to 949. The other papers were quick to follow him.Its this breaking of the unions that has really accelerated commercialisation of news. Its not news that in every privatised industry, the drive for profit will turn the focus away from social benefits and towards increasing earnings. With journalism,Id consider that what theyre meant to be supplying is a truthful representation of the important events. If we look at how the system has changed, especially in comparison to Wapping, then we can see a lot of ways in which the current set-up has really got in the way of that goal. This isnt just just because there are a few bad eggs wholl break laws if it gets them a good scoop and some money, its a systematic failure of the medias ability to accurately report the truth.Firstly there are simply far far less journalists out there. There arent and have never been tens of thousands of Guardian, Independents and Times journalists out there digging up stories all across the UK for the big top tier nationals. Instead theyve relied upon a network of smaller local papers and specialists scattered about the country that form the essential infrastructure of news gathering. These organisations simply no longer exist in the same way they did a few decades ago. The local newspapers themselves have have gone down by a third in the last two decades, while the number of journalists at the local newspapers still up and running has gone down with more than half of the provincial NUJ members lost their jobs in the decade and a half after Wapping.The local freelance agencies were the other place that journalists could go to to get news from across the country, but these are even worse off as the big papers cut their budgets for buying stories and froze the prices of those they did get meant the agencies had to shed staff and close. There were five agencies in Leeds, now there is one. Around Merseyside three of the four agencies closed and the one that did remain shrunk to around half the number of staff. The same thing happened in Stoke, Manchester, Derby and pretty much every city across the country save London and to a certain extent Birmingham while in rural areas, the smaller towns and villages, the one-man-bands that had covered them simply went bust.The story is the same wherever you look, like the specialist court reporting agencies that used to dig out severalt national news stories every day, including some fairly large scandals like when they caught the Chancellor Nigel Lawsons wife being snuck into her drink driving hearing which had been scheduled for before the courts would normally be open. Practically every supply line of national news and information to the major new organisations has collapsed in a bid to save money and cut costs. Meanwhile, at the big well-known news organisations things arent much better. Although they havent suffered cuts as massive as the ones faced by smaller newspapers because for instance that 8000+ employees being reduced to less than a thousand was mostly normal working people like the printers rather than journalists who are involved in finding and reporting on news, the numbers of journalists at the major Fleet Street organisations has still dropped a bit. The big problem they face though is the workload. Although there are almost as many journalists at major papers as there used to be, they space theyre expected to fill in a paper has trebled and thats before you take into account more recent innovations like free sheets, websites, blogs, podcasts and all those extra things that are considered essential nowadays.1/2","title":"cmv: \\"Objective\\" Journalism isn't real and never was"},{"text":"You get what you vote for.","title":"'F--k you!'

This is why they don't actually care to resist fascism, because doing so will make their politics completely unappealing to voters.

I have to validate them and their beliefs while alienating myself from everyone with a differing belief.  I don't do that shit for straight people.  I don't do that shit for LGB people.  I have to ensure the trans community never feels societal pressure or judgement when every fucking other person in this country feels societal pressure and judgement.  I have to volunteer my tax dollars to pay for niche healthcare therapies and procedures, including for convicted criminals and illegal migrants, when I don't have proper basic healthcare.  I choose to use preferred pronouns, because I believe in treating people how they prefer to be treated, but that's not enough either.  That still gets you called a \\"True transphope.\\"  I need to berate others into using preferred pronouns too.  Failure to do any and all of this, or not doing it enthusiastically and uncritically enough, is seen as an infringement on their rights now.If treating the trans community equally, and by equally, I mean treating them like I treat every other asshole in this godforsaken country, is transphobic, then you win.  I'm a transphobe.  You caught me.  I'm more exhausted by having to walk on eggshells and avoid honesty than I am afraid of that label at this point.  You can also feel free to call me antisemitic, racist, sexist, &amp; ableist.  Judge me guilty of any form of bigotry you'd like for insisting on treating people as equals.  Let the trans community fight for their \\"Rights\\" on their own, the way every other minority group had to.  Given that they make up 1.14% of the population, I'm sure they'll manage the job more quickly without imperfect allies and transphobes like me.","title":"How Kamala Harris out of touch trans views cost Democrats the election"},{"text":"Dollar has no limit.\\nBitcoin is a limited pool.\\nPrint some more.","title":"Congratulations USA you are now 36 trillion dollars"},{"text":"Yeah good job Trump voters...

Full disclosure, I'm a Democratic Socialist from outside the US, but I have no choice but to pay attention to America politics. I'm only here because this was the first subreddit that popped up on election night outside lgbt. You call this a compassionate critique, but frankly, what even is this? Critique requires engaging with some semblance of the substance of the thing being critiqued, but besides the valid attacks on wokescolding, this is nonsense. Objectively, nearly every single metric you cite in this masturbatory screed is wrong, and easily verifiable as wrong from even a cursory glance through this very subreddit, to say nothing of any of the actual subs for marginalized peoples. You constantly call the left lazy, you constantly say we aren't educating people, aren't fighting against fascism, you call us passive, when really, I think lazy ones are you centrists.If American progressives aren't fighting and aren't educating people, then how did abortion and weed measures pass damn near everywhere, even in blood red states? If they're pushing allies away, how were leftist, if not outright DemSoc policies being passed nearly every time they were made direct ballot measures? How were State Supreme Courts being flipped? You say there's no appetite for pragmatism in the American Left, but that doesn't bear out in any of the data collated so far. Spoiler votes were a rounding error and Progressives overwhelmingly turned out for Kamala. How is it their fault that centrists can't be bothered to learn, or more importantly, leverage, Intersectionality? Why should they tolerate underwhelming candidates, when underwhelming candidates are the reason the Democrats lost? You've mistaken frustration at the pace of progress and chosen to blame that for the Dems' loss over any of the objective factors that have been identified. You fetishize incrimentalism, sanitizing the often thankless, painful, and sometimes bloody work of advocacy. You have no concept of realpolitik or solidarity. I don't mind fighting in coalition with center leftists, or even centrists, but I'm not fighting Fascism with someone who doesn't even know how to fight.Bernie was right. You centrists love stealing our ideas and pretending you were allies all along, and the blaming us progressives the second things go south. Anything it takes to keep from looking inward.You want to see what Progressive Left \\"hard work\\" looks like? Look to the ACLU. Look to Spain and France and Germany. Look to California, to Minnesota, to fucking Texas of all places. To the Pink Pistols and the SRA and Redneck Revolt and the Black Panthers.Why would American Progressives join you?

Where the people had no say in how things were run. This was pretty much continued post-independence.  This is a historical anomaly since local governments were extremely strong historically. As per colonial surveys in the 19th century, India had one of the highest primary enrollment rates in the world. [Source - The Beautiful Tree by Dharamapal has a good collection of British Survey records]. The vast majority of students and teachers were usually from the lower castes as per the surveys and not the higher Brahmin castes. So if the fear was castism, it was ill-founded, at least when it comes to education.  My guess is that the post-independence govt. saw the British system as more bureaucratic and thus more advanced, even though in practice it sucked.

Saying theyre bad because they went overboard in the 70s is like saying corporations are bad because of Enron or something.So, Ill address your other claims after this, but the comparison is fundamentally misguided.Unions, unlike something akin to a corporation, are not a necessary institution for social function, and their going too far is not a phenomenon limited in space or time. It did not end in the 1970s, and it will never end, because the issues with unions are precisely what others will claim the benefits of unions are.Corporations are a means of individual citizens joining together in a business enterprise. The corporation as it currently exists need not be replicated, but something an awful lot like it will exist.In contrast, most jobs are not unionized. Most people dont need unions. The jobs where unions do exist are strongly correlated with government as the employer or funder of the project, suggesting some degree of state capture is a regular aspect of unionization. Unionized industries in the United States are less productive and receive less foreign investment. Construction and manufacturing unions are whiter even for their age than the general worker population. Furthermore, unions have impeded Americas green transition, attempted to keep manufacturing jobs out of the Black south and near their union strongholds, and have a de facto monopoloy on control of Americas ports. Teachers unions and police unions bear significant responsibility for the sorry-state of Democrat-run states, as they protect bad actor from punishmentlegal or employmment, promote unscientific and inefficient practices like seniority hiring and raises, interfere in public affairs while violating their duties, for example, phonics resistance among teachers or refusal to stop crimine among cops.Size-asymmetries in the labour bargaining process are real and important, and unions are the best way to compensate. Size asymetries are neither obviously a market failure nor obviously something which benefits the employer. Information loss occurs at size, and small employers can pay more for higher-quality employers. The difference in employer/employee bargaining power also occurs when there exists a real competition on the part of one side to get access to the other, and while businesses have the capital to persist in theory for far longer than an individual, this is a fallacy of personifying markets. And 19th-early 20th century unions played a crucial role in establishing worker rights.So did communists, but thats not an argument for their serving a good purpose today.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouchesFor fuck's sake","title":"Inside the Republican false-flag effort to turn off Kamala Harris voters"},{"text":"Hate that GeForce now introduced a 100 hour cap even on the paid tiers.

Black voters in North Carolina were told Democrats wanted to take away their menthol cigarettes, while working-class White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouches. **What voters had no way of knowing at the time was that all of the ads were part of a single $45 million effort created by political advisers to Tesla founder Elon Musk who had previously worked on the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), according to a presentation about the groups efforts obtained by The Washington Post.**","title":"Inside the Republican false-flag effort to turn off Kamala Harris voters"},{"text":"I don't remember seeing pro rent control stuff but haven't checked the discord in a while.

The Chinese state prioritized primary education over secondary/tertiary, while the Indian state did the opposite.Chinese primary enrollment rate passed India in 1950, secondary in 1975, and tertiary only in 2000![https://preview.redd.it/worcf03coy0e1.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45042147bb8c0f73af1022445a8a4add0574a4f6](https://preview.redd.it/worcf03coy0e1.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45042147bb8c0f73af1022445a8a4add0574a4f6)[https://preview.redd.it/9vtkf87eoy0e1.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92040124adc06dc89af8ff3b96174a4bee7b2ac0](https://preview.redd.it/9vtkf87eoy0e1.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92040124adc06dc89af8ff3b96174a4bee7b2ac0)(IMO, this is not the primary cause, the primary reason is that in India education is a state subject and the centre and the state prop up elite colleges from time to time.In China education is controlled by the local government which is better able to manage local schooling needs, take instant feedback to improve local schools and also ensure higher enrolment.In contrast, primary education in India is controlled at the lowest level by inefficient bureaucrats who are answerable to far away state governments and not the local government. So basically how British Raj Burecracy worked during the pre-Independence times.Chinese local governments are also funded by land value capture while Indian state governments are poorly funded by regressive taxes and the Local Governments receive an abysmal 3% of the total tax revenue. In China Local governments receive almost 50% of the revenue share, which is higher than even the most developed countries.The lack of primary education in India is the result of the deliberate handicap of local governments and not an outcome of any policy which prioritised one over the other)&amp;#x200B;b. India still produces more Master's degrees (but China has more doctorates, though it only surpassed India in the 2000s)[https://preview.redd.it/9o1pqvohoy0e1.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e38bfda4f42d999f159dc6387e701cfc12c51d8](https://preview.redd.it/9o1pqvohoy0e1.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e38bfda4f42d999f159dc6387e701cfc12c51d8)(IMO, since there are no manufacturing jobs in India \\\\[due to the cocktail of Labour Laws, Unionism and Licence Raj\\\\] people differentiate themselves from the competition in the job market by getting useless Arts degrees. While in China due to far more jobs being available, getting a master's is pointless unless you are truly aiming for higher education or a well-paying job.)&amp;#x200B;c. The same thing in teacher investment. Chinese pupil-teacher ratios passed India in 1950, secondary in 1970, and tertiary not at all.[https://preview.redd.it/zdontlfkoy0e1.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9235b70c89f119a63b7acfd9ede6d46d495030c](https://preview.redd.it/zdontlfkoy0e1.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9235b70c89f119a63b7acfd9ede6d46d495030c)[https://preview.redd.it/exl0ojvloy0e1.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=536e7d216e4f8bcb61d0039c2336ad59e9d974a2](https://preview.redd.it/exl0ojvloy0e1.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=536e7d216e4f8bcb61d0039c2336ad59e9d974a2)(No surprises here, China hasn't handicapped its own local governments and has thus far better state capacity. There is also better supply and demand elasticity for useful degrees and thus a proper number of teachers at the secondary and tertiary level.Tertiary education is useless for the vast majority of the population. India produces too many unemployable PhD, who just get a degree in anticipation of a scarce half-decent job and to pass the time in the meanwhile so that they can keep themselves occupied instead of sitting around doing nothing.)&amp;#x200B;d.

All due to the state shunning manufacturing. This restricts upward mobility for the vast majority of Indians who are stuck doing menial labour in farms or in the cities.)[https://preview.redd.it/2t5b9g9roy0e1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae33b98b655defc489aafde02aec3dac8babac22](https://preview.redd.it/2t5b9g9roy0e1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae33b98b655defc489aafde02aec3dac8babac22)[https://preview.redd.it/dlw5huxsoy0e1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87207f910c7bababe0cfb99f11b9f0f48e86b8c1](https://preview.redd.it/dlw5huxsoy0e1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87207f910c7bababe0cfb99f11b9f0f48e86b8c1)(Therefore, the poorer the state, the less likelihood of the student to pick a STEM degree.The Chinese are only getting degrees if they provide them with actual expertise. In India, due to the lack of a manufacturing sector, there is hardly any requirement for expertise or even basic vocational training)&amp;#x200B;Conclusion:IMO, India needs to do two things,Allow manufacturing through labour and bureaucratic reforms - This will create jobs and demand for quality STEM educationUse Land Value \\\\[or at least property taxation\\\\] to fund local governance. Most of the tasks of State governments, including Education, ought to be shifted to the local governments.Historically it was from India that Britain learned the Madras Method which helped raise primary enrollment in the UK.

It's written asThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to pro mote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Board of Governors shall consult with Congress at semiannual hearings before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives about the Board of Governors' and the Federal Open Market Committee's objectives and plans with respect to the ranges of growth or diminution of monetary and credit aggregates for the upcoming twelve months, taking account of past and prospective developments in production, employment, and prices. Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to require that such ranges of growth or diminution be achieved if the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee determine that they cannot or should not be achieved because of changing conditions.There is some serious creative interpretation to get from stable prices to exponential growth at 2%, the dual mandate was created during the 70s, stagflation. I do not see it surviving long in the post chevron era. You can reasonably argue that the mandate is for deflation at the rate of productivity growth, by keeping stable prices for land and labor, but arguments for permanent exponential inflation do not match either the letter or the spirit of the law.","title":"Harris got nearly as many votes as Biden 2020 in every battleground state.

Is the *relative* leftward shift of the Democratic elites because the Democrats shifted left in response to Trump, because the American voter shifted right to align with Trump or, more likely, some mixture of both?US voters also perceive the Democrats as having moved much further left than the Republicans have shifted right in recent years.Ah. But again, this seems to stem from Trump hoodwinking the US electorate:https://preview.redd.it/0yrf1wnxl11e1.jpeg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e7f5de819ea8234491e1a06273c33f6c54eb5cfThe decline begins before Trump is elected but that drop is precipitous around the time Trump becomes a political force.I think in general this is an interesting piece but it doesnt give the GOP enough agency. The fault in the relative leftward shift of the Democratic Party sits solely with the Democratic Party and not even partially with the GOP and Trump successfully shifting the Overton window rightward. Would be a much more compelling argument if JBM had made some effort to also show that the American electorate hadnt also moved rightwards.

You can drive on whatever side of the road you want. Extremes like this might work fine in a sparse farm community but not Manhattan or Beijing.The answer, as always, sits in between. A welfare state is necessary. But there needs to be a process to question the current validity of the current welfare practices. You do not arbitrarily commit 90% of your country's resources for 1% of the population.The difficulty with the welfare state is it does not have a p&amp;l statement.

Also the women I know who have had abortions have had multiple and it was a form of birth control. I have one woman I have known since my young teens. I am friends with her twin. As an adult this woman has had 5 abortions! All as a form of birth control and oh because she found out they were boys! She kept the 6th as it was a girl. A lot more of this scenario happens more than I think liberals want to admit. Im also a 20 year seasoned nurse who works in a Pacu at a level one trauma hospital. Ive seen plenty of d and c preformed because the baby is likely to have down syndrome and the mother doesnt want a disabled child. Now we have seen down syndrome individuals go on to have incredible lives with profound impact on this world and the people around them. To imply that those human beings would have been better off not existing is not for us to say IMO. I understand the need for a d and c for a missed abortion. Then baby is not viable and the mother hasnt completely passed the baby herself. This is an emergency and the mom will die of sepsis if a d and c is not preformed. Then again in that instance the baby has already died. I have also never known a woman who has gotten an abortion that doesnt regret it. It has had a huge impact on their lives down the road for these women. They struggle forever with the decision they made. As anyone should if you decide to end anothers life. Also, the liberals did this to themselves by constantly pushing the envelope. Having abortions wasnt good enough. They insist they have to be able to have them at any time of the pregnancy and for any reason. A good deal of people should and do have a problem with full term abortions. I am 45 years old and have never gotten pregnant by accident. It turns out having one partner and using birth control works very well.

It sounds a whole lot to me like you're just labeling any piece of media that isn't actively trying to overthrow every part of society as \\"conservative propaganda\\", which is obviously ridiculous. Not everything is political. Sometimes people just want to create something that is entertaining. Propaganda requires some level of intent to persuade.I don't think your exactly ready for gender trouble yet. See this is the problem with people who consume primarily liberal media. The total inability to even comprehend what the opposing argument is about. Both sides of this debate make perfect logical sense if you assume their philosophical argument is true. If a fetus isn't a person deserving of rights, then it makes no sense to limit abortions. If it is a person deserving of rights, you would have to be a psychopath to support killing it. The argument is about whether the fetus should have rights. That's the only thing in debate. It's really not that difficult of a concept to understand.I understand it. It seems you are just projecting whatever you think i believe onto me. Abortion relates to healthcare because abortion bans directly effect healthcare in real life. Secondly, arguments for abortion stem from personhood and bodily autonomy as well. They all have implications for healthcare since abortion is a procedure for medical complications.  This is simply incorrect. A neutrality bias implies that I'm giving up some level of objectivity to appear neutral. In my example, i maintained perfect objectivity in my rewording. The difference is that rather telling the reader what to believe using language loaded with negative connotation, I'm simply informing them and providing reasoning and evidence. A middle ground fallacy would mean I'm arguing the truth is in the middle of the opposing sides. My rewording explicitly states that one side is right and the other is wrong. The message is the same. It's just worded in a way to not immediately alienate any readers that are not already on your side.Framing it as not a conspiracy is bias. Its called false balance. Even if the news ultimately reports it as wrong, it still gives the topic more legitimacy it deserves.","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"The *BRITISH* mandate of Palestine?

That, along with the fact that most people are fine with older cars as well, and electric cars are regulated to being more of a luxury. The market will favor ICE for a really long time, especially if battery tech doesn't end up being economic after research and development. The only advantage of EVs is a slightly lower footprint(still emitting carbon through mining and factory production, as well as electricity production and usage) and excellent torque curves(outside of high rpm application). Most consumers don't really demand this, so EVs aren't in any position to dominate the market. Ps. Low maintenance is not an advantage when your several thousand dollar battery fails in two hundred thousand miles(or possibly less if you cheap out.) As well as all of your parts being much more expensive. I know plenty of ICE engines that last 300000 miles on a few hundred dollars of maintenance.

It sounds a whole lot to me like you're just labeling any piece of media that isn't actively trying to overthrow every part of society as \\"conservative propaganda\\", which is obviously ridiculous. Not everything is political. Sometimes people just want to create something that is entertaining. Propaganda requires some level of intent to persuade.That is quite literally what the abortion debate is about.See this is the problem with people who consume primarily liberal media. The total inability to even comprehend what the opposing argument is about. Both sides of this debate make perfect logical sense if you assume their philosophical argument is true. If a fetus isn't a person deserving of rights, then it makes no sense to limit abortions. If it is a person deserving of rights, you would have to be a psychopath to support killing it. The argument is about whether the fetus should have rights. That's the only thing in debate. It's really not that difficult of a concept to understand.This is the definition of neutrality bias. Not calling it a conspiracy commits the middle ground fallacy and sane washes the belief. It give more credibility to the issue when their is none.This is simply incorrect. A neutrality bias implies that I'm giving up some level of objectivity to appear neutral. In my example, i maintained perfect objectivity in my rewording. The difference is that rather telling the reader what to believe using language loaded with negative connotation, I'm simply informing them and providing reasoning and evidence. A middle ground fallacy would mean I'm arguing the truth is in the middle of the opposing sides. My rewording explicitly states that one side is right and the other is wrong. The message is the same.

He has a very sizeable base of people enraptured by his cult of personality, but it's not enough to win a national election.The demographic which swung for Trump this year were not hardline MAGAites, they were people who genuinely believe \\"the Democrats\\" (as a monolithic entity) had swung too far left, and were destroying the economy, personal liberties, and their livelihoods with their policies. Whether or not this is true, the Democrats need to give an olive branch to this group next election, rather than pandering to a progressive base that will never, *ever* be a swing demographic.This is a problem first-and-foremost with America's federal structure combined with its current high-discipline party system. Every swing voter looks at solidly Democrat-controlled states as an example for what America will look like under a Democratic presidency, when these states are frequently controlled by progressives and even somewhat authoritarian (by the standards of most swing states) governors who never have to make any compromises to the other side of the isle.In my opinion, the national Democrats need to more thoroughly decouple themselves from the actions of their state/local branches, and embrace a much more moderate-looking national agenda in order to win. A genuine, down-to-earth candidate running on a platform of gun *rights* and a clear classical-liberal/libertarian concept of \\"personal liberty and personal responsibility\\" (moderated by support of basic welfare and New Deal corporatist policies, of course) could win the deep south if the Republicans don't catch on, particularly if they're a figure who genuinely projects charisma and inspiration.","title":"Harris got nearly as many votes as Biden 2020 in every battleground state.

Kennedy did not travel to Samoa to attend the 57th Independence Celebrations until the summer of 2019, just a few months before the measles outbreak.  \\nCompounding matters for the worse, recent studies reveal that [Samoan children are malnourished](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37166449/), which was a suspected contributing factor to the outbreaks 1.45% case fatality rate.Researchers found that [Samoan children are deficient](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29877157/) in calcium, potassium, and vitamins A and E.Historically, mothers who acquired natural measles in childhood went on to confer excellent passive immunity to their babies, which protected those babies from measles infection until they were young adolescents. This is not the case for vaccinated mothers.The unforeseen consequence of vaccinating the globe for measles is that infants are no longer born with passive measles immunity, as immunity cannot be passed on by a vaccinated mother who lacks naturally-acquired antibodies.In 60 years of measles vaccination, infants under 12 months have shifted from being the most protected demographic to being the most at risk. This fact may also help to explain the very high mortality in Samoan infants.In addition, vaccination sites are often not sanitized against infectious disease, turning vaccine clinics into infection-spreading hot spots, rapidly accelerating infection rates. Jose Hagan, Immunization Specialist for the World Health Organization (WHO), suspected this paradoxical outcome was the case in Samoa. \\"This is a feature of almost every outbreak I've ever been a part of,\\" he told [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/18/these-babies-should-not-have-died-how-the-measles-outbreak-took-hold-in-samoa)in December 2019.Lastly, while the [D8 measles strain](https://reliefweb.int/report/samoa/national-measles-response-and-recovery-appeal-6-december-2019) was present in the outbreak, we do not know if D8 was the only strain, or if vaccine strain measles also played a role.Regardless, according to pediatrician and vaccinologist [Dr. Stanley Plotkin](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/221/10/1571/5610905?login=false), the D8 strain is \\"not as well neutralized by antibodies to the vaccine genotype.\\" In other words, it was not unexpected that the D8 strain that was circulating in the fall of 2019 could cause an outbreak in even highly vaccinated populations because researchers already knew that the vaccine is not as effective against D8.","title":"Trump just appointed RFKjr to run HHS."},{"text":"If you think someone's humanity is something that is debatable, you shouldn't be anywhere near any role where you could impact someone's life.

The killing curse instantly kills anyone it touches if she missed or Bellatrix dodged, Molly could kill a kid or friend. Molly used a precise spell hitting her directly in the heart, that probably wouldnt have killed an accidental target. The killing curse is unforgivable because its instantly jumping to lethal force which is almost never required in the wizarding world given all the options they have. Its the difference between self defense and intending to kill. Its also important to remember that the series is for ages 9-12. Its not surprising its messages are love is good killing is bad.

These sources are the alternative media, and are popular in part because they offer interesting and satisfying alternative perspectives and narratives to the official one. **But many people don't listen to or watch these podcasts and still generally believe the mainstream narratives.** And so in that sense it is still \\"Mainstream\\" even if it is less so than it used to be.Nothing here negates the narrative that non-legacy media is less popular than alternative media overall. since \\"facts have liberal bias\\" it is perceived as Left leaning. Frankly, this is ridiculous though. Idk that the proper term is truly liberal/ left-leaning, but rather the Mainstream Media is clearly and often pushing narratives on behalf of the D.C. establishment, and often for the Democratic Party specifically. For example, it was clear to pretty much everyone that Biden was mentally declining over the past few years and was not fit to be president for another 4 years (nothing to be ashamed of really).I never claimed  that the MSM was always correct or never biased. Also there are counter points to this. Firstly, almost all news channels underreported on both candidates mental decline. Futher more the MSM has also does stuff like report on bidens ''garbage'' comment to a significantly greater degree than any of trumps comments ever. here's a 0% chance that all of the facts would always support the liberal point of view- political issues are far too complex for that. The fact that Trump gets something like 95% + negative coverage on these media outlets while Biden/Kamala got like 90% positive coverage really can't logically be explained by just objective factual reporting. Sure Trump is plausibly wrong on some things and if it was more like a 60/40 split for Biden/Kamala then I think u could argue that it was unbiased, but a 90/10 split is ridiculous.Again, I never claimed  that the MSM was always correct or never biased. . This is also exactly what im taking about when I say neutrality bias. The MSM has sane washed trump by even comparing him to Harris. It is absolutely the case that weighted based on good/bad things trump/ harris has done is easily a 90/10 split. Haris is a run of the mill liberal candidate with some blunders.

The problem is that the supposed left wing party in the US, at best, played lip service to these things and failed to meaningfully incorporate those priorities in their platform. Worse still, Biden and later Harris moved to the right on several of these issues in an ill-guided attempt to woo away so-called conscientous Republicans away from Trump leaving many on the left feeling like they weren't wanted in the party that, on paper, is supposed to represent them.As for why Biden+Harris did that... money. Not outright bribes per se but, thanks to certain SCOTUS rulings about money in politics, it's basically mandatory to have things like pacs/super pacs to support a national level candidacy. That money largely comes from lobbyists, corporations, and the wealthy, all groups that benefit from the status quo that left wing political discourse believes that it is necessary to disrupt.They made a bet that these policies would peel away more Republicans from Trump than they'd lose from their own base and they lost that bet hard. You'd think they'd learn after Hillary, and Kerry before her, made the same gambit and lost their presidential runs for the same reasons.Ironically, the same forces that prevent the Dems from going \\"too far left\\" may help contain Trump to some degree, basically, he'll be able to do whatever he wants as long as it doesn't affect the bottom line of our oligarchs.Problem with that system is that the status quo is unsustainable, infinite financial growth in a finite world is a pipe dream. Everyone always hears about how well the economy is doing but the average person feels like they're just keeping their head above the water, too much of our supposedly amazing economy that both parties dote over only benefits the rich. And that is why our politics are so unstable, a lot of people have decided that if the left isn't going to save us from the system then they'd be just fine with having Trump tear it all down.Things like race, gender, and sexual orientation tend to get more air time from our representatives because they both motivate people to vote but ultimately don't affect the bottom line of the wealth class (of which every politician, CEO, and person on the TV is part of) whereas the class issues almost never get talked about even though 90% of the population feels the resulting problems in their daily lives and that is by design. In a nutshell, the reason why in American politics it always looks like disparate groups are engaged in multiple zero sum struggles with each other is because our ruling class/wealthy elites are actively manipulating the animousity of these groups to prevent them from uniting against the elites in a full on class struggle. Better they fight each other than us is the thinking behind this plan.Anyway, sorry for the trip to Narnia (honestly, even this is a gross oversimplification) but sometimes I feel like there's a lot of context to American politics that people from the outside looking in don't have.","title":"Jasmine Crockett Lays Bare The Stunning Hypocrisy Of Trump's Unqualified Picks"},{"text":"Even discounting the forbidden topic, Rowling was still pretty awful on slavery, minority metaphors, Eurocentrism, antisemitism, etc. and covered it with shallow and forgotten platitudes.

The problem here is that the news that they try to portray as \\"straight\\" is filled with heavily biased framing. For example a mainstream news outlet might say something about how Kamala Harris supports \\"reproductive rights\\" or \\"women's access to healthcare\\", ignoring the fact that this is not what the abortion debate is about. This would be the equivalent of saying Kamala Harris supports murdering children. It presupposes a conclusion to the philosophical argument which is the actual crux of the debate. In a similar, but more subtle fashion, they will often just direct quote a politician or public figure, but when that person frames something from a right-wing perspective, they will often \\"add context\\" by inserting a line about the alternative perspective . On the other hand, when something is framed from a left-wing perspective, like the one I mentioned above, there is rarely any alternative shown.2. If you truly believe that your side is objectively in the right, then you should be able to present both sides of an argument in good faith and walk the reader logically to that conclusion. Not doing this is objectively bad for you. When a neutral/uninformed party reads your news article, which claims to be neutral and objective, but then finds out that it was framed in a misleading way or misrepresented the opposing argument, you lose a lot of credibility in their eyes, even if your side turns out to be right. Similarly, you should ideally want people from the opposing side to read your neutral and objective article, and framing it in such a way that presupposes their currently held beliefs as wrong is likely to immediately alienate them, and send them to a source that reinforces their beliefs. For example, if you want to actually convince people that believe the 2020 election was stolen by voter fraud, it will do you know good to refer to them as \\"voter fraud conspiracy theories\\". The buzzwords do nothing but gain you some extra applause from your existing audience. You can maintain objectivity and alienate fewer people with something like, \\"alleged voter fraud that evidence has shown would not have swung the election\\" with a link to another (opinion-free) article that runs through the evidence. The issue is that these publications simply cannot help themselves from inserting some sort of framing device or opinion into nearly every article.3. It is finally starting to die out, but they are for now, definitely still the mainstream. They are the outlets that everyone else refers back to. Among people over 30, they are viewed as the most credible. They have the most funding. They are what you will see at the airport, in the newspaper, in your google feed and searches, on the YouTube front page, in your windows task bar. Basically anywhere that you're getting news without explicitly searching for something alternative, you are getting legacy media.4.The user base of certain platforms is not what makes the platform itself biased. Twitter used to be very left-wing biased. After Elon bought it, it is mostly unbiased and basically allows anything that is legal. If liberals choose to cede that ground on that platform because they don't want to have to actually defend their viewpoints and convince people, that is on them. Youtube, while it allows some diversity in its content, still has a prety left-leaning bias. It participates in shadow-banning of right wing ideas, and it specifically chooses to promote left-wing news sources more prominently, even to people with no interest in them, while right wing news sources are generally only shown to people who actively seek it out.  Again, if you actually believe your side to be objectively in the right, then you should be able to convince the majority of the population without resorting to any censorship, or hiding of opposing viewpoints. 5. Media is a reflection of culture and what people find entertaining. A movie having gender roles, norms, and status quo isn't \\"propaganda\\". It's just a normal movie meant to appeal to normal people. Status quo is just that. It's the baseline, starting off point. Not every piece of media is a political statement. If you think otherwise, and that status quo is propaganda for the opposition, you are the very definition of a radical. Most movies are just meant to entertain people. The things you listed are nonpolitical and gain more viewership and sales. The left wing movies insert preachy political topics that very few actual customers want, and results in fewer viewers and sales, and are included to push a political message, not to make a better movie. Also, conservative workers/actors in Hollywood are at real risk of being ostracized/blacklisted/fired for their political beliefs. This simply isn't the case with liberals. I do agree with you, though, on the glorification of war/torture/police brutality in war/crime movies. I cringe every time I see a show/movie try to portray violating a prisoner's fourth amendment rights as a good thing","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"The values are hardly all that important.
