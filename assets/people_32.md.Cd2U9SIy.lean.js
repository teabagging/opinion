(Note that I don't believe in all of them as the right thing to do.)1. More austerity during the COVID pandemic. It would have hurt a lot of people who were out of jobs but inflation would be a bit lessened during the recovery. Although this is a really hard one, there was no easy way out of the economic aftermath of COVID due to lockdowns and supply disruptions. Obviously, Dems were really in a hard place here in regards to inflation and they did a good job overall so I can't be too harsh here. But it really does seem like Americans prefer layoffs to higher grocery prices.\\n2. Crack down hard on immigration. Would be cruel to the vast amounts of asylum seekers in the aftermath of the pandemic, but Americans seem to consistently want it.\\n3. Bully State and local governments about housing. Keep talking about housing supply importance until the whole conversation has shifted. The idea of tax credits for local governments who loosen zoning? Great, just too little too late.\\n4. This is more for local Democrats but they really need to address the petty crime problem in cities. Yes, overall violent crime is subsiding, but San Francisco-esque lenient policies on drugs, public homelessness, and theft are simply not popular.\\n5. Pander to men. Loudly say \\"men's rights matter!\\" and \\"we need to talk about men's issues!\\" If you want to get more substantive (which isn't necessary), can bring up men falling behind in education and how to bring them up. To be fair there was a little of this from Walz with a nice emphasis on boosting trade schools.\\n6. Come up with more catchy slogans! \\"We're not going back!\\" was good but needs to be more of them focused on a specific policy (drill baby, drill). It can be a huge oversimplification, that's fine.\\n7. Repeatedly denounce the most fringe \\"woke\\" stuff. It's not enough to just not associate with these people.   Kamala didn't really engage in that much identity politics this time around. But people in their right-wing misinformation bubbles believe that what any random leftist does represents the Dems, so we need politicians to call those people out. And might even have to throw in some \\"I'm not a fan of DEI\\" or \\"let's keep women's sports to women\\".\\n8. Frame the foreign policy into an \\"America First\\" dynamic. Americans don't care about what's going on the other side of the world. Now, it's very important to not let Ukraine fall to Russia, but they need to frame this issue as 'sticking it to the Russian commies' instead of saving Ukrainian lives. Maybe even lie that Russia is coming to attack the U.S. Now as for Israel, an arms embargo was actually was a highly favorable position in multiple polls. While it might upset some older Republicans, it seems that increasingly even right-wingers don't give a fuck about \\"protecting Israel\\" so it might be time to loosen the cord, while simultaneously boosting enthusiasm among the young leftist base (and winning Michigan).\\n9. Go on all the podcasts and Twitch streams and Youtube videos. Yes that includes Rogan and all the right-wing manosphere podcasts. The idea that you are \\"Platforming\\" these ghouls is misguided-- they are already far too entrenched in society. This is the way we re-capture the younger vote especially among men. Traditional news media doesn't cut it anymore.\\n10. Literally just talk shit about the opponents more. It was working, and then Trump got nearly assassinated and then they backed off. But civility isn't the answer anymore.

Racists, misogynists and homophobes.

No, I'm brilliant. He just has to mess with me. Example, I had to research a project before I completed it but it was still relatively timely. He told me to stop trying to be \\"Rembrandt\\" and work faster. The next day when he opened his email and saw the SCOPE of the work my research had spawned ... he asked me a bit in awe \\"how did you DO this?\\". I was still pissed and snapped \\"because I AM Rembrandt!\\" Nah, he didn't know what to say, but that's the kind of shite we got in the art department. No, it wasn't just me he picked on ... Two black people in the building, both of us women and two other artists... he has no respect for artists either. This shite has been going on forever and most people turned their backs and pretended they didn't see/hear anything ... and then wondered why we would get pissed.

I can't even thank you sarcastically... I'm so pissed. I had to have this talk with my kids AND my grand kids. My mum was raped and so was I and one of my sisters. No not all at once.

It was somehow my fault? I was naive ... thought my next boss would appreciate the truth. Didn't get that or the next two jobs I applied for until someone told me to take that place off of my resume. I could tell you 62 years worth of stuff like this ... but my life wasn't unique. These are things that many if not most of us have to live and have had to. A few of you ... Like you shoesandhose actually CARE, but for the most part I've found that most white people just wish we'd shut up and go away. HENCE THE VOTES WE JUST SAW.

That is simply backwards. A LARGE number of Hispanic voters SUPPORT that agenda. Why? Because while the joke was that Trump said illegal immigrants take \\"Black jobs,\\" the truth is that illegal immigrants' primary competition for jobs are?*other Hispanic workers*?who are?*legal*. They are the main ones who believe illegal immigrants are taking their jobs and that's why Hispanic men dramatically shifted to solidly supporting Donald Trump in 2024 55%-43% and overall Trump won an unprecedented level of Hispanic support at 46%, a number unheard of for a GOP Presidential candidate.

Now. I know you want prices to go back to how they were.  But inflation doesn't work that way.  The prices are now fixed and yes. That hurts.  But the only way to decrease the price is to have deflation which means we have a massive recession and we don't want millions more to lose jobs.  What we need is for wages to catch up to inflation. In the meantime we are going to work at bringing inflation down, but again the prices won't come down, they just will increase year over year at a slower pace so wages can catch up.  To do that we are gonna increase interest rates to slow down spending.  This will hurt for a bit but won't cause a recession.  So it's a better plan, but no you won't see immediate relief.\\"Into a lawn sign. The frustration is that people who do understand this are tired of seeing the country be placed into the toilet because people don't understand any of this.

This group is predominantly represented by unvaccinated people because those who are not vaccinated are far more likely to experience such long-term effects. In this subset, the vaccinated people experiencing long-term cognitive effects still perform better on tests of cognition compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. In other words, in the minority of cases when a vaccinated person experiences these effects, the impact is less severe than it would be if they were unvaccinated.Vaccination significantly mitigates this risk by making such long-term effects much less likely to occur in the first place. As the second link noted, severity and duration of illness are the main contributing factors that lead to decreased cognitive performance, and both of those factors are substantially mitigated by vaccination.People who are fully vaccinated and up to date on all of their boosters are unlikely to develop any long-term symptoms, including decreased cognitive performance. Here is a study showing the significant benefits of vaccination in curbing the likelihood of long-term symptoms: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaccination-dramatically-lowers-long-covid-risk/ Another piece of good news from this study is that the current variants appear less likely to inflict long-term effects on cognition compared to the strains circulating in the early stages of the pandemic: \\"Multiple findings indicated that the association between Covid-19 and cognitive deficits attenuated as the pandemic progressed. We found smaller cognitive deficits among participants who had been infected during recent variant periods than among those who had been infected with the original virus or the alpha variant.\\"All of this is to say that while I agree COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to unvaccinated people, it has been largely mitigated as a threat to the vast majority of vaccinated people. There will always be vaccinated folks who are still at risk because of their age, immunocompromised status, etc., but for most folks, the current strains of COVID-19 will cause mild illness at the very most, with a low likelihood of long-term symptoms. Thanks to the power of science, most vaccinated people don't need masks or other mitigation measures under most circumstances.","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"I'm in","title":"No man will touch me until I have my rights back: why is the 4B movement going viral after Trumps win?"},{"text":"This is what lack of education does to a mf country","title":"Exit polls about the economy clues why Trump won over Harris"},{"text":"Rules, rights, laws, procedures and norms mean nothing.

We are then told that our complaints about men (particularly white men) and the patriarchy are the reasons why men become radicalized by people like Peterson, Musk, and Rogan, creating this impossible to win feedback loop. Because men are fundamentally unable or unwilling to recognize the inequality throughout society, and see any potential solution to that (like DEI initiatives) as a threat to them rather than an assist for us, it is basically pointless to try to even engage with them anymore. We are not just scared of getting pregnant, we are giving up fundamentally on men being allies to us in any way. We are protecting ourselves medically, yes, but also mentally and emotionally.

Additionally, the assertion that the good people stayed home implies a moral superiority that can alienate potential allies who may feel disenfranchised or disillusioned with the political process. Instead of viewing the divide as a battle between good and evil, it might be more productive to engage in dialogue that seeks to understand the underlying issues driving peoples beliefs. This approach could foster a more inclusive conversation and encourage participation from those who feel marginalized by the current political discourse.

Justices are supposed to listen to constitutional arguments and interpret the law themselves. The job of the Chair is to run meetings, that's what it means to be a chair. Also to give speeches. The Vice Chair of the Fed is actually a very notable trade economist. The most important meetings the Chair, or in his absence, the vice chair run are FOMC meetings, which is a committee that decides on interest rates, and that committee generally has several PhD economists on it and is advised by departments upon departments of other PhD economists. Powell's qualifications academic and non-academic qualifications are actually quite good. A lot of modern fed policy relies on macropru, which are legal regulations it takes a lawyer to understand. He's also worked in investment banking and economic policy for about 30 years, so he's probably picked up a thing about economics. Not only that, he's been on the board of the fed for a decade.

This is because modern US domestic politics is fundamentally a game of dividing up the plunder that foreign policy secures. \\nThis plunder arrives in the form of persistent federal govt budget deficits which are maintained via the exorbitant privilege of the US dollars position as global reserve currency, an arrangement forced upon the rest of the globe in the ashes of the world wars of last century.\\nImageSince WW2, this unilateral global arrangement has been maintained through a mixture of brute force, monopoly control of global institutions, and a healthy dose of quid pro quo with its junior partners that comprise the western world.ImageImageImageIn the same way that domestic politics is downstream of foreign policy, US elections are downstream of real disagreements amongst factions within the US bourgeoisie. The two political parties represent the diverging PR strategies by which empire is sold to the underclasses. The increasing polarization of mainstream domestic politics can thus be attributed not to the rise of social media, foreign interference, or other facile explanations liberal pundits offer, but rather to a real divergence in imperial strategy given life by partisan jockeying. Historically, the factions comprising this divide have been the domestic bourgeoisie+petit bourg. elements on one side and the financial/international bourg. on the other.Until recently, the former was given political form by the GOP, the latter by the Dems. \\nBut over the past year, the tech giants that account for a sizable portion of Dem party backing appeared to switch sides and coalesce their support behind Trump.What caused this sudden shift?ImageIn a word: ChinaFor years, China represented both a massive labor and manu. hub for US outsourcing, and a massive consumer market for US-branded goods.But recentlyC-accelerated by US tariffs and the pandemicC-Chinese-branded goods have begun out-competing those from the US.ImageImageAs a result, Silicon Valleywhich has historically seen their interests best served by Dem-led foreign policyare now casting their lot with Trump and his more openly hostile stance toward China.ImageImageMusks open campaigning for Trump really only makes sense in light of his (correct) anticipation that Chinas domestic manufacturers will rapidly overtake Tesla as the worldwide leader in EVs.ImageImageImageThus, in just a few years, Americas tech giants have shifted from seeking to maintain China as a market and manufacturing hub, to finding themselves facing a formidable competitor. In this way, they are now in a similar position the US domestic bourg. faced decades prior. With both major factions in US capital now under increasing threat of competition from the same source, capital is unified in backing the horse they believe has the winning strategy: open confrontation with China. American liberals have largely failed to notice this sudden alignment of capital behind Trump because their lofty rhetoric serves only to obscure their own view of US imperial policy and are thus unable to understand the source of the apparent decay. Liberals didnt dislike Bush because he killed a million Iraqis, but because of the gaffs and embarrassment he brought to the office. He struck a blow at the heart of liberal identity, which is heavily tied to a perceived sense of respectability of US empire. Trump does the same.ImageImageBut from the perspective of the rest of the world, the neoliberal era was the aberration.Trump represents a return to an era of more honest US politics without the sneering veneer of respectability liberals value. An era of open hostility to secure naked self-interest. Contrary to what frustrated liberal pundits will assert tomorrow, Americans as a whole aren't \\"dumb\\", which is often a lazy way of accusing groups of voting against their own self-interest. Trump voters are *very aware* of what they are getting with Trump. \\nLiberals may pull out their hair and point toward Trumps unapologetic self-interest as proof of his unsuitability for the role.But this self-interest is exactly what his voters ordered, and hope he will deliver. \\nIt has been said that liberalism is capitalisms lying smile, fascism is capitalisms honest fists.Americans have once again voted for the fists, and this time, it appears they have a majority of US capital behind them.","title":"Interesting thread: @bidetmarxman: The rise of Trump and Trumpism cannot be fully explained without first recognizing how, over the last two decades, American politics has been shaped by the rise of China. ??"},{"text":"No its everyones problem.

People blaming incumbency disadvantage, public (mis)understanding of inflation or liberals being too woke aren't necessarily wrong, but they don't really offer a roadmap to how to win back votes, whereas looking at areas of bad governance is actually proactive. \\nI think this analysis actually explains the rightwards shift in Europe too. Poor governance, with results that are immediately visible/tangible when going to a city centre make for poor electoral results.I also think that there's a complete dearth of bold ideas in  Western politics. Trump's bold ideas are stupid, but they are nonetheless bold ideas. This sits in contrast to most center to left types who either offer more of the same (which reads as basically doing nothing) or seem frightened of their own shadows. Where is the creativity, leadership and follow through?I go into the city centre and the number of empty shopping units is staggering, yet I almost never hear of any way of fixing it. People cite Internet shopping and say the market has decided that it's untenable for retail. If that's the case then use the space for something else, slash rates for start ups, or give to the NHS for some local service or give it to the University to start a botany project that visitors could enjoy or even give it to a local art college as a project, etc etc. I know some of these are unfeasible, but omfg I just want someone to do SOMETHING to provide incentives to stop cities turning into shitholes.","title":"Best piece Ive seen on why democrats lost"},{"text":"Why is he bad?

Go to a gun range that allows you to rent out different firearms. Try out at least three different at calibers and sizes. If you are a woman, you are going to get talked down too about what is a womans gun and other bullshit. Honestly, if you get any phrase of this is a good womans gun, go find another range or person to talk too. Theres no such thing as a womans gun and a mans gun.A smaller and lighter firearm might seem like a good idea at first, but remember, Newton is a motherfucker. In order to move a 5 gram piece of metal 1,000 feet per second is a lot of energy and will be put into your hand. The more massive (weighty) the firearm, the less felt recoil. Of course, heavier it is (weighty) the more difficult it is to carry.You will be hearing a lot of bullshit about recommendations. If any of them suggest .40 cal, ignore it. .40 cal is a horrible round to shoot no matter the platform. Try something in 9mm and .380 ACP. Hell, you might like a .45 ACP, but those tend to be much heavier platforms. Try out as much as you can afford before buying. If you dont like to shoot it, its useless for you.Speaking of shooting it, learn to shoot it. Learn how to clear failures. Keep it clean and well oiled. Practice, practice, practice. Drawing, aiming and shooting needs to be second nature if you are going to carry. Learn to shoot off eye, in your weak hand, how to operate with one hand, etc. plan for the the fucking worst.Ignore all discussion about stopping power. A lot of it is a bunch of bullshit for people to promote their favorite caliber (mine is .45 ACP) but anything stronger than .22 LR will do. .22 LR will stop someone, but itll take a bit longer. All of the common calibers these days will do the job. .38, .380, 9mm, .357, .40, .45 will all take care of what it needs to take care of - just know if you have to use it, the human body is more resilient than you think, so empty the fuck out of that cylinder or magazine.For the love of fucking god, do not get Taurus, especially their Judge line, doubly so in .410, triply so in airweight. That fucking thing is an abomination and is not pleasant or fun to shoot.Know how to take apart and service your firearm. Youll find the lube youll like best for your firearm (and your firearm likes best, this is a different discussion), use it. But also have back ups, and know what it can use in the worse case scenario. Run them in that scenario to see how long you can run like that. Glocks can handle damn near anything given to them.

This may sound like the same thing, but reducing the interest rate on the cost of homes substantially decreases the monthly mortgage payment, reducing the cost of the home every month, and over the life of the home. For example, the mortgage payment for a $400,000 house, with a 10% down payment at an interest rate of 8% would be $3,216.55 a month for 30 years ($1,120,608.89 total payments if only paying the minimum monthly payment).? The same house, with a 3% down payment would be $2,092.77 monthly ($708,398.83 total payments if paying the minimum monthly payment.)Lower monthly mortgage payments can also lead to lower rent prices. Most people that rent out property try to price it high enough to pay off the mortgage and expenses. This allows them to gain wealth by growing the asset, while maximizing expense deductions and keeping the property occupied. They lose money quickly when it is vacant. (a lot of my tax clients purchase property to rent out, very few of them make much money at the end of the year, it is all about building the asset that can be later borrowed against, or sold.)Another way to drop the cost of housing, is to make the price of housing rise slower than inflation. Essentially, your dollars have less buying power as inflation increases. This is why when comparing prices over long periods of time, they will almost always adjust for inflation. By simply reducing the regulations for builders (one of trumps plans) this will increase the supply of houses and reduce the cost as builders will need to invest less time and manpower in meeting those regulations. People prefer to buy new houses, if there is a large increase in the availability of new houses, then pre-owned houses will stay on the market longer, which will cause the seller to either reduce the price or wait to sell. As many of them may sell to take advantage of buying a new house, they will have incentive to drop their price to sell faster.?Finally, his plan of deporting the illegal immigrants (since this post is about Trump supporters engaging in magical thinking, then it should be noted, that being against this policy does not change the effect it will have) will free up more housing, which will also go on the market.With an increase of new housing, an increase of previously occupied housing, and a drop in the interest rate, the cost of housing can decrease without any magic needed. ?","title":"CMV: Housing prices can only drop substantially if we have a depression"},{"text":"Fuck the USCCB.","title":"Donald Trump Under Pressure from Catholic Church on Mass Deportation Plan: We are for a wise policy towards immigrants and therefore one that does not go to these extremes"},{"text":" \\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an analysis published in mid-October.

I initially thought it was bad and everything should be done within a couple hours but questioned what the purpose would be. The electoral college vote doesnt get certified until Jan anyway. Why the rush? You could maybe argue having some kind of line to figure out which candidate should start the transition of power. I think the big argument out timeliness is in fact election security. Can be a double edge sword. Forcing a faster or more deliberate slower process can both have security issues. Forcing faster you may not be able to catch irregularities, could be a shittier process and people make more mistakes. No process or system gets better in a time condensed situation. On the other side, slower process and you have time on your side. You could see how things are going and possibly influence the results. I feared this in Philadelphia. I thought there was maybe a chance they were intentionally withholding reporting to see if they needed to generate some additional ballots. Majority of these places did revamp the way elections were held compared to 2020. Just too many questions. I think there is a lot of merit in the possible fraud of the 2020 election.

Life is conservative by nature and by conservative I do not mean in a political sense, I mean all life is slow to change and adapt over time. There absolutely is a backlash to sudden abrupt change by a majority of organisms. We are no different and it's the offensive accusations, labeling and offensive rhetoric that is all over the media and here on reddit that is causing an equal and opposite reaction. It's not right when they do it and it's equally not right when we do it. One reddit responded to one of my comments with, \\"America needs to fix its whiteness problem.\\" Imagine how people feel when they read that? I think they know very well because it's likely the same way people feel when they hear, \\"America needs to fix its gay problem.\\" It's not acceptable when they say it and it shouldn't be acceptable when we say it.

Jfk was an anomaly because they figured him wrong in thinking the blackmail material they had on him would make him bend the knee. Well the guy was a shitty husband but a true patriot. Moved to get away from the federal reserve and the central banking cartels, wouldn't play along with creating military conflicts with Cuba and Vietnam. It got him and his brother targeted by a state hit put together by the Dulles brothers. An argument could be made that Trump was also an anomaly in 2016 and after he won in a upset because he wasn't viewed as a serious threat to actually win. Then he was targeted by the intelligence community for conspiring with Russia to steal that election and faced multiple impeachments and legal issues.

Harris wasn't being condescending with her housing plan. There was a fox interview with Harris and Bret Baier. Brett Baier tried to get her to say bad things about Trump supporters and she refused to do that. I don't believe that she's condescending. I've seen YouTube shorts and things that take her out of context and make her look awful, but she's really not whenever you look at it in context. I see a lot of videos like that taking all kinds of different Democrats out of context or acting like they don't want to answer a question when they did that's a classic one. Nobody is gonna be able to fix the housing crisis instantly, nobody. It's gonna take a lot of investment and local cooperation. I just disagree with the whole vibe of the post which is commenting like they're American when they have the Europe flair btw which I find odd. Trump also has no housing plan btw. If there is one I'm mistaken, I would love to see that information. I live in the actual sticks and I hear people say shit like that all the time and it doesn't really bother me because I don't think like that. People probably should avoid talking like that.I feel like an outcast in my own community often enough. I think a lot of the people have good hearts and they're afraid of a changing less white America. People casually drop the N word here and also hate Mexicans. I've been called a r--- traitor for supporting BLM, because I don't think it's right to kneel on a man's neck until he's dead when you got how many officers standing there watching a man die.Most the people where I'm from just go with the flow of republicanism. I see most people just vote like their parents. I see the culture of what people say and you should hear what they say about the Democrats. I've been physically threatened by Trump supporters simply for challenging them in a civil way on things that are absolutely farcical. They talk about how Joe Biden doesn't want oil anymore and he's trying to stop drilling. I challenged that and said the oil production was at an all-time high and I was told I was a dumbass. I tried to explain to a trump supporter that tariffs we would be passed along to us the consumer, and it could even hurt our jobs because we import parts from foreign sources. I was told I didn't know what the f I was talking about. I don't come at people in a condescending way, but it doesn't matter what you say to some people, they take any challenge of the narrative as hostility. I'm open to civil discussion. I'm open to having my views challenged.

I watched a trial with subtitle translation, occurring in Afghanistan right after the recent American withdrawal. Immediately, the US installed judge was removed and the community put a local expert on the Koran and Sharia law in his place. A woman came to court claiming her husband had been killed, she thinks by his brother, but didn't know, but his brother was asserting he had a right marry her. Her position was that she had never learned to read, because she obeyed the law, but was certain she remembered hearing that the Koran demands she return to her father's house until such time he could find her a suitable man to marry, and that this is what she wanted because her father chosen her husband and she loved him, so she trusted her father to choose a good man again. The brother of her dead husband was cavalier about how it had always been the tradition in the region that when his brother dies, he has a right to take her as his wife if he chooses. The judge condemned him harshly, because he could read, and ignored the Koran and Sharia law, and was there making his case based on a heathen regional traditional practice. He complimented the woman for remember what Allah commands, even though she could not read the command itself, and for coming to the court to see it carried out. He told her father not to worry about this man, and if anyone present should see him trying to ignore the court's order to seize him and bring him before the court immediately, then he sent them on their way. He had his bailiffs bring a man recently convicted of shoplifting in and had his punishment carried out, cut off an arm. He told the man he may return home or to his brother's house, and he may have his brother's things because he had no evidence he had killed his brother and no reason to believe there was a another living person with a better claim to his estate, but warned him not to steal what is rightfully her father's until such time she is rightfully her husband's, after one is chosen and a marriage occurs, because he will be treated as a thief and it'd be hard to get away with it with so many present.I'd call that justice. It's certainly not a system I'd want to live within, but there is an objective rule that is to be obeyed, an impartial arbiter of disputes according to that rule, and far greater faith and compliance in the rule and it's arbiter among the community that will honor the decisions and bring any contempt or violation they witness back before the court.
