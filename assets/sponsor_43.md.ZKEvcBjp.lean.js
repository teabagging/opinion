Nothing has changed materially that would suggest 2024 will be otherwise.This is false actually. The things that have changed is that polling groups have changed the weights they apply to their predictions for Trump support in order to compensate for their underpredictions in the past. Also, Democrats have been outperforming polls since 2020. Why is that? Because pollers give higher credence to \\"likely voters\\", which generally means older Americans. Which demographic has shown an increase in turnout since the downfall of Roe? Young women who are first or second-time voters. This is the exact opposite of why Trump outperformed the polls in 2016 and 2020: because low propensity voters showed up in droves for him. That doesn't mean that he won't still win, but pollsters *have attempted* to correct for the mistakes of the past, but if the electoral environment has changed again (because Roe), then their new predictions could once again be miscalibrated.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is highly likely to win the upcoming General Election in a couple weeks"},{"text":"Hey, fellow red stater!

In fact, the idea of placing fervent loyalists in positions of great power throughout the Federal government and weaponizing the state seems to indicate to me an ideological strengthening. Moreover, I think the Republican Party would actually be enthusiastic about expanding the States footprint if in doing so allowed them to better enforce and mandate their ideologies.

You are saying that people shouldnt vote for the lesser evil, or at least you dont think its good. But you also say that abstaining ones vote isnt the solution. Im saying that voting lesser evil is treading political water at best, but more likely just drifting to the right but not in a direct manner. Treading water while the tide is going out is maybe the way to put it.Who are people supposed to vote for then? Yes! Exactly. Personally in the near term, anyone who dont want the choice of status quo (on the edge of fascism every 4 years or so) or fascism need to try and figure out how to make a new political dynamic. Vote blue isnt moving the needle and I think the inside strategy of DSA or the squad has run into its limits. A generic progressive party like the Greens doesnt have a real base, its just a collection of not-Democrat liberals or progressives (and some hippie kooks after the mid 2000s tbh.) So my undeveloped idea is a party based more on groups of people like renters and housing activists, more militant labor, marginalized groups left out of the political mainstream.This is more like how the late 1800s and early 20th century left was organized not on ideas but on a social basis. German and Yiddish and Italian language socialist press and their communities along with progressive populist small farmers along with militant labor unions etc. That was more how the Socialist Party and IWW functioned. And no, they are not perfect, any candidate is not perfect.Your view no longer makes any sense to me. Theres no such thing as a perfect candidate, especially in a two party system like the United States. The best candidate will always be the lesser evil.\\nPurity is a red herring argument, no actual leftist who organizes is pure do you think everyone in my union is a socialist some are even weird conservatives who somehow cant see the disconnect but could be convinced to go on strike because personal experiences sometime weigh more than things you hear in the news and just uncritically accept.I might have voted for Sanders if he made it to the general election (he was out of the race in the primaries by the time it got to my state I even registered Democrat for the first time just to try and vote for him in the primary didnt get that far (so yall are ok with this level of spam and junk mail? I was a Democrat for like 3 months and I dont think Ill ever be unsolicited for donations for the rest of my life!)Nader I was not personally impressed with, he is more liberal than Sanders. But since I do want a left opposition party in the US, he was a compromise.

He's defining common traits of fascism which is subtly different.  In this wikipedia article you linked to, a quote stood out to me regarding the 14 points he outlines: He argues that it is not possible to organise these into a coherent system, but that \\"it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it\\".I think what ultimately this means is that these are all generalities that commonly appear in the fascist view point. But Eco wrote this based on his personal experience, and I think that to some extent he meant to isolate things he saw in his experience. I think that there are things that need to accompany all of these elements. Just because a number of these elements appear, does not mean that fascism has occurred. It depends on what actions come from them. Fascism describes a certain type of political power, so Eco's elements need to be wielded in line with a fascist dictatorship in order to count in that way. Just because there are some symptoms, does not mean that the same disease exists. A headache, fever, cough, soar throat could apply to allergies, a cold, the flu, covid, lung cancer, and a whole host of other diseases. Let me twist something to make a point here. Recently Kamala Harris's campaign released a video aimed at men, with the message that real are not afraid to let a woman lead. If you look at Eco's elements, number 10, \\"contempt for the weak\\" might apply here, because it is basically implying that only weak men would not support Harris. But let me twist it even further; if you wanted to take all these points, you could argue that the Climate Change movement movement is fascistic, or cult like; take your pick. (I don't think it is but as a thought experiment, let me illustrate my point). * 1. \\"**The cult of tradition**\\" - Eco specifically points out that no new learning can occur, which is inline with the concept of settled science.\\n* 3. **\\"The cult of action for action's sake\\" -** Much of climate activism is not very clear about what the specific remedies should be, but for now it is understood that we need to move and move quickly. \\n* 4. **\\"Disagreement is treason\\"** \\\\- In the immortal words of climate activist Greta Thunberg \\"How dare you!\\" The climate crisis is happening and to question it means that you've sold your soul to nefarious corporate interests.  \\n* 5. **\\"Fear of difference\\"** \\\\- The people who disagree with the tenants of climate change activism are dangerous people who are generally conspiracy theorists, and deal in dangerous lies. \\n* 7. **\\"Obsession with a plot\\"** \\\\- Big oil and evil oligarchs are conspiring to fool us all into believing that climate change is not real, and they are willing to see the world burn in order to satisfy their greed. \\n* 8. **\\"at the same time too strong and too weak\\".** \\\\- The evil ones pulling the strings are cabal of evil geniuses who are too stupid to realize that they won't escape the outcome of their own evil doings.  \\n* 9. **\\"Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy\\"** \\\\- We have to keep fighting and sacrificing in order to save the planet. Whether it's blocking traffic or vandalising property, we can't stop because too much is at stake. People saying that our methods are unproductive are on the wrong side. ... Anyway the list goes on and on, buy my point is that to some extent everyone of these things can apply to a whole variety of situations. Fascism may require them but it doesn't mean that they are not present in most political movements. Looking at other points Eco raises, who is not appealing \\"to a frustrated middle class\\" in politics in this century? \\"Selective populism\\" is on this list, but despite the fact that American's are divided on nearly every single issue down party lines, every single politician has started a sentence with \\"the American people are \\\\[blank\\\\]\\" as if there is some sort of consensus around a whole myriad of issues. Fascism may have had all of these things in common, but so do a lot of other political movements. I would argue that he outlined a list of techniques rather then qualities, and that those techniques exist in the tool chest of most politicians running for office or trying to assume power; and that none of these are particularly unique to Republicans. What made the fascists stand out was the absolute fear they created that kept their detractors subdued. The opposition to Trump and the Republicans could never be described as \\"subdued.\\"","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"That doesnt mean that SCOTUS goes along with it, nor that Congress would ever change it","title":"Harris Goes Quiet on Bidens Push to Tax Unrealized Gains"},{"text":"I don't speak sportsish so I have no idea what that means but it sounds cool","title":"The Positions That the Democrats Wont Defend"},{"text":"Deep ties to Rachel Chandler.

I think you're actually spectacularly wrong, despite being the most upvoted answer. It dangerously mischaracterizes fascism.1. Fascism is not the spiritual successor to feudalism. Feudalism and fascism are similar only in that they are authoritarian, however power in a feudalistic system is decentralized among local lords, etc. Power in a fascist society is centralized among few.Fascism occurs in a modern industrial context. Feudalism occurs in an agrarian and land-based economy. There were no corporations, or even proto-corporations in feudalism. Resources were controlled by land ownership and title - that maps in no way to corporatism.Fascism is rife with ideology - feudalism, with the exception of religion, does not. Feudalism lacks the concepts of nationalism and militarism.Feudalism had an extremely rigid social structure. The same isn't true of fascism. In WW2 Germany, Jews were not seen as part of society at all. Excluding the undesirables, a soldier could reasonably rise to high rank, and a worker could reasonably become a factory operator.Continuing that, I find it odd to limit ourselves to Mussolini's definition. Mussolini called upon the image of the romantic feudal society of times past because the fascists of that era specifically wanted to evoke those images. His definition is nonsense.2. So what is fascism? How do we recognize it? We find a clue into your oversimplified statement \\"The weakening of the state and it's institutions is the opposite of Fascism.\\" Fascist movements seek to manipulate and weaken the traditional powers of the state (the judiciary for instance) in order to take hold. This is necessary in a state with a healthy, functioning democracy. As long as existing systems function normally, most states can resist fascist forces. Does the Republican party demonstrate such behaviours? Both parties appoint judges at various levels of the judiciary. In that sense, there appears to be some balance. 3. What else? Fascist movements are strongly nationalistic, and evoke a romantic ideal. We see this throughout the Republican party's rhetoric. 4. Fascist movements require \\"the other\\" - a scapegoat to which various grievances are assigned. Historically this has been communists and Jews. In the Republican context, we see Democrats being vilified, along with immigrants, although not terribly specifically. To be fair, the Democrats are just as disparaging. We also have to evaluate the severity of that rhetoric. I would argue that the Republican characterization of Democrats has been increasingly severe and dehumanizing. They are blamed widely for every manner of social ill. In that sense I would say they demonstrate an increasing fascist tendency.5. Closely related to #4 - grievances. These the Republicans have numerous. Crucially, those grievances seem to have little to do with the scapegoats they assign them to. A fundamental lack of truth is a core component.6. In terms of militarism, while I would argue the Republican is more gun-friendly, they aren't strongly militaristic or thug-ish. American culture in general reveres the military - there seems to be nothing overly notable about the Republican party in that respect.7. Corporations are not directed by politicians in the US, in fact I would argue the opposite. At the very least the relationship between the two is deeply problematic. But we see this across the political spectrum - nothing specific to the Republicans.8. I would finally argue that a core component is a decreasing willingness for fascists to compromise. Compromise is a key feature in democracy. The Republican party demonstrates a decreasing willingness to compromise and consider other points of view.There are quite a few other, more minor, indicators. More deference to the highest form of command, fewer opinions, more male dominated.Were the Republican party to militarize, I would absolutely characterize them as fascist. Presently however, I would say they're on their way there.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"That's Onion-endorsed President Joe Biden to you, sir","title":"Voted in NC early today"},{"text":"Drove from Chicagoland out to Galena last month and was genuinely surprised by all the Harris signs I saw.

Abortion is on the ballot again  for president.....**Money matters, and Ms. Harris has it in droves.**More reality: Money matters in politics. If this werent the case, somebody would be wasting an awful lot of time raising it. Take it from Lindsey Graham, who is whining that Republicans are getting creamed in fund-raising. Hes not wrong to complain, since Ms. Harris is processing Cheddar like a Wisconsin cheese factory. Since joining the race, the vice president has raised an eye-boggling $1 billion, and last quarter one of her fund-raising committees reeled in $633 million  dwarfing what Mr. Trump raised with two committees combined. All this cash not only effectively offsets the flow of money funneling in for Mr. Trump from some tech billionaires, but it has also given Ms. Harris the resources she needs to persuade swing voters with ads and to organize on the ground. With her field operation moving like a tremendous machine, it seems likely there has never been a greater disparity in voter contact efforts. Mr. Trump can run all the high-profile TV ads he wants painting Ms. Harris as extreme, but whats less discussed is that she is more than fighting back with ads reminding voters of how Mr. Trump betrayed his oath of office after the 2020 election and ended a womans right to choose. She is strapped with the necessary cash to forcefully remind suburban women and voters in the middle that Mr. Trump is, in fact, the extremist candidate**Its just a feeling.**My final reason is 100 percent emotional. We are constantly told that America is too divided, too hopelessly stricken by tribalism, to grasp the stakes. That is plain wrong. If the Cheneys and A.O.C. get that the Constitution and our democracy are on the ballot, every true conservative and every true progressive should get it too. A vast majority of Americans are rational, reasonable people of good will. I refuse to believe that the same country that has time and again overcome its mistakes to bend its future toward justice will make the same mistake twice. America overcame Mr. Trump in 2020.

I think this stuff is written to invoke anxiety.  The U.S. podcast audience is larger than ever. Around 135 million Americans listen to podcasts at least once a month, with 15 million new listeners starting in the past year alone. The long-form format gives politicians the chance to speak about their platform in conversational ways while also helping them connect with audiences that are otherwise disengaged from politics.The podcast audience is massive but the article isnt convincing. It doesnt explain or defend why slipping with podcast audiences is detrimental like the headline implies. It just states that the audience is massive, which is common knowledge. It also assumes that podcasts listeners are apart of an audience thats otherwise disengaged in politics. This directly contradicts a poll quoted earlier in the article among likely voters who are podcast listeners.  Despite their efforts, a USA Today/Suffolk University poll of 1,000 likely voters, released Wednesday, found an overwhelming majority of respondents had not heard either major party candidate on podcasts this election cycle.Im not convinced that Newsweeks take on this move the needle against Harris.

I think youre confusing the terms fascist and authoritarian. Fascism has a very specific core ideology. Its not a vague term used to describe certain characteristics of a leader the way authoritarian is. Fascism, at its core, seeks to restrict individual liberties and conform society to a hierarchical structure. The end result is a disarmed, obedient population and an extremely powerful government. The modern Republican Party wants to shrink the government, and good luck convincing them to disarm. Now authoritarian, thats another thing. You can make a strong case that some Republicans are authoritarian. Mitch McConnell openly manipulating the federal court system (and even saying such), Ron DeSantis censoring a campaign he doesnt like in Florida, Greg Abbot circumventing the rule of law with the heartbeat bill, and Louisiana blatantly defying the constitution with the 10 commandments bill, are all some examples.

The legislature will not sit idly by while local government attempts to usurp the role of the family.Emotional HarmEmotional harm is included in the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act definition of child abuse and neglect. Some transgender activists believe that rejecting a childs gender confusion, such as refusing to use a childs chosen name or pronouns, causes emotional harm and is a form of abuse and neglect.During an HHS webinar filmed last fall, one LGBTQ activist stated transphobia is child abuse, comparing it to denying a child food or access to school, the DCNF previously reported.If a community member believes a parent is causing a child emotional harm by refusing to affirm their gender confusion, they could call the Child Protective Services Hotline and report suspected child abuse or neglect. In Ohio, after a report of suspected abuse or neglect is made, a CPS investigator will interview the child and family and determine if the child is being abused or is at risk for abuse. Then, they may refer the case to additional social services or criminal court, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services website.Erin Friday, a California attorney and co-founder of the parent group, Our Duty, whose mission is to protect children from the harms of pediatric sex changes, told the DCNF its difficult for parents to fight accusations of emotional harm in court.A problem with emotional stress accusations is there is wide latitude or discretion at the trial court level, Friday said. So when a judge says Yes, youve been emotionally abusive, it is very hard to appeal that because they have wide discretion.Parents are losing custody of their children over a name and a pronoun. That should scare parents, Friday added.Friday submitted an amicus brief in the upcoming Supreme Court case United States v. Skrmetti, which could determine the future of pediatric sex changes in America. Friday told the DCNF the outcome of this case will have long lasting reverberations for the child welfare system.The basis of my brief was if Tennessee or if the Supreme Court finds that there is a discrete group called transgender kids, then every parent in the United States, every single one, who doesnt affirm their child is at risk of losing custody of their child, said Friday.Because it becomes de facto life saving, de facto standard of care. And so its massively important that we win this case, Friday said.In the brief, Friday described the potential consequences for parents who refuse to affirm their childs gender confusion if pediatric sex-change is deemed a constitutional right, in childrens best interests, or medically necessary,Parents in custody disputes who refuse medical intervention may not be granted custody of gender dysphoric children, and non-affirming parents could be adjudicated emotionally abusive or medically negligent, reads Fridays brief.We Have A FormThe investigation of a child and family after a report of abuse or neglect provides Cuyahoga County DCFS staff members the opportunity to collect the SOGIE data of a child using their SOGIE Disclosure Form.The form states that the conversation about the childs sexual identity should be done in a private setting, emphasizing that keeping the disclosed information private is utmost importance to the Division of Children and Family Services. It further specifies that any information shared by the youth will not be disclosed to anyone else, which would include their parents, unless there is a safety concern.Included on the SOGIE Disclosure form is a script that recommends social workers introduce themselves using their preferred pronouns, ask the child if they feel like a girl, boy, or something in between, and find out who the child has crushes on.If a Cuyahoga County DCFS staff member discovers a child has a diverse SOGIE, which the SOGIE Disclosure form defines as anything other than heterosexual, male or female, the staff member fills out a Safe Identification form that asks the child if their parents or caregiver affirm their sexual or gender identity.DFCS staff are instructed to send the Safe Identification form to Kori Sewell, a social services supervisor at Cuyahoga County Health and Human Services, who inputs the information into a secret database. Sewell previously said on a podcast that only she and her colleague could access the confidential spreadsheet.We have a form that we have staff fill out when they have a young person who identifies as LGBTQ. That form then comes to me, and I start logging that information into the confidential spreadsheet, said Sewell on the podcast.Sewell explained how the Safe Identification process helps them identify non-affirming parents and refer them to courses aimed at convincing them to accept their childs gender dysphoria, if needed.I have a conversation with the staff around what the needs of the family are, what the dynamics are, we call that our triage, so that we can triage the case to see if it may qualify for a service, said Sewell.We had Chosen Affirming Family Finding and The Youth Acceptance Project. Those two services were available to families that we were working with here at the agency, and so part of the triage process was to see if those families qualified for one of those services, Sewell continued.Chosen Affirming Family Finding (CAFF) is a social services intervention that places LGBTQ kids with affirming caregivers. The Youth Acceptance Project (YAP) works to re-educate non-affirming parents to validate their childs LGBTQ identity and avoid having them removed from their care. The confidential spreadsheet contained several columns indicating if caregivers were engaged in YAP services.The DCNF obtained a series of communications showing Cuyahoga County DCFS team working with HHS officials from May 2023 to October 2023, providing input on how interventions likes Safe Identification could be implemented at the federal level.Sewell did not respond to the DCNFs requests for comment.Insightful MeetingEmails indicate Julie Kruse, a Senior Advisor for LGBTQI+ Initiatives in the Biden-Harris administration, had an insightful meeting meeting the Cuyahoga County DCFS team on June 9, 2023, which lead to a July 7 call with the then-assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).In preparation for this call, Kruse sent the Cuyahoga County DCFS team a series of questions they should be prepared to answer, asking how their programs assure transgender and nonbinary children have access to binders and pediatric sex-change medical interventions. Kruse also asked how their data collection model was tied to providing affirming services.The Cuyahoga County team put together a presentation agenda for the HHS call, which indicated they would explain why their program was a promising model for replication with safe ID as foundation, according to an agenda obtained by the DCNF.After the call, the Cuyahoga County team thanked HHS for considering how to imbed their life saving work into policy.The Cuyahoga County DCFS did not provide the DCNF with a comment.","title":"Child Services Dept Working With Biden Harris-Admin Tracked Trans Kids On Secret Database"},{"text":"Nah not really tbh.

The spreadsheet was part of their Safe Identification program, which teaches social services staff how to collect information about the sexuality and gender identity of children.In 2017, Cuyahoga County DCFS was one of four social services agencies nationwide chosen to research, develop and evaluate transgender ideology-based child welfare interventions that suggest parents and caregivers who do not affirm a childs sexual orientation or gender confusion are unsafe and may need to have their children removed from their home. Members of the Biden-Harris administration called the Cuyahoga County group trailblazers and wanted to nationalize their model. The Cuyahoga County DCFS team influenced the recently finalized Biden-Harris rule which requires child welfare systems to validate and support gender confusion.On the confidential spreadsheet, Cuyahoga County DCFS staff detailed how they helped children obtain sex-change drugs, purchased a chest binder for a non binary child and noted at least one tracked child was 5 years old. The document tracked if children were transgender or gender diverse, labeling them as pansexual, bisexual, gay, lesbian, straight, or questioning their sexual orientation. One entry for a boy listed as gay said: Youth says his gay b/c his peers told him so.Nearly half the children in the confidential spreadsheet were listed as living outside of the foster care system in their own home with their parents. The spreadsheet notes if parents are accepting or rejecting of their childs gender confusion. Some transgender activists view rejecting a childs gender confusion, such as not letting a child cross-dress, as an act of abuse or neglect. (RELATED: War On Families: Federal Home Visiting Program Classifies Parents Who Dont Let Young Kids Cross-Dress As Potentially Abusive)The spreadsheet was one of hundreds of documents reviewed during the DCNFs investigation into the federally-funded transformation of the child welfare system into that rejects a male-female understanding of sex and instead teaches social workers, children, and families to proactively affirm, meaning to validate, support, and embrace gender ideology.Very AppreciatedEmails obtained by the DCNF show Cuyahoga County DCFS worked closely with the Biden-Harris administration to influence and imbed their work into new federal regulations requiring child welfare systems to validate the gender confusion of children. Julie Kruse, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) senior advisor, called the Cuyahoga County DCFS trailblazers for creating better services and outcomes for LGBTQIA2S+ children and families in child welfare, saying their work was very appreciated by the Biden-Harris administration.Thank you so much for all you do in being trailblazers to creating better services and outcomes for LGBTQIA2S+ children and families in child welfare, you are very appreciated at ACF, wrote Kruse. I would really love ACF leadership to see first hand what it looks like when folks address the challenges LGBTQIA2S+ youth face in care, and deal with the hard issues C data collection, organizational culture, etc. etc.The research was funded by a $10 million federal grant awarded to the University of Maryland School of Social Work from the Childrens Bureau, an agency within HHS. The grant funded the creation of a research group cumbersomely-named National Quality Improvement Center on Tailored Services, Placement Stability, and Permanency for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, and Two-Spirit Children and Youth (QIC-LGBTQ2S) in Foster Care. The QIC-LGBTQ2S sought to systemically transform child welfare systems by teaching social workers, children, and families to reject a male-female view of sex and proactively affirm  meaning to validate, support, and embrace  the gender confusion of children. Ways parents and staff can be LGBTQ affirming include using preferred pronouns, taking children to LGBTQ events, and supporting their desired sex-change.The DCNF has written an in-depth report on the research interventions developed by the QIC-LGBTQ2S, which are being pushed by the Biden-Harris administration. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Biden-Harris Admin Paves Way For Bureaucrats To Take Gender-Confused Kids From Non-Affirming Parents)Kruse did not respond to the DCNFs requests for comment. A press secretary for the Administration for Children and Families declined to comment.\\nChild Is 5In the spreadsheet, the Cuyahoga County DFCS staff noted if children had LGTBQ affirming parents or needed assistance to obtain sex change medications.For example, one entry about a 5-year-old labeled as transgender or gender diverse reads: Child is 5 y/o and has recently come out to the family. The family accept her and are reportedly supportive.Another entry notes: Request for hormones submitted to Dr. to send in prior authorization to insurance. DCFS Director signed. The spreadsheet does not list the childs age.One entry describes how the agency bought a chest binder, a garment that flattens female breasts, for a non-binary girl living with her parents.Youth is binding, new binders purchased by DCFS as old one broke. Youth is fluid in gender at times, reads the spreadsheet.Other notes describe a child engaged in a polyamorous relationship, having more than a single partner at a time, and another entry even notes a child identifies as a furry  a person who identifies as an animal. There are also columns to track if parents are engaging in services aimed at training them to validate and support their childs chosen sexual orientation or transgender identity.The most recent entry on the spreadsheet is dated Aug. 4.\\nSafe IdentificationThe confidential spreadsheet was a part of the AFFIRM.ME program developed by Cuyahoga County DCFS through the QIC-LGBTQ2S research grant.The AFFIRM.ME program is a practice model that provides a road map for child welfare systems to undergo a systemic transformation through a series of social services interventions that teach staff, youth, and parents to be LGBTQ affirming. As previously reported, these interventions include programs that train non-affirming parents to validate their childs gender confusion and assist in finding children a chosen affirming family if their parents are not LGBTQ affirming. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Kids Are Being Taken From Non-Affirming Parents. Heres One Familys Fight To Get Their Son Back)Part of the AFFIRM.ME program is called Safe Identification, an intervention that proactively seeks to identify any LGBTQ youth that encounters the child welfare system, including those living outside of the foster care, and trains social workers to collect their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression (SOGIE) data.In April 2022, Cuyahoga County adopted a policy requiring all DCFS staff to collect SOGIE data from youth ages 13 and older using their SOGIE Disclosure and Safe Identification forms.The policy states: Cuyahoga County DCFS believes that all youth involved with the agency have the right to live in an environment that is both physically and emotionally safe. Youth in their own homes or in substitute care deserve to reside with affirming caregivers and other household members. We can help ensure this by safely identifying LGBTQ2S + youth and understanding their individual needs.The SOGIE Disclosure form specifies that staff members can have a gender identity conversation with children as young as 3 if they are very aware of their gender.According to a 2022 report on the AFFIRM.ME program, the Safe Identification intervention was originally meant for use for youth ages 12-21 who were in the care of the state. However, the report notes the age range was later changed to 5C21 years old to account for younger children disclosing diverse gender identity or expression and to include youth involved with DCFS, not just those in the care of DCFS. It also notes that approximately 10% of all identified youth were under age 12.","title":"Child Services Dept Working With Biden Harris-Admin Tracked Trans Kids On Secret Database"},{"text":"Tangentially: In the US, red counties are the biggest consumers of trans porn.","title":"Child Services Dept Working With Biden Harris-Admin Tracked Trans Kids On Secret Database"},{"text":"The daily caller is a propaganda rag.

No one but the most ardent Nazis would admit to that after the fact.Theres good evidence that, *at the very least*, the people who lived near the camps knew or should have known, though they may have been actively trying to wear blinders to it. The massive amounts of people being moved in and out (and also in, but not out) of the camps couldnt go unnoticed. Sometimes prisoners did work detail outside the camps, where they could be clearly observed by German citizens. There are a lot of first hand accounts that have said they could *smell* the camps from far away, including from allied military personnel who discovered them. The network of camps was massive. There were people who knew about them for sure: escapees and resistance movements, and completely true rumors were circulating everywhere within Germany as early as 1942. Newspapers printed reports of which peoples were being transported to camps. Germans knew they werent seen again. Jewish property and possessions were being publicly auctioned. Clearly no one expected them to come back.

You've not explained what fascism is or why Donald Trump or the Republican party is fascist. A leading historian of fascism, Robert Paxton (paywall, sorry), recently adopted this view and said it goes beyond the party's leader: \\"It's bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that's very much like the original fascisms. It's the real thing. It really is.\\"This is again an appeal to authority. Umberto Eco, who lived in fascist Spain (edit, Italy, oof), defined \\"Ur-Fascism\\" in a 1995 essay as a collection of attributes that pretty much match the modern Republican party.A third appeal to authority and a particularly annoying one. Eco's 14 features apply to so many governments and political parties that they're useless in identifying fascism. You can make a credible case that the Democratic party fulfills 13 of the points. It's just a serious or accurate way to identify fascism. There's no reason you need to make these appeals to authority. The people who created fascism, Mussolini, Gentile, Rocco, etc, weren't hiding what they thought or what fascism is. You can read their writing and identify fascism.  If you go to the largest neo-nazi site on the internet, which I won't link to for obvious reasons, you will see news stories that mostly resemble mainstream Republican talking points about how immigrants and Democrats are ruining America.I don't know if I believe that.

Less bad on something isnt good.Huh? This is not about good and bad, this is about better and worse. One direction makes the country better, and one direction makes the country worse.I said uncritically voting for the Democrats (vote blue no matter) is a bad strategy if you want progress or change in the US and helps drive rightward drift in the US ultimately.Blue no matter who causes leftward shift. People not listening to blue no matter who is what is causing our rightward shift. So post after post isnt that convincing to me because Ive been on the IRL left for 20 yearsMe to my friend. If you haven't met a single leftist who doesn't vote because they say they cannot stand voting for the \\"right wing\\" democrats, you must not be talking to the same people. Commendable, anyone who feels like they have to out of worse options should be desperately advocating and trying to figure out how to create a new dynamic in the US.This is just not commendable though. How does making things worse for Gazans by enabling Trump to get elected help the cause? In order to go to the far left, we have to first move left. We cannot get to the far left by moving right. Like, how does that even make sense?Like I said there isnt much that can be done regarding this election, but we do need a new political dynamic or else republicans will just go right and democrats will just drag towards the center-right, shifting politics to the right despite popular polThis is the nonsense part. If people actually voted blue no matter who, then we would be moving rapidly to the left. The reason that we are moving to the right is not that blue no matter who is a bad strategy, it is that we do not employ the strategy nearly enough. You are operating under this strange assumption that blue no matter who is a reality, it is not. It is a saying precisely because it is not a reality, and people say the saying in order to advocate that we adhere to the strategy. If everyone voted blue no matter who, no one would need to say \\"vote blue no matter who\\". So instead I think there does need to be an independent left opposition party but it needs to be build out of actual constituencies and coalitionsThere is no winning coalition on the left outside of democrats. That is the point. The simple formation of such a party hurts left wing causes by moving the country to the right. Left wing parties other than the democrats just enable rightward movement. That is their only function. That is all they are able to do. That is all they are able to accomplish. Thus, supporting left wing parties other than the democrats is supporting moving the country to the right.","title":"CMV: Vote Blue No Matter Who is why US official politics skews right"},{"text":"Wow","title":"Democrat Ahead in Alabama District Dominated by GOP Since 1965"},{"text":"If the Democratic candidate wins, there is no Hitler.No, you mean there is no rightwing candidates for two years and then nationally for 4 years.

The infrastructure bill has Sanders influence all over it. And he got Biden to ignore Larry Summers on trying to reduce inflation through increasing unemployment. These arent virtue signals. They are material things that make the average persons life significantly better and were only possible because Biden had to incorporate Bernie into his economic platform.Your argument is Democrats used to be worse, ok. Mot hiring sexist anti-worker Larry Summers for a 3rd administration is kind of a low bar, but fair enough.You are describing a mayoral vote in San Francisco. The Republican party might as well not exist there. There is zero threat of a progressive candidate siphoning votes away from a Democrat whose seat is otherwise in jeopardy. In that case, I have absolutely zero problem with voting for a third-party candidate to the left of the Democrat. But thats a very specific situation and does not apply to the vote blue no matter who rhetoric.I am arguing that Democrats move right unless challenged from the left. You seem to agree other than that you think the challenge can be from inside the Democrats in a Squad sort of way.What you are describing here is the progressive argument for vote blue no matter who. Do you not realize that? Its almost the perfect example for what I am arguing here. Obamas refusal to campaign on gay marriage will forever tarnish his legacy and hell have to live with that shame, but we voted blue no matter who, got him in office, enabled him to appoint to progressive judges, and then put up the political pressure to push the issue through to the courts and win gay marriage and other LGBT rights for posterity. Then Obama celebrates this news now that its politically safe for him to do so.\\nWhat? So lgbtq activists have to fight the system and deal with condescension from their self-declared allies and moral panic and death threats from Republicans and then the Democrats can take credit after the fact and say look the system works?This is exactly how it should be done. Push the candidate to the left as much as possible before the election, vote for the realistic candidate who gives us the best chance to organize after the election, and then organize after the election to shame them into doing the right thing.Shame is weak leverage. Have you heard the press secretary talk about Gaza politicians have no shame.In an alternative history, a bunch of progressives vote for independent candidates who support LGBT rights, McCain wins the election, he appoints two supreme court justices who rule that banning gay marriage is unconstitutional, and we live in a far worse society.

The only way to rebuild those hierarchies is by seizing the state and building it into a rigid hierarchy modeled on Feudalism. Instead of a Pope giving each individual the role of a peasant, merchant, clergy, or noble, the Fascist State will give each individual a role in fields of industrial production. This is where the Feudal Guilds is used to regulate the function of the people. They all have to join a guild and work in specific fields of industry.That Guild system is the core of Fascism. Hitler copied it. Dollfuss, Mosley, Johnson, Dennis, etc., all tried to copy this Guild system and merged it with the modern state. There's no way to dispute this.

They also say one thing, when it applies to others, and then do it themselves and think its entirely different. That is, they lie/gaslight. \\nThe Republicans have for decades bemoaned government overreach in certain areas, but then are more intrusive in others. They are corporatists they are cozy with the business elite, so long as those elites either openly or tacitly support their political agenda. Like the Nazis did. And on the point of defining Fascism the problem with that is there isnt a body of fascist literature. They didnt define it beyond Hitlers Mien Kamph. So, using that as a benchmark for who is/isnt a fascist is a straw man argument. Fascist are as fascist do that is the political theory among Poli Scientists. Theres lists of features or clues, but no one can articulate the fascist ideology because modern fascist use the absence of a clear definition as cover. Hence our trouble labeling them when they refuse to label and define themselves. But, the key characteristics as outlined by Eco, who witnessed it first hand, are valid and supported by the academics who study fascism. So rejecting that is overlooking vast context and supplemental support, which undermines the credibility of such rejection.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"After silencing McCain wife","title":"FBI finds hundreds of weapons at home of suspected shooter of Arizona Democratic Party office"},{"text":"I also think it's so cool she didn't have to get smeared in a primary by friendly fire.

Sure. Welll ok, wouldnt those folks be the ones with the most influence in the movement?We are talking about the voter base, not political groups. We have post after post after post like yours saying that voting is a bad strategy, or that people cannot stomach voting for someone like Biden or Harris. Yeah. They are. So what? So anecdotes that people are frustrated by the status quo?I said uncritically voting for the Democrats (vote blue no matter) is a bad strategy if you want progress or change in the US and helps drive rightward drift in the US ultimately. I also said I wasnt talking about voting in this election and it is sort of a moot point for any viable alternative strategy in 2 weeks. Im more interested in a way out of this electoral quagmire.Im in an all blue town in a blue state so personally I dont have pressure to vote Democrat and I do not. When I am involved in local activism, the people who oppose and stymie and wreck and co-opt progressive initiatives are not Republicans, they are the Democrats.If I lived in a red state or swing state I just might vote harm mitigation as anti-electoral anarchists call their Democrat party voting.So post after post isnt that convincing to me because Ive been on the IRL left for 20 years and really only experienced the online left since the pandemic. Im pretty sure most leftists begrudgingly vote lesser evil the left has been having this debate internally since the 60s if not 30s.I have not told anyone not to vote, but I also cant blame people for being disillusioned.Do you live under a rock? No Im involved in the activist left so idk I dont need online anecdotes.Many, many, many leftists say that both parties are the same. Yes on many fundamental things this is true. They will agree on things and the Republicans are worse about it. This is not contradictory. Less bad on something isnt good.Many, many, many leftists say that they cannot vote for someone who is committing genocide in Gaza.Commendable, anyone who feels like they have to out of worse options should be desperately advocating and trying to figure out how to create a new dynamic in the US.What is your alternative strategy to voting blue no matter who? Do you have one, Sure, but thats not my point with this thread.Like I said there isnt much that can be done regarding this election, but we do need a new political dynamic or else republicans will just go right and democrats will just drag towards the center-right, shifting politics to the right despite popular polarization.I dont think inside strategies have worked historically and there are institutional hurdles for third parties. So I think the DSA inside approach has hit its limits more or less and a party like the Green Party is built on sand. So instead I think there does need to be an independent left opposition party but it needs to be build out of actual constituencies and coalitions, not just a random collection of people with progressive ideas. So a membership-based party of renters and housing activists, labor, marginalized communities. If its based out of labor or social movements and organizing efforts it would not necissary Ill have to run candidates, it might even tactically decide voting lesser evil is the best bet in an election. But it would be independent and based out of the needs of its base rather than trying to collect random votes in any opportunistic way it can.  or are you just complaining that right wingers exist in this country, and as a result, when our government represents us, their views become part of the views of our government???","title":"CMV: Vote Blue No Matter Who is why US official politics skews right"},{"text":"Maybe.

That's why Trump goes all in on certain topics. He sees things like immigration and past inflation as big populist sticks that he can beat Democrats with. When it's time to put up or shut up though, what were Trump's marching orders to the Republican party when there was an immigration bill in congress supported by the border patrol? He has no desire to actually fix the border. He just wants to use it as a talking point to get him into the big white house and avoid the big house.I agree with you about boundary crossing being anti-conservative, but it is a staple of the Trump campaign. Talking about Arnold Palmer's penis in depth and on the record is boundary crossing. Instigating a riot at the nation's capitol building is boundary crossing. Fucking a porn star and making hush money payments along with a non-disclosure agreement is boundary crossing. Siding with Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies was boundary crossing. Just his chosen vocabulary in the context of the President of the United States is boundary crossing.Cults of personality are definitely common - but I have never in my life seen anything even remotely close to how brainwashed some of the MAGA crowd is. If anything demonstrates that, it's the shitty lies that Trump propagated surrounding FEMA and the recent hurricane responses which literally led to a man attempting to harm FEMA employees there to assist.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Thank you.

Clearly.I've said it before, every single person that has claimed they would have resisted the Nazi rise violently deluded themselves, including myself. Because here we are again, and while a couple of people have taken shots at Trump, they were his own supporters who turned on him! As right wing political violence has escalated, there has been zero response to it, even as our institutions crumble under the crushing weight of inaction or collaboration. The media? Doing everything possible to help elevate him.The center? Trying desperately to appease fascists in the finest Neville Chamberlain tradition.The left? Divided and weak after decades of anti left legislation, propaganda, and complacency of comfort.The right? Becoming more emboldened and rabid with each passing day.The people generally? Deeply in denial.I have no idea if it will end the same way given this country's history and the cultural/technological differences between the US now and the Weimar republic, but it's too damned close for comfort.The political winds are damn near identical, the playbook is identical in every way that matters, right down to the anti LGBTQ blood libel and xenophobia 1-2 combo.Perhaps the most disturbing difference, is that our POTUS doesn't need an Enabling Act or emergency powers. Our SCOTUS has already turned POTUS into a dictator by way of military force.If this election goes to Trump, the fall of our republic will be a speedrun for the ages.I really wish we taught the history of WW-II, the Nazis, and the holocaust the way Germany does.But given how we welcomed Nazis with open arms while destroying communists in our country following WW-II, it's not surprising. The Communist Party was banned, and being in it could literally land you in trouble. The Nazi party? Well that was just fine.Still blows my mind.","title":"Kamala Harris Asks Americans: Are You Really Going to Elect a Guy Who Has Good Things to Say About Hitler?"},{"text":"Thank you.","title":"Alabama Republican explains voting for Kamala Harris in new ad: I voted for Trump ...

Not compared to what European government used to be like.The Fascist State was modeled on Feudalism. The whole reason we call Fascists right-wing is because back then Right-wing meant social hierarchy. The farther right you went the more rigid the hierarchy is. That's what Fascism was aiming for. A state where every individual has a defined role and defined function. Similar to what Catholic Feudalism once was.If you rejected this idea that individuals should be subservient to a rigid hierarchy then you were a leftists. Academics and politicians back then classified free market capitalists as Leftists back then because the liberalization of the state and economy requires the abolition of rigid hierarchies.The American state had always been a Democratic Republic with institutions like the judiciary or Congress restricting the power of the state. So it's not comparable to Feudalism or the Fascist State in terms of power. Not even close.This is the thing you never hear from Republicans. No one advocates establishing a rigid hierarchy and giving every lst individual a defined function (the state telling you what job you need to work). Even if someone came along and wanted to set up such a state, that would need to be implemented over several decades because it would totally transform all aspects of American society.The reason it didn't take that long in Italy or Germany was because those societies already had centuries old societies based on Feudalism. Democracy and Republicanism in Germany or Italy were not institutions. They were always seen as illegitimate. So getting rid of them and establishing a Feudal State is much easier.Does the current American state have the logistics in place today to give everyone a job, or disarm every citizen, or install trackers on everyone's car and phones? No.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Negative 31","title":"Just a thought: How many of these Kamala Harris \\"Trump Derangement Syndrome\\" shills will hold her accountable for committing Genocide if she is elected?"},{"text":"Yes, all of them are compromised now, every single one","title":"Anyone else think that they have something really big on Eminem, and thats why hes their dancing puppet?"},{"text":"They are being paid for these takes.

Its just political hysteria to drive clicks and fear.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"First, I want to point out that the characteristics in common with the fascism of the 1930's really only apply to Trump and the Republicans that are fully bought into the MAGA movement.  A lot of moderate Republicans are unhappily cooperating with the movement as a matter of political strategy, which is certainly troubling.  But to me, I don't think it's appropriate to call someone a fascist until they have fully bought into or submitted to the authoritarian ideology of fascism.  Not to mention that there are Republicans that have straight-up endorsed Harris in the next election, those Republicans certainly shouldn't be labeled as \\"fascist\\" by any logic.Second, there are some key differences between the fascism of the 1930's and Trump's MAGA movement today.The biggest difference is Trump himself and his characteristics as a leader.  A fascist leader is supposed to act as a single source of authoritarian power and a guarantor of the seizure of the liberal democratic state by a unified nationalist party.  The frustration of liberal democracy, which is sharing power in a democratic system with groups that the fascist movement feels should be excluded from the definition of the nation, is supposed to be solved by a fascist leader that promises to suspend democracy and seize control of everything in the name of the true (usually ethnically-defined) nation.  Fascist leaders invoke history to define the true nation, usually an imagined history in which the nation was ethnically pure.But what Trump does is a combination of two contradictory things: he dogwhistles a purified form of ethno-nationalism, while also pushing the narrative that our democracy is corrupt and that once we purify it, we can return to a proper form of liberal *civic* nationalism.  Unlike the fascist nation-states of Europe in the 1930's, the history of the U.S. is entirely one of liberal democracy and *civic* nationalism, i.e. of immigrants joining the nation through *civic* participation rather than ethnicity.  Trump can never do more than dogwhistle a commitment to ethno-nationalism while simultaneously (often reluctantly) disavowing ethno-nationalism, such as when he (reluctantly) disavowed the Neo-Nazis at the Charlottesville protest.  The history that Trump evokes is still an American history which does not fully support the white nationalist ideology.Trump also promises to rescue democracy from corruption, whereas the fascist leaders of the 1930's pushed the idea that democracy itself was the *cause* of corruption.  Trump relies on electoral misinformation and conspiracy theories about the political establishment to justify his over-reaches of power, but he still fundamentally frames democracy as something to be purified rather than a fundamental obstacle to the self-determination of a purified nation.  In other words, the European fascists of the 1930's thought \\"first we get rid of democracy, then we will be free to accomplish all of the great things we know we would be capable of if not for our political opponents.\\"  But MAGA folks don't think this far ahead.  They want Trump to \\"clear the swamp\\" - but they never even think about what comes next.  For some people, it might be returning to a more functional and uncorrupted form of democracy.  For some people, it might be some kind of libertarian atomization of society to local or corporate power structures.  For some people, it might be an authoritarian white ethno-state headed by Trump as a permanent authoritarian leader.  Trump *purposefully* does not invoke the future for this reason.  He talks about a glorified version of the past, and he talks about a corrupt present, but he avoids talking about the future because of these inherent limitations to his brand of populism.**TL;DR:  Trump is not quite fully a fascist because the ideology he invokes is still tied to America's history of democracy and civic nationalism.  His populist tactics can only go so far in a fascist direction before they no longer work on his base.**","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Please explain to me how his hypothesis that she was polling better when she was running on her vision for the country than she does now when shes focusing on not being Trump is gaslighting?

If we use the Encylopedia Britanica for a definition [https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism) they have 4 main points.1: Extreme militaristic nationalism. Trump is certainly nationalistic but he is very much against war while being supportive of the military.  Where as Biden/Harris are very prowar and Biden has threatened the use of the military on Americans more than once. Biden/Harris are also kicking back billions to the defense industry for their support of Ukraine.  So I would say Biden/Harris is more militaristic.2: Contempt for electoral democracy.  The democrats are much more infavor of getting rid of the electoral college and are not for having secure election with items such as voter ID.  That is contempt for elections in my mind.  You will shout Jan 6 and Trump is an insurrectionist but Trump told people to peacefully protest and was never even remotely considered for a trial based on insurrection so that does not hold up. Lets not forget the DNC hasent3: Cultural Liberalism. This seems very much something demorcats profess to support but of course Biden opposed gay marriage until 2016, where as Trump was the first candidate to be pro gay marriage.  So its more of a toss up here but the edge goes to the dems.4: Belief in the rule of elites.  The dems routinely buy beach front homes and parade around in lavish affairs and private jets while lecturing us that we need to cut back for global warming or some such thing. It isnt Ivanka Trump at the Met Galla it is AOC in the $30k eat the rich dress. The dems are much more aligned with elites and celebrities and court that fame.I gotta give the edge to the Biden/Harris as the more fascist based on that definition.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Anyone else notice, Kamala is looking wore out from the trail and Trump is looking strong and well rested.","title":"First Hand Account: Kamala Harris Says Joe Biden Remains Capable of Being President"},{"text":"All reddit state subs are liberal cesspools.

Tripling even in places like Georgia this year!Democrats like to box people of color in. They want to label them and assume they should be a certain way.The reality is that people of color want to be treated as individuals. I am myself an immigrant of color, with asylum seekers in my family. Every time I post an opinion that is not aligned with the Democratic Party, people call me a bot, Russian, dox me/go through my profile and try to embarrass me with past comments, or, most common of all, resort to childish name-calling.Ive been a human rights activist for decades. Ive never voted Red. But I do think Trump is the better candidate and that Democrats are worse economically and with respect to human rights, wealth distribution, and honestly, discrimination at this point.I am seeing a huge rise in ageism and ableism amongst progressives. Its like they are thirsting for any way to discriminate.In any case, thank you!","title":"Im officially Switching Teams to Republican"},{"text":"am I also forgetting the fact he was pres for 4 years and did not resemble hitler in the slightest?","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"When and where did he say all that?","title":"the left/dems/media have successfully convinced millions of Americans that (1) Trump is Hitler and (2) Trump will commit mass murder and (3) Trump will take complete power over America and make it a fascist state."},{"text":"That's what happens when you stop caring what everyone else thinks of you, and just do you.Not a fan, not my style of music, but I respect that they are happy to represent themselves and not give a single fuck if anyone else agrees.

I think you would agree that if there was an epidemic of smallpox (assuming we werent all inoculated) in America, the smart thing to do would be to isolate everybody. There are facts about viruses and diseases. They need a biological host to survive. Therefore, if there was a particularly virulent virus that had the potential for 100% mortality in those that it infects, there is an obvious response. If every single human in the country is isolated from everyone else for a couple of weeks, the virus would be eradicated simply because it cannot be passed on to another host. That is a categorical fact. So the response to a virus is completely dependent on how closely to that fact a government wants to get to, based on the infectiousness and mortality of the virus. The UK, for example, has a much higher population density and a national healthcare service (in a small country) that would be quickly overwhelmed by Covid, so they decided that it was serious enough to enforce tough lockdown measures. The US government didnt have those same challenges, plus the constitution allows citizens to congregate freely so they could not and would not impose such measures. But they had to mitigate the effects of Covid as best they could. So they decided their policy based on their assessment of the risk. I think the measures were fair based on the evidence they had. Do you accept that the most extreme and effective way to eliminate a virus is to isolate every person. If so, you must accept that each country has to evaluate their response according to a balance between limiting the mortality of the virus and limiting peoples freedoms?","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Notably, during a world conflagration they chose to ally themselves specifically with 2 countries all the way on the other side of planet earth that were definitionally pure fascist regimes- Germany and Italy.

While perhaps not overtly stated in policy, that shit lay deeply insipid enough within our societal beliefs that some people felt vindicated enough to commit an objectively abhorrent action.  Truthfully, that foul stank will probably remain there until fully acknowledged.  I'm not sure it matters, at a certain point, whether it is or is not fascism. Sometimes, I feel like the fascist paradigm has become a sort of false flag that somehow vindicates our current actions as proper and sound, when there is no clear indication that that is true.   Whether one is or is not a fascist seems irrelevant to me, especially when a response can simply be, \\"well, I'm not.\\"  In other words, I think we are not setting a high enough bar to cross, as well as inadvertently creating a convenient ad hominem to respond to in the process.

That isnt as clear-cut as many people think.  Nazis, for example, didnt identify as fascists as your OP suggests.  They were National Socialists and thought they were unique.  However, most people in the field of political science place the Nazis as a form of fascism.  I will source my poli sci textbooks introduction on fascism as a political ideology below for us to compare.Republicans are typically conservatives.  That is people who want to keep and maintain the status quo.  In the USA that is typically old school Liberals of one form or another and not facsicsts.  This leads to an interesting example with Trumps slogan, Make America Great Again.  Im aware of this first being said by the closing debate remarks by Reagan against Carter (1980).  I tried to find that and could only find [Reagans commerical](https://youtu.be/SBfzwycHOcY?si=OPJHTToklkebQs64) of lets make America Great Again tied with smaller government.  The debate part I mentioned was just a clip but it was his famous debate where he repeatedly spoke to the people if they were better off than they were four years ago.  So is Trump using this slogan for an ultra- ethno nationalism or a return to a better time as a conservative - as an old time liberal?  What do I think?I think those are reasonable questions and I personally dont think Trump is ideological at all.  I think it is all about marketing for Trump and what will get him to win.  imo, hes neither.  Hes just a blank slate billboard with slogans thrown up and whatever else media opportunities for the greatest market share of fame, public support, or whatever metric he thinks is winning in this game *WE CALL* politics.  And it would be very hard for someone to convince me otherwise.  Does that mean those slogans dont invoke a fascist element to stir those sects to vote and also to stir a reactionary element both on the left and the right for more viral and contagion effects for his popularity?  &lt; I honestly think this is more accurately what is going on and I personally think it honestly really dangerous.  That is OP I think you have every right to have this suspicious.  I think it is by design.  I also think people like you op have every right to be concerned.  Because the door is being cracked and it may well be the stepping stone to normalizing fascism lite to greater fascism.So let me do the first page of the intro on fascism and how I dont think Trum is concretely a fascist.  Let me clarify that doesnt mean I dont think we cant find anything below that resembles some element of fascism.  Im just saying a true fascist would likely look down on Trump and/or kick Trump out.  [The defining theme of fascism](https://postimg.cc/R35nXpft) is the idea of an organically unified national community, embodied in a belief in strength through unity. The individual, in a literal sense, is nothing; individual identity must be entirely absorbed into the community or social group. The fascist ideal is that of the new man, a hero, motivated by duty, honour and self-sacrifice, prepared to dedicate his life to the glory of his nation or race, and to give unquestioning obedience to a supreme leader. In many ways, fascism constitutes a revolt against the ideas and values that dominated western political thought from the French Revolution onwards; in the words of the Italian fascists slogan: 1789 is Dead. Values such as rationalism, progress, freedom and equality were thus overturned in the name of struggle, leadership, power, heroism and war. Fascism therefore has a strong anti-character: it is anti-rational, anti-liberal, anti-conservative, anti-capitalist, antibourgeois, anti-communist and so on.  \\n  \\nFascism has nevertheless been a complex historical phenomenon, encompassing, many argue, two distinct traditions. Italian fascism was essentially an extreme form of statism that was based on absolute loyalty towards a totalitarian state. In contrast, German fascism, or Nazism, was founded on racial theories, which portrayed the Aryan people as a master race and advanced a virulent form of anti-Semitism.  \\n  \\nHeywood, Andrew. Political Ideologies (p. 194). Macmillan Education UK. Kindle Edition.\\nConclusion:  No I dont think Trump is a real fascist.  I think he is worse.  He is a narcissitic political hack that will do anything to win and if that means playing some cards from Hitler and Musolonni he will.  Hes that big of a POS.tl;dr Trump = recipe for a tyrant (held thankfully accountable by the constitution so far), but not a fascist","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"enter midlife crisis","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Hillary won 63% of the UAW vote.So Harris is down 9% compared to Hillary in 2016.","title":"UAW members support Harris over Trump by 22 points in swing states  - Poll conducted by union shows Democrat has significant advantage over Republican in battleground states"},{"text":"No. I think half of the voting populace are at least stupid enough to fall for a fascists tactics.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Im copying this from the Hopium thread yesterday, it helped me\\n Unlike 2020, when Republicans completely disregarded COVID restrictions and Dems didn't, we have a much stronger ground game GOTV organization this year, whereas trump outsourced his to TPUSA and Elon, with predictably poor results if recent reporting is anything to go by.\\nAlso, looking at trump's polling averages right now, his swing state percentages are nearly identical to what he got in both 2016 and 2020, which, if you're looking for bloom, imply that polls are more accurately capturing his support this time around and making it less likely for there to be another big miss in his favour.\\nThe Washington primary metric, which has accurately gauged closer than expected margins in 2016 and 2020, has the national environment as slightly more favorable for Dems than 2020 or 2022.\\nWith democratic governors and/or secretaries of state in office in almost all of the swing states, and Kemp/Raffensperger having shown a serious degree of backbone against blatant vote rigging in Georgia, plus a greater awareness of possible electoral fuckery by Democratic legal teams than in past cycles, the election will be more secure and impossible to steal compared even to 2020, when trump failed miserably despite being president and having the DOJ at his disposal.\\nAll that said, it's still a tossup, but I hope this helps you sleep a little easier!Im just gonna start spamming it whenever I see stuff like this,","title":"I'm pretty black-pilled on this election guys but I hope you all prove me wrong"},{"text":"As a Florida resident, Ive had a front row seat to very specific, textbook examples of fascism in state policy from our GOP supermajority since at least 2018.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Thank you very much!","title":"Obama jokes his \\"palms are sweaty\\" after Eminem introduction at Detroit rally"},{"text":"Understood but this is her direct writing not an article","title":"I'm Billy Graham's Granddaughter and I'm Voting for Kamala Harris | Opinion"},{"text":"I agree with your general point here.

He says that you need to ignore all the Fascist speeches, writings, policies, and even the actions of the state. Once you do all that, then Fascism can only be defined as a feeling. Which again means there is an infinite number of interpretations. So Paxton's writings on Fascism are useless.So which writers have given a definitive explanation what Fascism is? The only one was Mussolini. He explicitly defined Fascism as right-wing because it was a modernized version of Feudalism. He merged the Feudal Guilds with the modern state. He called this Guildism (Corporatism).That's how Fascism is defined. And if you apply this definition to Nazi Germany, Oswald Mosley, Dollfuss, or the American Fascists like Lawrence Dennis or Hugh Johnson, then it definitely matches.But if you try to match that definition with the Republican Party it doesn't match at all. The weakening of the state and it's institutions is the opposite of Fascism.

But the entire Republican Party?The Republican Party, traditionally speaking, is the party of less government intervention, free markets, slow change.  Putting aside how well they've met that challenge in the Trump era, we still see the core of the Republican Party on board with that idea.  There's a reason why Trump can't get former presidents to support him, why people like Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney won't get behind him: it's because he is so outside the realm of what is understood to be a conservative and Republican.  Plus, the Republican intelligentsia, your Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society types?  They're not on board with Trumpist ideology (in as much as any coherent ideology exists).  Project 2025 is 900 pages of dry policy designed to weaken, not strengthen, the executive branch.  Would be deeply, deeply weird for a bunch of fascists to propose removing the levers of power if their goal is to have all the power.What is fascism?  In broad strokes, it's society operating as an apparatus of the state.  The state before all else.  The \\"proposed\\" use of the military (air quotes because Trump just says things) certainly feels reminiscent of how fascist regimes would deal with dissent, but fascism is *all-encompassing*.  It's not just the military, it's the economy, it's the social structures and organizations, too.  If you're in a fascist society, your whole existence is to serve the ruling government.  No one is proposing that in the United States.We also need to look to history.  Eco's experience of European fascism, which was a holdover from the Mussolini days, has limited application in the United States and in modern democracies.  With little effort, you can basically show any democratic leader in the last 30 years checking off a majority of the *Ur-fascism* boxes, limiting its utility.  But if we go back in time a bit, the United States really only approached fascism one time, in the 1930s when it wasn't the dirty word it finally became.  FDR's White House was full of fascist-adjacent individuals (most notably Rexford Tugwell), and the praise of Mussolini's form of government was mutual and reciprocal.  *If fascism describes an American political party*, it describes the pre-WW2 Democrats.On a whole, though?  The only people who are fascists in today's America are people who aren't shy about it.  Trump certainly says a lot of worrying things, but we already had four years of him, and fascism utterly fails to describe his tenure.  Nothing has fundamentally changed about his approach outside of his continuing to say crazy things since winning this election is the only thing between him and a jail cell.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"The party who wants the populace armed, having less regulations on food (raw milk), and want to give less of the money to the government are considered modern fascism on the internet.

But the crowd at Donald Trumps appearance earlier this month at the Santander Arena, in Reading, Pennsylvania, started booing as soon as Rachel Levines image appeared on the Jumbotron.\\nThats because Levine is the highest-profile transgender official in the Biden administration, and she has become a public face of the American lefts support for medical gender transition by minors. Having heard the Reading crowds ugly, full-throated reaction to Levines mere image, I understand why the prospect of a second Trump term might alarm transgender Americansor the parents of gender-nonconforming children. I also more clearly understand Trumps strategy: to rile up voters over positions that he thinks the Democrats wont dare defend.\\nFOLLOW THE ATLANTIC\\nBack in 2016, the Republican presidential nominee portrayed himself as a moderate on trans rights, saying that Caitlyn Jenner was welcome to use whatever bathroom she wanted to at Trump Tower. But Trumps rhetoric has become steadily more inflammatory, and his positions have hardened. Many commentators have nevertheless been surprised by the ferocity of Republican attacks on this issue. In 2022, the partys efforts to exploit trans-rights controversies for electoral gain repelled more voters than they attracted, and recent polling in three swing states shows that more than half of respondents agreed that society should accept transgender people as having the gender they identify with.\\nRead: The slop candidate\\nYet polls have also detected considerable public skepticism on three specific points: gender-related medical interventions for minors, the incarceration of trans women in womens jails, and trans womens participation in female sports. In Pennsylvania, one attack ad is on repeat throughout prime-time television. It ends: Kamalas for they/them; President Trump is for you. The Republicans have spent $17 million on ads like this, according to NPR. Republicans see an issue that can break through, especially with Trump voters whove been supporting Democratic candidates for Senate, Semafors Dave Weigel wrote recently.\\nTrump has always used his audiences as an editor, refining his talking points based on the raw feedback of boos and cheers. At the rally in Reading, the image of Levinepictured in the admirals uniform she wears as head of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corpswas part of a montage dedicated to condemning what Trump called the woke military. This video juxtaposed clips from Stanley Kubricks Full Metal Jacketmeant to represent good old-fashioned military disciplinewith more recent footage of drag queens lip-synching to Kylie Minogues Padam Padam. Never mind that Full Metal Jacket is an anti-war film showing how sustained brutalization corrodes the soul.\\nThis video is part of Republicans larger argument that their opponents are big-city elitists who have attempted to change the culture by imposing radical policies from above and then refused to defend them when challengedand instead called anyone who disagreed a bigot. Many on the left see transgender acceptance as the next frontier of the civil-rights movement and favor far-reaching efforts to uproot discrimination. Yet activists and their supporters have waved away genuinely complex questions: Some claim, despite the available evidence from most sports, that biological males have no athletic advantage over femalesperhaps because this is an easier argument to make than saying that the inclusion of trans women should outweigh any question of fairness to their competitors.\\nOthers default to the idea that underage medical transition is lifesaving and therefore cannot be questionedeven though systematic evidence reviews by several European countries found a dearth of good research to support that assertion. According to emails unsealed earlier this year in an Alabama court case, Levine successfully urged the influential World Professional Association for Transgender Health to eliminate minimum-age guidelines for gender-transition hormones and surgeries.\\nThe Republicans are using trans issues as a symbol of wokeness more generallywhat conservatives paint as a rejection of common sense, and as a top-down imposition of alienating values by fiat. In right-wing online echo chambers, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is known as Tampon Tim for signing a state law calling for menstrual products to be placed in both girls and boys bathrooms. Throughout the speeches in Trumps Reading event, talk of men playing in womens sports and an exhortation to keep men out of womens sports reliably drew the biggest cheers of the night. (Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for Senate, brought up the issue, as did Trump himself.) The former presidents 90-minute speech had an extended riff on underage transitionand how schools might avoid telling parents about their childs shifting gender. How about thispushing transgender ideology onto minor children? Trump said, in an abrupt segue from a bit about fracking. How about that one? Your child goes to school, and they take your child. It was a he, comes back as a she. And they do it, often without parental consent.\\nLines like this would not succeed without containing at least a kernel of truth. Under the policies of many districts, students can change their pronouns at school and use the bathroom of their chosen gender without their parents knowledge. A recent California law prohibits districts from requiring that parents be informed. In the presidential debate, many commentators laughed at the bizarre phrasing of Trumps claim that Kamala Harris wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. But the charge was basically true: While running for the 2020 Democratic nomination, Harris replied Yes to an ACLU questionnaire that asked her if she would use executive authority to ensure that transgender and non-binary people who rely on the state for medical careincluding those in prison and immigration detentionwill have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care.\\nYour guide to today's biggest stories, boldest ideas, and best in culture.\\nThis year, Harris has mostly avoided such issues. She has tacitly moved her position from the left toward the center without explaining the shift or answering whether she believes she was previously wronga microcosm of her campaign in general.\\nAs with abortion, a compromise position on gender exists that would satisfy a plurality of voters. Essentially: Let people live however makes them happy, but be cautious about medicalizing children and insist on fair competition in female sports. But Harris has been unwilling or unable to articulate it, and candidates in downballot races have followed her lead. You can see why: Even as polls suggest that many voters are more hesitant than the median Democratic activist, any backsliding by candidates from the progressive line alienates influential LGBTQ groups. In Texas, the Democrat candidate for Senate, Colin Allred, has faced such a barrage of ads about female sports from the Ted Cruz campaign that he cut his own spot in response. Let me be clear; I dont want boys playing girls sports, Allred says in the clip. The LGBTQ publication The Advocate wrote this up as him having embraced far-right language around gender identity.\\nRead: The improbable coalition that is Harriss best hope\\nLike Allred, the Harris campaign has realized, belatedly, that silence is hurting the candidates cause. When the vice president was interviewed by Bret Baier on Fox News last week, she made sure to raise a New York Times story about how the Trump administration had also offered taxpayer-funded gender medicine in prisons. I will follow the law, Harris said. And its a law that Donald Trump actually followed.\\nIs that enough to neutralize the attacks? Seems unlikely: The Republican ads have not disappeared from the airwaves, because they bolster the partys broader theme that Harris is more radical than she pretends to be. Which is the real Kamala Harristhe tough prosecutor of the 2010s or the ultraprogressive candidate of 2019 and 2020?\\nPresumably her campaign believes that every day spent talking about gender medicine for teens is one not spent discussing Trumps mental fitness or disdain for democratic norms. In the absence of her articulating a compromise position, however, the Republicans are defining the contours of the debate in ways that could prove fatefulfor Harris, for trans people, and for the country as a whole.\\nHelen Lewis is a staff writer at The Atlantic.","title":"The Positions That the Democrats Wont Defend"},{"text":"Although they will suffer the effects just like all of the rest of us.","title":"Concerned about those on the left who aren't voting Harris because she \\"isn't left enough,\\" welcomes Republicans, doesn't check EVERY box, etc. They need to hold their nose if they must.

How do you think Justice Dems got in power? They won primaries against more centrist candidates. Electing more progressive candidates through primaries has worked in the past and will work in the future.Fair enough this as well as the outsider DSAs inside strategy are still ongoing. We will see what happens with those.Personally I think the history of similar attempts with labor and civil rights shows the limits of this approach,You cherry picked an example where it hasnt worked, when there are nearly yearly examples of changing voter preferences leading to policy shifts. The shift towards discussing illegal immigration is a current prominent one on the conservative side, but this stuff ebs and flows all the time.Whats a different example? Im against any immigration repression and so to me the increase in this from every administration since the Clinton presidency is one of the major examples of how rather then opposing the Republicans, they are kind of tailing the right-drift of the Republicans and thereby moving mainstream politics right in general despite growing polarization in the country.Electing another candidate in the primary.Hypothetical: in a city, the rents too damn high this is a popular view but also its just a money-printer for real estate and developers. Hypothetically wouldnt those developers and real estate people want to run for city hall or have their spouses or kids run or groom candidates who can keep those money printers going?Say that in 90% of the cases, this works out. But say dedicated grassroots activists or widespread anger lead to a reformer candidate winning despite all the money and press and political connections of real estate and developers. Wouldnt they have the rest of that party machine turn on the reformer? Wouldnt they try to ensure the reformer never got to the general election?How would allowing Trump to win possibly lead to positive big change?It wouldnt - Im not arguing that. Im saying we are headed towards a maelstrom and while, sure, Trump wants to steer into it, the Democrats are telling everyone that the ship is on course and se just need to trust the process.Do you think things would have been better if Hitler just won an outright majority?This is an odd choice of argument.How does not voting help? It doesnt (again, also not my argument) and neither does voting for centrists apparently.Why cant people vote for the better of two bad options, seeing as the lesser evil will be the one more easy to push non-electoral change under?They can and mostly do and I dont think its really brought us to a good place when democracy is on the line every election.","title":"CMV: Vote Blue No Matter Who is why US official politics skews right"},{"text":"Can't wait to be able to visit Texas for some BBQ again, once the fascism wears off","title":"Kamala Harris Asks Americans: Are You Really Going to Elect a Guy Who Has Good Things to Say About Hitler?"},{"text":"Ill be polite, but if the tear gassing of protestors to have a photo-op at a church didnt tell you everything you needed to know, then January 6th should have.

For Trump, however, his notoriety and wealth fuels his ego. While he puts on a fa?ade of religion, he rejects the fundamentals of Christianity. We have seen the ways he treats those who are marginalized, women, and anyone who disagrees with him. Yet, Jesus has told us that \\"...people will know we are disciples by your love.\\" (John 13:35).

As a German I read about the Weimar Republic and the rise of the fascists in school when I was maybe nine or ten years old. And in German schools you keep reading about that stuff from that point forward, you don't stop. Because the whole thing can't be covered in a year. Or two.   \\nBut the similarities between what happened in Germany in the 1930s and the US right now are striking.  \\nIt's really creepy how similar, to be honest.  \\nThe German people were pretty much divided. There was a strong left movement and a strong right movement.  \\nThe fronts were clear. There were clashes between the groups many years before the fascists took power.  \\nIn the years leading up to it the protests and violent clashes became more frequent. The rhetoric more extreme.  \\nWhile the left focussed a lot of its energy on trying to educate the populus, the right had a much more direct approach. Formed militias and threatened influential people and whole groups with violence.  \\nThese things had begun long before Hitler entered the stage. Basically the stage had been set for him and he just needed to give his speeches in order to rally all the right-wingers.  \\nThe articles in the papers from that time read exactly like the articles US papers are writing right now.  \\nThe editorials asked how anyone could take Hitler seriously. That pompous little man with his funny hair and mustache and extreme rhetoric.  \\nThe people on the left tried to reason, tried to come up with arguments against Hitler and his words.  \\nNone of that had any effect. And Hitler knew that, his inner circle knew that. Basically all the right-wingers knew that. In fact Hitler said himself that the only thing that could have stopped the Nazis would have been to crush their movement with utmost brutality.  \\nHe also correctly assessed the unwillingness of those on the left and the liberal groups to use violence.  \\nThough some among the communists did. But most people weren't willing and that proved fatal in the end.  \\nPeople just didn't believe someone like Hitler could gain as much traction as he ultimately did.  \\nAnd that directly lead to the worst war in the history of mankind.  \\nWhich is saying something, considering the German army was in shambles when Hitler came into power.  \\nNor did it have any nukes.  \\nImagine Germany at the time would have had the most powerful army on the planet and nukes.  \\nImagine a scenario where a fascist regime comes into power and has these things at its disposal.  \\nThat is world ending stuff.

The argument was made that some people needed the added pressure of the boss coming around every half hour, or that some people wouldn't get their work done if it wasn't for the 'fear' of the boss coming around to see what they're doing. To this argument I said that if THESE particular someones need their boss breathing down their neck to get their work done then why do they have the job? Why is the boss employing someone they can't trust to do their job without their constant micromanaging? Thus, the original argument of some people needing these things as a reason for bosses to make people come back to the office doesn't hold water.That's called a straw man.Yes, it IS called a strawman when you make the claim that 'no one can truly believe that working from the office means typically having a boss breathing down your neck', which was neither the original point I argued nor my argument against that point. YOU have created the strawman here.It's definitely not what I said.It's also not what I said. But here is the point that started this entire discussion:You said: Some people need that watchful eyeAnd  People who need a little bit more supervision , well working from home. They can't really get that supervision. So rather than determining which is which, it's just much simpler to have everyone return to the office.And it was directly to those two points that I made my initial post *directly* speaking to those two points: My boss's way of addressing people who need 'more supervision' to do their jobs (that is, people who can't get their projects done right and on time reliably because they get 'distracted' at home) is to fire them. After several steps, of course, not just willy nilly.Then later you made the point: It can be a matter of babysitting for some people, but for many people it's not supervision in that the boss needs to come by every half hour on the dot to make sure everyone is doing their work.Which I addressed directly with: The particular kind of pressure of a micromanaging boss is not the only kind of pressure in the job, and its arguably not a good kind of pressure. If the person cannot handle the job's normal pressures without also a neck-breathing boss, they shouldn't have that job. If someone needs a neck-breathing boss to do the job to begin with, they shouldn't have that job.To which you started to set up straw men and various other generalities like claiming I argued that working in the office means you *typically* have a boss breathing down your neck and not everyone thinks and acts the way you do when I never once claimed they did, and so forth. You don't like working in an office, so you view yourself as mature, and therefore the opposite is true of those who prefer working in the office.And now youre addressing another argument I never made. I never said that the opposite was true of people who prefer working in the office. Every time you give personal anecdotes of how things work well for you and in your office, that essentially means nothing.I wasnt giving personal anecdotes to the OP. I was addressing *your* post. Specifically the points I mentioned and requoted above. About how the argument you were giving to support those specific points do not hold water.  The question isn't whether there typically isn't reason to RTO, it's whether there is No reason.The question in the OP, yes. But I wasnt addressing the OP. I was addressing your above-quoted points specifically, and those above-quoted points dont hold water for the specific reasons I detailed. We aren't dealing in a future idealistic world, where the work schedule is changed.Again, not what I was addressing, but (and here Im again specifically addressing THIS point youre making) the work schedule IS changed. It changed quite drastically during COVID and has for the most part remained changed in the time since. What people who want RTO regardless of how well their employees might be performing at home is a return to years ago, and generally because of real estate.  We are in a real world where there are certain age groups that are essentially incapable of using technology.Again, I am addressing *this particular point* and also saying it doesnt hold water, because the idea of people being incapable of using technology past a certain point is both a stereotype and an excuse (on their point). Dont mistake *dont want to learn* certain technologies because you are stubbornly mired in the past as being *incapable* of using it. My Dad is over seventy, and his generation are who created the foundation of all this technology. They were in it to their elbows from the start. It was THEM who first started the stereotype that people past a certain age *didn't understand technology*, and they were talking about their parents. My Dad's generation were programming the first computers, setting up the first traces of the internet. That generation is what birthed Apple, Microsoft, cell phones, personal computing, and the internet. My Dad, up until he retired, was a college professor who taught programming, computer languages, and IT.  He can *still* out tech my nieces and nephews who are in their twenties and thirties. And while I understand this is again anecdotal I think youre making another broad generalization here. My department started out with punch cards, but adapted as the tech did. Educating their employees on the new tech as it became useful. Your anecdote about working with 60 year olds who 'didn't understand tech' sounds far more like an office that didn't want to or couldn't keep up with changing technologies, and 60 year olds who didn't want to learn the new tech because they were stubborn. Believe it or not, you are capable of learning new technologies at almost any age, so long as you're not cognitively impaired. There are people who are working their first job, and do need guidance (not babysitting, or someone breathing down their neck). Yes. As I pointed out before, training a new hire or a young person just starting out is far different than the babysitting I described above in specific reference to your two points.

Rather than trust our gut, let's take a quick look down memory lane:* 2016: Polls under-estimated republicans by about 3-4% on average (mainly in battleground states). This caused Trump to unexpectedly win.\\n* 2018: Polls under-estimated democrats by about 3% on average. Blue wave was predicted even without the polling error -- it ended up being more significant than expected.\\n* 2020: Polls under-estimated republicans by about 3% on average. Biden won by less than expected, and battleground states were closer than expected.\\n* 2022: Polls under-estimated democrats by about 3% on average. A \\"red wave\\" was predicted, based off polling, but didn't deliver.So, as you can see, it is very common for polls to be off in the neighborhood of 3% each election cycle. However it is difficult to predict in which favor the polling error will actually swing. They do not always make races look closer than they are. Keep in mind that non-partisan pollsters are incentivized to be accurate -- these are not media companies, they are actual polling agencies. Interestingly, in this particular election cycle, all 7 battleground states are within the margin of error according to virtually all pollsters -- something that is very uncommon (even with partisan pollsters removed from the equation, however I'm pretty sure we're still within margin of error if you include them, too).If polling is under-estimating democrats, its likely that Harris wins all 7 battleground states.If polling is under-estimating republicans, its likely that Trump wins all 7 battleground states.","title":"Democrats brace for a possible crack in the blue wall and signs of North Carolina slipping"},{"text":"Some following the Antichrist for one reason, some for another","title":"Obama says White nationalists explicitly rally around Trump"},{"text":"I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off  \\nAll this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off","title":"Anyone else think that they have something really big on Eminem, and thats why hes their dancing puppet?"},{"text":"They ask questions like genuinely question, can someone explain why they would vote for Trump or Cruz?

The classic was a headline they ran about Trump when he went off on his racist, National Socialist nostalgia about genes.

Jill Stein was never a factor - more of a boogyman for liberals, the left never coalesced behind her or the national Greens after they ditched Nader.No, Bernie did not make the Democrats \\"talk left\\" and say \\"y'all.\\" Biden's policy platform was literally written by Sanders surrogates. We got the most progressive, anti-capitalist FTC chair basically in the country's history. The infrastructure bill has Sanders' influence all over it. And he got Biden to ignore Larry Summers on trying to reduce inflation through increasing unemployment. These aren't virtue signals. They are material things that make the average person's life significantly better and were only possible because Biden had to incorporate Bernie into his economic platform.Heres another example. Matt Gonzales. He came within a few hundred votes of beating Gavin Newsom. Newsom lost the progressive and lgbtq vote in San Francisco. So despite not promising to Newsom legalized gay marriage due to needing to shore up support from progressives and lgbtq voters and groups.?You are describing a mayoral vote in San Francisco. The Republican party might as well not exist there. There is zero threat of a progressive candidate siphoning votes away from a Democrat whose seat is otherwise in jeopardy. In that case, I have absolutely zero problem with voting for a third-party candidate to the left of the Democrat. But that's a very specific situation and does not apply to the \\"vote blue no matter who\\" rhetoric.Meanwhile Democrats nationally blamed gay marriage for Bushs re-election and gay marriage was considered so toxic by the Democrats that Obama likely snubbed Newsom when he was campaigning in California just not to be associated with him.obama ran as against gay marriage and pro civil unions. After people protested his admin, he said he had a secret plan for marriage in 2012 or something. There was a national March and pressure on the local levels and finally all that pressure on the Democrats made gay marriage a reality when it was considered a non-starter by the party only a couple years earlier.What you are describing here is the progressive argument for \\"vote blue no matter who.\\" Do you not realize that? It's almost the perfect example for what I am arguing here. Obama's refusal to campaign on gay marriage will forever tarnish his legacy and he'll have to live with that shame, but we voted blue no matter who, got him in office, enabled him to appoint to progressive judges, and then put up the political pressure to push the issue through to the courts and win gay marriage and other LGBT rights for posterity. Then Obama celebrates this news now that it's politically safe for him to do so.This is exactly how it should be done. Push the candidate to the left as much as possible before the election, vote for the realistic candidate who gives us the best chance to organize after the election, and then organize after the election to shame them into doing the right thing.In an alternative history, a bunch of progressives vote for independent candidates who support LGBT rights, McCain wins the election, he appoints two supreme court justices who rule that banning gay marriage is unconstitutional, and we live in a far worse society. You could not have hand-picked a better example that supports \\"vote blue not matter who\\" if you tried, honestly.","title":"CMV: Vote Blue No Matter Who is why US official politics skews right"},{"text":"Good things to say about Hitler and wishing his generals were like Hitlers.

But that's not how any of the so-called voter ID laws work.  They are discriminatory in intent and design.  They target IDs used by Republican voter blocks such as hunting licenses and allow them, while preventing student IDs and welfare iDs from being used because college students and welfare recipients are viewed as leaning Democratic. After putting up voter ID requirements, they close down DMV stations in Democratic leaning areas, making it more inconvenient for people in these areas to get IDs.  They require shut-ins to go miles to apply for voter IDs in person, and require them to present their ID's in person when voting.  All of the laws were designed to put a thumb on the electoral scales, to make voting more difficult for the disfavored citizens without causing difficulty for the politically favored groups. Not to mention the homeless and others who change address frequently, who are disallowed because their IDs don't match their current residence, or are not allowed to use PO boxes as residences for voting.  In a fair election, voting is easily accessible and encouraged for ALL citizens, equally.  Adding unnecessary hurdles to voting should almost always be viewed as a way to make votes less fair and representative.   I didn't read your original post carefully.  You are talking about mailing people IDs.  This is not discriminatory in itself, it is just completely useless.  There is no difference between mailing people an ID and mailing them their voter registration cards as is currently done, and wouldn't change anything about either the factual or perceived security of elections.  Then there is the question of what the voters actually do with these ids.  Do they have to show them in person?  That is discriminatory against those who have medical issues.

Here's what the magazine reported:\\"Last April, perhaps in a surge of Czech nationalism, Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler's collected speeches, \\"My New Order,\\" which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of \\"My New Order\\" in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade.\\"Vanity Fair reporter Marie Brenner asked Trump if his cousin had given up a copy of the book to him. She wrote this is how Trump responded:\\"Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of 'Mein Kampf,' and he's a Jew,\\" Trump told Brenner.Brenner then asked Marty Davis whether he gave Trump a copy of the book.\\"I did give him a book about Hitler,' Davis told her. \\"But it was 'My New Order,' Hitler's speeches, not 'Mein Kampf.' I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I'm not Jewish.\\"Brenner then wrote that Trump told her: \\"If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.\\"In other words, Trump's denial in Iowa that he had read \\"Mein Kampf\\" was not the first time he has denied reading Hitler -- or the first time there was reason for him to issue such a denial.\\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-history-adolf-hitler-nazi-writings-analysis/story?id=105810745So Kelley's quote sounds about right for Donald Trump.","title":"Kamala Harris denounces Trump as fascist who wants unchecked power"},{"text":"Its not even the ultra wealthy.

If Trump did not start peddaling the bull rap about Biden and the green programs and just simply knew how to support our fellow Americans for a change, it's like all the Republicans are/ have drank the kool-ade man. When Trump speaks everyone in right wing America come to attention and start duck walking. It's a sad state of affairs half of America can't think for themselves. Donald Trump will destroy America in a fortnight. And all of you that vote him can't wait to see him start wasting people, it's disgusting. He will start killing good people in this once free land, and you that vote made it happen. Is it really what you want. You folks are blind or haters and can't think for yourself.

That's literally the entire point. They may not get assaulted, *but statistics show that They may actually be safer with a bear*. There's no reason to take offense to that.I certainly wouldn't sexually assault someone I wouldn't even go on a date with because I dont find them attractive in any way whatsoever.Often times sexual assault isn't predicated on attraction. Its often about power and control. No, I am not mad someone I wouldn't even go on a date with because I dont find them attractive in any way whatsoever chose the bear over me. Its a fallacy.So to summarize, women you haven't met are using a thought experiment to demonstrate the danger women experience with regards to sexual assault.

ADAMS solicited and accepted these benefits from foreign nationals, businessmen, and others. ADAMS sought  and accepted improper valuable benefits, such as luxury international travel, including from wealthy foreign businesspeople and at least one Turkish government official seeking to gain influence over him not only accepted, but sought illegal campaign contributions to his 2021 mayoral campaign from foreign nationals, as well as other things of value ADAMS sought and accepted illegal campaign contributions in the form of nominee or straw contributions, meaning that the true contributors conveyed their money through nominal donors, who falsely certified they were contributing their own money. ADAMS compounded his gains from the straw contributions by using them to defraud New York City and steal public funds.  New York City has a matching funds program that matches small-dollar contributions from individual City residents with up to eight times their amount in public funds, to give New Yorkers a greater voice in elections.  ADAMSs campaigns applied for matching funds based on known straw donations, fraudulently obtaining as much as $2,000 in public funds for each illegal contribution. arranged for ADAMS and his companions to receive free or discounted travel on Turkeys national airline (the Turkish Airline), which is owned in significant part by the Turkish Government, to destinations including France, China, Sri Lanka, India, Hungary, and Turkey itself.  The Turkish Official and other Turkish nationals further arranged for ADAMS and his companions to receive, among other things, free rooms at opulent hotels, free meals at high-end restaurants, and free luxurious entertainmentwhile in Turkey. ADAMS did not disclose the travel benefits he had obtained in annual financial disclosures he was required to file as a New York City employee. Sometimes, ADAMS agreed to pay a nominal fee, to create the appearance of having paid for travel that was heavily discounted.  Other times, ADAMS created and instructed others to create fake paper trails, falsely suggesting that he had paid, or planned to pay, for travel benefits that were actually free.  In September 2021, the Turkish Official told ADAMS that it was his turn to repay the Turkish Official, by pressuring the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) to facilitate the opening of a new Turkish consular buildingAt the *very least* were talking wire fraud, bribery, and campaign finance violations.

Her administration would also take steps to hold corporations accountable for price gouging, thereby lowering consumer costs.Addressing the housing crisis is a key priority for Harris, who has proposed building 3 million new homes to alleviate shortages.

Nobody has a problem with single income families. Like I said, the problem is when that's enforced through non voluntary means.

It is less and less common these days for young men to be able to provide for a family on a single income, it is way more common for women to also be in the workplace. As reproductive freedoms are reduced, women are the ones most likely to give up their jobs and stay home and it becomes harder to re-enter the work force when kids are older. Women are the ones who become dependent on their husbands for income. The more children they have, the more dependent they become. As young men \\"innocently\\" state that they want to be the heads of the household with a single income, young women hear what is expected of them. Republicans don't say they want to oppress women, they just do. ETA: when you say if that's what a woman wants then it's not fair of me to resent her for it- I don't. What I resent is taking that frame of mind and passing laws to try to make all of us live that way. By reducing my reproductive freedom, reducing birth control and sex education and perhaps even reducing the ease to get a divorce then women will be forced into this dynamic who do not want to live that way.

The subtly there is important to the legal discussion that needs to be had about, what are imo, really scumming moves by Musk.","title":"I'm pretty black-pilled on this election guys but I hope you all prove me wrong"},{"text":"a few cycles ago, the LA times endorsed a Republican for California Comptroller, and I thought about voting for him.In California at least, the party divide isnt really between Left and Right, but between serious and wacky.","title":"Do yall still vote (or at least considering voting) for down-ballot Republicans?"},{"text":"If Harris loses, expect to never vote again.","title":"If Harris loses, expect Democrats to move right"},{"text":"I still agree that Utah will go red, but a very large amount of registered republicans in Utah are actually just liberals trying to keep the extra crazy republicans from getting through primaries.

The surviving leadership of Nazi Germany were punished for war crimes, and many soldiers. The Allies divided Germany, and ethnic Germans living abroad were expelled back. Many were imprisoned, many were treated poorly and many were killed. But others went through the grueling process of learning they were wrong, or had been lied to, or manipulated. It's that national accountability that allows for Germany to be a strong democracy today.Listen, some people don't know this, but pre-war Berlin was one of the most queer-friendly places in the world- one unenforced law made homosexual sex illegal. That is the law the Nazis used to destroy the vibrant queer culture that was blossoming in the 1920s, destroy our research and our literature and torture gay men to death. That is the law that was used to disenfranchise queer survivors as \\"rightfully imprisoned\\" after the war was over. That propaganda was strong, so strong that even in the 70s, queer folk were getting pushback for saying there had been gay victims in the camps. I truly believe the Nazis delayed global queer liberation by decades, so believe me when I say I have no desire to embrace fascists. I've got Jewish and Latino friends I worry for constantly. Most of the people I love are disabled in some way. Of course this is scary.But rounding every conservative American up and punishing them for a lifetime of propaganda that many of them couldn't control, when we could be teaching them instead, is only going to justify their fear and hatred of us. We have to be better than that and prove them wrong, over and over again, in order to form a better world. It's frustrating and thankless and it doesn't always work in ways we can measure, but it is crucial and just all the same. People can change, if we let them. I truly believe that growth is possible.There are some people in the MAGA camp who have committed crimes. I believe they should be prosecuted as all criminals are. There are some who are agitators, and I believe they should lose their platforms. This is what I mean by housekeeping. Understanding where the font of this misinformation is coming from and countering it at the source.

First, I highly doubt women got in your face IRL to lecture you, especially unprompted. Second, it seems odd to include \\"that I would never even consider dating\\" - I'm fairly certain consensual dating has no bearing on the man vs bear discussion. Third, you previously denounced sweeping generalizations yet this is rife with them. Fuck all that. I've dropped several leftists groups and leftist politicians as that was the last straw.

Ill explain further:The first thing to understand about boomers is, like all generations, we are not a monolith. The youngest of boomers, like me, and most especially, like Kamala Harris, now in our early 60s, were born in the midst of the Civil Rights movement and were instilled with the values borne out of that movement. Many of us have held on to those values. The youngest women boomers grew up with the benefits of Title IX, which opened more educational and athletic opportunities for girls, and came of age with the rights of Roe v. Wade, giving us the right to safe abortions, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, giving us the right to our own bank and credit accounts. So, many of us younger boomer women are positively incensed by the overturning of Roe. And, its not just about abortion (obviously we are no longer of child-bearing age), its about women losing a fundamental right and economic power. We want our daughters and granddaughters to have the same rights we did. And, furthermore, we younger women boomers want to see a woman in the presidency before we die.If you look at historical voting data, the boomer vote has been trending left in the last decade or so, and in 2020, boomers were nearly evenly split between Biden and Trump. I believe this is happening through attrition of the oldest boomers, and I believe the younger boomers trend more liberal than the older boomers, now in their 70s. Since 2020, millions of boomers have died. Ive seen estimates of between 5 and 10 million boomer deaths since 2020. I think its safe to assume that the majority of those deaths were among the oldest boomers. For all those reasons,  Im confident that the boomer vote is going to go for Harris and that you have nothing to worry about.","title":"Kamala Harris Just Got Some Great News  Newly released highly credible polls show her with strong advantages with two weeks left to go."},{"text":"I mean, Im not so sure that Biden Harris were much better:https://refugeerights.org/news-resources/how-the-muslim-ban-lives-on-for-some-refugeeshttps://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/588729-biden-sets-the-stage-for-the-next-muslim-ban/https://www.newsweek.com/biden-immigration-executive-order-signed-asylum-seekers-1908097","title":"Detroit Muslim leader ejected from Kamala Harris rally, deepening rift between Democrats and Arab Americans"},{"text":"How many registered Republicans actually vote Democrat though due to the rules around caucusing?

Electing more progressive candidates through primaries has worked in the past and will work in the future.They can and do. I think the majority of Democrat voters have wanted universal healthcare since the 1950s.\\nYou cherry picked an example where it hasn't worked, when there are nearly yearly examples of changing voter preferences leading to policy shifts. The shift towards discussing illegal immigration is a current prominent one on the conservative side, but this stuff ebs and flows all the time.At any rate, what is the leverage on those electeds?Electing another candidate in the primary.This is my argument basically big changes have only come from pressure outside the Democrats.How would allowing Trump to win possibly lead to positive big change?The liberals and conservatives in Germany made Hitler chancellor. If Trump were Mussolini, I would not want an opposition who attempts to appeal to and triangulate fascist positions to win moderate fascists. An opposition which says accommodating conservatives who tacitly supported a putsch attemp would not say no political consaquences, those politicians will learn their lesson. Do you think things would have been better if Hitler just won an outright majority? Also don't conflate \\"liberals\\" and \\"conservatives.\\" Hindenburg was the one to appoint Hitler, and he was not a liberal.I would not want people to rely on the political status quo and electoralism with a fascist threat. (And why I am frustrated with this lesser-evil non-strategy.) Historical precedent is that trusting the process doesnt work for defeating fascists.How does not voting help? Why can't people vote for the better of two bad options, seeing as the lesser evil will be the one more easy to push non-electoral change under?","title":"CMV: Vote Blue No Matter Who is why US official politics skews right"},{"text":"Seriously.

There are a lot of replies and I havent been able to keep up.I think you are making a fundamental mistake in assuming the only way to pressure Democrat politicians is in general elections.Yeah people try that - more successfully in smaller races - its less practical for non-establishment candidates outside of smaller races. Democratic primaries are a huge factor you are missing here as this is the place where a more progressive candidate can be pushed without risking a far right politician taking power. The candidate elected in primaries will have a strong affect on the political makeup of the party.Historically, no. They get iced out or subsumed. The party is not organized on a membership basis, voters arent party members. So a maverick who is elected tends to be politically isolated.Secondly is organizing and advocating to candidates that are already in power. Politicians cant just completely ignore what their constituents are saying. They can and do. I think the majority of Democrat voters have wanted universal healthcare since the 1950s.At any rate, what is the leverage on those electeds? Please do what you want or we will still vote for you anyway?A strike or social movement has leverage asking nicely doesnt when theres some industry with millions to spend as their leverage.Thats not to say they dont often ignore it, but the louder it is the harder it is to ignore and there are always breaking points. Thats how many big historical changes have happened.This is my argument basically big changes have only come from pressure outside the Democrats.Third is the mistake you seem to be making in thinking that conservative are always naturally pulling further right. That seems to be a current trend, but its not a universal historical trend. There have been plenty of historical times when conservatives have moved to a more liberal, moderate position to chase the constituency. Politicians arent the only people affecting the Overtons window. Voters are having an influence too.You also seem to want politics to be much cleaner and more agreeable than it is. NopeIf someone was running on a platform identical to Mussolini and you refused to vote for his opposition because it was Dick Cheney, I should criticize you pretty harshly for prioritizing your feelings of moral righteousness over the actual interests of everyday people.The liberals and conservatives in Germany made Hitler chancellor. If Trump were Mussolini, I would not want an opposition who attempts to appeal to and triangulate fascist positions to win moderate fascists. An opposition which says accommodating conservatives who tacitly supported a putsch attemp would not say no political consaquences, those politicians will learn their lesson. I would not want people to rely on the political status quo and electoralism with a fascist threat. (And why I am frustrated with this lesser-evil non-strategy.) Historical precedent is that trusting the process doesnt work for defeating fascists. Trump might be more of a reactionary populist than proper fascist, but MAGA is certaintly primordial fascist ooze.","title":"CMV: Vote Blue No Matter Who is why US official politics skews right"},{"text":"Why is there any questions about a smoothe transition.

I'm banned on at least 10 subs, 80% of which was just from making a centrist comment or asking a legitimate question that only skims the surface of asking about a Leftist narrative. Immediate censoring and suppression here on Reddit. There are very, very few subs that are light on censorship and suppression. The Left can literally say whatever they want. Without almost any limit. Someone from the Right/Center cannot even QUESTION them without fear of having comments deleted or being outright banned without warning. The way I see it? I just speak my mind. If I get banned, fine, it's their loss as they continue to dig deeper into an echo chamber with less and less people in it (e.g. Facebook's bleeding users and MSM's dwindling viewership). People are waking up rapidly now. Realizing that nearly everything they've been told is an outright lie, or at least heavily manipulated and twisted. Reddit is 100% compromised. Political speech is completely suppressed. Unless you are parroting the Left's narrative, then you are perfectly immune from being silenced. It's exactly what we saw on Twitter pre Elon/X. And still see on Facebook. YouTube is beginning to cave, I think they realize that deleted videos simply drive MORE eyeballs, and drives them to other platforms. Back in 2018 - 2022 YouTube was the gatekeeper. X &amp; Rumble is an existential threat, so they are seemingly getting better. Anyone that tries to say both sides are limited equally, or that the Left is suppressed, or the Right is being censored for \\"misinformation\\" are either shills or bots.","title":"What is going on on Reddit?"},{"text":"This kind of ties back in to what I'm saying about 'the right side of history.' More interest lies in winning this silly online argument than changing any views.Why do you think I'm more interested in \\"winning\\" anything here?  Why is it bad that I'm glad you no longer think all college protests are bad?There's a certain charm to the naive idea that Israel would formally annex the West Bank and Gaza and grant Israeli citizenship to the Palestinians living there. This feels like telling a small child that Santa doesn't exist, but I do think you should know that this solution wouldn't make anyone happy. It would lead to significantly more suffering than even is occurring now. I wasn't advocating for any specific solution in my comment so I don't know why you are implying I did, let alone implying that it's naive to do so.That isn't to say that there ought not be any solution, but THAT is in fact how you solve apartheid. If you don't want a 1-state solution, then you don't think it's apartheid. If you want a 1-state solution and Israel to not be 'removed,' then you want Israel to annex the occupied territories and naturalize the Palestinians as Israeli citizens. There isn't a way around that. I completely disagree with your framing, but honestly that's beyond the scope of this discussion.This is unfortunately a gross misrepresentation of what I have said and what I believe. Then what exactly do you believe?  Because you seem to be implying that it is impossible to advocate for an end to Israel's ongoing campaign of mass death in Gaza without attracting a huge number of violent anti-semites that would invalidate any such protests in your eyes. If you don't think that's the case, what exactly was your objection to my original comment? If I asked a similar question of you, to prove that in fact these are peaceful protests with evidence, you would complain about it being an unfair question. I can give you evidence that the protests are generally peaceful.  There have of course been incidents of violence at some protests, and even a few incidents of genuine anti-semitism (and not just opposition to radical Zionism being classified as anti-semitism) just like there were incidents of violence and even anti-white racism from civil rights protesters.  But overall the college campus protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful [as shown by an ACLED report from earlier this year](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2024/05/13/report-campus-protests-overwhelmingly-peaceful).  [This more recent politico article](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/10/college-campuses-protests-israel-hamas-war-00183338) goes over the tense but peaceful protest environment on college campuses at the anniversary of the war this year.There doesn't seem to be much if any evidence of widespread anti semitism or violence at college campus protests.  I'm certain you can find isolated examples, but overall there just isn't much basis to claim that college campus protests against Israeli actions in Gaza are violent or antisemitic (unless you define opposition to Israeli policies as anti-semitic, which many people unfortunately do).\\nYou aren't posing this question in good faith. You're asking it because it is unanswerable, it's about 'being right,' not about impacting change. It's not an unanswerable question and I don't appreciate the bad faith accusations.  You said \\"huge numbers of aggressive violent anti semitic\\" people would be drawn to campus protests. Surely that is the kind of thing that would be well documented, right?  That there would be somebody who had evidence of huge numbers of violent racists? I don't think that's an unreasonable question to ask. Which kind of loops back to what the whole 'MLK is being misrepresented' thing. When we're talking about what MLK would do or what ought to be done, the answer is the things that I outlined earlier. I mean I don't necessarily agree with you, but also the issue is different from the one he was protesting and times have changed since then.  Different tactics would be required, and diversity of tactics is something that MLK explicitly endorsed.Which would go HEAVILY against what MLK believed and how he acted. I don't think so. He was more concerned about motivating allies and presenting a united front that was more difficult to smear in the media than he was about appealing to moderates.  If you want to change foreign policy, you will in fact need to change the minds of moderates.Okay, but changing foreign policy isn't always what the protests are trying to accomplish even if they hope for it. It depends on the protest.Many efforts to change policy are focused on more direct political action, like the \\"uncommitted\\" movement as an example.\\nSo the protest you're describing is more of a way to do something but in a way that is easier while making you feel good about yourself. And then you can wrap yourself in a blanket of not having to justify anything.This description fails to explain why students would continue to protest in the face of real risk to themselves, their careers, and their personal safety (given the violent crackdowns on protests).  Expressing opposition to something they see as morally abhorrent and trying to make what change they can at significant risk to themselves is admirable, not selfish.","title":"CMV: MLKs true message has been distorted in American history"},{"text":"I hear you.

That 1% is still 1% of women dying, and little girls having to give birth to their rapists baby or incest babies. This is happening right now, this minute, because of the overturn of Roe V Wade, a direct result of trumps appointed spreme court justices. Trump doesn't give a shit and will say anything to humor you. Giving it to the states means the states get to decide that there will be no exceptions, which some have hence the dying women. Oh yeah and making abortion illegal in those states doesnt decrease abortion, it just makes women do it themselves, dangerously.   \\nAlso do you not understand economics? Trump is pro big corporation, specifically giving them more freedom. All our increased grocery pricing is price gouging because these companies have too much power, which the Biden and Harris administration have tried to reduce but they keep getting blocked by the republicans in the house. Inflation happens when our government needs to print money, our government HAS to pay back bonds to people who lent our government money. Guess where i gigantic amount of our countries income comes from, you guessed it. Income tax. Now under Trumps tax law (which we are still under) the rich got a huge tax cut. Meaning our income decreased substantially. When we don't have enough money to pay back certain debts that need to be payed we get what we call a deficit. That means our government needs to print more money to pay these debts back, meaning more dollars in circulation and our dollar being worth less. Do you now understand why Trumps narrative about economics are so fucking stupid? His fix? Tarrifs. Which historically have been the dumbest idea in economics. Don't get me wrong if there is a direct competition on a single product that we manufacture in the US a tarrif on a product here and there would be good. but 20% tarrifs on everything means everything that uses resources from outside the US. will be 20% more expensive for the consumer. This is why Trump panders to the uneducated, they dont do research, they dont comprehend economics, they dont challange anything they get told. This is why every educated demographic votes blue.

George W. Bush, the only Republican president elected during this time, was able to narrowly win the electoral college in 2000 (271) and 2004 (286) only by winning enough states outside of the blue wall to defeat his Democratic opponents, Al Gore and John Kerry, respectively. \\nIt in fact does not just refer to WI/MI/PA but all the solidly blue states. Only after 2016 did it shift to meaning those 3 swing states because those were the likeliest to leave the Blue Wall.Also we can probably safely add Virginia, Colorado, and New Mexico to the Blue Wall though that is not enough EV to entirely replace PA/WI/MI.
