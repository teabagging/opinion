The law does not apply to them.\\\\~ The conservative president had enough evidence and testimony presented before congress to convict him in two impeachments but conservatives wouldn't let that happen.\\\\~ Historically conservatives have been the stalwart defenders of denying equal rights to minorities and the people wearing swastikas and waving confederate flags are voting for Conservatives to express their views and write them into law.\\\\~ Throughout the nation the law is applied unequally to minorities and whites. Conservatives consistently deny this in spite of the evidence and where they don't deny it the celebrate it. \\\\~ Assuming you are not wealthy, you don't enjoy the same system of justice wealthy people do.

In the past, a man was elected and sat in his house, met with potential cabinet members, and courteously, carefully kept out of the news except to make a statement announcing a new nominee. The incumbent was president until Inauguration Day. Thats the way it was even in 2016; Barack Obama was still seen as president after Mr. Trump was elected. All that has changed.Mr. Trump is the locus of all eyes. He goes to Europe for the opening of Notre-Dame. The protocols they put in place for his arrival were those of a sitting president, not an incoming one, a Trump loyalist and former staffer said by phone. He holds formal meetings with Volodymyr Zelensky and Emmanuel Macron. There he is chatting on a couch with Prince William. Why not the prime minister? Because the British know Mr. Trump is enchanted by royalty and doesnt want to be with some grubby Labour pol. Mr. Trump talks of new tariffs on Canada, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rushes down to Mar-a-Lago. After their meeting, Mr. Trump refers to him, on Truth Social, as governor of the Great State of Canada. (The Babylon Bee follows up with a headline: Trump Tells Trudeau He Wont Annex Canada if They Admit Their Bacon Is Just Ham.)The government of Syria suddenly falls and the world turns to America for its stand. Naturally it comes, quickly, from Donald Trump. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. .?.?. DO NOT GET INVOLVED! The next day, Joe Biden characterizes the moment as one of risk and uncertainty for the region. Was there ever a moment that wasnt one of risk and uncertainty for the region?Mr. Trump tells Vladimir Putin that now that hes abandoned Syria, he should make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The world is waiting!Mr. Trumps cabinet picksespecially the highly questionable ones!dominate the discourse in a country that hardly ever notices a cabinet nomination below that of secretary of state. His representatives, most famously Elon Musk, are greeted on Capitol Hill with a rapture comparable to past visits by heroic leaders of allied nations.Donald Trump hasnt overshadowed Joe Biden; he has eclipsed him. A former senior official in Mr. Trumps first term told NBC News a few days ago that Mr. Trump is already basically running things, and hes not even president yet.To some degree the status shift is expected. Mr. Trump is the future, Mr. Biden the past; Mr. Trump wide-awake, Mr. Biden sleepy. The 46th president is a worn tire, the tread soft and indistinct. With the pardon of his son he lost stature. Also, Mr. Trump makes other leaders nervous, as he enjoys pointing out. They can neither predict him nor imitate him, so they cant take their eyes off him. And Mr. Bidens been rocked by something he knew in the abstract thats become all too particular: after 50 years at the center of public life hes been dropped, cast aside, because it was about power all along, and not about him.A president, however, still has the machinerythe National Security Council, the State Department, the nuclear football. I can hardly believe our biggest adversaries dont capitalize on this split presidency, this confusion. For all our woes you sometimes forget what a lucky country we are.Here I mention a part of the amazing interregnum that I think is important, one that his friends and staffers speak of. Mr. Trump is calmer and more confident than he has been in the past. It is a commonplace to say that his surviving a shootingthat a bullet came within an inch or so of his brainwould change anyone, even a man in his eighth decade, even a man with fairly brittle ingrained views, even Donald Trump. But all of his friends go back to this as they speak of the Trump theyre seeing now. They think it took time for it to be absorbed and settle in. They see him as at least presenting himself in an altered way.The former staffer said by phone, Right now he is extremely relaxed. It isnt only the assassination attempt. Everyone thought he was gonna change in a way that would be normal for most people to changean outward reflection, more humble. I laugh when people say, Normally, a president would. Dont use normal with him.But, he said, after the second assassination attempt was thwarted, at Mr. Trumps golf course, it had real impact. Trump began to recognize, not in an unappreciative way but in a reality way, that hed been spared. It gave him a stronger sense of confidence, some extra level of relaxation and of determination. He feels the American people are in trouble and if he can be a small part of fixing that, he must.The former staffer said Mr. Trump feels that this wasnt an election, it was a vindication. The court cases, the indictments, the impeachmentsall these things against Donald Trump, and he doesnt just come back, he roars back in a way that defies logic, reason and history. Few can fathom this. He meant the history, but also its effect on Mr. Trump.Something else, he said. When Mr. Trump was elected in 2016, his policy priorities and intentions werent fully clear. They are now, and have been popularized. He knows the mission he laid out to the peoplesane border policy, unleash energy, monetize the liquid gold, make the tax cuts permanenttheres an air of confidence about his mission now, and an understanding of the systems in place. He is living something few get to live: If I could do it all over again.A different observer, whos seen Mr. Trump up close, said this week, This is the best version of Donald Trump we will see.Back to the former staffer: The gravity of this historic moment cannot be overstated. He has a level of swagger, a new level. People say, Can I get the policy without the personality? No, you need a certain level of I dont give a damn. If you think he had it the first time, Katy bar the door.He had a prediction: This has the potential to be historic in a way that only a handful of administrations have been. We remember some administrations with a level of history-altering moments. This ones gonna have a lot.What about the potential for wrongdoing, such as using government to suppress or abuse foes? Hes said a million times his revenge is going to be success. When Trump wins, he lets bygones be bygones.He paused. Some of the people hes hired arent that way, so theres a chance some people may take it upon themselves to do some stuff. I dont know.","title":"Biden Gets Lost in Trumps Shadow - The president-elect acts as if hes already in charge.

Before that happens, many will suffer, and Trump will find cruel ways to punish blue states, in particular the funding sources of the Democratic party.

Even while people freak out over children who DO very determinedly ask for surgery and discuss it at length with multiple doctors and therapists and their parents.It's normalized, but the forced transition of intersex youth is abuse. It's not \\"just fixing\\" anything that is actually wrong with them. Usually nothing is wrong with them, it's just that their body falls outside binary?expectations just enough to make *other people* uncomfortable.If you talk to actual adult Intersex people who have had this done to them as children, most of them sure aren't happy about it.Some of them wished they'd been left as they were born. Others end up seeking gender transition - away from the sex that was abitrarily chosen for them, and toward the other, or back toward ambiguity - as adults.\\nSometimes this is done to very young intersex children, they're surgically assigned a gender (arbitrarily chosen by the parents and/or doctor, not by nature), and the parents don't even tell the child this happened. And sometimes this results in the child feeling wrong in their own skin, coming out as trans, going through all the pain that can be involved in that in our society... and then discovering that their parents and doctor created the problem for them by deliberately choosing to surgically alter the child's body before they ever got to have an opinion about that.Obviously, different intersex people have different experiences and opinions, and I can't speak for them. But by and large, they all seem to agree that deliberately medically transitioning them as children without their knowledge or consent should stop yesterday.If you really must, just assign a pronoun and raise them accordingly - that's at least a few million miles better than permanently altering their body, including removing or altering genitalia that they can never truly get back, before they're at least old enough to express an opinion about it.Anyone who has ever worried about trans kids regretting permanent changes they chose, should think about these kids who are having permanent changes they didn't even ask for made for them while almost nobody bats an eye.","title":"All But 10 Senate Democrats Voted for a Defense Bill With an Anti-Trans Healthcare Ban"},{"text":"Genocide via semantics.

I would agree that elements of the left have been ironically more orthodox and less liberal, particularly with respect to gender and identity politics. Still, I think this analysis fails to capture some of the broader trends in neoliberalism and how those trends alienated more and different voter blocs. Its more than just cancel culture and the limited impact of social media screeds. For decades, the neoliberals have aligned themselves with the donor class, and to make up for the gross unpopularity of the policies needed to keep that group happy, the Dems focused on narrower and narrower social issues with no or minimal fiscal impact. Without serious policies to bolster the working class, the neoliberal rhetoric of identity politics becomes an orthodoxy that deliberately appeals to only a narrow constituency. Weve allowed Trump to define elites, even though he is one, and to speak to labor issues like the decline of American manufacturing, even though he makes it worse, because he sincerely does not give a shit about alienating donors, or anybody. So he can at least validate voters, even as he betrays them.

Needless to say I doubt that anyone was thinking of the impact on these patients when they wrote the bill (one of many reasons why medical decisions should be made by doctors and not politicians).","title":"All But 10 Senate Democrats Voted for a Defense Bill With an Anti-Trans Healthcare Ban"},{"text":"The period of left-wing illiberalism that began about a decade ago seems to have drawn to a close, Jonathan Chait writes.When was the last time you saw a social-media mob have any effect outside social media? Who is the last person to be publicly shamed and unjustly driven out of their high-status job over some misunderstood joke or stray comment? Chait asks. The culture seems to be shifting in the other direction. Shane Gillis, who was fired five years ago from Saturday Night Live in response to outrage over offensive jokes made on a podcast, was brought back in February as a guest host. David Shor, who lost his job in 2020 for suggesting that violence is politically counterproductive, helped direct advertising by the Democratic Partys most powerful super PAC this year.The illiberal norms originated from two sources, Chait writes: the giddy atmosphere that followed Barack Obamas 2012 reelection, which was thought to be due to a rising cohort of young, socially liberal nonwhite voters whose influence would continue to grow indefinitely, and the prominence of social media, especially Twitter, which was the perfect forum for political correctness to flourish.By late 2021, with COVID in abeyance and Joe Biden occupying the presidency, things began calming down quickly. Trumps (temporary) disappearance from the political scene deescalated the sense of crisis that had fueled the hysteria. And Elon Musks disastrous 2022 Twitter takeover accelerated the decline, Chait continues. Trumps victory in the 2024 election came in part due to higher support among nonwhite voters, upending the premise that treated left-wing positions about social issues as objectively representing the interests of people of color. Now that the election had confirmed that those positions alienated many minority voters themselves, doubts that had only been whispered before could be shouted in public more easily.While the illiberal left is in retreat, the illiberal right is about to attain the height of its powers, Chait continues. A new era of open discourse in progressive America cannot begin soon enough.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/3iX3JROM](https://theatln.tc/3iX3JROM)?

Spiders are not insects my fault.  \\nAs for Jesus. What I am going to write is for another topic, but I will try to summarize it. As I wrote, I was into the occult all my life, I was a new ager, believed in aliens, annunaki and the like. The planet prison theory that threw me into depression. The thing is everyone has something they believe because of perception and it's not like there isn't evidence for aliens or for Jesus. That's where we get to the catch 22... I can understand if someone believes in aliens because there are various doubts why someone believes in it (reptiles and the like). But it should also not be strange to anyone that someone believes in Jesus and God because there is evidence for that too. Let's say, as a big ex-believer in aliens, my theory today is that they are demonic entities. You have cases where people were abducted and called out to Jesus and the \\"aliens\\" didn't like it. Never Allah, Buddha or someone else, always Jesus. And here we come to the fact that I never read that these experiences disappear when anything other than Jesus is invoked. I used to do an experiment with Allah, Buddha, and I really wanted the sleep paralysis to disappear, but nothing happened, but as soon as I mentioned Jesus, everything disappeared. So I researched the near death experience and many atheists/agnostics/of other religions became Christians because Jesus appeared to them. Ask yourself this... How come the people who control this world (the elite) believe in Satan. They are satanists and satanic symbols are all around us in movies, series, music videos. They hate Christianity and Jesus like no other religion. It is very well documented.As for the astral spiders, yes, they were real. The second time I saw him, he moved as if he noticed that I saw him and disappeared within 4, 5 seconds. I read that when they see that we notice them, they \\"get scared\\" and disappear. And how do they disappear? They just disappear like some kind of hologram, that's the closest description. They looked like any spider, only much bigger than any spider I had ever seen. The first time it was black, and the second time it was brown. Both times I fell asleep with the movie on and woke up suddenly","title":"Let's be realistic for a moment.

According to web information and posts on X:- **Financial Incentives**: The bill allegedly included a significant financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies, amounting to over $50 billion in taxpayer dollars. This was criticized as effectively serving as a bailout for the industry, with specific mentions of benefits going to companies like Pfizer.- **Immunity and Protection**: There were claims that the bill provided Big Pharma with immunity from liability until 2029, which would protect them from certain legal repercussions related to their products.- **Prevention of Price Competition**: Critics argued that the legislation included measures that would prevent price competition, thereby ensuring high profits for pharmaceutical companies by maintaining elevated drug prices.These elements were highlighted by both web articles and posts on X, suggesting a broad sentiment that the omnibus bill was structured in a way that favored pharmaceutical companies, potentially at the expense of taxpayer interests and market competition. However, the exact details and the extent of these benefits would depend on the specific text of the bill, which was described as complex and containing many provisions.","title":"Bernie Sanders blasts President Elon Musk for derailing spending deal"},{"text":"Probably.","title":"Reports of Liberalisms Demise Are Greatly Exaggerated"},{"text":"The flu disappears when convenient.

Based on the responses to those questions and how you broke down the poll's methodology, I do think you're correct that loan forgiveness is probably more unpopular than popular.

We have to make it OK for someone to change their minds, Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the executive director of Advocates for Transgender Equality, told The New York Times. We cannot vilify them for not being on our side. No one wants to join that team. Cassie Pritchard, a labor activist in Los Angeles, conceded on X that the left had miscalculated. I think there was a time where it felt like the liberal-left coalition had essentially won the culture war, and now it was simply a matter of enforcement, she wrote. But thats clearly wrong. We didnt, and a lot of us overestimated our power to enforce our preferred norms.Once political correctness had expanded to the point where it could affect candidates for office at a national scale, it would inevitably begin to self-destruct. A small group of committed activists can dominate a larger organization by intimidating a majority of its members into silence, but that tactic doesnt work when people can vote by secret ballot.Trumps success reveals the limits of a political strategy that was designed to impose control over progressive spaces on the implicit assumption that controlling progressive spaces was enough to bring about political change. What will come after the era of political correctness within the left is, hopefully, a serious effort to engage with political reality. While the illiberal left is in retreat, the illiberal right is about to attain the height of its powersand, alarmingly, some of the institutions that once gave in too easily to left-wing mobs are now racing to appease the MAGA movement.

Act Like an Opposition Party.\\n"},{"text":"In the end, progressive illiberalism may have died because the arguments against it simply won out. Although a handful of post-liberal thinkers on the left made an earnest case against the value of free-speech norms, deflections were much more common. It was just the antics of college undergraduates. When it began happening regularly in workplaces, the real problem was at-will employment. And, above all, why focus on problems with the left when Republicans are worse? None of these evasions supplied any concrete defense for sustaining dramatic, widely unpopular culture change. Eventually, reason prevailed.Much of blue America is now experiencing a determined reaction against the excesses of that bygone period. Many important organizations that had cooperated with mob-driven cancellations came to experience regret, installing new leaders or standards in an explicit attempt to avoid a recurrence. The New York Times, perhaps liberal Americas most influential institution, has made a series of moves reflecting implicit regret at its treatment of figures like Bennet and the science writer Donald McNeil, including publishing a pro-free-speech editorial and defying demands by activists and writers that it stop skeptically covering youth gender treatment.Corporations have pulled back on the surge in spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that began in 2020, and some universities may follow. Many elite universities have stopped requiring job applicants to submit DEI statements, which have been widely criticized as a de facto ideological screening device. The sociologist Musa al-Gharbi has found that the upsurge in attention by scholars and journalists to race and gender bias peaked a few years ago, as did reports of cancellations.One interpretation of these shifts, suggested by the conservative Times columnist Ross Douthat, is that the trend has merely settled in at an elevated plateau. The repressive machinery might be less fearsome than it was a few years ago, but it is still far more terrifying than in, say, 2010.I believe that the illiberal-left movement has not merely declined. It is dead, or at least barely breathing. When was the last time you saw a social-media mob have any effect outside social media? Who is the last person to be publicly shamed and unjustly driven out of their high-status job over some misunderstood joke or stray comment? Indeed, the roster of cancellation victims has not only stopped growing, but begun ticking downward. Five years ago, Saturday Night Live fired the comedian Shane Gillis before his first appearance on the show in response to outrage over offensive jokes he had made on a podcast. This past February, he was brought back as a guest host. David Shor, who lost his job in 2020 for suggesting that violence is politically counterproductive, helped direct advertising by the Democratic Partys most powerful super PAC this year.Douthat and other critics of left-wing illiberalism suggest that bureaucratized diversity represents a kind of consolidated machinery of the social revolution. But this misses the sheer hysteria that was the hallmark of the cancellation era. What made social-media mobs so fearsome was the randomness of their actions, and the panicked submission that often followed. Bureaucracy, however annoying it can be, inherently involves process. A corporate department is unlikely to terminate an employee simply because he was guilty of a bad look or failed to read the room, or any other buzzword that once swiftly turned people into nonpersons.One reason the demise of political correctness has failed to register fully is that critics have redefined it as wokeness. And wokeness can mean a lot of things, some of them noble, some of them silly. Land acknowledgments are woke. Hate Has No Place Here yard signs are woke. But those forms of wokeness are not illiberal or coercive. The left-wing ideas about race and gender that spawned the recent era of progressive illiberalism remain in circulation, but this fact should not be confused for the phenomenon itself. The repressive effect of political correctness may spring from ideological soil, but it requires other elements in order to grow and spread. And the political atmosphere that fostered the conditions of 2014C24 has grown chilly.Many antiCpolitical correctness moderates feared that another Trump victory would revive left-wing illiberalism, just as it had in 2016. Instead, the immediate response on the left has been almost diametrically opposite. Rather than confirming the most sweeping condemnations of American social hierarchy, Trumps second election has confounded them.This time around, Trump managed to win the popular vote, making his victory seem less flukish. More important, he won specifically thanks to higher support among nonwhite voters. This result upended the premise that undergirded political correctness, which treated left-wing positions about social issues as objectively representing the interests of people of color. Now that the election had confirmed that those positions alienated many minority voters themselves, doubts that had only been whispered before could be shouted in public more easily. On Morning Joe, for example, Mika Brzezinski read aloud a Maureen Dowd column blaming the defeat on a worldview of hyper-political correctness, condescension and cancellation that featured diversity statements for job applicants and faculty lounge terminology like Latinx, and BIPOC.","title":"How Liberal America Came to Its Senses"},{"text":"Anything specific? Because the impression I had was that, at best, the theory was the GOP had horrible long term prospects because they weren't appealing to minorities and young voters, so their electoral prospects relied on an increasingly declining portion of the population. I don't recall anyone being so deluded as to think it was all guaranteed, especially since during his Presidency Obama wasn't exactly the god tier President people seem to think he is now. He was similar to Trump in terms of his appeal in maybe 2008-'09, but when he didn't bring the Wall Street CEO's to jail, proceeded the expand the drone war, didn't curtail the survalliance state and in the end passed a more moderate watered down version of his healthcare bill, a lot of people lost that spark they had before. He became just another President they've seen before, even worse, a lot like Bush. Seeing his and Michelle's pathetic outreach to black men in the closing days of this election, I think it was more because his time was of when both parties couldn't figure out a way to harness people's frustration. It was increasingly disillusioned and cynical. Their base hated voting for them as they weren't giving them what they wanted. Neither party was really resonating with the low info disengaged voters that we are now trying to court, so Obama looks better than he actually was. Or in other words, Obama and his era of politician were all nerds too scared to do anything interesting. Donald Trump is a frat bro who will chug a whole keg and party up until 6 AM, and that plays well. A lot of people for instance, are rightfull upset that he wants to be more dictatorial, but many people who voted for him this was a positive, not a negative. It's less that they hate democracy, more that they think something needs to change and it needs to be drastic.","title":"How the White House Functioned With a Diminished Biden in Charge"},{"text":"I'm so happy that this will now be his legacy.

Most flu strains originate out of asia, where humans are in close proximity of pigs and chicken/ducks/geese... the flu will ping-pong back and forth between the species, picking up mutations each time it bounces around. Say they identify 10 flu variations... they then might make a vaccine that targets the top 3 that show the most transmissibility and/or that have the highest severity of symptoms. This is actually where gain-of-function research has been important, with identifying what mutations and where, and what effects those mutations may have in infected individuals, it also helps them to anticipate where future mutations may occur, allowing them to better and more quickly respond to it.","title":"Here we go.

So yes, if you have an actual parasite doing harm, it will show up as things like malnutrition, high white blood cell count (your immune system is attacking something), also higher liver enzymes, anemia, etc... Not ALL parasites will show these things in blood-work, but if they don't show in blood work they can also cause you to show outward signs of symptoms. In America, we have sanitized water, we don't eat bush meat, we cook our meat thoroughly (or you should anyway), we wash our hands &amp; have better sanitation over all. So we are less likely to get parasites that less developed countries get. Now it can really come down to how caring your doctor is &amp; I'm sure there's plenty of non-caring doctors in the US. But over all, the premise of this post (that ALL illnesses are caused by parasites) is just completely untrue. Some parasites &amp; viruses can cause/increase your risk for certain cancers &amp; such, but this doesn't mean all cancers are caused by parasites. I had mono as a teenager, which means I have the Epstien-barr virus in my body, forever. Which can lead to all kinds of issues.

Today theyre still publicly traded with revenues in the 10s of billions of dollars. Bayer is a large medical company that exists today and has household products used by many people. You might be one. They used prisoners in concentration camps to test and experiment with medicines that were too risky to use in studies. Often, leaving prisoners with long term untreated medical side effects or even death. Degussa, now known as Evonik, helped to create the gas known as Zyklon B knowingly. This gas was used in the mass death of concentration camp prisoners. They still exist today and are publicly traded with billions in revenue. Deutsche Bank lent the money to the nazis for the construction of major concentration camps, such as Auschwitz, they knew about the plan for forced labor and helped to involve major brands like BMW and Mercedes into using the prisoners as free labor to produce their automobiles. Merck KGaA supported Hitler and the Nazi regime so enthusiastically they deemed the company for Hitler, willing to do just about anything for him. The company produced and tested pharmaceuticals, medical implants, used slave labor to develop and implement various compounds to then be used on Jews for euthanasia. Today the company exists and is still publicly traded. These are companies who also benefited greatly from the non-stop forced labor, among many others like Porsche, Volkswagen, Hugo, and Zeiss, that worked people to death in the 10s of thousands. Particularly these examples are still existing companies who willingly tortured, mutilated, experimented, and developed devices of genocide. Today, they still exist.

Everything about Trumps persona seemed to confirm the lefts most dire warnings. He gleefully objectified women and had boasted about groping them. He made statements deemed racist even by fellow Republicans and inspired active support from white nationalists. And yet, at the same time, his victory seemed tenuous and reversible. He had squeaked into office on the tailwinds of a hyperventilated email scandal, and still lost the national vote by two percentage points.The prevailing interpretation among Democrats was that Hillary Clinton had lost because she had failed to turn out enough nonwhite voters. The key to energizing those constituencies, many liberals believed, was to ramp up identity-based appeals to drive home the stakes of Trumps racism and misogyny. The retrograde behaviors Trump exhibited were simultaneously threatening enough to present a crisis, yet vulnerable enough to be defeated if the opposition could summon enough energy.That energy took many forms, not all of them equally productive. Protesters tried to shut down campus appearances by right-wing speakers such as the provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and the conservative race-science theorist Charles Murray. These tactics ignored the possibility that any charge of racism might be erroneous, or that it might be possible to overreact to its scale, and had no limiting principle.Inevitably, the scope of targets widened. Harvard fired the first Black faculty dean in its history after students protested his work for Harvey Weinsteins legal defense, establishing a new norm that the sins of misogynists and racists would now attach to the defense lawyers who represent them. Censoriousness also applied retroactively. In 2019, the comedian Sarah Silverman said she was fired from a movie over a resurfaced 2007 photo from a sketch in which her oblivious character wore ludicrously offensive blackface in an effort to see whether Black or Jewish people faced worse treatment. (The whole joke was that she mistook angry reactions to her racist getup for anti-Black discrimination; once again, a satirical take on racism was treated as racism itself.) A NASCAR driver lost a sponsorship over a report that his father had used the N-wordin the 1980s.\\nThis is just a tiny sample of the kinds of events that had become routine. If you think we are still living in that world today, you have forgotten how crazy things got.The mania peaked in 2020. By this point, Twitters influence had reached a level where large swaths of reporting in major newspapers were simply accounts of what Twitter was talking about. When the coronavirus pandemic struck, social media almost totally eclipsed real lifeespecially for liberals, who were much likelier than conservatives to stick with social distancing. This gave the summary judgments delivered by online crowds a new, inescapable force. George Floyds murder seemed to confirm the starkest indictment of systemic racism. Progressive Americans, many of them white and newly aware of the extent of racism in American life, set out to eradicate it. Much of that energy, however, was trained not outward, at racist police officers or residential segregation patterns, but inward, at the places where those progressives lived and worked.Many of the most famous and consequential cancellations played out during this period. A New York Times op-ed by Senator Tom Cotton calling for deploying the National Guard to stop riots was deemed dangerous by Times staffers, leading to the ouster of James Bennet, the editorial-page editor. Bennets critics insisted that Cottons argument would pave the way for attacks on peaceful protesters, but even criticizing violence became risky behavior in progressive circles. The Democratic data analyst David Shor lost his job after retweeting a study by a Black academic suggesting that violent demonstrations had helped Richard Nixons campaign in 1968.In classic witch-hunt logic, the guilt often spread to those who failed to join in the condemnations of others. In June 2020, The Washington Post published a surreal story about how its cartoonist, Tom Toles, had hosted a Halloween Party two years earlier in which one attendee had shown up dressed as Megyn Kelly in blackface. (The costume, intended to lampoon Kelly for her comments defending blackface, did not go over well at the time, and the designer apologized shortly afterward.) The article, which resulted in Toless guest being fired from her job as a graphic designer, implied that Toles was guilty of secondhand racism for not confronting her. The next summer, a contestant on The Bachelor was found to have attended an antebellum-themed fraternity party during college, and when the shows longtime host defended her as having been caught up in rapidly changing social norms, the ensuing uproar forced him out of his job. (Again, these cases reflect just a tiny sample.)But by late 2021, with COVID in abeyance and Joe Biden occupying the presidency, things began calming down quickly. Trumps (temporary) disappearance from the political scene deescalated the sense of crisis that had fueled the hysteria. And Elon Musks disastrous 2022 Twitter takeover accelerated the decline. By driving away much of Twitters audience and suppressing the virality of news reports and left-leaning posts, Musk inadvertently shattered the platforms monopolistic hold on the political attention economy, negating the most important arena for identifying and punishing dissidents.The aftermath of the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel further chipped away at the foundations of left-wing illiberalism by showing how easily its premises could be co-opted by the other side. Many Jews who had previously supported the lefts approach to racial issues began to apprehend that their allies considered them oppressors, rather than the oppressed.\\nMeanwhile, the response from supporters of Israel turned the cancel-culture debate on its head. In the face of anti-Israel protests, congressional Republicans hauled several university presidents into hearings, where they were berated and urged to adopt sweeping policies not only against anti-Semitic conduct, but against any speech that made Jewish students feel threatened. Suddenly, the rhetoric of safety and harm that had been used by the left was being deployed against it, and principled free-speech defenders were sticking up for the right of protestors to chant Death to Israel. This put even more strain on the already unraveling consensus that allegations of racial discrimination must be treated with total deference.","title":"How Liberal America Came to Its Senses"},{"text":"It would still be better than Trump.","title":"How the White House Functioned With a Diminished Biden in Charge"},{"text":"I don't understand where the obligation to report is mentioned or implied.You're right.

Professors would get disciplined, journalists fired, ordinary people harassed by social-media mobs, over some decontextualized phrase or weaponized misunderstanding. Every so often, I would write about these events or the debates that they set off.But I havent written about this phenomenon in a long time, and I recently realized why: because it isnt happening any more. Left-wing outrage mobs might still form here or there, but liberal America has built up enough antibodies that they no longer have much effect. My old articles now feel like dispatches from a distant era.The beginning and end of any cultural moment is difficult to pin down. But the period of left-wing illiberalism that began about a decade ago seems to have drawn to a close. None of the terms or habits will disappear completely; after all, anti-Communist paranoia continued to circulate on the right for decades even after the era of McCarthyism ended in 1954. Nonetheless, the hallmarks of this latest periodthe social-media mobbings, the whispered conversations among liberal onlookers too frightened to objecthave disappeared from everyday life. The era lasted almost exactly 10 years. The final cause of death was the reelection of Donald Trump.The illiberal norms that took hold a decade ago have gone by many terms, including political correctness, callout culture, cancel culture, and wokenesseach of which has been co-opted by the right as an all-purpose epithet for liberalism, forcing left-of-center critics of the trend to search for a new, uncontaminated phrase. The norms combined an almost infinitely expansive definition of what constituted racism or sexismany accusation of bigotry was considered almost definitionally correctwith a hyperbolic understanding of the harm created by encountering offensive ideas or terms.Whatever you want to call it, two main forces seem to have set this movement in motion. The political precondition was the giddy atmosphere that followed Barack Obamas 2012 reelection, which appeared, based on exit pollsalthough these were later found to have been misleadingto reveal a rising cohort of young, socially liberal nonwhite voters whose influence would continue to grow indefinitely. The rapid progression of causes like gay marriage seemed to confirm a one-way ratchet of egalitarian social norms.The technological precondition was the rapid adoption of iPhones and social media, which allowed the memetic spread of new ideas and terms. Twitter in particular was the perfect forum for political correctness to flourish. It favored morally uncomplicated positions. It encouraged activists and clout-seekers to gain audience share and political influence by mustering braying crowds to render summary judgment on the basis of some fragment of video or text. The instant consensus that formed on Twitter felt like reality to those absorbed inside of it, an illusion that would take years to dispel.Numerous analyses have identified 2014 as the year when the trend achieved exit velocity. It was in December 2013 that Justine Sacco, a publicist with only 170 Twitter followers at the time, dashed off a clumsy tweet attempting to make light of her white privilege before getting on a flight to South Africa. By the time she landed, a social-media mob was calling for her to lose her job, a request that her employer soon obliged. That same year, #cancelcolbert swept through social media, in response to a tweet by The Colbert Report that used cartoonishly over-the-top Asian stereotypes to make fun of the obvious racism of the Washington Redskins. Stephen Colbert wasnt canceled, but the premise that one misplaced joke could be punished with a firing was now taken seriously. (Both cases also demonstrated social-media mobs difficulty distinguishing irony from sincerity.) That spring, Michelle Goldberg wrote possibly the first column diagnosing the rise of what she called the return of the anti-liberal left for The Nation.The censorious elements of the new culture could be hard to acknowledge at a time when many of the same energies were being directed at deserving targetsmost notably, police mistreatment of Black Americans (#handsupdontshoot) and sexual harassment and assault of women in the workplace (#MeToo). Partly for that reason, or out of a general discomfort with criticizing their allies, some progressives insisted either that nothing new was afoot in the culture and that reactionaries were manufacturing a moral panic out of thin air, or alternatively that there was something new, but it merely involved overdue accountability (or consequence culture) for racist and sexist behavior.Over time, both defenses grew untenable. Student protesters began routinely demanding that figures they disapproved of be prohibited from speaking on campus or, when that failed, shouting down their remarks. Seemingly innocent comments could generate wild controversy. In 2015, for example, Yale erupted in protest after a lecturer suggested that a school-wide email cautioning students about offensive Halloween costumes was infantilizing.","title":"How Liberal America Came to Its Senses"},{"text":"the differenc eis musk is front and centre and has maga reps openly saying he should be in control, and trump is granting him control","title":"Bernie Sanders Goes Off on 'President Elon Musk' for Derailing Bipartisan Spending Bill: 'Billionaires Must Not Be Allowed to Run Our Government'"},{"text":"you're right but this has taken it from 0-100 real fast at least they where hidden now they are brawling and brazen with it","title":"Bernie Sanders Goes Off on 'President Elon Musk' for Derailing Bipartisan Spending Bill: 'Billionaires Must Not Be Allowed to Run Our Government'"},{"text":"Obviously Trumps locking us in our homes again and then sending us 350$ with his name on the check.","title":"Here we go.

An August 2024 poll showed that 63% of Republicans believed that taxes should be raised for the wealthy and big corporations, and another August 2024 poll showed 58% of Republicans in 6 swing states were in favor of the wealthy and corporations paying their fair share.

Do I think the Democrats should have voted for AOC to have the committee seat? Yes. Do I think it would help them in the next election? Not really, no. Because this last election has shown me that a huge amount of voters simply do not pay any attention at all to politics, and I don't think there's really any concrete actions that a party can take that can break through that, especially one that is either in the minority or has a majority so thin it cannot actually pass legislation. The right has massive propaganda networks that are more effective because they're willing to just constantly shamelessly lie to be outrageous and entertaining. Yet people I mostly agree with on policy seem to think the answer is to scream abuse at Democrats for not accomplishing more when they have been overachieving based on the little power they  actually had, and either not vote or vote for third party candidates giving even less chance for meaningful legislation to be passed. If you want New Deal level reforms and sweeping policy changes you need New Deal era majorities and voters have never given Democrats that since the Civil Rights era. The answer to having more progressives in congress is to vote for progressives in primaries plus elect more democrats overall, not purity tests and taking your ball and going home because you didn't win.","title":"Ocasio-Cortez pokes fun at Trumps suggestion to keep trying to lead Democrats"},{"text":"[We all know who is in charge here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmiD-uer1lI)","title":"Dems Troll Vice President Trump as Musk Meddles With Government Funding Bill | The term President Musk also started trending on X, which he owns."},{"text":"Being in the science field for most of my life.

Im still at-ease with dismissing any GOP criticism until I see something substantive to suggest otherwise.But I do fundamentally agree with you that Biden should have explicitly said he was going to serve one term. The cynic in me, however, thinks that certain people in his orbit (looking at you Jill) enjoyed Joe being president more than Joe himself did, and whispered sweet-nothings in his ear to convince him he was the only choice so they could maintain a certain amount of influence and lifestyle.I think history will look kindly back on Joes presidency, but I worry that will be because it stands in stark contrast the disaster that will be Trump 24-28.","title":"How the White House Functioned With a Diminished Biden in Charge"},{"text":"It's very similar to vaccines.

Many on the left may not know this, but inside Trumps inner circle he demanded on his last term they sign a contract to never take any lobby money or special interest dollars.  The traditional way in which these miscreants enrich themselves and their families. I say families because by extension as we have seen the previous four years by learning the Chinese technique of how to bypass the laws and ethics of trading influence, secrets or vote direction they will use their family members as bag men and shields so they can deny they have taken any money from anyone.  The point however is that if all else is equal I would much rather have a billionaire in a top position  because they already being rich will be much harder to sway with money from likely conspirators. It will be much less  likely that they do something that would jeopardize their position of power for any small or meager amount of cash. They will be much harder to buy off if they decide to go against their agreement.  In all I find this notion more comforting than if they were broke and desperate essentially.

No, 70% believe that Trump unfairly lost the election due to widespread voter fraud and a conspiracy masterminded by a non-incumbent candidate. On the other hand, this same candidate who screamed about voter fraud, also called Georgia and pressured and harassed and vaguely threatened their political leaders to find votes to flip the state. The next election, that same candidate had a billionaire pay people to vote for him. And so I understand that that is at best an ancillary  point to the original commenters argument.

Or Wall Street? How bout all those bank bailouts that raised inflation?Supporting \\"wall street\\" is a pretty open statement that's relatively meaningless. Bailing out the banks? I think you should look at why this occurred and why it was needed rather than just taking an empty populist take. Remember when Biden was running, and he was saying how hes on team poor people?Yes. Does a meeting with rich people throw out all the positive change he made? Under Biden we achieved the highest unemployment in more than 50 years immediately after a massive pandemic. Under Biden we are outperforming in our recovery from the pandemic in terms of economic growth, inflation, unemployment,  etc.Under Biden we changed the laws on overtime pay to make millions of our poorest Americans now eligible to earn extra for their hard work. Biden was the first president to walk a picket line. He walked with UAW union. That UAWs strike won historic wage increases and helped ensure that electric vehicles would be manufactured in America by union workers.President Biden signed into law the Butch Lewis Act which protected roughly 2 million workers pensions, ensuring they remained solvent.Biden passed The Inflation Reduction Acts corporate minimum tax ensures that billion-dollar corporations pay at least 15% of their income in taxes. In response to the surge in corporate stock buybacks after the Trump tax cuts, the Biden-Harris Administration enacted a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks to encourage businesses to invest in growth and productivity as opposed to funneling tax-preferred profits to wealthy and foreign shareholders.The Biden-Harris Administration reversed the chronic underfunding of the IRS, giving the agency the tools it needed to improve taxpayers experience and make wealthy and corporate tax cheats pay the taxes they owe.Biden passed major infrastructure bills and the CHIPS act bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. All of these things are helping the poor and middle class. If you keep insisting if we all just vote Democrat everything will be great, nothing will change.If for once we could have democrats enter the leadership outside of a major recession or pandemic we might be able to see more positive change rather than just cleaning up the last guys mess.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Damn...

Since election night I've been eating my crow. Quite frankly my perceptions of this sub have radically shifted and I don't view it in such high regard (relative to other political subs on Reddit). Myself and many others on this sub mercilessly dunked on people who were ringing alarm bells at the right time. Dean Philips was prescient and should be getting his flowers right now. It's one thing to be data driven and rely on institutional knowledge. It's another to completely ignore obvious signs and warnings which the vast majority of this sub did up until the debate and even some people after the debate. He was the right candidate in 2020 to defeat Trump but he should've committed to being a one term president from the outset. Hindsight is 20/20 but I think those around him, especially Jill, should've pushed him to be a one term \\"transition\\" President to reset our norms and fix the economy. I think Joe Biden's popularity would've fared much better if he was viewed by Americans as the cleanup guy who will go away after four years. I think he could've also positioned himself as a sort of foil to the Democratic primary to take criticism and offer the sort of launch pad for a new administration that Kamala couldn't really do in three months as VP.Just looking back to his victory in 2020 it is clear to see that he has slipped away a lot. Sometimes I look at clips from 2020 campaign and I can't help but think if he was able to pull off even that he wouldn't have dropped out. Look at Biden in 2016 vs 2020 and it's clear to see the \\"stutter\\" was just a piss poor excuse to cover his mental decline. Joe in 2016 would've roasted Trump's ass alive on a debate stage relegating him to a footnote in history. He's not Obama but Joe can certainly knock out a speech or hand your ass to you in a debate. I think history will look at Biden's term as a last gasp of the new deal Democrats. It was fun while it lasted but Joe, you fucked up.","title":"How the White House Functioned With a Diminished Biden in Charge"},{"text":"This is going to keep happening until Democrats realize that they have to pull the same bullshit to hold mutually beneficial things up.

A lot of the tech billionaires like Gates or Zuck or whoever arent exploiting people making minimum wage and paying them nickels; their employees are highly educated nerds making really generous like 250k+ salaries.Improving quality of life for the majority does require having a globally competitive economy, so like you do have some basic constraints there.The way you improve quality of life for the majority is by ensuring more balance of power between employees and employers.The left correctly recognizes some of that comes through workers right regulation, and the right correctly recognizes that pulling that lever too hard inhibits the economic engine that powers this whole thing.The right correctly recognizes that immigration - particularly undocumented - are big drivers of inequity as they strain services / drive up some costs, while contributing to wage suppression as surplus labor. The left is largely in denial about it.The left recognizes the need to break down monopolies (but theyre super disorganized about it), while the right recognizes regulatory capture and nationalization also create effective monopolies. The left and right are both pushing on the issues that improve quality of life *for their constituents*.The failure here is not recognizing the validity in the other sides approach.I do think a workers unity party / supermajority focused on these issues is possible.

But let me try something slightly different.  And this is purely based on the claim that it's hypocritical.  This isn't a defense of J6, a support of the idea that any election fraud took place or an attack on Democrat reactions to losing 2024 (which I think are mostly quite reasonable and far less extreme than they were in 2016).For a claim of hypocrisy to be correct, the essential reactions of the two parties needs to be similar in principle, though not in scale.  That is, paraphrasing, you posit that it's hypocritical for Trump voters to make fun of Democrat reactions to losing because Trump voters reacted much more strongly when their candidate lost, correct?If so, the argument against this is that the two reactions were entirely different, in **principle**.If Democrat reactions to Trump winning are, as you say, are \\"*rightfully upset, angry, etc, that is bound to happen when you lose an election, especially when its to someone as hated as Trump is*\\", this is principally different than the reasons Trump voters were upset about 2020.  It isn't just a difference in scale, it is different, in principle.The **principle** you described as why Democrats are upset is:a. it's natural after losing an election andb. because Trump is so hatedFrom everything we know, the **principle** why Republicans were upset was:Allegations of fraud, media messaging, mistrust in voting systems, political polarization and Trump's pre-election narratives 'priming the pump' as it were.  I suspect you will agree with this but if you request links with evidence, I will provide them.  Note: I am not defending any of those views, in any way.  They are, imo, incorrect and...concerning.  But that's not the point, here.The **principle** of why Republicans were upset can't be attributed to the same reasons as Democrats.  That is, as being natural to losing an election (since J6 hasn't really occurred before, much less regularly, when Republicans have lost).  And there is no evidence to suggest that particular hatred of Biden was a factor.Because the reasons for being upset were do different, it's not actually hypocritical.

They like to pretend they're so fucking ruthless and politics is \\"tough business that forces them to be so morally &amp; ethically bankrupt\\", but they're actually just spineless fucking wimps who dont stand for or believe in ANYTHING. That's why they lose all the fucking time. Because they don't have beliefs or real opinions that can't be morphed into something more palatable if the \\"right people\\" (DONORS/ THE RICH WHO OWN THEM) find those beliefs or opinions disagreeable. Voters see this, everyone does, they're not fooling anyone but the biggest fucking morons. They're corrupt disingenuous liars and they got rich as fuck being that. Ya know what voters hate? Hearing about corruption from the other party when you're just as fucking corrupt. They love to pretend \\"we need to throw marginalized groups under the bus to win\\". But if that's true, why are they always fucking losing? Because they certainly don't miss any opportunity to leave people out in the cold with their policies. It's like listening to an amateur swimmer tell me what it takes to compete at an Olympic level for the shotput. \\"Oh, we're so cynical, we're making the tough decisions that it takes to win\\". Try actually fucking winning with that strategy then, cause you haven't been. They think they're the adults in the room, doing the tough stuff that needs to be done, but actually they have an almost child-like view of \\"how power is acquired\\", \\"what it is to be wielded for\\", \\"when it should be wielded\\". That's why this dogshit party couldn't hold trump accountable for a fucking insurrection. Cause it's not a problem for healthcare ceos to kill thousands yearly, or the cops to do so, but it's a HUGE problem if they shoot a few trumpers trying to storm a prison to get Trump out. That was a time to wield power, but instead they sat on their fucking hands for YEARS and appointed a do-nothing time waster in Garland, so glad our taxes went to his salary to jerk off in his office for four years. Can't arrest Trump and stick his ass in a prison where it belongs because someone might get a little upset and try to do some domestic terrorism. Oh, but they're so fucking ruthless aren't they?! They're making the tough decisions that someone's gotta make, huh? Tell me where are these ruthless decisions when it matters?   \\n  \\nThe ruthlessness only seems to come when it's time to triangulate themselves out of providing for or protecting the American people, never when there's a threat worth treating with ruthlessness. Although they'll tell you up and down, forwards and back that it is a threat worth treating seriously, then turn around and act the exact fucking opposite.

It hasn't even been long enough to judge whether Biden's presidency has had a positive or negative impact there.  Labor power decreases are a social problem. Of course they can, but you are pretending like no progress has been made because problems still exist. In reality, one of two political parties stopped even trying to contribute to federal governance in 2008, which means nothing of import gets done unless the other party controls both wings of the legislature and the executive. In the narrow windows when that has been true in the last 18 years big things have gotten done, even if they are not as big as you would like them to be. But, Congress has limited bandwidth and just like in an election, you need enough people agreeing to get something through.

I don't think the administrations of Ronald Reagan or either of the Bushes compare in this regard for the degree or speed they want to dismantle the federal government.If you want to quibble, the Silicon Valley executives joining the Trump administration are probably more inspired by the philosophy of Ayn Rand than political libertarianism *per se* as Ayn Rand herself was adamant that her philosophy was **not** libertarianism, but I'd argue that, practically, that is a distinction without a difference because their policy goals look about the same: a minarchist (\\"night watchman\\") state that exists to enforce private-property rights and enforce private contracts as well as the national defense, deregulation of industry, tax cuts, privatization of public goods (see also [post-Soviet Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Privatization_in_Russia&amp;oldid=1253896526)), and abolition of central banks.In short, the Republican Party already *is* shaping up to be a radically libertarian partywith a veneer of populism.","title":"CMV: The Republican Party needs to dissolve and be replaced by a libertarian party"},{"text":"When it was revealed that electric cars required less workers to build than ordinary cars and layoffs are coming from the democrat push to green.

It's taken from other similar examples and history.The king built his kingdom on years of strife. There were long periods of time where he saw his entire family die off in wars, wars where he was often the one killing his family. He finally attained a measure of peace by being the most powerful person - really, the person who was left standing. He respected power because he knew how awful it was.The kingdom was passed to the son, the prince. The prince knew the awful cost of power, had seen his father kill his uncles and cousins, and knew that peace was a gift. He struggled to maintain the kingdom his father made, but it mostly worked out because he was there to have seen the most violent years of his father's struggle. He was not a great, powerful man like his father, but he was an obedient, mindful son, and that ensured he kept peace above all else.The grandson of the king inherits the kingdom from his father, the prince. The grandson grew up in abundance, knew nothing but pleasure and comfort, and thus had nothing to struggle for except ways to find more pleasure. He is a drunk, abusive to his staff, and a terrible ruler of the people. He is assassinated a few years into his reign, and the kingdom collapses, opening up the walls to the barbaric hordes outside who will start the struggle for power and peace all over.Elon is the grandson.","title":"Musk Kills Government Funding Deal, Demands Shutdown Until Trump Is Sworn In"},{"text":"That's more or less it, and I expect more of the same.","title":"Bernie Sanders Blasts Elon Musk For Helping Tank Budget Deal"},{"text":"lol you guys arent going to be able to pull off this gaslighting portraying Republicans as innocent victims who would never deign to call their opponents bad names.","title":"half of America thinks the odds were against them."},{"text":"Absolutely.

Whats the fastest way to turn off working class and rural voters, have a message that sidelines their very real hardships and economic futures. He showed you can acknowledge that systematic racism has hobbled minority communities in the county and acknowledge trade deals and corporate greed has wrecked large swaths of white peoples economic stability. People are suffering for different reasons and you dont have to try and put one group over the other you can acknowledge both and say everyones problems should be addressed in a fair society. He also wasnt rabidly anti gun until the democratic machine pushed him to take up the message. What I find hilarious about that is folks on the progressive left will rant about racist cops and turn right about and say theyre the only ones who should be armed. Progressives should be against any and all state monopolies of violence, which means an armed working class. So embrace the economic populism, that has legs. But a lot of the progressive platform doesnt.Saying we should defund the police. I saw that message alone loose democrats elections in swing districts. Go into poor areas of major cities and ask folks in some of the worst crime ridden neighborhoods if theyd like to see more or less police. Saying we should have lighter sentences for property crime.

These morals that people hold come about due to the way that that person has experienced reality, and their identities have been shifted by this reality. The reality we live under in today's society is Capitalism and that way of living clouds judgements and alienates many people from their relationships, or at least the full potential of their relationships. This is called alienation by critical theorists. Connecting people back to an ideology where class analysis dominates their thinking would be impossible without community. Communities require interaction among their members. Without such interaction, humans can be prone to grandiose thinking, can get trapped by messaging akin to rugged individualism, or become angered by isolation. Argument, within reason and without violence, must be a central tenet of every human community. It is in these important conversations that hostilities can be amended or assuaged, and learned behaviors from the existing superstructures (Capitalism and its ugly cousins Patriarchy, White Supremacy, Homophobia, Xenophobia) can be combatted. Your take is unreasonable simply because a person brought up under capitalism can not awaken their own class consciousness, or discover theory, these changes in thinking don't emerge in a vat.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"They stayed home","title":"Where Did 6M Democrat Votes Go Between 2020 and 2024? | They Didn't Go To Deeznutz ??"},{"text":"Why are our elected officials listening to a non elected official??

It feels like an attempt to redirect the primacy in a moral hierarchy instead of an entreaty to set aside moral differences.When any resource is scarce (including money), the natural goal of those with access to the resource is to both maintain existing levels of access and increase acquisition of the resource as a hedge against potential future increased scarcity (one of the things that's led to the increase in cryptocurrency in an effort to get around the scarcity of fiat currencies, as well as their vulnerability to bad actors within high levels of government).At the end of the day, the \\"ultra wealthy\\" aren't doing anything wrong by being wealthy. As a cohort they're as likely to contain bad actors as any other cohort, but on a macro level are no better or worse than anyone else. Attempts to siphon off their wealth through taxes, regulations, or social unrest only come off as rank class warfare, which is ultimately rooted in jealousy.Within America, this is ultimately a non-starter, because it's baked into our culture AND laws to favor individual exceptionalism. Anyone can theoretically become wealthy or \\"ultra wealthy\\". Find a need, create a means to meet that need, and through innovation or skilled business &amp; social maneuvering, convince people that the means of meeting that need is still represented best through you. It's how current billionaires did it. Sam Walton in Walmart made the \\"best\\" one-stop-shop. Jeff Bezos made the \\"best\\" bookstore with the fastest shipping, then expanded to shipping other products. Bill Gates made the \\"best\\" computer operating system at a time when computers were just starting to fully penetrate middle-class America. Elon Musk made the \\"best\\" electric vehicle, and also got around American franchising laws that prevented OEMs from owning their own dealerships by exploiting a vagary in American law through which Teslas were able to operate under a different classification than \\"automobile\\", thus avoiding those franchise laws' restrictions.By nature the left and right are always going to argue, because while they have the same goal (improvement in the quality of American life, freedom from violence and theft, ability to maintain a particular quality of life), they have radically different approaches to that goal. As a consequence, efforts to remove that conflict are destined to fail, mandating that reluctant bipartisan compromise is the only way to achieve any kind of legislation in a country nearly 50/50 split between those two poles. Consequently, unifying the two against the \\"ultra wealthy\\" (who are significant financial contributors toward both sides, and as a result are relatively safe from being targeted by the very people leading each side) isn't something that'll happen. Practicality would then indicate the pointlessness of pursuing a goal that only seems to appeal to the fringes who think wealth is inherently bad, and often seem to instead favor absolute redistribution of wealth so everyone \\"has an equal amount\\" (which brings with it its own significant problems, outside the purview of this particular discussion).","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Manchin got away with it because he was in one of the reddest states in the US.

While it has never worked as Reagan said it would it has been a core ideology of the right in the US for over 40 years. What this means is that poorer people on the right continue to support policies that are best don't benefit them and usually harm them financially while it continues to be a benefit the wealth hoarders.Until the right stops embracing these ideas they continue to support wealth disaprity","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"I would say the left generally agrees.

When you ask a right wing person and a left wing person what the problems are they will often agree. The biggest issue is how each of them want to solve it.Right wing solutions aren't actually solutions. For financial problems their solutions are to cut programs that help people. They say this is because it will force them to work their way out of their problems but really it's because they don't want to help carry the burden of the misfortunate. For social issues their solutions are to pressure people into acting according to normative acceptable groups. Left wing solutions are actual solutions. Financial problems are solved by the redistribution of wealth from the ultra wealthy to the needy. We say this is because relieving some financial burdens will allow people to get on their feet and improve their conditions. This is born out in the data of countries who do this. Social issues are resolved by acceptance and inclusion. This also works but people like to pretend not being allowed to harass people until they act the way they want them too is an infringement on their freedoms. Left wing social framework allows each person to act according to their own values provided it does not infringe on another person's rights or violate the law. Using abortion as an example left wing policy allows people to get abortions and people who don't want abortions can simply not get one. Right wing social policy denies the autonomy of the people who want abortions. This is why \\"finding a middle ground\\" is so infuriating. Left wing policy is almost always starting from the middle ground and then forced to cede ground to the right under the pretense on middle ground. The left never advocated for forced abortions which would be the opposite position. They started at the middle ground.These two groups are diametrically opposed in how they aim to solve problems and can't just not fight each other.Certainly the ultra wealthy are favorable to the right wing because they can afford to exist in a world that doesn't provide for the needy and as a result they have a motivated interest in convincing people of the public that right wing policies are best. Unfortunately for everyone they are really good at it and so many people vote for people who will directly harm them with their policies.Left and right don't agree so we can't stop fighting each other but we should also try to take down the ultra wealthy.Short version.

I think that was our last possible chance to salvage 2024 given the huge disadvantage we started with. One of the most baffling parts of the 2024 campaign is that she and her team knew the whole time that she was behind. When you're behind, you can't afford to play a safe, no-risk campaign. It's possible she would've lost by a little more if it'd backfired. But she was on-track for a pretty surefire loss no matter what, so...Maybe had she gone rogue, resigned from the VP position, picked AOC as running mate, returned to her \\"Medicare for all\\" stance - then maybe it would have been a game-changer. But she had no time or legitimacy for that.Not sure she had to go to that extent. I think we Dems often conflate anti-establishment and progressive. For us, they're often framed as the same thing because the progressive wing of our party is the only one that's not totally lockstep with the hyper-establishment centrists currently running the party into the ground. But you can go bold and anti-establishment without going full-blown progressive. Look at how Bill Clinton and Obama messaged.I don't think she had to turn into maverick rogue agent Harris with Biden in her sights. But she had to acknowledge the disconnect between Biden's message and the electorate. Voters had been screaming about that for years and she she tried to just bulldoze ignore her way through. We can disagree on the best way to handle it, but I think we can all agree that giving voters the middle finger like Biden's team did and Harris continuing that stance is...high risk low reward.If I were on her team, I'd be workshopping statements like below from the milisecond she became the candidate:\\"I respect the president's vision for the future. He's worked to lay infrastructure and return jobs that will help us for generations to come. But his vision has been focused on the long term and I would've made time for Americans who are suffering here and now.

In the case of the American Right they believe in a nationalistic meritocracy, basically that the government should be used to prioritize American enterprise but that internally we should be meritocratic. They might be sympathetic to restricting how the ultra wealthy make money through leveraging international trade and labor, but they don't have a problem with the mere fact that they're ultra wealthy.The Left see hierarchies as bad and a necessary evil at best.

Within the right you have (at the very least) ~~neoliberals~~ neoliberal conservatives (edited after [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hhujbm/comment/m2u8s7x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button))  and traditionalists. These best describe politicians (and you will sometimes find each ideology across the bench a little) - but they also work as decent labels for people, albeit people knowing less about and having more of a mix of ideologies.Socialists will get behind your message any day of the week - whether they be communists, anarchists or even social democrats / democratic socialists, all agree on \\"rich people bad\\". Liberals... will hesitate. Because ultimately liberals want \\"kind capitalism\\". They wouldn't even really see a problem with the ultra wealthy if \\"kind capitalism\\" could be achieved.Traditionalists are ultimately less focused on class. There are numerous camps of traditionalists, obviously - some are even borderline monarchists or support an aristocracy, others are very religion focused. But so long as their social aims are met and society \\"returned\\" to its glory (whatever they perceive that to be) - they do not really care about the ultra-wealthy. They might see them as a current obstacle, but in the long run they aren't a problem. Neoliberal conservatives, on the other hand, are fundamentally opposed to what you are calling for - as they believe in and agree with the current world order as it is, they are the ones who constructed it after all. If you notice with Trump - it is the traditionalists who rallied behind him with \\"Make America Great Again\\" - and it was the neolibrals who hated him as \\"Never Trumpers\\" because he threatens the neoliberal world order (by threatening other countries with invasion, tariffs etc).Centrists tend to be a blend of liberals and neoliberals.So you could convince maybe 3/4s of the left/right political divide. But it would be a tenuous alliance - with the traditionalists and liberals likely to flake on you the moment they see a better opportunity.At the end of the day...we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy... is a left-wing statement.If those from the other political ideologies agree with it - it is because either it currently it aligns with their goals as the ultra-wealthy are an obstacle *or* they have a little bit of a socialist mindset buried somewhere within them.

The ultra wealthy are easy to hate because they are very public and it makes everyone very aware of the class divide, but what do you actually hope to accomplish by taking them down? What do you actually think would change in society?IMO most of the issues that people get upset about are not the result of anything the ultra wealthy do. Most things are the results of systematic choices that were made long ago that we are just dealing with, and they have figured out how to profit off of.Take the UHR CEO: He did profit off of a broken system that incentivizes denying care to people in need, but he didn't set up the system. Of course, he would likely prefer it continued since it enriched him, but taking him down didn't exactly take down the system, or even change it at all. If we took down Jeff Bezos would small business suddenly flourish and Amazon would go away?To me it seems like if we want to have real positive change again the left and the right need to learn to work together again and actually make compromise. The real issue that is plaguing the US is that the sides are so adversarial that when all parts of the government aren't in control of one party then nothing ever gets done or fixed. The health care industry in the US does need more done so we get better results without bankrupting so many people but that simply won't happen, regardless of who is in charge of those healthcare companies, until the two sides are willing to work together again towards a common goal (which means it likely won't happen in the next few decades).","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"You Go Dr Jill!!!!","title":"How vengeful Jill Biden is urging 'depressed' Joe to 'burn the whole thing down' in their final days... with Obama, Kamala and Pelosi at the top of her 'naughty list'"},{"text":"They don't know anything.","title":"Bernie Sanders Blasts Elon Musk For Helping Tank Budget Deal"},{"text":"It really shouldnt be.

You can't just eat the rich, you need to make it so that they don't come back the same way. This requires systematic change on a national scale. Many in the right wing of American politics don't seem to agree that the issue is Capitalist structures. They just think that the specific people who are at the top are bad, and if they are removed then things will all be better. If folks like that have significant say in any reordering of society, when the time comes to make new systems and new institutions, then they will very likely be the same ones in place now. It will be a turning back the clock, but not a changing of the game. For a true, unified, working class revolution (or systematic reform that meaningfully alters current structures) both sides need to be on the same page that the systems themselves are the issue, not the individuals within the systems (although of course individuals can be shitty too). Until the majority of the working class agrees to this bedrock concept, any meaningful change is doomed to fail as the wealthy will peel off those who are in it for their own personal circumstances and any movement will die by a death of a thousand cuts. The left and right wings of the working class _should_ be working together, but if they're not pulling in the same basic direction then they will end up just ripping things apart.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Btw this is just trying to distract you and keep you on left vs right rather than up vs down.

They called Buttigeig the winner if the Iowa caucus which wasn't true.   That prevented Bernie from building any momentum going into NH.\\nThey had very few debates and scheduled them opposite NBA playoffs, intentional move to prevent Bernie's message from getting out.  \\nOnce voters hear Bernie speak they like him.

In addition, the administration required construction contractors to enter into project labor agreements, helping support good value for public investments and creating high-quality jobs on large projects.

We really need age maximums and both sides are too afraid of alienating elderly people who vote so this shit just continues","title":"How the White House Functioned With a Diminished Biden in Charge"},{"text":"Unfortunately, there isn't an easy an answer because such a large portion of our public is ill informed and barely or doesn't care. The former is hard to remedy since it's a combination of needing to improve the education system, something that requires Democrats in control, and needing to dominate the messaging in media and social media when Republicans have long had an advantage. The latter is due to many people being very busy, then wanting to escape in entertainment or something else when they have free time, not follow politics. People in these political discussions daily are a small percent of the population but can believe many are like them or fairly close. Or they're not busy but have an abundance of options vying for their attention that they find more appealing than keeping up with politics and related matters. And some of those are just comfortable enough in life and take things for granted, assuming how things are is maybe the absolute norm, that it can't get worse so they can nitpick about something like the price of a bag of Doritos and their favorite fast food meal. Democrats need to keep the above in mind. You have to really make sure people are aware of when they're even trying to help and what they have done in the past as well. It doesn't matter if it's successful or not, just make sure they are very much aware. Again, it's hard with the way our media is but one example with the inflation, Biden and Democrats could have made a big show about setting up an Inflation Task Force, keep talking about how they're trying to combat this even if that Task Force is really powerless as the main actions require congress (but the task force would be submitting reports to congress). Biden did talk about price gouging and tried to get a bill passed but I think it came a bit too late and was not getting much attention, sure most of the public (see above) were even unaware of what he said and tried. Likewise, the party needs to figure some way to educate people on how things work. Something like School House Rocks but not just aimed at kids and such civic educational shorts need to appear on social media as well, not just TV. Party branding on that would need to be as minimal as possible if any directly at all, to reduce skepticism. Of course many would point out it's coming from Democrats but no way around that, doubt Mark Cuban or some big company would finance such a thing independently, no way a non-profit could afford to do that, and highly unlikely Republicans (and ElonTrump) would agree if it were attempted via congress. I also think they need to step back from sounding like the grown ups and defenders of our government because it makes them come off as the \\"establishment,\\" which a large portion of the population seems to mindlessly be resistant to and they're not aligning left, they're being picked up by Republicans who look like the rebel bad asses disrupting the old guard \\"establishment\\" (Democrats). They don't need to attack the government like Republicans do but just try to change the messaging to appear less as if they're the party of the \\"establishment.\\" Also, unfortunately, many people seem to lack empathy on a larger scale, many are just selfish, yet Democrats are seen as the party of helping the worst off and marginal people. They shouldn't change on that but need to change how it's presented, that they are trying to improve everyone's lives as opposed to people getting the impression they are taking money from them to help others, some of which may be taking advantage of that. Again, difficult to do with how the media is but I think more can be done.","title":"Opinion | What Do Democrats Need to Do? Act Like an Opposition Party.

No county using the other 2 machines shows anywhere near this leadSummary: Trump's team stole the tabulator software, Musk joined in and as Tech Bro?? he had the connection needed to find someone who could crack it. Voting centers got cleared out due to bomb threats and once the tabulators were mysteriously left alone with potential Lion of Judah election workers they suddenly started coming up hard for Trump, including an astronomical increase in bullet ballots for Trump (typical average: 0.3%, 2024 average: 10%). This is why Musk has total control over Trump now, he has him by the balls as the orchestrator. This is also why you can ask so many of your friends and family in swing states to check their mail/absentee ballot status and it will almost certainly still be uncounted, because the tabulators stopped counting real votes around 8pm.I would also add that in a painful cruel twist of irony, if this is indeed what happened, Democrats fucked themselves in the end. Because the only way to expose this would be hand counting ballots, which Georgian republicans, unlikely to know of the monumentally treasonous Trump/Musk rigging, tried to do and Democrats sued and stopped it.

Democrats \\"going right\\" was what got them back in finally after a serious drought. Over those next two years, Democrats were very cautious and not very progressive.Republicans took the Congress after forty years out directly because voter turnout in the 1990's plummeted--the same way Republicans held the government in the 1920's BTW.Once those who bothered to vote preferred reaction over progress, both parties competed for that. That's reality. The less popular party moves toward the more popular party.That period more-or-less continued until 2018 when a Democratic landslide gave Democrats room to move significantly toward the progressive side. But even that turned out to be \\"a momentary break then a quick hard turn to the reactionary side.\\" Republicans reached record turnout in 2020 and actually took seats from the Democrats in the House, then in 2022, Republicans again attained record turnout and took back the House.During that \\"momentary break\\" we had two years of stunning progress with a minimal 50-50 Senate.In 2024, Republicans yet again had record turnout. In 2020, for the first time ever, support for House Republicans passed 20% of the population. In 2024, turnout went even higher. Meantime, Donald Trump increased his vote total even more that Republicans did generally. Republican popularity just keeps growing. In a representative government, choices by the marginal voters who decide outcomes is the most important thing determining the direction of the government.","title":"Democrats Face 'Gerontocracy' Crisis Amid Ageing Leadership"}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],O={key:0},R={key:1};function j(t,i,e,c,r,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 public opinion 🥳")])],-1)),n("div",P,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.visiblePoems,(l,g)=>(o(),k(m,{key:g,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(o(),a("span",R,"Loading...")):(o(),a("span",O,"See more"))],8,E)):T("",!0)])}const G=d(W,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-1ee9fce7"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/46.md","filePath":"quotes/46.md"}'),F={name:"quotes/46.md"},U=Object.assign(F,{setup(t){return(i,e)=>(o(),a("div",null,[u(G)]))}});export{L as __pageData,U as default};
