However, not every single bit of online reactionary culture makes it into the real world; see, for instance, that Ron DeSantis Sonnenrad/American Psycho video. My guess would be that the median American probably has the same level of racism towards Indian people that they did in 2014 or so, and the people who haven't are either terminally online assholes or tech-sector assholes.

Let's try to break this down a little.First, the Democratic Party is a right-wing party.  Is it more \\"progressive\\" than the Republican Party?  It doesn't matter.  If you condone capitalism, even regulated capitalism, you condone the profit motive and place profits before people.Identity politics, that sit at the core of the Democratic Party, are not wrong in and of themselves.  Of course it is good policy to recognize the very legitimate interests of groups like Blacks, Hispanics, women, gays, etc.  These are real people with real concerns about how they are treated in society.The problem with the Democratic Party, though, is that it makes identity politics the core of its political vision.  This is a tragic mistake.  Whether intentional or not, and I think it is very intentional, the party uses this \\"pandering\\" to completely obscure the class war.  As long as the billionaire class and the mega-corporations have disproportionate power to we, the people, there can be no democracy and our inhumanity to the weakest among us will worsen.With this background, I define \\"the left\\" as a fundamentally socialist ideology.  This means the complete tearing down of capitalism.  It does not mean \\"regulated capitalism\\" nor does it mean handing out capitalism's table scraps to the poor.  We are not talking here about a welfare state.  We are talking about a social, economic, and political system that puts people first.This means that people, both workers and the public, control our workplaces.  This means that stockholders no longer exist or, if they do, they no longer have a voice in the affairs of corporations.  The idea is less about an economic system and more about democratic people power.As for the OP's question, there is no \\"strong\\" leftist movement in the US.  But, and this is critically important, there is a huge leftist sentiment in the US.  Do you get that?  The recent CEO assassination showed what is hiding just below the surface.We also should not suggest that there is no \\"leftist movement\\" in the US.  I voted for Jill Stein (again!!).  She got something like one percent of the vote or whatever.  Pathetic.  It would be easy to conclude the US left does not exist.  This would be a major mistake.  The US left is a non-existent political force but the groundwork is being laid everyday and the status quo is rotting and collapsing.  It will take time, maybe more time than we have, but the US left will definitely emerge.One of the most essential elements of this great change is the presence of alternative media.  The big corporate news sources are collapsing and people are looking for alternatives.  Those alternatives are primarily from socialist-leaning outlets.Ultimately, my view is that the US left cannot become a potent political force without better leadership.  Jill Stein is great but not even close to effective enough to bring about change.My 2028 ticket, as unlikely as it might be, would be to have Briahna Joy Gray head a ticket with a labor leader, perhaps Shawn Fain, as a VP.  There are all kinds of reasons this will never happen and probably wouldn't succeed.  Still, until I hear a better ticket, that's the one I'm promoting.Sorry for the long rant!","title":"Do you think any strong leftist movement died with Bernie 2020?"},{"text":"\\\\That would be like making school shootings or obesity the hallmark of American identity or cherrypicking some one off incident from Alabama to assert that Americans love their cousins a bit too much.?Those kinds of comments are made all the time and are widely applauded.","title":"CMV: Racism against Indians is getting dangerously normalized"},{"text":"Birds of War!","title":"The guy who died in the Tesla Cybertruck explosion was a Trump fan and a former Army Special Forces Green Beret"},{"text":"Another Sharpie hurricane map time as hell never admit being wrong, just double down on his own alternative facts (lies).","title":"Trump falsely pushes anti-immigrant claims after New Orleans attack by US-born Army vet"},{"text":"We never really left slavery, just rebranded it so poor white people would play along....","title":"Trump's going to crash the economy"},{"text":"Im on the side of better safe than sorry.

Soldiers have always had less in the way of civil rights and liberties.  This is necessary, obviously.  They cannot be advocating against the Commander in Chief, current or future (or past, really).

Especially if you repeat nonsense about sexual danger every time when discussing us.

In the same way that Martin Luther King knew that it wasnt the klansman but the white moderate who stood in the way of civil rights progression, its the cisgender moderates who will decide our fate. Its not too late yet to do the right thing, when all you white cishet moderates decide to stand up for a group progress happens fast, when you stand in the way progress, bigots win.

Since 2000 Republican's have had control of both houses (or a tie in the senate) with the exception of Obama's double majority for 2 years and Biden's first half, essentially 80% of the time. Dems have rarely had more than 2 years in that time frame without the GOP taking one house. It's simply, the party in power is who's guiding legislation at the end of the day, the minority has to negotiate and usually concede parts of their bill. But at the end of the day I place a large amount of blame on all political news media as they do not inform in order to educate about an issue and come to your own conclusion, but 'inform' with opinions and talking points to guide a conversation. Journalism was considered the 4th branch of government for its ability to hold accountability to power, and now the largest media providers aim to please (investors/owners/sources) instead of aim for truth. So much of political awareness is being able to view an issue from multiple perspectives and with Sinclair and others, it's largely an echo chamber.

How is your life changed if you learn of it on Sunday, reading a *high quality news source*, rather than reading it on Thursday at 10:33PM after he tweeted it? Aside from outbreaks of war, active attacks, etc, there is no reason to consume news instantly, unless its related to your job (youre a communications person, you yourself work in politics, youre a bonds trader, etc).Basically, it may feel like burying your head in the sands, *but its not*.

In a nominal transition it is presumed that the documents were signed and the 4000 people in the security clearances que will be ready for the Vise-President Elects administration on Jan 20. Which would satisfy the election requirements. Since that wasnt done the concern would be Why?It is commonly accepted that the weakest point of the US Democracy is the Transition period between different Administrations as key positions are not yet filled.  From WikiResponsibilitiesKey responsibilities of a presidential transition include the identification and vetting of candidates for approximately 4,000 non-civil service positions in the U.S. government whose service is at the pleasure of the president; arranging the occupancy of executive residences including the White House, One Observatory Circle, and Camp David; liaising with the United States Strategic Command for receipt of the Gold Codes; and briefing senior civil service personnel about a new administrations policy priorities.[10]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidential_transition_of_Donald_TrumpIts concerning that  in this current Transition all that preparation was not completed. One would think that an incoming president would be excited and eager to join the process and begin briefing senior civil service personnel about a new administrations policy priorities.[10]. Red Flag Behavior - avoiding background checks. \\nNo POTUS ELECT NO V POTUS ELECT Article 3 of the 20th amendment states in part the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified.This could be a long process and the acting president would be hamstrung Im as having to run a proper Transition starting from scratch because of security clearances and the latest version of the President Transition Act. As far as timing goes, the house would have to select a speaker of the house, and swear in every body and then get ready for the Joint session on the 6th Monday at 1pm. I imagine an interested party could file for an injunction at the Supreme Court, for a Writ of Quo Warranto on the basis that the MOUs that were signed after the deadline are invalid. Void Ab Initio. I would attach John Roberts 2015 State of Judiciary report that listed a 4 point test to determine Good Faith and Fair Dealing between litigating parties to insure a fair and speedy trial.  (1) encourage greater cooperation among counsel; (2) focus discoverythe process of obtaining information within the control of the opposing partyon what is truly necessary to resolve the case; (3) engage judges in early and active case management; and (4) address serious new problems associated with vast amounts of electronically stored information.A really good read from J Robertshttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/2015year-endreport.pdfAnd point to Trumps documented behavior of running the clock to avoid accountability and engaging in brinksmanship which harmed the countries national security readiness. And intentionally being in contempt of the 1963 Presidential Transitional Act. https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/2015year-endreport.pdf\\nTheoretically, This would invalidate all the elector college votes as being Void Ab Initio and immediately expose Trump to legal liability of all the cases he had been avoiding .Its conceivable that all 50 states could see state level action like that. This would be wishful thinking, but at this point it could be a template filing form.","title":"I believe I spotted grounds to Disqualify Trump under the 20th Amendment. Call your Congress critters.

If they halve the poverty rate and grow the economy and reduce the suicide rate or record drastic improvements in other metrics, than why is that not an unambiguously good thing for the course of the country?Hypothetically? Sure. I don't think you will find too many people who think that a person could commit a crime but still be a good person who does good things. But there is obviously a huge spectrum here. Someone who cheated on their spouse but saved 100 million people is probably a net good for society. Someone who gave every citizen a free candy bar but also embezzled billions in tax payer money is a net negative. But your view implies we shouldn't even have that discussion which is absurd.But of course the much bigger problem here is that these things are hypothetical...in reality it's hard for voters to predict what politicians will actually do. We have to make a choice between who we think will actually do or accomplish the things we want, versus someone who is lying or not capable. In this context, it seems pretty obvious why someone's character and trustworthiness is relevant to the discussion. If someone is untrustworthy in general why would you trust them with the public good? If someone is unethical in general how can you trust them to make ethical decisions in government? If someone is selfish or a criminal, how can you trust them to be selfless and to fairly apply the law? Finally, I can't really look past the simple fact that part of being an effective leader/representative is being cooperative, trustworthy, and stable. We expect these people to create peaceful domestic and foreign relationships and treaties, look after our public interests, and navigate unexpected and chaotic situations. Insulting foreign leaders, being untrustworthy, or being corrupt undermines these goals. So yes of course their personality and trust are relevant. Even if you give Trump credit for the economy in his first term, you can't just ignore the amount of discord he sowed, the damage he did to our foreign relationships, the corrupt use of tax funds and the abuse of power for his personal gains. These are totally unnecessary. Surely he did not have to be an asshole in order to improve the economy? How much better would that term be without all the scandals and unnecessary insults? As another example, Musk sells a lot of cars but if he wasn't such an asshole, he would probably sell even more cars. Right? These things do actually matter because the world is made of people and people are more willing to cooperate and follow when they are being treated fairly and kindly. Given an equally competent choice, surely you would pick the leader who is both capable and good over the leader who is capable and an asshole. Your view implies that we shouldn't bother considering better alternatives.","title":"CMV: discussions about a politician's personality and personal life is irrelevant, pointless and stupid (like the media buzz around corruption scandals)"},{"text":"He's a weathervane: he follows whatever the last person says to him.

Meanwhile the shipbuilding industry, which he also says he supports and which has given significant financial support to Republican causes, is struggling to overcome an acute worker shortage. Immigrants have been critical to helping fill the gaps.According to a Navy report from last year, several major shipbuilding programs are years behind schedule, owing largely to a lack of workers. The shortfall is so severe that warship production is down to its lowest level in a quarter century.Shipbuilders and the government have poured millions of dollars into training and recruiting American workers, and, as part of a bipartisan bill just introduced in the Senate, they have proposed to spend even more. Last year the Navy awarded nearly $1 billion in a no-bid contract to a Texas nonprofit to modernize the industry with more advanced technology in a way that will make it more attractive to workers. The nonprofit has already produced splashy TV ads for submarine jobs. One of its goals is to help the submarine industry hire 140,000 new workers in the next 10 years. We build giants, one of its ads beckons. It takes one to build one.Still, experts say that these robust efforts have so far resulted in nowhere near enough workers for current needs, let alone a workforce large enough to handle expanded production. Were trying to get blood from a turnip, said Shelby Oakley, an analyst at the Government Accountability Office. The domestic workforce is just not there.In the meantime, the industry is relying on immigrants for a range of shipyard duties, with many working jobs similar to those on a construction site, including on cleanup crews and as welders, painters and pipefitters. And executives worry that any future immigration crackdown or restrictions on legal immigration, including limits on asylum or temporary protected status programs, could cause disruptions that would further harm their capacity for production....When asked how the second Trump administration will increase shipbuilding while limiting immigration, a spokesperson for Trumps transition team only doubled down on the president-elects deportation promises, saying they would focus enforcement on illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers.A few days after Trump won the election, a group of undocumented shipyard welders leaving a Hispanic grocery store near the port in Houma, Louisiana, expressed a dim view when asked what they thought lay ahead. One man, who declined to provide his name, broke into a nervous laugh and blurted, Well, we could be deported. Another man, a welder from the Mexican state of Coahuila whod been working in the U.S. for about two years, also declined to give his name but said he worried about losing the life hed managed to build in this country.Immigrants over the generations have been the lifeblood of the nation, and today's situation is not so different. With every generation there seems to be a pushback against them by more established groups, whether it's those of Irish, Jewish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Somali, Indian, Mexican, or other ethnic origins. It's unfortunate that it's difficult for people to realize the benefits that newcomers bring to society as a whole, especially for societies that are looking to grow rather than to shrink. This is also especially critical when looking at infrastructure build out and other labor intensive industries such as farming, healthcare, and construction. There needs to be a recognition for the people who are doing this work, and a reasonable path created for them to join in the society that they are helping to create and support.","title":"Trump Has Promised to Build More Ships.

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone.

This country doesn't appreciate what it hadMy dad's a union guy, electrician. I've always voted pro-union because I truly believe in them, but this rapid turn towards Trump of Union members has really reminded me of something really shitty that happened when I was little. Growing up we had two cars, both American. Dodge Omni and Ford Taurus. The Omni was a total piece of shit, it was always breaking down. The Taurus was slightly better but also a piece of shit; the electrical system was always failing so the heat would get stuck on or the windows wouldn't go down. Both total lemons. Both too expensive for what you get. Eventually the Omni died and when we looked at how much we had put into repairs for that thing, we ended up paying almost 2x the total purchase cost of the car, just for repairs. My dad said \\"enough\\" and bought a Camry. But he refused to drive it to work, because \\"my coworkers would kill me\\". One day, the Taurus dies, won't even start. Dad has to get to work so he drives the Camry. At the end of his shift he comes back out and they had totally destroyed the car. Flipped it *upside-down*. The \\"average man\\" in this country has always been total garbage. Can you imagine a guy spending every last dime on shitty cars, finally buying one that works, and then promptly having it destroyed by your coworkers simply because it wasn't American? Utter garbage mentality. So the Union turn towards Trump really doesn't surprise me. The average American is an angry and spiteful being, and his hatred really resonates with them. I hope they get what they want.","title":"Unions Brace Themselves as Trump Prepares to Defang Labor Board"},{"text":" There seems very little to commend the cybertruck.Explosives in any other truck and the bystander would have been killed in the blast.","title":"A Tesla Cybertruck exploded at the entrance to Trump International Las Vegas"},{"text":"Ironically I was downvoted so I guess hiding my words is a thing.","title":"All my replies on liberal/socialist boards get removed."},{"text":"It's a cult.

The whole conversation is one of contextual phrasing.  Simple fact is, if you think abortion is \\"baby murder\\" there are absolutely 0 justifiable cases for abortion.  In private conversations, they will absolutely cop to this.  When discussing their motivations for their position, they will all but say it.However, it turns out that telling people \\"God wants rape victims to have been raped and to carry the baby to term\\" doesn't sell particularly well outside of pretty radical circles.  So they lie and say they support exemptions, knowing that if they get their foot in the door they can slowly pare those exceptions back.Its the same reason why they will ceaselessly gesture at 'late term abortions.'  It sells the idea better to people who don't actually think about it.  If you think about it, the idea of women commonly waiting til 8.5 months into a pregnancy before having an *elective* termination is obviously absurd.  However, the argument lets them get their foot in the door for passing regulations around how long into a pregnancy before you are no longer allowed to have an abortion.  This lets them springboard into a de facto ban via a multipronged approach of early cutoffs* and red tape.*Good pregnancy tests can usually detect if you're pregnant ~2 weeks after conception but most women probably aren't going to know until they miss their period.  This means many women won't even start considering if they should get an abortion until 2-6 weeks into their pregnancy.  Thus the 6 week restriction is effectively an outright ban.","title":"Newborns are being left in dumpsters in Texas, but Republicans don't seem to care"},{"text":"Mitch the B!tch!

But this coming year, she will have a different perch from which she can represent them, as a state senator in New Mexico.Nava, 36, a Democrat, is one of several barrier-breaking politicians elected this fall at the same time as Trump. They will represent constituencies that his policies have targeted in the past, including Muslims and transgender Americans. While they generally wont have direct authority to try to halt Trumps actions, their election offers a platform for new voices to speak out against those actions.I think it provides an opportunity to bring people to the table that have never been at those tables, Nava told the Globe. They have been chopped on, theyve been discussed on, policies have been made that impact them but theyve never had a seat. ... And I feel a great amount of responsibility for that.Nava got DACA status in early 2016, granting her protection from deportation and the ability to work as an undocumented immigrant who was brought to the US when she was a child under the Obama-era program. Months later, she called her father in fear following Trumps victory about what his election would mean after he campaigned heavily on anti-immigration policies.He said, Cindy, we have to continue working each and every day regardless of whos in power, we need to continue putting food on the table and making ends meet, and regardless of whos in power I will continue working, Nava said. So to see that strength and resilience in my father has been really meaningful and impactful, and its just the way of life Ive seen my immigrant family take, always.Trump in his first term did try to rescind DACA, a move overturned by the courts, and enacted numerous hard-line immigration policies, including the family separations at the border that drew widespread condemnation. In his second term, he has pledged to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.Nava gained citizenship in 2021 through marriage, and in 2022 became the first former DACA recipient to get an appointment from?the White House, serving as a senior policy adviser at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She stepped down to run for her office.Nava said she is waiting to see what policies Trump puts in place and will wait to respond accordingly, noting she doesnt just represent immigrants but all of her constituents.Its a theme echoed by many of the history makers, who embrace the ways they have broken ground but emphasize that they did so because of the message they carried that resonated with broad support.Im here to represent all the communities, said Democrat Hanadi Nadeem, the first Muslim woman elected to the Nevada Legislature. I believe in equality, in inclusiveness, in unity, and Im committed to work for the welfare of all Nevadans.","title":"They made history with their elections.

Theres a reason. Theres a reason for this, theres a reason education sucks, and its the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed. Its never gonna get any better. Dont look for it.

I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. Theyve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they dont want: They dont want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They dont want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. Theyre not interested in that. That doesnt help them. Thats against their interests. Thats right. They dont want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly theyre getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They dont want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now theyre coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? Theyll get it. Theyll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you aint in it. You and I are not in the big club.

All day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted folks.

They dont give a fuck about you. They dont give a fuck about you. They don't care about you at all -- at all -- at all. And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care.

The one feature it has over traditional rental car companies is that if you're set on a specific make and model, using Turo would guarantee it since you're renting a specific vehicle from an individual who owns it.  Whereas with Hertz, Budget, Avis, etc. while you reserve a specific category, the particular model isn't usually guaranteed and you could be bumped to another category if they're out.  (A few companies have guarantees for certain models but it's not widespread.)If the LV terrorist was wanting to send a message linking Trump and Elon then that would be a motive to use Turo and find a Cyber Truck specifically.  As for the NOLA terrorist, we don't know if he wanted an electric truck specifically or just a full size truck or if it was random what he chose.  Trucks are big and heavy of course and EVs tend to be heavier still.  That could be why, since he planned to run people over.  But we simply don't know at this point.Same with Ft.

He didn't like reading but he *did* like feeling clever when solving puzzles, which sounding out a word was, so I leveraged that as much as possible.I remember one time him complaining about learning to read being hard, and I said, \\"I know it's hard.  I've done it three times.  And it was especially hard in college, when I could read anything I wanted in English without effort but I had to do exactly what you're doing, sounding out letter by letter, including sounds I'd never said before.  And besides, you're cheating.\\"And he snapped to attention and looked surprised, and said, \\"How am I *cheating*?\\"I said, \\"You *speak* German.  You can get most of the way through a word and guess it.  For the first two weeks I had to sound out every word letter by letter, and when I was done I didn't even know if it was a real word or what it meant!  You already know the word!\\"That got a big giggle.In the early days, if he brought me a book to read to him, 50/50 chance it was English or German.  And honestly I hadn't spoken or read German in a decade, so even when I was doing voices I was just mostly faking the cadence.  But it came back to me pretty fast.And when he'd get tired of sounding out words in English, I'd switch to a German book, because German orthography is *much* closer to phonetic than English.  The language regularly updates its orthography to reflect pronunciation (most famously the same year I started studying it, so that I learned the old spelling right as it was no longer being used.  Thanks, German).Funny side effect, I'd read with him with my finger under each word, and I'd often throw him small words to read, and occasionally a really long word as a joke to tease him.  Not once did he ever shy away from a long word in English, and often I had to tell him I was joking and that I'd read the word because it wasn't fair because it couldn't be sounded out.On the other hand, I did get to watch him go from being able to sound out single letters, to being able to read and sound out two letters at a time (for example, the word \\"know\\" with its silent k, German *kennen*) to finally being able to sound out three letters at a time (for example, German *sch* is English *sh* but breathier.)  So that was really fun.Of course, once reading was fun, he loved reading.  And that was another pitch.  \\"You *have* to read what your school assigns you.  And some things you'll love, some things you'll hate, and some things you would have never tried before but you find out you like it.  *But*, once you can read quickly, you can get those out of the way... and then you can read *anything* you want.  You'll have plenty of time for it.\\"","title":"Kids' low reading scores are 'a 5-alarm fire,' says DOGE's Ramaswamy.

In my opinion, as a 16 year elementary school teacher, it does not coincide with natural childhood development. While the standards themselves are great, its too advanced too soon. We dont put any value on learning basic information like phonics, vocabulary, grammar, spelling, computation, accumulation of scientific and geographical facts and information. Rote memorization is looked down upon. Instead there is all this analyzing and synthesizing before even mastering basic concepts. Kids are told to write a paragraph in kindergarten before they have mastered the letters and phonemes. Why are there math word problems talking about paying mortgages and bill collectors at such a young age? Some kids can handle it, however the majority cannot. I believe the classical education I had in public school was more than sufficient. My daughter started at a school, in fifth grade, that models the classical curriculum and I saw a vast improvement in a matter of a year with her reading, math and writing skills. Now she is a senior with a 4.3 GPA and college credits from her AP courses. Funny thing is that I laugh sometimes because I can tell she is still lacking in some phonics skills from that early trash education.I can talk all day about this. However, I am also a Special Education teacher. There seems to be more and more kids having or acquiring learning disabilities (thats another topic). I believe my team gets a lot of our funding from the DOEd, so I would hate to see it go because it is really helpful for many children and legally required.","title":"Kids' low reading scores are 'a 5-alarm fire,' says DOGE's Ramaswamy.

I've not only heard this from teachers, parents, economists, and generally most of the educated people that I know; but also verified that it is consistent with common sense.In general, public goods suffer when they're also expected to be profitable. Healthcare, fire departments, police, military, libraries, social security, education: none of these work as well in for-profit models because eventually every company reaches a point where it is willing to hurt it's customers (financially or otherwise) in order to make more money.If we don't have the option of not using the services a company provides, then there's no supply/demand dynamic to keep prices in check. If the government caps prices (or they simply reach a point where people can't pay any more), companies will turn to slashing budgets to increase profits. (Remember a few weeks ago when Blue Cross Blue Shield wanted to put a limit on anesthesia for surgery?) If you manage to cap prices **and** mandate quality of service (which is much harder to do and easier to get around since quality can be so subjective) then what you've got is a government-run utility with a whole lot of extra steps (and angry, profitless shareholders).It's a bad idea to privatize education just like it would be a bad idea for the government to take over the automotive industry.

I used to always just have a kneejerk \\"corporation bad\\" reaction when I heard that word, but it turns out that it is actually a much more interesting system and something that I think could actually work very well in the modern world if we implemented it properly. Below is a quick explanation. I had previously written under a different thread for anyone interestedThere's a political system called corporatism that does have corporations controlling policy but it's actually a bit more interesting than it appears just from the name. It's actually more similar to stakeholder capitalism than to the current systemThe idea is basically that interest groups (corporations) should be directly involved in policy with the state existing more as a mediating force between different interest groups. The thing that makes this interesting is that all people would belong to their various interest groups as well and theoretically this gives everyone a seat at the table whether they are large corporations or towns, neighborhoods, churches, or any other social structure who's members have interests of their own. You can think of these interest groups as being like unions.This is different from liberal democracy because under a liberal democracy these interest groups are not able to sit at the same table. The voters are expressing their interests by way of voting, the corporations are expressing their interests by paying politicians before anyone gets to vote. This has obviously resulted in an unbalanced system where the only things the voters are able to vote about are the scraps that lobbyists didn't care enough about to pay for. Theoretically if people were treated like interest groups instead of like voting bases and interest groups were directly involved in government, then that would mean everyone is actually playing the same game for once. The different interest groups that would be affected by something would send representatives to negotiate for their groups interests while the state mediated and moderated with the aim of making sure all interests are fairly considered.The ideas behind corporatism do have issues, some strains more than others, but historically these types of structures have been common and pretty successful. Scandinavian countries are often cited as a modern example of a type of corporatist system. It is an interesting idea, and I think at least worthy of discussion. If properly implemented, it seems that it may be a better way to run a society that aims to represent the will be the people and not just the will of those with huge amounts of money.This is a pretty good video about this subject?[The Corporate State: What Is Corporatism?

He has been sharing?[far-right memes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp35w0kj2y4o)?and?[conspiracy theories](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/musk-election-misinformation-x-officials-twitter-voting-rcna176938)?even though he has direct political power in a way he never has had before.Musks critics are divided over what really drives the man. Some see complex tactics behind all his moves C even his purchase of Twitter for a vast overpayment of $44bn (35bn), which they insist now was part of a grand plan to install himself in the inner circle of a second Trump presidency. Musks seemingly chaotic interventions do have a habit of supporting the financial interests of his business and himself, but they are also sometimes just erratic.Others see in him a desperate need for adulation, perhaps even?to be loved. His constant interactions with fans online and his obvious delight when he is cheered on stage speak to this.The mystery of which of the two most drives him might not be solved, though the obvious answer is surely that its both C by hitching his wagon to that of Trump, Musk can satisfy both goals at once.Predictably, many liberals in America fear what both will do together C and whether Musk will shift even further to the right. While those fears are credible, it is not the only way things could go: both have famously volatile tempers and large egos, and a fallout between the two men is a distinct possibility.Should that happen, Musks course could change dramatically. He enters 2025 as?[Trumps first buddy](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856073530137526564), by its end, he could be a fierce adversary.","title":"Elon Musk could still abandon Donald Trump - and use his powers for good"},{"text":"This will end in Netflix ??","title":"Trump Cabinet picks ordered to stay off social media amid ugly MAGA visa battle"},{"text":"Big guy theyre already set for life ??","title":"Driver killed, 7 others injured after Cyber truck Explodes outside Trump Tower in Las Vegas The driver pulled up, stopped right outside the front doors, and remained in the vehicle with their foot on the brake, and detonated explosives.

I 100% believe the statistic is true. I'm just curious where the statistic was falling when these adults left the school system. Like an adult in their 30's graduated Highschool sometime in the 2000s were test scores showing that 54% of 18 year old's in that time period never progressed beyond Middle School (indicating the problem is the education system, which I agree we have completely neglected) or did they leave the system a higher reading level and then over time had their ability fall due to lack of use?As I said, this is an abysmal statistic. Even worse when you realize that 20% of Americans (so almost half of this group) are at or below a Level 1 reading level (and I don't think anyone got out of school at a level 3+ and fell to at or below a level one unless something like an injury or illness impacted their cognitive abilities). The whole point of my comment was to try and suss out the cause of the 54%. Most people jump to it being the school system being poor (and that is for sure a contributing factor and could be THE factor). I'm just curious how many people graduate at a higher level and slip backwards due to lack of use of the skill vs having never developed the skill at all. To be honest, I had to do some digging to understand exactly what the criteria is. I'm not sure if the PIAAC level map to grade or not. The study I saw said 54% of American adults (which for some reason also includes 16 and 17 year olds) \\"lack literacy proficiency\\". Not sure if the 6th grade equivalent is buried in there or if it was your attempt to provide context so that readers would better understand your point. It sounds like \\"literacy proficiency\\" is defined as being level 3+ which means: Adults at these levels can be considered proficient at working with information and ideas in texts. They have a range of higher literacy skills from the ability to understand, interpret, and synthesize information across multiple, complex texts to the ability to evaluate the reliability of sources and infer sophisticated meanings and complex ideas from written sourcesThat's very different that what I had assumed \\"read below a 6th grade level\\" meant. I was only looking at what they should be able to comprehend at that a 6th grade level but the actual definition includes interpretation, inference, and evaluation of the reliability of sources. I would have thought those were more 9th-12th grade items so I wasn't considering them when writing my initial post. I 100% believe that 54% of adult American's don't have the ability to meet the requirements they used in the analysis.","title":"Kids' low reading scores are 'a 5-alarm fire,' says DOGE's Ramaswamy.

Sometimes it actually shocks me that I'm the age I am because I don't realize how much time has passed. In my case I can tell it's because I'm numb. I have PTSD and severe emotional numbing. I just don't feel anymore. This makes me more of a bystander in life. It's difficult to actively participate in one's life when one is numb inside. Emotional numbing makes every day feel the same. Today feels the exact same as yesterday and tomorrow will be the exact same. Because of this you don't have any points to mark time passing. Kind of like when you're on vacation for two weeks. You don't always realize it's the weekend because you don't have the work week to make the weekend more noticeable. All the days are the same which makes them all kind of blur together.

A 6th grade reading level covers most of what the average American adult reads. \\"popular\\" books like Harry Potter are all below a 6th grade reading level. Books like Helen Keller's autobiography are at a 6th grade level. Heck, if you're going by Lexile scoring (Lexile rates the 50th percentile of 6th graders to be between 950L and 1030L depending on what time of year we are talking bout since they go up over the course of the school year) things like Lord of the Rings (Fellowship is 860L, Towers, is 810L, and Return is 920L), the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1030L) and the Island of Dr. Moreau (990L)  are at or below a 6th grade reading level. That level covers 90%+ of what the average adult reads on a regular basis. I wonder how many graduated high school with a full at 12th grade level (1270L-1295L for the 50th percentile) and saw their skill diminish over time because they are not actively reading books like Beowulf (1290L) or the works of Edgar Allen Poe (1260L) on a regular basis. Again, not saying this metric is acceptable but I do wonder if it's the education system that causes it or if it's more the level of content most adults consume over their adult years causing their skills to drop.","title":"Kids' low reading scores are 'a 5-alarm fire,' says DOGE's Ramaswamy.

It's probably a bit of both, depending on what they need to do to feel good about themselves in any particular situation. E.g. they can switch between true belief when they psychologically need it and gleefully destructive attitude where they find pleasure in the dismay and hurt it causes people who actually care.The overriding factor is probably selfishness and lack of empathy, allowing them to continuously construct and adapt deities, moral frameworks or \\"scientific\\" truths that are essentially extensions of themselves and their own desires, regardless of the consequences for other people.

You see there is something about revolutions that we like to leave out of our history books; they aren't organized and executed by regular people. They are organized and executed by elites trying to take out other elites. The regular people are just foot soldiers. Elite theory outlines how this works. and this is a pretty good video on the subject [The True Reason Why Monarchies Got Overthrown - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN4JVG8Ubfw)Take the founding fathers for example. They were not regular people; they were quite wealthy. The tea didn't go into the harbor because people were mad at the crown over a 2% tax, the tea went in the harbor because wealthy people in the colonies did not like that the crown decided to give special tax breaks to the British India Company, who were the ones importing the tea. Taxation without representation isn't about democracy and the will of the people, it's about the fact that there was one company who was being given special representation by the crown, hence any other corporations lacked that representation and still had to pay taxes despite not being given representation for their interests.Another lesser known fact about the colonies is that New York was actually originally New Amsterdam and was founded by the Dutch India Company. The name changed after the Dutch India Company transferred their holdings to the British India Company. Then a revolution occurred and these holdings were taken over by the elites who orchestrated it.I think that this is actually a pig part of what we are seeing right now, Trump and all the billionaires on his side are fighting to take the control away from the establishment government and the billionaires on that side. The idea that history is a series of class wars between the oppressed and the oppressors is a Marxist doctrine not an objective view of historical events.Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.","title":"Gonna call it"},{"text":"Well when you get news from Facebook, X, and telegram.

Our team at the scene has seen law enforcement escort neighbors away from the complex, but police say there is no known threat to the community. News5 crews at the scene have observed armored vehicles and agents in tactical gear.As of right now, no motive has been stated and KOAA is the only outlet to have reported this as of this writing. The investigation is still ongoing as to whether or not this was connected to the New Orleans attack. **This information is very new, so please take all the social media rumors with a grain of salt until more definitive information comes out.**","title":"The Cybertruck explosion at Trump Tower Vegas came from a detonation system controlled by the driver, plus explosives such as fireworks, gas tanks and campaign fuel, per CNN"},{"text":"lol no shit.

They hire them through agency shell companies so they didn't have to manage the visa directly.  Then the agency just doesn't re-up the visa and most get sent back anyhow. I'd rather it be limited to 5% of a company's workforce, and no longer allow them for contract work.  Require a sponsoring company to be required to fulfill employment for the whole visa to get rid of the incentive to exploit them with the threat of deportation.

His businesses keep hiring foreign guest workers\\n"},{"text":"Now here is a good question. \\nI would first like to clarify that undocumented immigration overall increased over the time period from the 90s until now, so with illegal immigration increasing while crime rates plunged, we can clearly see that more undocumented immigrants have NOT caused an increase in crime rates of any kind (except their status as undocumented immigrants).\\nThere are many reasons why we in the US have much higher crime rates than in Europe, and it is a very complex situation which I dont think anyone can name a single contributing factor that makes up for the difference. \\nImo, one of the leading factors is how we treat our convicted (and even accused) citizens. In the US we view prison as purely punishment, and the worse it is for the prisoners the more justified Americans feel in their system. Criminals here are viewed as less than nothing, they are a burden and we as a society, for lack of a better word, hate them. Even when released from prison, time served, they are not re-assimilated as a regular citizen, they are a convict, and should never forget that. It follows them everywhere and drastically limits what jobs they can get, if any at all. This leads to our recidivism rate being over three times that of Europes. I read somewhere that if a US citizen ends up serving any amount of real time that there is a 75% chance that they will end up back in jail/prison within the next 20 years after their initial release. In other words, we dont believe in rehabilitation, only punishment, strict harsh sentencing, and a never ending reminder that youre less than everyone else.\\nAnother huge factor is guns. We have something like 120 guns for every 100 Americans. That will make doing crime easier as robbing someone at gunpoint is much more effective than with a knife or harsh language, and much easier to commit to knowing that most people shit their pants when you pull a gun on them. It will also drastically increase homicide rates, again its a more effective violence distributing device than say a knife or nunchakus. \\nOn that note we have a very polarized, and more recently and disturbingly, religiously extreme governing body that are hellbent on satiating our corporate warlords with endless capital. Im pretty sure our YEARLY defense budget will be over $1 trillion by the end of this decade. This makes for a culture that is infatuated with war and conflict while for the most part never having experienced those things first hand like the inhabitants of war-torn countries. This is my own speculation but I think when your mindset for a country is Team America World Police people take that shit home with them at night. I have no evidence for this, just my own personal opinion. Either way, most of us dont want to be that kind of country, but the people who have bought and sold our politicians really dont care what we want, and war and school shootings and domestic and foreign terrorism on our behalf seems to benefit them more. And so our politicians dont actually do what a majority of Americans want, they just do what their handlers have written for them. \\nThese and many other factors like socioeconomic factors (i.e., extreme wealth gap, worst rate of homelessness in industrialized countries while having the highest GDP in the world), systemic racism, and, definitely not last or least, our quickly collapsing education system, I am sad to say that it seems a lot of us pride ourselves on our ignorance. \\nThese are just a few, and they are not all inclusive of the factors that play into our crime rates here, though I think they give a decent base to accounting for the crime rate differences we see between the US and Europe.","title":"Trump Falsely Suggested New Orleans Suspect Was an Immigrant"},{"text":"Speaking of grim reaper ??","title":"Mitch McConnells legacy: A grim reaper for US bipartisanship?"},{"text":"https://www.koaa.com/news/crime/fbi-investigating-at-townhouse-complex-in-colorado-springs-wednesday-evening The bomber was identified.

One common take on Reddit's various political spaces, is that Democrats would be better served focusing on working class-friendly policies. But when you look at Harris as a candidate &amp; consider her history as a politician - she saved the Teamsters pensions as the 51st vote in the Senate, she's offered cash assistance for first time home buyers, prosecuted wage theft against workers, etc - there's nothing about her that indicates she was anti-working class or anti-union. Is she Bernie Sanders or AOC? No. But it's not like Bernie's ideals haven't had an effect on the current administration.However... you can often predict the future by glancing into the past &amp; seeing what similarities exist between past eras &amp; now. One of the things that's pretty consistent within America's history is the willingness to self-sabotage in the name of White supremacy. This can be anything from closing/destroying desegregated pools, to deliberately burning prosperous American cities to the ground because the most prosperous in that city were Black. And we all know of the infamous Lyndon B. Johnson quote, which touches on how gleeful White Americans are to have someone to look down upon, even if it means it'll cost them.Fast-forward to 2024, and we have a candidate deliberately spouting abject falsehoods about Haitian immigrants in the middle of a debate, against a powerful Black woman he was intimidated by the moment she shook his hand. Trump represents a lot of things - none of them good - but what he represents the most is the desire for a majority of White Americans to say the things that they feel about other people in the exact manner Trump does: explicit, unfiltered &amp; with no consideration to anyone's sensibilities or the truth. And the truth of the matter is, even though unions are supposed to be a strong base for the Democratic party, the people within those unions are more likely to share Trump's views on many things, despite the Republican party always running on destroying unions. A lot of people here will say it's probably more to do with stupidity &amp; illiteracy of those within these unions - and that's true... but stupidity &amp; bigotry aren't exclusive. After all... you have to be *pretty fucking dumb* to believe in the concept of racial superiority unironically.In any case, these people were willing to jeopardize everything they enjoy - the right to organize, seek better wages &amp; benefits, advocacy for better working conditions &amp; workplace safety, etc - because a lot of them simply won't accept a Black woman having authority over them, and they also love what Trump stands for. What they don't understand is that blind hate is, indeed, *blinding;* they can't see past their own warped, closed-off &amp; reactionary view of the world. When Sean O'Brien eventually gets Hoffa'd for fucking over his own union for reasons, he won't see it coming. His rampant hatred for Harris literally caused him to forget everything the Democratic Party did for union rights, to the point of saying Dems have fucked them over for the last 40 years - a statement that isn't even true for *the last four years,* let alone the past four decades.","title":"Unions Brace Themselves as Trump Prepares to Defang Labor Board"},{"text":"I'm staying at Treasure Island and have a straight view of everything.

This was an attack!"},{"text":"It's baffling that Republicans have been able to run on a message that's \\"pro-working\\" class when they've been chipping away at the labor movement since Reagan.So let's start there.There is no other figure in recent history that has had such a negative impact on the middle class and American worker's way of life.Reagan's Administration ushered in the greatest redistribution of wealth in a generation. His admin cut social programs and welfare benefits for countless Americans.Reagan took money from the social security fund to pay for his budget deficits.His admin rolled back labor organizing dramatically, and his handling of the air traffic controllers union strike was heavy handed and normalized union bustingReagan played the most prominent role in carrying out supply side economic policies. Part of this agenda involved removing regulations and lowering taxes on businesses and corporations, which was supposed to translate into things like higher wages for workers, better jobs, etc, hence the \\"trickle down\\" label.However, unlike the new deal response to the Great depression, which depended on the federal government intervening in the economy, the Reagan administrations response to \\"stagflation,\\" did not result in long lasting positive outcomes for the working and middle classes.Before Reagan's presidency, income tax on the wealthiest Americans was as high as 70%. By the end of Reagan's presidency that number dropped to 28%. Reagan was also responsible for generating major tax breaks for corporations and estates, all for the sake of limited government and a redistribution of wealth to the top.People brag about short-term improvements during Reagan's presidency, but the emphasis should be on short term, while it should also be emphasized that during this time, the rich got richer, and the poor, middle and working class saw little improvement.The incomes of the wealthiest Americans rose by over 100%, by comparison, the incomes of workers rose by a whopping 17%. All that wealth really trickled down huh? And since then, that wealth gap has only continued to widen. Since Reagan stepped into office, executive salaries have skyrocketed as much as over a thousand percent, while average worker compensation has increased by only 18%In 1980, the average CEO earned 36 times the average worker. Today, the average CEO earns 400 times the average worker.For the average worker, wages haven't even kept up with inflation. Where's the trickle down?Throughout Reagan's presidency, even though there were concerns directed at his policies, Reagan still maintained that if workers weren't getting richer, It was solely due to their own moral failures. And ever since Reagan, this idea has taken hold in the Republican consciousness.In terms of Reagan's influence on unions:The mid 20th century saw a peak in Union activity, nearly 1/3 of workers belonged to a union. Not only that, but unions had power, power to mount challenges against their employers. This even allowed unions to bring about important labor laws.During this time, Reagan was a member of a union himself. He was even president of the screen actors guild. But then he flipped.While he was president of the screen actors guild, he abused his power to grant his talent agency a waiver that would get him comfortable and well paid television roles. The FBI actually investigated this for anti-competitive behavior. His talent agency was eventually forced to shutter its doors.Despite this, Reagan still used his previous position as a union president to appeal to union workers on the campaign trail.\\n \\n**The air traffic controllers union strike:**These workers were striking for better working conditions and higher pay.The problem is that they were federal workers, and Reagan made it perfectly clear during a press conference that what they were doing was against the law, and that if they did not end their strike immediately, they would all be fired. Yeah, what a real working class hero.Two days later, 12,000 workers were fired, not only that, but they were barred from working for the federal government ever again.This actually crippled the labor movement, and it hasn't recovered since.At its peak, union membership accounted for over a third of all workers in the United States, at the end of Reagan's presidency that number was cut in half. Today, union membership accounts for around 10% of all workers. Reagan's firing of the air traffic controllers sent a heavy-handed message to Union workers. That message, in part, not only legitimized Union busting, but made it more acceptable.Moving on...Today, Republicans like Trump have taken a page from Reagan's playbook, appointing corporate loyalists and cronies into positions of power within agencies like the NLRB where they can cripple the power of unions, make it harder for them to operate effectively, and continue disrupting whatever balance is left between employers and employees. While Trump was president, his administration rolled back labor regulations, making it difficult for unions to organize and negotiate for better working conditions.His administration also implemented policies that struck down protections for federal workers and restricted collective bargaining rights.Trump's policies favored employers over employees. Don't forget his recent remarks in front of a crowd of Union workers where he stated he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.Trump's new administration is expected to be the richest in US history. Billionaires funding billionaires helping billionaires, yet they run on a so-called populist platform. On the other hand, Joe Biden has been one of the most pro-union presidents in recent memory. Biden has publicly and outspokenly supported unionization efforts. He is the first president to join workers on the picket line. He has issued executive orders that have helped improve working conditions for federal employees, and he has supported legislation that makes it easier for workers to unionize and bargain collectively.By comparison, the labor relations board under Biden has been more active in protecting workers rights, even investigating union busting practices.Biden's policies have protected worker's overtime pay and pensions and have ensured federal support for union jobs, construction projects, higher wages, collective bargaining and labor standards.Under Biden's admin, the gender pay gap narrowed. His administration also targeted workplace discrimination and the PUMP Act provided workplace protections for pregnant and post-partum workers.Biden's infrastructure agenda funded tens of thousands of infrastructure projects nationwide. Many of these projects require that all manufactured goods and construction materials be made in America.Biden's CHIPS and Science Act invested in the US semiconductor manufacturing industry, in workforce advancement and training, and in chips research and development.The Biden admin also helped to implement a corporate minimum tax and a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.In the end however, the media and the American electorate have memory-holed Trump's record as president. The general public is an irrational force, a much too large percentage of American voters aren't making politically informed decisions, instead, they're letting their feelings decide the outcome of our elections. And that's what got Trump elected, *feelings*","title":"Unions Brace Themselves as Trump Prepares to Defang Labor Board"},{"text":"Cadaver in a self-driving truck.

(I wish this was the top upvoted comment instead of the other \\"Ukraine 2.0\\" comments.)**\\nTo address?\\"Firstly - If this is such a massive resource why would Denmark ever accept the US's offer? Surely its worth far more to Denmark for the exact same reasons.\\"\\n(1A) Denmark's GDP is 400 billion. It would take hundreds of billions of dollars to develop Greenland into a multi-trillion dollar trade/mineral economy.\\n(1B) Without mineral extraction **(which Danes would never do)** Greenland is not worth multi-Trillion, and thus not worth hundreds of billions to invest even if they had the money to expend like USA does.\\nAdditional In-Depth Explaination of costs: Poland's world-class airport they plan to build costs $9 billion and Singapore's chokepoint Mega-Port with Smart A.I capabilities costed 10-20 billion, thats just 2 things. If Greenland (only has 90 mile road network) wants world-class infrastructure, it would take LOTS of money that a 400 Billion GDP **simply cannot give unlike the USA.**\\"Secondly - What of the native Greenlanders? Do they not get a say? Under Denmark they have not been treated perticularly well... USA hasn't either.. up to Greeland whether they stay with Denmark, become independant or join another country like the US or Canada? (paraphrased)\\"\\n**Disclaimer:** Before I type out the addressing this, I disagree with Trump on this. He should ABSOLUTELY be trying to negotiate with Greenland, and NOT Denmark. (The post was about Greenland being essential to America, my agreement with Trump's GOAL of American Greenland*, not the immoral land-purchase method that Trump is currently using).\\n**(2A-Sovereignty):** America, while morally reprehensible, can legally buy Greenland from Denmark since Greenland is not a sovereign country. They are owned by Denmark with domestic autonomy.\\n**(2B-Natives):** America does have a bad track record, yes, but they could easily do concessions and legal guarantees that America would listen to the Natives concerns and wouldn't mistreat them.**(2C-Sovereignty):** I agree with you that Greenlanders should decide for themselves. **67% of Greenland wants to leave Denmark at some point to become independent.** Greenland would have the most benefits in joining America and America is the realistic path if Greenland ever became independent. (Not sustainable economically/Canada wouldn't accept them to not piss off America/Poland or other EU allies would blocked Greenland being in the EU).\\n\\"Thirdly - .... Extracting resources from the land... Greenlanders should be the ones who get to have a say.... Environmental consequences of extraction... Do we (as a globe) really want the pole's resources to be extracted for the sake of capital investment by the rich of America?\\"\\n**(3A-Extraction)** China has Muslim concentration camps and Russia is commiting genocide in Ukraine. I care more about beating them than environmental concerns. Human Life  Environment (my POV).?Mineral Extraction would be very beneficial to NATO as it completely destroys any reliance on Russia's mineral reserve advantage and China's 95% rare earth mineral monopoly. To let China/Russia move towards global supremacy is farrrrr more immoral than an environment deteriorating.\\n**(3B-Mineral exploits)** I agree that its *moral* to let Greenland decide whether to exploit its own resources but if America purchases the land from Denmark (also immoral) then America's right to. **Granted, I PERSONALLY want Greenland to VOTE to join America under some pro-environmental concessions from Trump so that the Native Inuit decide.**\\n**(3C-Does the world want this?)** Russia will be using the Arctic's minerals, so America has to keep up to not get beaten. Its not non-imortant feelings/ideals at stake here, its the lives of 330 million people in American Civilization if we ever come to a conflict. The USA should be prepared to GO TO war at any time so the CHANCES of war go down. \\"Best way to avoid war is to make it an unappealing option/prepare for it.\\"** For \\"if the globe wants it or not\\", why should it matter if they do or not? Nations always act in their 1st interest as principle and America is not some Nazi civilization, its a civilization that gives 50% of Global food aid, beat the Japanese empire, sent a man on the moon, and are working on putting a man on Mars. America, with its flaws, is the greatest civilization on earth for what it contributed to mankind/humanity.\\"Its selfish/insensitive\\" (last paragraph of your comment)Geopolitics is inherently selfish and feelings dont matter when people's lives/wellbeing are on the line. Every country acts in accordance to its own self-intrests. To say \\"something is selfish therefore wrong\\" is a principle that could be applied to all countries when they want something limited\\nIs Iceland selfish for its fishing claims because it benefits them? Is this small country now bad?\\nSee how that principle can be applied??\\n**I personally belive that people/population should be of the highest Virtue and morality but governments make decisions with the weight on millions of lives that don't take into account feelings. Feelings don't matter in trade deals or military alliances. America is not benefitial allies with Saudi Arabia and Israel in the conflict-ridden middle east because of feelings but BECAUSE of mutual national interests with complex cutthroat undertones. At the end of the day, thats what matters for a successful/most peaceful ordering of the world**\\nEnd of commentI know this was a long comment of difference of ideals but I'm glad I go to explain myself and respond to your points! I really enjoyed doing so.\\nAgain. I hope mods pin this comment, by far the best one here in intellectual weight/principle, thank you!","title":"CMV: Trump is right about Greenland acquisition being a necessity to the United States of America.

My guess is that NEA members and teamsters vote very differently from one another. To me the situation suggests two things. First, that factors other than union membership are more determinative of voting behavior (race, gender, level of education). I think a good example of this is that the teamsters refused to endorse a candidate, but the teamsters national black caucus endorsed Harris. Second, unions dont have the organizational power and influence to turn out their membership, even when they do endorse a candidate. As your example shows, they dont want to directly tell members who to vote for and why. Its not effective organizing, but they dont want to make their members angry. The NEA endorsed Harris and the president of the NEA spoke at the DNC, but I received no official communication from the union at the national, state, or local level telling me to vote for Harris.

All the post-election analsis trying to dream up what terrible mistakes the Democrats must have made to lose (by 1% of the popular vote!) have ignored the reality that Trump just successfully conned a lot of voters who didn't bother to even think about how stupid they were being, taking a pathological liar seriously and not checking out what he said with more reliable sources. Or even just engaging their brains to realize how nonsensical it all was. Or just remembering what happened when he did the same stuff he's promising in his first term. Nothing that the Democrats were saying about reality was penetrating their thick skulls. They only listened to Trump, who was lying to them and telling them the exact opposite of reality. You can lead a voter to facts but you cannot make him listen and think. You also can't make a dummy bother to go vote in the first place when they don't wanna, too busy and waiting for their clone to run for office because nobody else will be pure enough. The price of groceries and gas are set by the food industry and the grocery chains and the oil companies, who jack up prices at the first excuse and keep them high after the excuse evaporates. The President doesn't control those prices, especially since the dummies keep voting for people like Trump and Trumpers who deregulate everything they can to please their rich donors. Inflation is different from those prices and is very low right now, thanks to efforts by the current Administration since inflation is actually something governments can help manage. Pay more attention in school, dummies. And work on that gnat-like memory of yours. Also look up \\"bird flu\\" which has been killing chickens while trying to remedy your lack of attention in school. Fewer chickens, fewer eggs. A shortage of anything drives up the price. The President can't control the appearance of birdie epidemics, but they are more likely to occur in factory farms that stress out the birdies in crowded conditions without real access to normal birdie activities.","title":"\\"You f**king deserve it\\": Lemon mocks \\"dumb\\" MAGA fans blindsided by Trump backing Musk visa push"},{"text":"Theres a shock","title":"Trump Falsely Suggested New Orleans Suspect Was an Immigrant"},{"text":"That sucks.
