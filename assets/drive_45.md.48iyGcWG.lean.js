They may still have a lot of influence over their local communities, but people dont need to play by their rules anymore.** Instead of going to the local college (if going to college at all) and being happy for the opportunity to work for one of their companies, graduates can leave for a coastal city and make something more of themselves.This is why local millionaires in LCOL cities tend to call people barely making six figures in HCOL coastal cities elites. Its because to them, what youre supposed to do is stay in your community and know your place. Leaving the area and working your way to a higher place (but still lower than theirs) is showing them that you are better than the hierarchy they benefitted from. And that hurts their ego.On the surface, Trump would seem like the type of guy they hate. He is a coastal elite with an Ivy League degree. But really he isnt because he is a local elite from a family line of NYC property owners. By contrast, they hate Bill Gates because he grew up upper middle class in Middle America. Trump knows his place and Bill Gates doesnt.Conservatism is the belief that people should know their place and stick to it. People can move up and down on their own merit sure, but it has to be within a set of rules they like. And now that those rules are no longer as strict, they see it as a breakdown of society.And thats how you get well off people flying to a big, liberal city to try and instill a fascist dictatorship. They want a leader who they think is like them who will put those damn coastal elites making a comfortable but not luxurious living in their place. They should be answering to the local aristocracy, not themselves. This is the origin of American authoritarianism in its current form.I bolded the section above because I think it applies here.

In that sport, teams only play each other once per season. Every game is a completely unique set of circumstances, because there are huge changes in rosters between every season, no team is exactly the same as previous iterations of itself. It is true that for any individual game, it is difficult to conceptualize how a probability could have been assigned to the outcome: each team either won or lost, and the event only happened one time. In what sense could a team have had a 70% chance to win going in?Yet we have data that is strongly predictive of how these games will play out, and modelers can consistently assign precise and well-calibrated probabilities to game outcomes. Even early in a season, we know that teams that were good last year tend to be good this year; we know that teams that recruit well tend to be better than those that don't; we know that teams that are returning a lot of starters tend to do better than those that don't; we know that teams playing at home have a slight advantage over visiting teams. Later in a season, we know that teams that are having a good season are more likely to win than teams performing poorly. You put all that in a model and you can come up with probabilities that are well-calibrated over many, many games. A team assigned a 70% chance to win by these models really does win about 70% of the time.The same is true of elections. Yes, this election and every other election is completely unique in many ways. Yet it is similar enough to previous elections that we can take data that we know is predictive and come up with a model that is going to assign a meaningful probability to the outcome. We know that election results tend to be pretty close to the polling average, and that the polling error is randomly distributed with a measurable level of variance. We know that state polling averages are correlated with each other. We know that economic conditions tend to have predictable effects independently of the polling averages. Throw it all in a model and the probabilities it assigns are generally going to be well calibrated if you do it right. Look at Silver's long run track record for elections and his probabilities really are well calibrated. Events with a 70% probability really do happen about 70% of the time. And the difference between a 70% probability and a 90% probability is meaningful.","title":"Democrats Kamala Harris More Likely to Win Alaska Than Florida or TexasNate Silver"},{"text":"I feel like its also worth adding pathetic to that statement.

Life is hard and traumatic no matter what economic system you're living under. Part of that is just *people* being shitty (childhood trauma, issues with parents, interpersonal abuse, etc., etc., none of that has anything to do with capitalism), but part of it is just survival not being easy for any creature on the planet... And a big part of it is just organic. Depression is a *disease*. It's *exacerbated* by circumstances, but caused mostly by brain chemistry. Anxiety disorders... same... there's usually not a proximate environment cause for panic attacks. Autism... not capitalism's fault. Relationship issues... rarely primarily socioeconomic. Childhood trauma... I mean, come on, really?Helping people is... helping people. It doesn't really matter why they're having problems... if some of them turn out to be socioeconomic in nature... you're still helping people to survive and thrive in their environment. It's not your job to fix the world. If you want to try to do it as a hobby, your being a therapist isn't going to interfere more than any other job. Ultimately, it sounds like your real view is that you're not sure you want to participate in the capitalist system *at all*. It just happens that your area of interest is helping people with therapy, so you're focusing on whether you want to do that. But really... would this be any different if you wanted to go into, I don't know... software development?

Jonathan M. Katz went on a rant about this recently, and Ive come around to his take. Probabilities are useful when you have many events to take data from, like a baseball player going to bat or weather conditions resulting in a hurricane.

Silver can predict that she has a 60% probability of winning but all that means is that if she does, she now has a batting average of 1.000; if she loses, its a batting average of 0.000. And that matchup will never happen again. Theres no way to actually match/verify Kamalas batting averages to Silvers probability numbers even after we have her real performance. \\n  \\nSilvers numbers are meaningless because theyre not anchored in election data. We struggle as it is with translating polls into vote performance, so probabilities based on those polls are just a fancier way of saying that Kamala can win or lose a state...

It is exceptional at that. Abundance is good it leads to higher standards of living. Most poor people in USA live better than kings and queens did prior to the 1850s. The mental health crisis is mostly due to the fact that our entertainment has become too good. People would rather sit at home than socialize. Which causes us to become fat and causes us to live like hermits. But this is not the fault of capitalism. This is the fault of technology. At any point prior to this it was always way too boring to sit at home because you did not have endless options for entertainment. Which is where psycotherapy comes in.","title":"CMV: Psychotherapy is enabling the current exploitative system"},{"text":"That would decrease her chances of winning as it would expose the differences between her and Republicans as being purely superficial.

Dems dont even field a candidate for many offices where a republican runs un-opposed. At least by registering republican they can try to tamp down the crazy in primaries.  With the way the electoral college works none of the votes Ive made for president have ever counted.  Im over 50.

Does this mean we should ban trucks and SUVs? No. It means we need to focus on methods of making our roads safer.I mean, why is that the only logical conclusion here?

I'm not necessarily disagreeing that the current setup is flawed in a lot of ways and contributes to mental health issues, and that humans in general would do better with an overhaul of what we think is valuable and how we go about our work and work/life balance. However, what you're suggesting is a *gigantic* endeavor that involves convincing the public, elected officials, and industries that the status quo is unsustainable and needs to change. That's going to take years or decades, if it ever happens at all.So while we're stuck in a flawed system waiting for a long-term solution, what can people do who are having short-term problems caused by this system? We can't really just refuse to live in it, unless you think a bunch of people going off into the backwoods to form communes is a valid mental health solution for the general public. So we're stuck having to make the best of it, which includes trying to find meaning and happiness within the current framework. In that context, psychological help and treatment is massively important, especially *because* the system is flawed. If you want to help people, it's much more efficient in the short to medium term to treat their mental health than to tell them to wait for a utopia that may or may not come about by the time they retire.Further, it's much easier to engineer change when people have the energy and resources to look away from their daily grind, notice the flaws they're living with, and demand change. So I would actually argue that providing mental health care is actually one of the best ways to facilitate the systematic change that you want, because depressed and dysfunctional people are usually not a good vehicle for societal overhauls.","title":"CMV: Psychotherapy is enabling the current exploitative system"},{"text":"Yep.

And 18,000 same sex couples married during the window until the window slammed shut when Prop 8 passed a little over 4 months later on election day Nov 2008. The CA Supreme Court then ruled that while same sex marriages stopped in California, and no more could be performed or allowed in California, that the 18,000 couples married during the window, were legally married still. Kamala Harris as AG was then asked to defend Prop 8. And bravely she refused to defend the hateful law. And the proposition headed back towards the California Supreme Court where it was ruled unconstitutional under our state constitution.But same sex marriage did not resume in California or most other states until the US Supreme court issued their decision on June 26 2015. The trial which you may be referring to did not resume same sex marriage. But it ended in a ruling that Prop 8 was unconstitutional under the CA constitution. And this was part of the agonizingly slow process of same sex marriage, or as we like to call it, marriage, lumbering towards the US Supreme Court. If youd like to watch the trial, here you go. Proponents of Prop 8 insisted that the trial not be filmed or broadcast. But the transcripts were available. So actors you will recognize read the transcripts. If youre limited for time watch the moving closing arguments.

So let's work down the list shall we? \\nThe thing that kicked off the Revolutionary war was the attempted confiscation of weapons by the Brits at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Funnily enough, the same behavior is being exhibited by some of our current politicians. \\nYour claims about the French and Spanish limiting the number of troops Americans face is absolute hogwash, as the Revolutionary War started in April of 1775, while the French didn't join until 1778 and the Spaniards in 79.\\nThey only created an Alliance with the U.S. after we had already won the battles of Saratoga.\\nOn October 17, 1777, British Gen. John Burgoyne surrendered 5,895 men to American forces outside Saratoga, New York. Those losses, combined with the 1,300 men killed, wounded and captured during the preceding five months of Burgoynes campaign to reach Albany in upstate New York, amounted to nearly one-quarter of those serving under the British flag in America in 1777.\\nTo go with that, you have the battles of Bunker Hill and Concord Road. In those two engagements, fought in the first 60 days of the war, American soldiersall militiameninflicted huge casualties. The British lost nearly 1,500 men in those encounters, three times the American toll.?\\nSo that pretty well proves you don't know what you're talking about, as the Continental Army was more than holding their own without foreign involvement.Yeah, you had Tories, which made up 20% of the population at the time, but by the standards of the U.S., 80% support is basically unanimous.You're also wrong on the support for gun bans.\\nhttps://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_042423/","title":"Kamala Harris Claims She Wont Take Guns, But Signals She Wants A Ban"},{"text":"But chief of police is not elected","title":"Portage County sheriff: 'Write down the addresses' of Kamala Harris supporters who display yard signs"},{"text":"I'm not sure what that means?

We are all in our early 40's and were all fed the same thing by our high schools about college graduates making more money and that there was free money to help pay for college. Now a good percentage of adults who graduated from high school back in the 90's and early 2000's are still paying off student loans in our 40's and some probably in their early 50's.

Bidden and Harris support Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas by doing what they can to eliminate Hamas's military capabilities, but they are concerned about the collateral damage. Trump is happy to see Gaza ethnically cleansed and then reannexed as a part of Israel.  Trump is a known quantity.  You can't just pretend that because Harris won't do what you want that it's worth seeing if Trump might.  Even if you are a single issue voter upset at Harris's stance, Trump still isn't the right choice on this issue.","title":"Im a pro-Palestine leftist.

Abysmal. Even some of Trump's opponents were upset. They don't want shoddy protection either, and they can see what a disaster an assassination would be. Well, some of them. I'm honestly surprised he's still alive at this point. I think this election is hot enough without candidates being killed. I really hope that doesn't happen, but I also think November is going to be wild any way it goes. I think the question most worth asking is why nut jobs with firarems keep getting within range and how did this guy know Trump would be there? Trump's schedule wasn't publicized. This is not too hard for the best security force in the land (allegedly) to handle. I hope Harris and Walz have good security, honestly. This is terrible stuff. And I think there will be more attempts. Can Trump get better security if he goes private? What does that say about the Secret Service, and what orders they're being given?

We have a right wing supreme court, we have right wing district courts, and roughly half of the senate/house are right wing at any given time. Both cops and legislators have limited time and resources. When we are passing legislation, we need to prioritize what is the most publicly popular and the most likely to survive the right wing courts. That is things like background checks. That is things like child access prevention laws. That is things like prohibiting people convicted for domestic abuse from owning guns.I will use the same example with you that Ive used several times in this thread. According to the [IIHS](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians), vehicles like Trucks and SUVs are 45% dead per to pedestrians than sedans. Does this mean we should ban trucks and SUVs? No. It means we need to focus on methods of making our roads safer. People arent dying in car accidents because of SUVs. Its because our road design is dogshit, they are not pedestrian friendly, and the penalties for breaking highway safety laws are far too lax.

I had really high expectations for it (as someone who really liked the original but found it flawed in several ways), but it completely exceeded my expectations. The overall emotional core and vibe of the original visual novel was both intact and well expanded upon in many ways, with way more hard-hitting moments throughout the entirety of it than I had expected or remembered. The Arcueid route was good as I had expected and remembered it being, with it being maybe my favorite version of it (tied with the manga adaptation of the original game). Favorite parts were the part in the middle where Shiki and Arcueid just go out, and then the ending.The Ciel route, specifically, went from just pretty good in the original (despite being mostly copied from the Arcueid route), to legitimately great in of itself and the moment where I realized the game was something special, !specifically with Shiki and Ciel's fight in the middle as Shiki was descending into insanity, then the flashbacks in the middle of the Noel fight!&lt;. While I personally preferred the normal ending over the extra ending, the extra ending itself was good by itself, !even with how... uh, \\"Fate-y\\" it felt with the prolonged action scene at the end vs Arcueid. Which was really cool, don't get me wrong, but the normal ending felt more fitting for the game's themes. The Ciel route extra ending is also better than the original's good ending, but that one was practically a joke ending so I don't think it really counts.!&lt;I'm real excited for the remake of the Far Side routes (Akiha/Hisui/Kohaku), although I have no idea how in the world Type-Moon/Nasu will deal with some of the more extreme/NSFW elements of those routes when remaking and releasing them onto consoles. I'm sure they'll find a way, although it absolutely won't be coming out for a long time considering that it took well over 10 years for the remake of the first two routes to release to begin with.Mucho texto: it's great and I highly recommend playing it, especially if you're already familiar with and like Type-Moon/Fate stuff. Note that it's not on PC though; it's only on Switch and PS4/5, so keep that in mind. Also FYI it'll take about 35-40 hours to finish the two routes/three endings.!ping WEEBS","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"And on welfare too, Id assume","title":"Get Ready for the reset"},{"text":"Estimate how many ocean beaches there are in the world, multiply by how many people are on each on average and by the proportion of people actually in the water.

They had agreed to wait to back gay marriage because they could lose a lot of votes. It wasnt a swing issue yet. Washington wasnt divided by a line yet over this. Biden was welcomed by a gay couple and their kids. They went over how Biden sat down and really talked to them. Seemed to forget what he was there for until the staff had to remind him he was there for a reason. I think it was the next day that Biden said he backed gay marriage and you could hear Obama sighing all the way in the west coast. That day lines were drawn. everyone had to pick a side. Obama had to go and back gay marriage in a tv interview. All of this because Biden met a family and he recognized they were no different from his and its like his brain did a hard reset. Now, whatever his faults may be, hes become the most pro lgbt president in history. We see this all the times in movies. Politicians have a human moment and change. Theyre shamed. They feel stuff like empathy and realize they need to do something. It very rarely happens in real life.

She wants to say that she is committed to protecting Israel from these terrorists, but she also wants to push for a deal that requires making concessions to them. She criticizes Trump's Afghanistan withdrawl, yet several deals the Biden-Harris administration has tried to broker have included the same concession of releasing terrorists many to one. why not 25a biden? [Forcibly remove him from office]Is because she's not a right-wing lunatic.The country broadly knows Biden is not fit for office, but it is something she worked to keep under wraps for political advantage.  It is not a right wing position in the slightest that Biden wasn't fit since debate, and especially not by now. It was only right wing leading up to the debate because the administration kept it under wraps and the media applied an unreasonable degree of skepticism.what exactly is in the [border] billIs because she's not a right-wing lunatic.What exactly are you talking about? Harris is claiming to support this border bill. It would be the interest of the left wing as much as the right over what is the substance of this supposedly critical border reform. will [Kamala] enforce any law, for example trade in marijuana being largely illegal.Is because she's not a right-wing lunatic.Marijuana legalization isn't a right wing issue, it is broadly popular but moreso among the left and independents. It is republican legislatures who are most likely to block marijuana reform. It is a democratic president who first announced a position of non-enforcement. Kamala has said in regards to the border she will enforce it because it is the law. When she was prosecutor, she charged nonviolent drug users because it was the law, despite that she too had discretion in that position.The reality is people don't vote based on policyMaybe no policy is good enough for you, but for anyone who isn't completely sold and uncritical of Harris, it might be interesting to know what exactly it means to put her in the white house compared to Trump who is not capable of being so strategic about hiding his position.Dana Bash asks questions about things that Harris is weak on in the eyes of some of the voters Harris is trying to winShe didn'tt ask them in order to force Kamala to actually defend the policies or commit to one side of a controversy, she asked them to help smooth them over and make the position appear challenged when she didn't even care what the answer's were.You posted links to the interview, you and anyone can watch it, why even try to maintain it was anything but a softball interview? Do you really think many people are dumb enough to buy that despite the video evidence, who are not being intentionally dense? this interview with Donald Trump on Fox BusinessYes, Trump loves a softball interview. That does not change that Dana worked for Harris and did not challenge her in any significant way or even pin her to one policy she had not already announced in advance of the interview, despite that she had only three specific policies to elucidate at that point. From the perspective of an independent, it only substantiates that Harris is a chamelon. If your argument is Harris should continue to insist against any challenging interview because Trump dodges them every chance he can, that is fine, but that's completely different than your argument CNN would hardball her when they have interviewed her and didn't hardball her. The notion that MSNBC would not be friendlier still is ridiculous, but unlike CNN it is unproven whether they are willing and capable to actually press her to adopt a stance where she is waffling to appeal to everyone.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":"Well, MGT, since both shooters were Republicans, I think your party should clean up its own messes.","title":"Is MTG serious with that question?"},{"text":"Iowa?","title":"Trump's Iowa lead shrinks significantly as Kamala Harris replaces Biden, Iowa Poll shows."},{"text":"The only thing that can stop a good guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"WSJ turned into the weird alt history hoi4 players","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Call of Duty XXI: Stochastic Warfare","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I'm just gonna do what I did to Biden- vote for them and then protest against them and criticize them.

The funding will help reduce risk from wildfires, support improved wildland firefighter training, expand efforts to rehabilitate burned areas in collaboration with partners, and advance wildfire science. Todays announcement brings the total the Department of the Interior has allocated for wildland fire management from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to nearly $1.1 billion across the nation since it went into effect in fiscal year 2022.  Acting Deputy Secretary Daniel-Davis made the announcement at Saguaro National Park in Tucson, Arizona, with Mayor Regina Romero and Arizona State Forester and Director Thomas Torres. The state is receiving upwards of $10 million in this latest allocation, bringing the total funding for wildfire mitigation and recovery in Arizona through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to more than $60 million.  \\n...  \\nThe Department is dedicating nearly $176 million from todays announcement to collaboratively reduce the risk of extreme wildfires across landscapes by expanding capacity and accelerating the pace and scale of fuels management projects in coordination with partners. These projects reduce excessive vegetation that can fuel wildfires through methods such as mechanical vegetation removal and chemical treatments of invasive species. Projects will also use beneficial fire, such as prescribed fires and cultural burning. To support the acceleration of these activities, some of this funding will be used to expand the National Interagency Prescribed Fire Training Center, providing the interagency wildland fire workforce with access to prescribed fire training and opportunities to gain practical experience. Nearly $56 million will be used to help restore landscapes damaged by recent wildfires. This includes over $20 million to continue developing locally adapted seeds and plant materials to revegetate areas so severely impacted by wildfires that the lands are unlikely to recover naturally. This builds on the Departments National Native Seed Strategy Keystone Initiative, focused on securing enough native seeds and plants to restore and enhance the resilience of lands and waters. Nearly $3.1 million will support the Departments wildland fire workforce by continuing to modernize training and position qualifications. This includes additional investments in the interagency Incident Performance and Training Modernization initiative, which will provide updated courses, offer more options for practical experience, reduce barriers to qualification and establish seamless interoperability within the interagency wildland fire workforce. Todays [September 10th] announcement also includes $1.4 million to advance wildfire science. The Joint Fire Science Program, funded by both the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture (USDA), will use this investment to further support research that will help inform how the interagency wildland fire community can best address the growing threat of wildfires amid a changing climate. These critical investments are supporting the nations wildland fire workforce, accelerating the pace and scale of fuels management and burned area rehabilitation, and advancing wildland fire science. Additional investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will continue through 2026. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also created the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, charged with making recommendations to improve federal policies related to the mitigation, suppression, and management of wildland fires in the United States. In September 2023, the Commission released a comprehensive report outlining 148 recommendations to improve the nations relationship with wildfire. Todays funding advances many of those recommendations.  \\n...Statement from Acting Deputy Secretary Daniel-Davis:Since the enactment of the Presidents Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Interior Department has worked quickly to get money out the door and in the hands of states, Tribes and local communities to help combat the ever-growing threat of the climate crisis, said Acting Deputy Secretary Daniel-Davis. Communities in the West in particular understand this threat C with increasing temperatures and more severe fires C and the Biden-Harris administration is taking action by investing in comprehensive wildland fire management that is creating more climate-resilient lands across the nation.","title":"Acting Deputy Secretary Daniel-Davis Announces $236 Million from President Bidens Investing in America Agenda for Wildfire Resilience and Recovery | Interior Department has invested over $1 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for wildland fire management"},{"text":"How it feels like to be a pro open borders, pro free trade pro capitalism sigma chadhttps://preview.redd.it/jx49tg5s14pd1.png?width=225&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ae62f655b71940ef662186b293ae37ddb0e9af9","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"SNL has never been funny.SNL is only funny when you watch exclusively the funny sketches you remember thanks to survivorship bias.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Ego Nwodim belongs in the last category.

So she followed up 2/3 times. The reason she didn't follow up with the questions you specifically wanted asked like,why is Harris even pushing for a deal [between Israel and Hamas]?why not 25a biden? [Forcibly remove him from office]what exactly is in the [border] billwill [Kamala] enforce any law, for example trade in marijuana being largely illegal.Is because she's not a right-wing lunatic. No voter who isn't already committed to Harris winning the election will be swayed by this interview, who wouldn't be swayed by a tiktok in which she made the same unchallenged claims. If she doesn't care about voters who care about policy, that is fine, but to claim she gets hardball interviews when she is a media darling is insane.The reality is people don't vote based on policy and an interview being difficult is not dependent on the interviewer digging deeply into policies that right-wing nut jobs care about like how much AI is in a bipartisan border security deal. The thing that makes this a difficult interview is that Dana Bash asks questions about things that Harris is weak on in the eyes of some of the voters Harris is trying to win (2,3,4,5,7,9,10) or questions about things that are divisive within the Democratic party (4,5,7,8,10).You're obviously a partisan hack whose views can't be changed. If anyone is reading this who is capable of changing their mind I ask you to compare the CNN interview we have been discussing with [this interview with Donald Trump on Fox Business](https://youtu.be/0fENMpxctnw?si=-sg-Tcbjfmc3FqcC). Notice that the interviewer never followed up a question and frames every question in terms of trump being good and his enemies being bad. She agrees with everything Trump says, only interrupts him to provide supporting evidence, and never calls out to any of his lies or attempts to avoid a question. That is a good illustration of the fundamental difference between right-wing media and mainstream media in America.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":"It's no wonder New Mexico votes blue.

I can just as easily argue that since there's a strong correlation between gun ownership, right-wing politics, and respect for law and order, if there were a law saying that they needed to surrender their guns, they'd respect the law. But I'm not going to speculate beyond that, and whatever words you type at me with further conjecture isn't going to change my mind on any of that. If you have any research you can cite that backs up your assertion, feel free to give it, but anything short of that isn't going to convince me. This otherwise just feels like baseless fearmongering to me.Do you not see the point that I am making of the fact that there are significantly better ways to reduce gun violence without the downstream effect of more gun violence?This is just more of the standard fallacious angle that we can't try to do more than one thing at once.But yes I am acutely aware of the connection between suicide and gun use / access, as I've published research on the topic. It still doesn't change the fact that there are multiple ways of going about this problem, and one of the most troubling aspects of this is the sheer number of guns out there.You have to understand, I come at this with an extraordinary appreciation for human life, something that my atheism forces me to believe very strongly. I don't think that people who are shot to death will get some justice by getting to go to heaven and live happily ever after; I think they're just dead and gone, and each and every instance of this is a huge fucking tragedy to me. So you can throw as many low percentages at me as you like, but if the net effect is that more lives are saved, then I am all for it. But please don't kid yourself into believing that we can only ever work on one approach at a time, that we can't go at this from multiple directions, *even with the awareness that some problems are bigger than others*. I still think we are more than capable of doing multiple things at once to fix this.

You can and supposedly have watched this interview? Question 1: Day one plansThis is mostly platitude but she lays out two policies, small business tax benefit and child tax credit, and alludes to housing, but the interviewer does not address the elephant in the room that is her proposed housing policy, specifically the housing subsidy that will just drive up costs in a time where the fed is preparing to dampen the economy in hopes of fighting inflation. Question 2: What about Americans who do want to go back on the economy? She mentions the same policies as day one plans, but this time expounds on the 25k for home buyers, which Dana does not even linger on a second but tags Walz in. Question 3: Why haven't they implemented the policies already?In this case Kamala could have fairly dodged the question by just throwing Biden under the bus, though it might have invited a non-friendly interviewer to ask 'why not 25a biden?', instead she just claims the economy was Trump's fault and they've done a ton to fix it, and is once again unchallenged. Question 4: This is the only one in which there is any pushback from Dana at all, but in the end the answer she takes as satisfactory is that Harris's values have not changed but that we can accomplish green energy goals without banning fracking, which is a platitude. What was it then, that isn't now, that made fracking critical to ban for accomplishing green every goals then, that isn't now? The only difference is Harris needs to appeal to more than just the party to win this election, it is purely a strategic position and reflects that her values are in fact very flexible when power is at stake. Question 5: The border: Harris refers to Trump insisting on killing the border bill, but Dana does not ask what exactly is in the bill, which in its first incarnation was practically an omnibus bill, and by the time it was killed still included a weird focus on machine learning based security measures, expanded visas,  You can see the text of it here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4361/text?s=3&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22S.+4361%22%7D ; however, it is unlikely Republicans would have improved on it if they controlled the bill entirely, so it is not like this is a strategic question to spare Kamala from, it nonetheless saves her trying to defend actual policies.Finally, when asked why she is insistent on enforcing the border now compared to her 2019 campaigning, she insists that she is the type to enforce the law, which begs the question if she will enforce any law, for example trade in marijuana being largely illegal. Surely her insistence on enforcing the law is a cop out, and a neutral interviewer would have called her on it. Question 7: After Harris has had time to think it through, that she introduced in prior questions, she asks about flip flopping policy directly, and she gives the same non-answer that her values haven't changed, without referring to anything else that changed, which would give reason for her position to change without her values changing.Question 8: Will you appoint a republican to your cabinet? That is just a softball outright.Question 9: Trump's racial attacks. This is just running Harris campaign for her. Bash brings it up so Harris doesn't have to.Question 10: Israel-Hamas: Harris gives the same platitude as always that we will continue to ship arms to Israel, they are fighting terrorists, but there has to be a deal done and in some handwavey future a two state solution, and she is not pressed on the conflict between these two matters, Israel can not be forced into a deal by the same strategy as the Biden-Harris administration has committed so far. If Hamas is truly such a terroristic bad faith actor as she claims (which is fair to claim), why is Harris even pushing for a deal? Since this interview, Harris has criticized the Trump administration for making a weak deal with terrorists, which isn't a fraction as weak as the deals Biden and Harris have been passively pretending to push between Israel and Gaza, and that is not to say Trump didn't engineer a disaster in the Afghanistan pullout. No voter who isn't already committed to Harris winning the election will be swayed by this interview, who wouldn't be swayed by a tiktok in which she made the same unchallenged claims. If she doesn't care about voters who care about policy, that is fine, but to claim she gets hardball interviews when she is a media darling is insane.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":"Anyone who hasn't deactivated their account at this stage is 100% complicit.

Its a terrible situation. And there are almost certainly war crimes people should be held accountable for. But heavy handed language like what weve seen from younger progressives is not only false, its also just damaging to any positive cause the dems are working towards. Youd have to be an idiot to think Biden or Harris wants Palestinians to die.

Dana asked about the affordability crisis and premised her question on the idea that the economy was better under Donald Trump. After Kamala answered. Dana followed up by asking why Kamala hasn't already implemented her plan as vice president.After that Dana asked about fracking, a divisive issue within the Democratic coalition, and framed the question in terms of Kamala Harris flip-flopping between her positions in 2020 and today. Kamala says she does not want to ban fracking and has not changed her position. Dana responds by quoting her from 2020. Kamala reiterates that her position has not changed and Dana responds \\"what made you change that position at the time\\".I suggest you watch the interview. I don't think any reasonable person who has seen it would call it a softball interview.Edit: I'm watching [part 2](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Rus0ght1j34) right now in which Dana asks about immigration and Israel's war on Palestine.

The only reason they exist is the same reason both parties end up bringing in whatever celebrity endorsements they can, which is to say 'Showmanship.'Choosing which party or which candidate you might prefer is only half the battle. The other half is trying to get the people you want voting for you to actually go out and vote, and arguably to try and quietly convince people you don't want voting for the other guy to stay home.Also, the millionaire/billionaire business owners (especially the ones who came from already wealthy families,) generally also have it better than 99% of the world, so I'm still not seeing why Musk was getting a pass in your original exception. :p The argument that he owns businesses doesn't really hold water, because business interests are already pushing their way into politics in the forms of massive monetary endorsements.

Not only was it right, but it was consistent with where PA went. So the two things that one has to keep in mind are that (a) not all polls are accurate and (b) you should learn more from the very good polls.

In responding to these inquiries, we can give general information regarding open government and speech issues but cannot provide specific legal advice or representation.? No attorney-client relationship has been formed by way of this response.\\n FAC does not have the resources to do a comprehensive analysis of 18 U.S.C.  2385.? But a quick survey of the cases interpreting and applying the statute indicate that the courts are split.\\n On the one hand, convictions under  2385 to conspire to organize the Communist Party of the U.S. as a group to teach and advocate the overthrow of the government of the United States by force and violence has been held NOT to violate the First Amendment.? Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951).\\nOn the other hand, mere advocacy in the abstract that the government should be overthrown and destroyed has been held to be protected speech under the First Amendment if unrelated to any effort to incite or institute action to that end by force or violence.? Bary v. United States, 248 F.2d 201 (1957).\\n Under cases like Brandenburg, it may well be that the courts would hold that an article that, for example, called on Russia to make an example of the U.S. for some perceived evil by launching a nuclear strike probably [this is what me and my dad were arguing about] would be protected unless it appeared reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action  with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit.? U.S. v. Foster, 9 F.R.D. 367, 391 (S.D.N.Y. 1949).\\n I hope this answers your question.","title":"Part of major* American political party has openly called for political violence against Kamala Harris: the New Hampshire Libertarian Party"},{"text":"You want the cult to disarm *themselves*?","title":"Alleged would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh donated exclusively to Democrats since 2019"},{"text":"We Libertarians truly are the most oppressed Minority.THEY TARGETED LIBERTARIANS!

Trump and other Republicans frequently allude to jailing their political adversaries, call for military tribunals, and danc around the subject of using bloodshed to get their way. When school shootings happen, Republicans shrug and say it's just a fact of life. Plenty of teachers, librarians, and doctors face threats due to things like abortion or being pro-LGBTQ.So, again, let's cut the shit.
