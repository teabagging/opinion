Unfortunately, the paratroopers immediately encounter resistance from an unexpected force: a cartel alliance so unified it makes NATO look like a dysfunctional family reunion. Armed with weapons, drones, and memes supplied by BRICS nations, the cartels swiftly dismantle the poorly planned offensive.Enraged by the setback, **President Trump**, in a Mar-a-Lago briefing livestreamed on Truth Social, declares the invasions failure a conspiracy orchestrated by the BRICS coalition. Trump accuses China of funding taco trucks to fuel Mexican resistance, Brazil of sending samba dancers to distract American troops, and Russia of providing Mexico with super-secret vodka missiles.As the war grinds on into its sixth month, American forces falter. Supply chains crumble because DeSantis insists on banning books and diversity in the field manuals, leaving troops unable to strategize effectively. Meanwhile, BRICS nations ramp up their support, shipping advanced weaponry to Mexico and encouraging TikTok dances mocking U.S. tactics. Mexico begins reclaiming territory in two strategic directions: *North Texas* and *South Florida.*Realizing the regular military needs a \\"special touch,\\" Trump appoints **Joe Rogan** as Commander of the rogue **Proud Boys Tactical Assault Force.** With a recruitment strategy that involves podcast appearances and prison visits, Rogan rallies an eclectic crew of fitness influencers, conspiracy theorists, and prisoners promised full pardons. Their mission? A *meat assault* on Guadalajara, featuring CrossFit-style combat tactics and elk meat MREs.But as the Proud Boys unit suffers heavy losses (and high cholesterol), Rogan grows disillusioned. During a viral live-streamed rant from the battlefield, he accuses Trump of being compromised by \\"alien brain waves\\" and declares the invasion an elaborate ploy by the deep state to keep us from finding the real pyramids of Mexico. Rogan then orders his Proud Boys to march on Washington, but the rebellion ends abruptly when Trump challenges him to a one-on-one grudge match at UFC 400. The pay-per-view showdown concludes with Trump declaring victory via a move he dubs the \\"MAGA Slam.\\"Meanwhile, the war devolves into chaos. BRICS powers, now openly mocking the U.S., supply Mexico with long-range missile systems capable of striking deep into American territory. They encourage Mexico to take back their land, and soon, Monterreys counteroffensive reaches as far as Dallas. DeSantis proposes a last-ditch \\"dont tread on me\\" retreat strategy but gets distracted by a new culture war campaign against tacos.As the dust settles, America stands divided, with its borders redrawn and its leadership in shambles. Greene resigns to host a reality TV show, DeSantis retreats to write a memoir titled *It Was All Disneys Fault,* and Trump blames it all on *rigged maps.* Meanwhile, Mexico, buoyed by international support, celebrates its newfound status as a global military power, and the cartels rebrand themselves as national heroes in the eyes of their people.","title":"Trump team debates \\"how much\\" they should invade Mexico, Rolling Stone reports"},{"text":"It sickens me too!","title":"Musk accuses Trump whistleblower Vindman of treason, says he will pay"},{"text":"I can't tell if you're being disingenuous or not.","title":"Trump taps GOP megadonor with no military experience to head up US Navy"},{"text":"Second coming of what?

He was almost universally loved).I asked many voters who were against her why they didn't want to vote for her and almost without fail their first complaint was \\"Why do we need bike lanes?\\" or \\"She outsourced our tourism advertising campaign to a Minneapolis firm\\" or that  \\"she spends too much time in St. Paul trying to raise money.\\" the latter of which was her going to the state legislature to try to lobby for funds to support our infrastructure. :eyeroll:Obviously, none of these complaints are truly valid complaints about her leadership.

Of course,  Marxists and liberals don't agree because of the history of both in aligning for interests. For Marxists,  they can bring people of various movements together such as Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party aligning people on class lines over racial divisions given by imperialists. Doesn't mean you don't try to work with conservatives or libertarians if you can find common ground such as being anti-war.[One of the big reasons I can recommend Rainier Shea is that he puts this dichotomy into perspective] (https://newswiththeory.com/communists-can-overcome-the-states-attacks-by-allying-with-illiberal-military-elements-preparing-to-defend-from-the-counter-gangs/) in his writing: The organized lefts investment in liberal identity politics has long kept what we call Marxism in America isolated, and separated from the class struggle. But the communists who refuse to embrace this dead-end mode of practice now have the momentum required for rebuilding what the USAs workers struggle has lost. If things keep going as they are now, were going to have a comparable amount of numbers and institutional power to that of communists in places like Russia. As Christopher Helali said amid his participation in ACPs [American Communist Party] launch: We have lots of work, but its okay. Work is good, struggle is good. Some of us will last long in the struggle, and some of us will not. Some of us will be persecuted, others might not. Whatever happens, united forwards, backwards never.And yes,  I've been heavily pushing for class struggle but would say there's so much propaganda about leaders of socialism that you have to relearn without the propaganda influencing you. People lied about [Gaddafi by calling him a dictator] (https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/14ywkv0/gaddafi_turned_libya_from_the_poorest_country_in/) so how can you know that what's said about [Stalin, ](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/1fjhyz8/stalin_starved_his_population/) [Castro] (https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/11df4pk/anticastro_propaganda_in_usa/), [Kim Jong Un](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/ev27p8/north_korea_kim_jonguns_aunt_appears_alive_after/), and many others. And what I find is everyone is on their own path and journey and it's largely undefined.  Find the truth and don't worry about the labels.  Labels slow you down.

The US put tariffs on all the VCRs and automobiles in retaliation and Japan buckled. Not only did they not do retaliatory tariffs they stopped flooding the US with semiconductors and opened their domestic markets to more foreign produced goods.Typically, when using a tariff as a diplomatic stick it works as a response to unfair practices that the punished country really shouldnt be doing in the first place if they are a good trade partner.","title":"If trump is supposed to save America, why is he going to implement tariffs?

If passed, the bill would see $200bn in funding and the work of the education department redistributed to other federal agencies and states. The federal Department of Education has never educated a single student, and its long past time to end this bureaucratic department that causes more harm than good, Rounds said in a statement announcing the bill.Holy shit, \\"has never educated a *single* student?\\" Ironically, the reason people like this get elected is *due to* our electorate's lack of education. It's an underlying theme here. The less educated the general public is, the more likely they are to vote Republican. Make no mistake, this is part of the Christian Nationalist, anti-intellectual agenda. The goal isn't to \\"return education to our states,\\" the goal is to encourage parents to enroll their children in private schools and religious institutions by whatever means necessary, And if they can't afford it, then school vouchers and \\"radical unschooling\\" are options of course.This bill appeals to aggrieved right wing anti-intellectuals, contrarians, religious fanatics and homeschoolers.Americans who have been inundated with so much culture war propaganda, fearmongering rhetoric and misinformation that they've become convinced that the education system is a \\"radical leftist\\" institution, teaching  critical race theory, indoctrinating children, grooming them and exposing them to graphic pornography in the classroom and in school libraries, brainwashing them with cultural marxist propaganda and gender pedagogy, teaching them to grow up to be secular leftists, atheists, communists, socialists... Teaching children to hate religion, to hate \\"whiteness,\\" to hate America, to feel guilty for being white... Teaching them American history that's too discomforting for conservative parents because it's not whitewashed enough. Encouraging them to go to the bathroom in litter boxes, forcing them to undergo sex change operations, pressuring them to use alternative pronouns, insisting that boys play in girls sports. Oh, and educating them on climate change and evolution, and *not* teaching them to interpret the Bible literally, God have mercy! and the list goes on and on. He added: For years, Ive worked toward removing the federal Department of Education. Im pleased that president-elect Trump shares this vision.We were warned about this over and over again. That the MAGA coalition would use Trump to enact a dangerous agenda with staggering consequences. That they would exchange their loyalty to Trump for a chance to consolidate power for the foreseeable future. A one-party system of government restructured at every level to accommodate the far right.This includes Christian Nationalists, ultra-nativists and white supremacists cheering on mass deportations, rolling back decades of civil rights legislation, pushing discriminatory policies that target out-groups, foreigners and marginalized people, and all while granting themselves the power to unilaterally remodel the government after a Church-state.This includes members of the federal society who have been trained and vetted to infiltrate the courts and reshape the justice system.This includes Heritage Foundation allies with goals to implement every extreme conservative policy we've been cautioned against, and policies that conservatives tried to gaslight us about.This includes special interest groups, corporate executives and powers with an agenda to cripple the labor movement, cut taxes for the rich/corporations, and redistribute wealth to the top. This includes discredited health \\"experts\\" with an agenda to reinforce distrust in the medical community and jeopardize public health.Neoliberals and \\"limited government,\\" \\"free market\\" conservatives interested in cutting social programs, Medicare and Medicaid, social security, privatizing every resource or service, then subsidizing the businesses and organizations run by their allies that will control what's left of these essential services.And of course, all the incompetent sycophants who will be installed into positions of power and agency staff roles that were formerly reserved for civil servants and knowledgeable professionals with relevant expertise, and whose jobs didn't previously rely on their level of loyalty to the president and the MAGA agenda.But we were also told that Donald Trump just exaggerates sometimes, that we shouldn't take him seriously when he makes unconstitutional threats, when he promotes an extreme and dangerous, anti-democratic agenda, when he asserts that he will become a dictator, or when he threatens to eliminate government agencies altogether and put what's the left of the administrative state under his direct control.

Russian criminals with links to the Kremlin, the old KGB and its main successor, the FSB, used the scheme between 2010 and 2014 to move money into the western financial system. The cash involved could total $80bn, detectives believe.Deutsche Bank was used to launder the money via its corresponding banking network C effectively allowing illegal Russian payments to be funnelled to the US, the European Union and Asia...Deutsche is also under scrutiny in Washington over its financial dealings with Donald Trump. On 15 April, Democrats from the House intelligence and financial services committees issued a subpoena, demanding the bank provide documents about its lending to the president.Over two decades, Trump borrowed more than $2bn from Deutsche. In 2008, he defaulted on a $45m loan repayment and sued the bank. Its private wealth division in New York subsequently loaned Trump a further $300m C a move that bemused insiders and which has yet to be fully explained.In recent years, the bank has had a series of bruising encounters with international regulators. Between 2011 and 2018, it paid $14.5bn in fines, with exposure to dubious Russian money a regular theme.\\"\\n2017: https://www.reuters.com/article/world/deutsche-bank-fined-for-10-billion-sham-russian-trades-idUSKBN15F1L6/2019: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/17/deutsche-bank-faces-action-over-20bn-russian-money-laundering-scheme","title":"Trumps promise to loosen crypto regulations may be boon for extremist groups | Trump administration"},{"text":"Obviously.

The very first in this chain, I think was Biden announcing he was going to have an African American female running mate, leading to a small pool of candidates for that role. He kind of made that comment off the cuff, probably without thinking it through, but once it was out, he couldn't take it back. So, of the small pool of choices, he chose Kamala Harris. Another bad decision, since she had low popularity to begin with and she's not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. Fast forward to 2023. Now would have been a good time for Biden to announce  he's not running for reelection so there could be a proper primary. Or it would have been a good time for the DNC to pull the stunt they did during the Summer and force Biden off the ticket. But nope, can't announce the president is mentally deficient, even if a lot of us can already see it. So the next misstep is waiting for Biden's first debate with Trump for it to become apparent his brains fried. It's too late for a regular primary and they just kind of throw Harris in. And then she makes her own mistakes during the campaign, like not having clear answers for obvious questions. Setting aside the administration's abysmal record, which is it's own series of missteps, at any part of the chain of these events, Dems could have taken the difficult option which would have paid off later, but instead went with the expedient option. And during the presidential race, all those expedient shortcuts finally caught up with them as they'd painted themselves into an ever smaller corner, so now the whole thing collapsed in on itself.","title":"Did the Democrats throw the Election?"},{"text":"is there 3 republicans willing to side with democrats?","title":"Trump Staffing His Administration With House Members Could Cripple His First 100 Days"},{"text":"\\"Whatever voters believe, that's truth!\\"-St Newt of Gingrich","title":"Several Trump picks for top jobs targeted with bomb and 'swatting' threats"},{"text":"As an adult with a lifetime of adhd, on the contrary.

Voting identity cards are provided free of charge unlike the US where IDs typically cost money and require you to proactively register. India also votes largely by voting machine. And finally India for the most part does not allow voting by mail. Instead of you are eligible for voting off-site you are visited by an electoral officer who records your vote on a voting machine. India restricts this eligibility however to seniors, physically disabled voters and in the last election to those with Covid.The US could have the same quick results if it committed to centrally run elections where the state goes out of its way to allow voters to vote. India for instance sets up polling booths high in the mountains and deep in swamps just to service isolated communities. Meanwhile in the US states like Texas try to limit entire counties to a single voting location. Similarly the US could take the effort to take the voting machines to voters who wish to vote at home. And like India could declare the day of in person voting to be a federal holiday. All of this would reduce the need to rely on ballots that come in through the postal network and would speed up counting.But it's Republicans who oppose most of these measures.","title":"Democrat Derek Tran unseats GOP Michelle Steel in razor-thin Orange County House race"},{"text":"The party whenever children get brutally gunned down by a Republican they say thoughts and prayers but when their own get targeted then its bad and those people should get shot","title":"Slew of Trump Admin Picks Targeted With Violent Threats Ahead of Thanksgiving"},{"text":"Nope.

The first round of tariffs were a bit hard on our company at first but we eventually found work arounds. We did have to raise prices a bit, but not much.

Certain products have higher tariffs than others and for those specific products we've started importing them as parts and assembling them here in the US. I'm all for equal trade and using tariffs as a negotiation tool. If a country has high tariffs on our goods then we should be placing the same tariffs on their goods. I'm against a universal tariff though. I think it would be very detrimental and if the goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, then companies need the time to make these adjustments.

Youre starting to get on an anti-Trump rant with somebody who really couldnt give much of a shit about American politics. I care about Canada.?The point is not national defence. The point is Trumps lens of good deals and bad deals. Hes been consistent on that. He does not like it when he feels the US is being taken advantage of. It doesnt matter what you, or I, or anybody thinks, believes, or understands. All that matters is his perspective. This has been his #1 gripe with NATO: the USA subsidizing collective defence for the rest of the alliance.?Bear in mind that when he was last in office, only the USA, Poland, and Estonia spent 2%.?If Canada can address this very tangible metric and present it in our argument to get rid of tariffs, I say thats the only policy-oriented best bet. **Ill reiterate: Republicans over the past two weeks said our Trump 1.0 strategy of Team Canadas Charm Offensive will not work this time. Policy metrics are the minimum.**?So the option is to either keel, over accept a trade war and a 5% GDP contraction for the sake of proving a point that Trump cant be reasoned with.

Nowhere to be found in between elections, we still dont have a clue as to how they contribute to society, but they praise voting as the ultimate civic right and responsibility and wail again about their rights being taken by the other candidate.These are the exact same people that screamed for people who didnt take shots to be put in concentration camps and refused any type of medical or social service, but now are fierce defenders of democracy and freedom of choice. THEIR personal CHOICE to be exact.So no, theres nothing terrible happening, its the same thing happening everywhere and they want you divided and scared so you cant see it happening.BOTH candidates are extremists - so its just a matter of will we do agenda 2030 with the wokies or the conservatives.","title":"Something terrible is happening in Romania"},{"text":"And in the Washington Post no less.

They are focused on \\"the mob\\" or \\"the government\\" taking it all away from them, usually in the form of fiscal, social or monetary policy. It's a psychological thing IMHO, where the government is the only thing that can conceivably threaten them, so they have to cut it down to a form they can comprehend and recognize: a single man they can buy or deal with. They despise the rule of law (and all the other democratic institutions) because, in theory, it applies to everyone equally and they reject equality as a guiding principle in society. They have to reject it, because how else can they justify their own power and wealth?They must believe that they are personally responsible for all their wealth and power, that they deserve it, that everything boils down to individual agency. So they apply that to the government too, namely that they are somehow safer if their legal and political relationship to political power depends on their personal relationship to the man in power. They have to believe they are exceptional, and that leads them to believe they will be the exception in this case too.You are entirely correct that this is a delusion. Dictatorships are not safer than democracies, even for those in positions of wealth and power. But they believe the opposite in the same way the lower ranked followers of these movements believe it. In a way, this is simply the more extreme form of what drives the rich in every country: they insist on policies that deepen social and economic inequality, even though there is ample evidence that it harms them too, and when this causes problems turn to repression rather than making the smallest concessions. Every single step towards a fairer society had to be fought over tooth and nail, despite the fact that it actually made things better even for the rich, and this remained true even in the face of immediate existential threats (fascism, authoritarian communism). Oligarchs turning to dictatorships are merely an aspect of this same old delusion gripping the extremely wealthy. The truth is that these people are just as mad as the madmen they support, or the lunatics who rally around them in the street. They are not rational. They have emotional biases that lead them to act like this, and the power to make this a real problem for everyone else. You can easily see this in how many of them are falling for mad schemes to prolong their lives, to live in bunkers as society falls apart largely because of people like them acting like they do, to go to Mars (or wherever) in an attempt to create their own societies according to their whims and beliefs. These are not the actions and thoughts of rational people, but of people reacting emotionally to the absurdity and immorality of their own position.","title":"Trumps return raises questions over future of CIAs Russian recruitment drive"},{"text":"Best chance is we see a Korean style DMZ zone - until the next administration. bc the endgame is long term and to the Baltic Sea. \\nNo one is challenging Putin at least another decade and we dont want to see the ugly power grab afterwards from a bunch of sycophants &amp; nationalist fanatics.","title":"I recently came across a unique opinion on Ukraine, do yoy guys have the impression that Putin is purposely escalating the conflict in Ukraine while Biden is in office so that when Trump comes in, he sets up some kind of ceasefire that stops the fighting so Trump looks like \\"the hero\\""},{"text":"When a lower life form like trump gets elected, it pulls all the other lower life forms up with him.

Only 11% end up in joint custody.Joint custody with no child support paid should be the default. There should be defined reasons as to why someone has been removed from their child's life. So, that should be the result in 90+% of divorces.  \\n\\"While some of these things are a myth (for example family courts no longer discriminate against men)\\"  \\nWhat makes you think this is a myth? The outcomes suggest you are wrong. Why else would men only get custody 20% of the time? Let me guess, you are going to claim that they did not want custody, with no proof for your claim. That idea ignores the fact that custody fights are expensive, while there is little assistance for poor men (google netional mens law center). If a person is told that they have little chance to win and it will cost them a lot of money, they are not going to pursue that. It would be a waste of time and money, with the results being the same or similar.\\"The question is, how does MGTOW solve these issues when the majority of people designing the laws and policies that contribute to these trends are men themselves?\\" What kind of silly question is this? What does the gender of a lawmaker have to do with the issues people are experiencing due to laws? It would be like saying we do not have to worry about men being murdered at a much higher rate, because men are doing it. It is just another way to dismiss an entire segment of society.As for how does MGTOW solve that, they don't. They chose to leave the system so that they did not have to experience the abuse. \\"In other words, how does men abstaining from dating women convince male policy-makers to address men's issues?\\" It does not. It removes the risk from that one individual.  \\nThe men in MGTOW are not (as far as I am aware) doing this as a punishment, but rather to escape a situation that they feel is unfair. If a man is joining the MGTOW movement as a form of punishment, then they are in the wrong. Just as if the people joining the 4B movement are doing it as a punishment, they are wrong.Ultimately, the two movements are very similar on the surface, but I would question what the desired result is from each group. While I believe that MGTOWs are doing it to escape, I could be wrong as I am not into that culture and only briefly looked at it a few years ago. A lot of the 4B posts appear to be doing it as a punishment and a way to influence laws. That would be similar to the tactics of terrorists and should be seen in the same light.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Provide proof it was actually done by someone on the left.","title":"Bomb threats made against some of Trump's cabinet nominees, FBI says"},{"text":"Yes, but only if we refer to them as freedom trucks.","title":"Team Trump Debates How Much Should We Invade Mexico?"},{"text":"Basic legal principles would say he obviously can't pardon himself because generally no official at any level can judge their own case.

That's going to cause a cultural civil war itself. And it will cause major political and economic rifts. We are already starting to see this. We are in the beginning stages of the American empire deteriorating.

The war is over.\\" When Russia inevitably attacks again, this time in a far better position than they were at in 2022, Trump will then talk about how shitty the Democrats are, because Russia didn't invade Ukraine when HE was in office (in fact he stopped them immediately!), and invaded only after he left. This is also why he's been claiming for three years straight that Ukraine has been destroyed, never relenting no matter how many battles they won: he wants the American people to accept immediately they lost and only his genius peace plan can get them anything.

For a while, Republicans will essentially be at a 1-seat majority, 217R-215D. Gaetz probably represents the reddest seat in Florida (FL-01), and Waltz's (FL-06) and Stefanik's (NY-21) are pretty damn red as well. Doesn't mean these seats aren't flippable though.

I do so myself when I want to learn how to do something simple and quick be it fixing cement cracks, fixing my broken laundry machine, or getting my dead printer running again. Yet YT isn't the end all be all and should be seen as another option in the learning tool kit (comes in really handy when you're asked to fix shit ASAP by your family like you're some professional handy man).Back to the point on the rich weaponizing the stupid. It's always been the rich and powerful who have manipulated and exploited the stupid. Only a matter of more or less and better or worse (in this case it's getting worse). But it's been that way since we've had civilization (heck maybe even before). Our entire society is built upon hierarchy with laws, money, enforcement, military, trade, religion, and even culture curated for the rich/powerful: Chinese emperors with their mandates of heaven, Magna Carta split power from the king but gave it other powerful/influential subjects, Confucian ideology preaching servitude to those above you, police act differently to someone poor/minority compared to a rich lawmaker, Christianity preaching forgiveness as well as shunning banking/finance, other Abrahamic religions teaching you to submission to \\"the lord\\", school systems being split by not only area codes where certain schools are massively better but there are private schools for privileged   children to further get ahead, Buddhism preaching the need for nothing, the confines of law to keep the populace under control while those with power can write the laws to their needs, the use of media/influence to propagate messages you want be it semi-fictional kings with noblesse oblige to fictional tragedies of traitors like Macbeth to some neopo-baby billionaire Trump being a champion of the poor uneducated folk, etcetcetc. Our entire society is built by those with smarts, power, money, influence, and means so of course it would be built in their favor. Only time it isn't is when there is revolution, but even then it's only a matter of time before the next brightest/richest/strongest/bestpositioned guy re-instates himself at the top and begins rebuilding society to benefit those at the top be it Napoleon, Stalin, Mao, etcetcetc. Men like Washington are the exception rather than the rule in history. Even then there were those who wanted Washington to be king and the founding fathers wrote the laws/constitution in favor of rich white men of means (property/land owners).","title":"Mexican Presidents Harsh Takedown of Trump Exposes an Ugly MAGA Scam"},{"text":"Think theyll realize that tariffs are paid by the consumer then?

This means that Democrats are on track to flip two more House seats in California, which means Republicans will likely only win 220 seats in the House, representing a net loss of 2 seats compared to the 2022 midterms.

Fleitz said Trump has responded favorably to the plan. Which makes sense for why he got the pick to be envoy. Not the best but not the worst.

In the documents case Trump wasn't charged under 2278, but if I remember correctly it was reported that he had documents that fell under the atomic energy statutes.This is a lot of words to say that I don't expect Trump to ever be re-charged with these crimes.

These aren't minor chargesthey indicate a deliberate attempt to disrupt the democratic process.\\nThe rhetoric during the attack included threats like \\"Hang Mike Pence,\\" which highlights the potential for extreme violence.\\nThis was not just a protest but an unprecedented breach of a federal institution.Threats Against Election Officials:Multiple reports have confirmed death threats made to election workers and officials. For example, Ruby Freeman, an election worker in Georgia, testified before Congress about receiving threats and harassment after baseless accusations of fraud.\\nThese incidents discourage participation in the democratic process and create fear among those tasked with ensuring free and fair elections.Rising Political Violence:According to a study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, political violence in the U.S. has increased, with incidents often tied to partisan divisions. This includes threats against public servants and violent actions linked to misinformation.Language Matters:Trumps continued promises to pardon January 6 participants, coupled with public support for those convicted, may embolden similar actions. This isn't hypotheticalsuch promises influence behavior.While the other guy's description may seem heightened, it reflects real, documented trends. Downplaying these events risks normalizing political violence and undermining the rule of law.

If indeed a simulation that would require a creator1. Humans conceive ideas, even seemingly impossible ones.\\\\- This would require us to be created in the image of our creator2. Over time, many ideas are actualized through advancements in knowledge and technology.\\\\- This suggests that if indeed we live in a simulation that it took planning towards a specific purpose 3.  Thoughts represent potential realities \\\\- This would be limited to the confines of the creation, laws of the universe, motion - thermodynamics - gravitation etc.If we are created to learn something, then there must be an instruction manual of sorts to be found, and it must have been found and passed through the ages as all whoever lived must have access to understanding the simulation from the creator.Mankind is naturally predisposed to believe in God and an afterlife - this is proven through history and also in recent studies.  Simulations necessitate three things to succeed - preparation - active participation and a post sim debrief. Isaac Newton, the obviously brilliant man who helped us understand some of these laws and confines we are bound with once said, prophecy is just \\"histories of things to come\\" ,  and if we apply that to an instruction manual - the true instruction manual would be a religious one that can be proven historically accurate in regards to prophecy and one that can accurately tell us the history to come. So my alternative explanation is in fact an old one, we are made in the image of our creator, we are given free will, we can actively search out the purpose we are here for or we can ignore it - free will.  But to go back to Newtons point I, and my direct point to change your view is that this is indeed a base reality and that trying to justify a simulation is simply having a form of godliness but denying its power - as was prophesied.Evil in the Last Days[1](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm)But understand this: In the last days terrible times will come.?[2](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm)For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,?[3](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm)unloving, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, without love of good,?[4](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-4.htm)traitorous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,?[5](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm)h**aving a form of godliness but denying its power**.?","title":"CMV: If thoughts represent potential realities, then simulation theory suggests we are likely already living in a simulation."},{"text":"Canadian here.

The problem was that they did it while spouting misogynistic rhetoric, AND they did it in such a way that hurt women in other ways.The MGTOW movement cant be compared to 4B because it is a fake seperatist movement lol.These wiki paragraph describing the origins &amp; modus operandi of MGTOW alone makes it comical to even compare the two movements Earlier members of MGTOW were largely politically libertarian and focused on individual self-reliance in accordance with traditional notions of masculinity. **Over time, the movements focus shifted toward male separatism**. Far-right commentator and polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos is credited with helping to popularize MGTOW with a 2014 Breitbart article titled The Sexodus, in which he described **men who were eschewing women, love, sex, and marriage because of feminism** MGTOW men gauge their participation in the movement on a series of four levels.[32] At the first level, men believe they are used and manipulated by women (called situational awareness or the red pill[33]) but still believe in the value of marriage; they are sometimes described as purple pilled.[34] At the second level, men reject long-term relationships, cohabitation, and marriage, **but will still participate in shorter term relationships and sexual encounters** A male seperatism movement in which men still engage in short term &amp; sexual relationships with women? ?LOOOOL. The 4B movement hasnt proven itself so hypocritical.\\nETA: Proponents of 4B &amp; female separatism in general would never allow such oxymoronic behavior to define the movement. I remember right after the election when. 4B was having a moment in the spotlight among American twitter users, and a lot of American women were being first introduced to the 4B movement itself and the concept of female seperatist movements in general, a recurring sentiment in the discourse was I have a boyfriend but hes like, a feminist. Can I still participate! :3 or Does it count if we engage in casual relationships with men?And the response from most women who consider themselves either part of 4B movement in particular or women who were already practising female separatism in general was pretty much are you bitches seriousSo that pretty much explains that??Many of the men going their own way clearly do not actually want to go their own way evidenced by the fact that they still find a way to paradoxically engage with women. That also includes the harassment and other ways in which MGTOW are dedicated to trying to make womens lives harder as described in u/petielvrrr s comment\\n**MGTOW: women are so terrible that we are going to go out of our way harass them and seek out sexual relationships with them, and generally try to make their lives harder*4B (so far) : men are so terrible that we are actually going to stay away from them**Treating both movements the same would be dishonest because they do not do the same thing.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Remember: if you plan on putting I Did That! stickers on the gas pumps, get one with both Trump and Vance on it.

And in my view the benefits of higher employment and putting more Americans in high paying jobs outweighs paying higher costs for goods. We're essentially paying for the cost of producing things in the US. Especially for items that don't cost that much more to make in the US, putting tariffs would only increase costs slightly while vastly increasing demand for American goods.So tariffs are especially good for things where it doesn't cost that much more to produce in the US. And there may be disadvantages when things cost vastly more to produce in the US versus China. In addition, we can use tariffs to not support our geopolitical adversaries, and threaten tariffs to encourage our desired action. For example, the threat of tariffs on Mexico will force Mexico to stop illegal immigrants from coming into our country. And tariffs on China will cause the US to maybe buy goods from a country that is a US ally or isn't an adversary like China is.","title":"Can someone give me the counter argument to all Trump Tariff headlines Ive been seeing across all media lately"},{"text":"Will do!  xoxo","title":"Trump team announces Cabinet nominees were swatted and received bomb threats"},{"text":"I don't get the criticism.

It does not matter why it is charged. It is the position where the baby is both a living human with rights and protections and not a living human with rights and protections at the same time.\\"As for \\"Schrodingers Baby\\" - it is more so about the women's bodily autonomy.\\"  \\nBodily autonomy is not a right. Every man has to sign up to give up his life when asked at the age of 18. One group cannot have more rights than another and it be a fair system.\\"she is not allowed to abort, that she?**has**?to be pregnant and deliver the baby\\" As I said, either way is fine, but you cannot have a baby both have rights and not have rights depending on who infringes upon those rights. If you say the baby has rights, then you cannot abort. If you say they do not have rights, then you cannot charge people for manslaughter or murder when one dies because of someone else's actions. Again, I do not care which direction we take, but rather that we are consistent and can therefore predict the outcome of any action we take.\\"We are still trying to understand when consciousness starts, so it is difficult to pin down exactly when a fetus has the awareness we would expect from a human as we know it. Does it have human DNA? Yes. You know what else has human DNA -?**sperm**?\\\\- and any man (including myself) that has had a wank is essentially committing a genocide every ejaculation.\\"None of that has any relevance to what I posted. But I will address it anyhow. Consciousness has nothing to do with the question. If a lack of consciousness removed your rights, then people in a vegetative state would have no rights. As this is not how this is handled, this is not a metric that is used to determine if someone has rights. The argument that something having human DNA makes it a human is silly. My spit has human DNA, does that give it rights? See, silly. Sperm is no more a human than an egg. The arguments you make about sperm would also be arguments made about the egg. This is a silly argument trying to equate a part of a human with a whole human. \\"At the end of the day, I will always choose the one who is clearly a human and has bodily autonomy versus the one who is debatably human and especially considering that fetuses?**by definition do not have bodily autonomy**?\\\\- they require the mother's body to survive and grow, otherwise they will perish. More like a parasite at that stage, if you are being grossly biologically minded about it.\\"Both are clearly human. Both are alive. Both meet every requirement to be a living being. Bodily autonomy is not a right. We know this as men lack it. Furthermore, not all humans with rights have bodily autonomy. No, a baby is not a parasite. Attempting to remove its humanity is a tried and true tactic to remove rights from others.Again, I do not care either way. What I care about is consistency and the ability to predict outcomes. Neither exists with the duality that currently exists.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Im told these things dont happen.

That has been shaped by the US seizing a huge swathe of Mexican territory in the 18th century, which today makes up Texas, California and several other states.But it remains to be seen whether Dr Sheinbaums tough stance is strategically astute.US-Mexican trade has boomed since the North American Free Trade Treaty came into effect in 1994, reaching roughly $600 billion in 2023 and seeing the two economies increasingly intertwined.That treaty was renegotiated by the last Trump administration C a deal he would effectively be tearing up with any new tariffs. Yet Mexicos GDP of $1.8 trillion is just seven per cent of the USs, while 80 per cent of its exports go to the US.Mexico would, therefore, come off far worse than the US should a trade war break out. But it could still inflict a significant toll on US consumers and businesses C and therefore on Mr Trumps incoming administration.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/27/mexico-says-respond-trumps-tariff-threat-levy-own/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/27/mexico-says-respond-trumps-tariff-threat-levy-own/)","title":"Mexico says it will respond to Trumps 25pc tariff threat with levy of its own"},{"text":"Seriously, he must have a ton of dirt on people.","title":"The Law Went Light on Trumpand Now America Will Pay the Price - Now that Trump has escaped punishment for his many crimes, the lesson is clear: He can do whatever he wants, and get away with it."},{"text":"Man, I dont even fully understand the UK political system and even I could see how relevant and accurate the satire was in Yes, Minister.

This is more of a philosophical explorationwhat others might call mental masturbation (haha, well, I hope we can mutually benefit from it anyway).As for your second point: Yes, Im describing technological advancement, but in the context of time. The ability to invent or create depends on the available knowledge, resources, and context of the era. The progress required to actualize an idea like flight wasnt possible in ancient times, but with the right context (resources, technology, minds working on it), it became a reality.
