Hence, if only 2 withhold he's toast. Johnson broke his agreement with Democrats (exactly the same thing that doomed McCarthy, fyi), so Jeffries has declared him persona non grata and the Dems will not save his butt. My prediction is these holdouts like Massie will let Johnson twist in the wind for a vote or two, extract some sort of concession for the next funding bill. But the real question is whether Johnson has the stones and votes to make sure someone can't do to him what Gaetz did to McCarthy by allowing just one person to call for what is essentially an American version of the no-confidence vote. My other prediction is if we are definitely headed towards a constitutional level crisis about the certification &amp; inauguration, Jeffries will step in to save the country the utter world-wide embarrassment of it by saving Johnson at that point. Otherwise, it's pretty easy to predict that Trump will insist he is president when in fact it would go to the president pro tempore of the Senate. And you will know the Republicans think this is a possibility when the usual proforma election of that position becomes a real fight (by recent tradition, the party's member with the most seniority gets the honor, which will be Chuck Grassley).","title":"Despite Trump Endorsement, Several House Republicans Raise Doubts They Will Vote For Johnson As Speaker"},{"text":"A veritable basket of deplorables.

Investigative journalism helps, but it tends to preach to the converted. There need to be news channels and media outlets for getting messages across to non-metropolitan areas dominated by far-right news sources. Liberal-minded billionaires should not sit idly by as they did in Hungary, watching the right take over the media. The New Right is also significantly more embedded in social media than liberals are. Those of us who favor democracy cannot let Elon Musks and Andrew Tates control the public discourse. Progressive influencers: Time to log in and post away  theres a narrative battle to win....To win the fight against autocracy, above all, the Democratic Party must reconnect with the working class to preserve liberal institutions. There are simply not enough educated moderate suburbanites for an electoral majority.First, this means creating new and strengthening existing local organizational structures, especially labor unions. Popular mobilization is crucial to energize the base. Yet, such mobilization sometimes focuses on issues important to the active base only  a tactical error that should be avoided. For example, the most mobilized segments of Hungarian society tend to focus on media freedom or democracy, but these are not the primary concerns of ordinary citizens, leading to repeated failures of mass mobilizations. To create the groundwork so ordinary people will mobilize during elections, its important to engage with them outside elections, focusing on issues that matter to them.Second, party financing should shift from the corporate elite to small and micro-donations. Fortunately, Democrats already have a strong base of small donors, but it needs to grow. This is the only guarantee against elites capturing the Democratic Party and provides a solid foundation to push through popular reforms that elites oppose. Freeing the party from elite capture will allow it to talk about things that matter, from the decline of middle America to inequality.Third, commit to left-populist economic policies. Republicans have stolen key populist messages; Democrats need to reclaim them. If done smartly, populist economic policies work and are popular in swing states, even among right-leaning voters. Championing issues like breaking the chokehold of pharmaceuticals over the health system, fighting inflation or increasing the minimum wage are key to overcoming the chasm separating low- and high-income Americans and would allow Democrats to regain their pro-worker bona fides.Fourth, learn symbolic class politics. In their free time, most Americans go to McDonalds and not to the opera. Democrats must learn to avoid coming across as condescending intellectuals and learn to valorize the working class. Instead of solely focusing on abstract aggregates dear to experts, Democrats must pay more attention to the lived experience of economic change. Embrace the mundane and be down to earth; it will not compromise but will enliven your transformative vision of justice and democracy.Hungarys key lesson is you dont protect democracy by talking about democracy  you protect democracy by protecting people. Only a democracy that works for the people is sustainable.","title":"Gbor Scheiring: I Watched Orbn Destroy Hungarys Democracy.

Remember all those Haitian immigrants who are in this country legally, and the targeted hate campaign against them thanks to unsubstantiated rumors and misinformation running rampant across right wing media?Whether here legally or illegally, there are many Trump supporters out there who cannot or will not discern the difference.And let's not memory hole Republicans shooting down one of the most stringent bipartisan immigration reform bills in recent history at the behest of Trump. Trump himself even admitted that the bill's passing would be too politically advantageous for Democrats.Many Republicans killed the bill at Trump's demand, and without even knowing the bill's contents. Even Republicans like Katie Brit, who actually worked with Democrats for months to negotiate on the bill, turned it down.Trump brags about having the most secure border in history, which is an outright lie, while him and his supporters conveniently leave out the part where the Trump administration benefited from a global slowdown in immigration due to the pandemic, and a subsequent emergency policy that relied solely on the existence and prevalence of COVID, a virus that Trump and his supporters constantly downplayed. All of which created a backlog of border encounters that would carry over into the Biden administration. For Republicans, immigration is a winning, wedge issue, because they don't campaign on fixing it, they campaign on scapegoating immigrants and raising fears that appeal to a chunk of the electorate's grievances, phobias, and paranoid delusions.Throughout multiple administrations, Republicans have been complaining about the \\"border crisis,\\" and they're a hell of a lot more outspoken about it whenever a democrat is in office.The only policies that Republicans do propose, are non-starters. But unfortunately, a lot of Americans don't understand just how disingenuous the GOP strives to be when it comes to this issue. Their policies are often extreme, non-viable, cruel and fear-driven. While at least some Democrats try to run on policies that address legal and illegal immigration in a practical and humane way.","title":"Connecticut AG says hed be first to sue if Trump targets birthright citizenship"},{"text":"The Al-Qaeda came out of the Mujahedeen which was created by the US, specifically Zbigniew Brzezinsky.The bin Ladens are Saudi insiders who were with Kissinger on 9/11.The towers underwent a controlled demolition using thermite.

I always find this such a weird standard. What people when they say this really just mean is that in that specific case they think the **interests** of one person matter more than that of the other. Absolute free speech is paradoxical issue because it would allow speech that advocates for the suppression of speech itself, such as calls for censorship or authoritarian rule.Yes, and that's not paradoxical. That's why speech isn't actions and why some people believe in absolute free speech. Becausing advocating that people not be able to say everything is not the same as making laws that punish them for saying certain things. That's why speech is in an entirely different class from actions and why many believe in free speech. There is indeed no one who preaches free actions for this reason. If we compare, the only significant difference between parties like the AfD and the Ba'ath Party is that the Ba'athists were Socialist-ish. Absolute free speech has allowed harm through the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and dangerous ideologies (such as far-right xenophobia and religious fundamentalism), undermining societal cohesion and trust. It also enables incitement to violence and defamation.So has religion and many other things.this is always my gripe when people talk about harm the standard is always so ridiculously unfair and things that are objectively speaking far more harmful than many things that are banned are allowed because they're socially acceptable. It was never about harm, it was always about arbitrary social acceptance.If Abrahamic religions didn't exist, and I would write the old Testament and everything in it today, it might very well be banned in many countries. Of course, the standard with regards to what drugs are banned because they are harmful is always also completely ridiculous.  misinformation is also always purely applied to misinformation I personally take social offence to while all sorts of other forms of outright lies, such as, again, what is written in about every religion on the planet is allowed a pass because it's socially acceptable.If Abrahamists can preach that the world was created by a fictive diety 6000 years ago, then any other lie should be allowed as well. They are all lies, nothing more. If Jews can stand up and proclaim that Hebrews were enslaved by the Egyptians, something which with all overwhelming probability is not true given all historical evidence, then Nazis should be able to stand up and claim that the holocaust never happened, a claim just as false. Historically, unrestricted hate speech has contributed to atrocities. During the early years of post-2003 Iraq, the US under Bremer and later through Al Maliki let sectarian TV channels and media outlets to be completely free. Which fueled tensions between Sunni and Shia communities, contributing to the violence that accrued. The same thing happened during the Rwandan Genocide, unchecked radio broadcasts (Mostly by the Radio Tlvision Libre des Mille Collines aka Radio Genocide) incited mass killings and violence.Yes, so did, again, every religion that's legal today. How many wars have been and still are fought over religious differences? How many people were mass murdered because they had a slightly different interpretion of the Abrahamic god than those who mass murdered them? How many people were tortured by the inquisition because they held scientificaslly accurate beliefs that went against the religious docrine?I'll believe it when the standard is fair, but that will never hpapen. And tbh, no society permits absolute free speech. Even in societies like the United States, where free speech is a fundamental right, certain speech, especially in politically sensitive contexts (such as criticism of foreign governments like Israel or criticism of a formerly oppressed group), can face legal restrictions. This reflects the limits on free speech that exist in every society, where speech that undermines national interests or incites unrest can be controlled, even in democracies.Even? The U.S.A. has about the least freedom of speech compared to about any other developed country except maybe the U.K.. I don't understand why it keeps saying of itself that it has so much freedom of speech when there are literal free speech zones and fines for swearwords on television there.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":"We should just start calling it Twitter again, that would eventually eat at him.","title":"Elon Musk 'living in cottage on Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate'"},{"text":"Sometimes the only way to deal with a lousy toddler is to let them rub their noses in their own shit for a while.","title":"Republicans Admit MAGA Civil War Is a Total Sshowand its Only Gonna Get Worse"},{"text":"Its whatever comes into his head at the time.

(Growing the economy also grows the tax base and thus creates additional breathing room for public investment, at least theoretically.)2. You made a point about high minimum wages being a failure, see the example of France.

The Democratic Party has to account for that in their future campaigns.The Right Wing can run idiots, ogres or others from the bottom of the barrel and continue to give them their solid 30% support even if they have a track record of failure.  Examples are GWB, Trump, Reagan, Ted Cruz and in Canada Rob and Doug Ford.  And then there's Berlusconi.  Their standards and expectations are low to non-existent.But everybody else has to be more perfect than God to maintain their support from their own.  Obama's expectations were so high, he got the Nobel Peace Prize.  But a lot of Democrats were disappointed with Obama because he watered down the ACA and didn't push the fight on climate change hard enough.  He won his second term but barely.Between Harris and Trump, specific groups like Latinos and Arabs are measuring Harris by a different standard they are not giving Trump.People continue to be worried about the economy under the Democrats even though the historical record shows the past 10 recessions started under Republican Presidents.  The latest Democrat was Carter.Even when they agree with Harris' position on many things like climate change and abortion rights, they can't support her because of her non- commitment against genocide.  You can't argue with that. Paraphrasing  from interviews, Harris had to earn to votes from democrat supporters.  But Trump is not subject to the same judgement.  Trump doesn't need to earn anybody's vote.  He's got the Republican vote locked-in regardless of his track record of failures.Meanwhile, Trump gets a pass because they think the institutional checks and balances will keep Trump from becoming a dictator.  (Haven't history taught them anything about that?) They disregard his past actions of stacking the Supreme Court and appointing judges who are loyal to him personally.  Those two alone are why he has survived and gone so far in this election.  And if elected, he'll go further for which his supporters will continue to be in denial.But talk of Harris stacking the Supreme Court, the argument against that is that it would set a bad precedent for each successive President to keep doing.And interviews with voters the day after, it's the same things: the economy, not speaking to/ resonating with common people.Post- mortum analysis says the Democrats disregarded the situation of normal people.  Huh?  I thought I heard Harris address that many times.

Tribalism in poverty is a good way to put it. I was thinking it was the toxic leadership that dont support their troops getting adequate medical care while in. I cant tell you how many vets I run into that proudly think they are 0%, and didnt document anything while in the service. The social trope not to show weakness to the point where they deny anyones disabilities.I did TAPS (the transition program mandated by congress at the time) and I was in there with pilots who were cleared by flight medicine and bragging about their VA rating and their full time commercial airliner gigs they were joining. My MEB officer was a disabled vet and worked. So I had some introduction to the mental gymnastics. And when I talk to other VSOs and vet volunteers they all express that these benefits are ours, all of ours, and we take care of each other and make sure everyone is getting the most of what they deserve (but deserve much more).Its hard because we treat everyone so shitty and think all these poor people getting benefits are the problem, but thats moreso because these benefits have been protected while non-veterans dont have the same protections.Im an optimistic person. I just think the brother and sisterhood that I left with must not be there anymore. The old guard vet orgs were just assholes to most of the Post-9/11ers and would rather exclude vets. Community Care removes the VA experience and isolates vets from the common experience. There are so many places to try to reinstate this, but its above all our pay grades. But MOST vets I know had to struggle like a fish out of water and found that they had emotional issues from serving that were keeping them from gainful employment and social relationships. I lost a few to the 22. Its a universal experience that is so hard to explain to normal civilians- integrating into society as an unskilled worker after being in charge of millions of dollar equipment and managing individuals in the highest stakes environment only to be told we dont have the right degree or enough professional experience. And then the VA paper jockies reject claims for any technicality and requiring additional forms and buddy statements to prove the IED is the cause of the PTSD symptoms. Its tough for vets and we lose so many- its just weird and I cant relate to people who saw the 2025 plans talking about letting private companies deny vets care and calling vets losers and making it harder to claim disability or to get rid of it completely.I think youre onto something about tribalism when your identity isnt tied to veterans as strongly as mine is. But theres still room to grow the tribe, but I dont see any of that going on- its just everyone saying everyone should struggle equally despite explicit benefits to serving in the military and our inability to sue for damages.","title":"The GOP is waging a stealth attack on veterans healthcare"},{"text":"Just remember Trump is  not as powerful as he thinks he is.

The messaging from democrats was not sufficient in convincing swing voters and reluctant voters to keep them in power. They made a risky move switching candidates (one that I still think was the right decision), but it didn't work out they way many had hoped.Unlike many, I don't claim to have the solution, but I think we need to understand that demolishing the pact between the leftists and liberals through infighting is not the way forward.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"It's a very obvious move for them to throw nonsense culture war crap into the headlines.

In the wake of Obama's presidency, the Republicans' post-mortem actually recommending that they moderate on key racial issues in order to draw in minorities who otherwise lean conservative. The current political order will seem stagnant and unchanging, until all at once underlying currents break out into the open, and a new realignment occurs. This could happen four years from now, it could also happen decades from now. Either way, the only way for this eventual shift to break in progressives' favor is to build political power from the local level up. This is what conservatives started doing post new deal, when the Democratics were ascendant, and decades later it paid off with the rise of neoliberalism in the 80s.On my optimistic days, I can imagine the Democrats picking up on the intense populist anger that MAGA feeds on, and using it to fuel a left-populist campaign that recenters the working class as the key constituency of the party.

I'm trying to point out that obviously there are forms of discrimination by the government that cannot be engaged in when deciding on what contracts can be offered to whom.  You said that discrimination in contracts based on political speech is not violating any rights or restricting speech because it just results in the loss of a business relationship.  The same consequence exists in a case where the government discriminates based on race, yet you think that somehow does violate rights even though the consequence for the targeted group is the same.  Why is one form of discrimination a legal restriction and the other is not?The alternative, of course, is that we demand complete ambivalence and when Westboro Baptist Church LLC fills out the right forms and offers the most competitive bid to provide supportive outreach for gay youth in rural Kansas, we refuse to hold their political beliefs against them and award the contract.  If we're not going to do that, we've accepted that prudential political judgments can be made wrt contracting and the only remaining question is which movements are to be excludedThis is an absurd comparison.  If the goal of a gay youth outreach program is to help gay youth, then the overt expressed beliefs and goals of the WBC would demonstrate that they clearly would not be a good choice for that role.  So if you had a government program that was specifically about facilitating business with the Israeli government then it would be perfectly reasonable to decline to grant a contract for that role to a pro-BDS organization.I'm not saying there can be no standards or requirements for government contracts.  What I don't think is appropriate is saying \\"the government can't grant any contracts of any kind to anyone who expresses this particular political belief for any reason\\".  It means it's a voluntary restriction you have to agree to in order to be subject to it.  You can also abrogate it at any time, but will face the consequences you accepted when you accepted the contract.So you can put in any restrictions on a contract you want and if the person doesn't agree with it it's entirely on them?  So the government could, for example, refuse to hire contractors unless they agreed not to hire a particular racial group?  Or they wouldn't hire people who follow a specific religion?That seems like a pretty weak argument to me given the unequal power present in contract negotiations.And you absolutely do think that they should, because I suspect that if Texas awarded a contract to Richard Spencer and defended itself by saying he offered the best bid and his private behavior was nothing of their concern, you'd be perturbed.\\nThe Texas government has contracted and does contract with organizations and individuals I find reprehensible. For example they use public health funds to support organizations that can provide medical advice without a license (because that advice is anti-abortion) and support explicitly homophobic groups.  They have contracts with all kinds of clearly discriminatory organizations, yet somehow they're banned from contracting with companies or individuals who participate in boycotts against Israel specifically (though not boycotts of any other kind).When you're sitting there minding your own business, say something unapproved to whatever audience you can reach, and face a legal consequence.  Not when something you say triggers elements of a contract you acceptedOkay, so then by this logic you think the government can discriminate in contracting by race because there is no legal consequence.  You're saying that if the government requires contractors to not hire black people and the company hires a black person they can terminate that contract and all of that is fine because none of that is a legal consequence or restriction.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":"2024 wasn't the year we needed or deserved, but hopefully things don't get too bad next year!

When you advocate for giving the government any specific power, I would suggest imagining the worst politician you can think of wielding that power and ask if youd trust them to do that and not destroy the country. I do not trust even the politicians I vote for to wield that type of power.The reason I disagree with you on the principle (ie, why I would oppose this type of law even if it would always be perfectly enforced), is that free speech *is about* the type of speech you want to restrict. Freedom of speech means absolutely nothing if it only protects popularly acceptable speech. If you accept regulating extremely authoritarian speech or misinformation, at some point you are saying this view is so evil that you shouldnt even be allowed to say it, or we think thats false, so you shouldnt be allowed to say it. Allowing the government to weigh in on what political views people are and arent allowed to express makes the government precisely the type of authoritarian state you claim to want to avoid. Your government, in this case, would be the one shutting down public speeches and banning books.Lastly, on the point of any type of misinformation regulations, I think there are precisely no reasonable rules that could be established here. If I say something that I believe to be true, but you believe isnt, how do you determine that truth? In a century, science will have progressed and we will likely have a very different understanding of the world. What if Im ahead on that understanding? What if Im behind? Why should I not be able to reject the current view, since thats literally the core of the scientific method?And if I say something I know to be false, you might say *that* could be criminalized. But how about a joke? How about satire? Do you suppose a politician or judge or jury should sit and decide if I was being serious or not?In short, there are a myriad of theoretical and practical problems with restricting speech. The U.S. does not restrict controversial speech, hate speech, or misinformation, except when that speech can be shown to cause a tangible harm. In those cases, its not the speech thats illegal, but the harm itself - if the speech hadnt caused the harm it did but was otherwise exactly the same, it would be legal. All slander, libel, defamation, and similar cases are based on proven harms caused by speech, not the veracity of the speech itself (though the truth is a defense to libel, falsehood alone is not grounds for a lawsuit or prosecution). All incitement cases are based on *results*. If I tell a toddler to blow up a building, I have not actually incited a crime and that would not be punishable. These are not speech restrictions, these are *harm* restrictions.The free speech standard in the U.S., established in *Brandenburg v. Ohio*, is that speech must incite and be likely to produce imminent lawless action in order to be criminally punishable. Brandenburg, the plaintiff, was attending and leading KKK rallies that advocated violence against minorities and pushed racist conspiracy theories, and he invited reporters to broadcast these rallies. The law in question was struck down because it criminalized mere advocacy of violence which is *still* a violation of the First Amendment in the U.S., so I think your conception of what speech can and cant be prosecuted in the U.S. is way off.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":"Twice :(","title":"Appeals court upholds $5 million E.

The Founding Fathers did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In Federalist No. 9 and No. 10, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions. In addition, the first President of the United States, George Washington, was not a member of any political party at the time of his election nor throughout his tenure as president.[12] Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not form, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his Farewell Address.[13] Historian Richard Hofstadter wrote that the Founders \\"did not believe in parties as such, scorned those that they were conscious of as historical models, had a keen terror of party spirit and its evil consequences\\", but \\"almost as soon as their national government was in operation, [they] found it necessary to establish parties.\\"[14]Since their creation in the 1800s, the two dominant parties have changed their ideologies and bases of support considerably, while maintaining their names.

Some things aren't going to change in 2025, like me being a big dork.As of yesterday, the Virginia SD-32 and HD-26 specials have seen 2,987 early in-person voters and 3,494 accepted mail votes, for **6,391 total votes.** Our two big goals before Tuesday: Get the 8,318 unreturned mail ballots in, and get another big day of early voting this coming Saturday.I know turnout is low, but I was curious how this compared to past elections.  And back in January 2023, we actually had a couple of comparable specials in Virginia!  Here's a comparison with those elections - Senate District 7 (a highly competitive race that Dems narrowly flipped) and House District 35 (a deep-blue district that saw little investment but is right next door to the current districts).(Note: The HD-35 district took place in a House district, which has fewer voters than a Senate district.  SD-26 has about 2.5 times as many registered voters as HD-35 did in 2023, so I multiplied the HD-35 numbers by 2.5 and put them in brackets to give a rough estimate of what turnout would have been in an equivalent Senate district).| Type of vote  | Senate District 26 (Jan. 2025)   | Senate District 7 (Jan. 2023)     |House District 35 (Jan. 2023)\\n|:|:|:|:|\\n| Early in-person       |**2897**   |4392   |  2,042 (~5,105)\\n| Mail votes  | **3494 (8318 outstanding)**|5893  |2,914 (~7,285)In other words, I could see us catching the SD-7 early numbers pretty easily, and maybe the HD-35 numbers if we really hit the phones.  We want a strong early showing to make it clear that we aren't putting up with GOP bullshit.  And we'll find out how it went in a week.But until then, you know what to do.

Only it frames it as a contract for small businesses or disabled veteran-owned companies or minority-owned companies and so on.  If it's a contract effectively *for* a specific group, it's *not for* everyone else.)What about banning contracts with people or organizations that support the NAACP? Is that okay?That would be the kind of thing we would leave up to legislatures making laws and regulations for contracting.  In principle, there is nothing wrong with a state or the federal government refusing, as a rule, to support companies that affiliate with certain causes.  For the NAACP in particular, I would say probably not - but if it behaved in certain ways, my opinion might change.The alternative, of course, is that we demand complete ambivalence and when Westboro Baptist Church LLC fills out the right forms and offers the most competitive bid to provide supportive outreach for gay youth in rural Kansas, we refuse to hold their political beliefs against them and award the contract.  If we're not going to do that, we've accepted that prudential political judgments can be made wrt contracting and the only remaining question is which movements are to be excluded.Just because the consequence of said political speech is not getting a government contract (or being prevented from expressing political speech for fear of losing a contract or job you already have) doesn't mean it's not a restriction.It means it's a voluntary restriction you have to agree to in order to be subject to it.  You can also abrogate it at any time, but will face the consequences you accepted when you accepted the contract.And it's worth noting that individually, you're still free to say and support what you want.Sure, the question is whether the state should be able to force contracts to discriminate against particular political beliefs or types speech. Personally I don't think they should, you apparently do.They already do and have since the inception of government contracts.  And you absolutely do think that they should, because I suspect that if Texas awarded a contract to Richard Spencer and defended itself by saying he offered the best bid and his private behavior was nothing of their concern, you'd be perturbed.What consequence is sufficient to count as a restriction by the government?When you're sitting there minding your own business, say something unapproved to whatever audience you can reach, and face a legal consequence.  Not when something you say triggers elements of a contract you accepted.Feel free to have the last word.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":" What about some Tulsi Gabbard smears?They don't want to elevate her name and risk her running in the GOP primary in 2028.

You're still allowed to say what you want, you just may have to sacrifice a business relationship with the government just as you might with any other customer.Okay, so you don't think the government would be violating anyone's rights if they, for example, said that black people couldn't get contracts?  What about banning contracts with people or organizations that support the NAACP?  Is that okay?Just because the consequence of said political speech is not getting a government contract (or being prevented from expressing political speech for fear of losing a contract or job you already have) doesn't mean it's not a restriction.in accordance with the contract you agreed to.  This is a business relationship, and I certainly agree that Texas changing the terms mid-contract was unconstitutional.Sure, the question is whether the state should be able to force contracts to discriminate against particular political beliefs or types speech.  Personally I don't think they should, you apparently do.And my point is that your speech is not legally restricted when the only consequence involved is a lost customer.What consequence is sufficient to count as a restriction by the government?  Because you could just as easily say \\"your speech is not legally restricted when the only consequence is a lost job\\" to say it's fine to ban certain political beliefs from being expressed by any government employee.

So he dropped women, instead trying to win men in 2024 and he won.Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats do so badly among men that the fact that we dont do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant. And thats more or less where it lies.The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to mens has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism. **Republicans cant win women; when they win, they win without them, by winning with men.**https://srpubliclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/JillLepore.pdfThe issue is that there still exists plenty of men who believe women should remain under coverture law.

MAGA isnt going to vote for Musk candidates if he continues to insult them and go against their beliefs, regardless of how much money he throws at something.

While on that roof he had people pointing him out and law enforcement was trying to figure out how to get him down. There's no way USSS was unaware of a man on a roof with a rifle pointed in their direction (Trump was between the USSS sniper and the \\"assassin\\"). There's no way they would have ever let such an obvious gunman get off multiple shots before killing him. Based on the videos and images I've seen, Trump's ear injury likely came from a USSS's holster hitting his ear when they all hit the ground. The second one was full blown bullshit. An alleged assassin shows up at his club when he's not scheduled to be there but he makes a surprise visit and then the alleged assassin is caught because the barrel of his rifle was sticking out of a bush? 2 problem there. First, you'd have to be the dumbest person in the country to try to assassinate someone but you accidentally put the barrel of your rifle outside of your hiding spot (fun fact, the gun shoots just fine with the barrel inside the bush). Second, go outside and take a quick scan around the area. What are the chances you notice a rifle barrel in the bushes of your neighbor about 50 yards down the road? Yeah there's pretty much no chance you're noticing a rifle barrel sticking out of one of probably hundreds of bushes in the area.

TLDR; PR was the last place in American territory to replace its government utility with a private one, and they only did so after the PR government completely and utterly and systemically failed over the course of thirty years.

There's no law against contracting with actual Nazis, but there's a law against contracting with people who *express support* for boycotting Israel?  That seems pretty blatantly targeted at opponents of Israel.  Whether it's constitutional or a violation of relights or not, it's still a legal restriction on criticism of Israel specifically that does not apply to any other political movement.Besides this isn't even touching on efforts to redefine anti-semitism to include virtually any criticism of Israel or radical Zionism, which definitely has problematic free speech implications.\\nyou are entitled to criticize Israel to your heart's content, but if you do so in conjunction with the BDS movement you might not get a government contract to which you were never entitled.  Your rights aren't being infringed.It also means that if you already have a contract with the government, your political speech is being restricted by the government.

So for the next four years at least, Americans will have to rely on local and state efforts like this to deal with the pollution from fossil fuels thats causing climate change.New York has fired a shot that will be heard round the world: the companies most responsible for the climate crisis will be held accountable, State Senator Liz Krueger said in a statement after Hochul signed the Climate Change Superfund Act into law.Kruegers office expects the law to generate $75 billion over the next 25 years. But in the immediate future, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) will first have to propose guidelines for how the fund works. That includes rules for who has to pay into the fund, how the state collects the money, and what kinds of infrastructure projects the fund will support. The law will apply to fossil fuel companies historically responsible for more than 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. And at least 35 percent of the benefits of the fund are supposed to reach disadvantaged communities.The plan is loosely modeled after state and federal laws that have been in place for decades to hold companies responsible for toxic waste sites they leave behind. But instead of directing funds to cleaning up hazardous substances at old industrial sites, New Yorks new law would fund resiliency projects such as upgrading storm water drainage systems.New York taxpayers were 100 percent on the financial hook for climate costs. Now Big Oil will pay for much of the damages that they helped cause, New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) Executive Director Blair Horner said in a press release. ...New Yorks latest answer to the environmental deregulation looming on the horizon is just one part of a larger trend that marked the first Trump presidency, and is poised to be part of the second. Earlier this year, Vermont passed its own Climate Superfund law. Similar legislation has also been introduced in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and in Congress, according to the nonprofit Food &amp; Water Watch.It will be interesting to see if states in the upcoming administration will truly have more leeway to determining their courses of action, or whether this freedom will only be in name only.","title":"How New York state is defying Donald Trumps plans to roll back climate action"},{"text":"It's transactional, not a pivot.?","title":"Trump ally Laura Loomer on Musk: Nobody wants to cross this guy"},{"text":"The solar eclipse with my momWent to a board game convention (I normally go every year but this was my second year back after pandemic lockdowns and such so still very exciting) Went to my first speed puzzling competitionSaw Wicked part 1 in theatresGot really back into reading again after barely reading the last 5 years or so (I used to read all the time so this makes me really happy)","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 31, 2024"},{"text":"I wish he'd just lost the election and then had an aneurysm live on TV while ranting about it","title":"US Attorney for DC resigns as crime hits 50-year low ahead of Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"There was no obstacles between Donald and the shooter.

Even then, I was shocked by the number of homeless encampments that were set up under freeway overpasses and people sleeping in bus shelters, and in parks. This isn't some new phenomenon. It's been years in the making. California has a huge Homeless industrial Complex. The state has spent literal billions on homelessness without much of anything to show for it because of the many people and organizations who have been on the take, selling an illusion of actually doing something, for decades. But if you start to question the results or strategy, you are immediately labeled heartless. Things have undoubtedly gotten worse there in recent years, but it's not because of Trump. Legalizing the possession and usage of drugs and the effects of inflation in 2021 and onward, on top of the already existing issues of limited housing / high prices, and having open borders and being non-compliant on the enforcement of immigration laws has thrown gas on the fire in California. But Gavin shows no sign of letting up on any of the policies that have led them to this point. He'll just keep throwing more money down the rat hole in order to reward his campaign contributors who depend on government handouts to survive. All of this has been well documented by numerous news organizations, even liberal sources like the LA Times.

Ive heard that back in the 90s when all the big pharmaceutical companies and tech companies like Microsoft had their tax incentives, things were overall better for the island.  Obviously tax incentives are fairly controversial but Ive heard from many locals that they were employed by these companies for $20 an hour (min wage has been pretty bad in PR) and life was pretty good.  Ive always wondered why our grocery stores in PR have such poor produce, fruit, and seafood considering we must have amazing growing seasons and an ocean surrounding us.  There is no question the salads at restaurants are really bad and our best produce unfortunately is shipped in through  Costco and Walmart (excluding local tropical fruits of course, those are great).  Same with dairy and meat; it seems most of the cows here are basically starving.  None of the grocery stores Ive been to have fresh seafood counters which I greatly miss compared the grocery stores stateside.  It seems like a huge opportunity for fisherman who only really sell their catch down by the local beaches.  Anyways, I was told that when many of the farmers were employed by the big pharma and tech companies, it was very hard for them to go back to farming and fishing and many simply moved off the island.  Again I dont know if this is totally true but its a story Ive heard a few times now from locals Ive become friends with.  If any part of this story is true, I could see the power grids being much stronger and up to date with these bigger companies being on the island.  Ive driven by massive solar fields built by Microsoft on the east side of the island that sit unused and rotting away.  Those def didnt exist in the 90s but they look pretty new and could be a massive asset is they were restored.  As the population of the island continues to grow older and the younger Puerto Ricans move off the island, I think the prospects of reliable power probably dwindles with each passing year.  The population of the island keeps lowering which probably doesnt incentivize reinvestment in general.

Many are but many arent. Nevertheless both accept that by combining their voting power they get better results. Trump in the past has taken stances or said things that should bother both of these people. Nevertheless they vote practically because Trump is still better for them than Democrats winning.The Democratic coalition is more driven by morals, purity tests harder, and is ultimately more individualistic.It wasnt that long ago you had Democratic policymakers from Southern states who were pro-life. You had oddballs on guns, deregulation, abortion, etc.Now it is essentially unthinkable for a high profile Democrat to hold most of these positions. Maybe there is a bit of flexibility on guns?

I know it's easy media clicks and it lets them avoid real issues, but there had to be more to it.And I believe there is, and we're missing it.I was talking to a friend yesterday, and they were beside themselves over how it is that so many blue-collar workers went to the GOP. He just couldn't process how this happened. I told him this is what you get for the Dem party becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of corporate America, and with the recent interview of some national union leader on Joe Rogan talking about how Kamala so rudely cut off their interview, and then, while wagging her finger in his face said [paraphrasing?], \\"You'd better get on board, because I'm winning with or without you.\\"So, the Dems aren't even going to pretend they support labor, and now they're freaking out that they lost labor.So, now what? They can't start making [real] overtures to labor, so they have to find a way to make the GOP toxic to labor.Enter Musk (and Vivik) giving them exactly what they need, an excuse to ramp the propaganda machine to 11 in a full court press to fuel a civil war on the Right over labor issues in an effort to stop hemorrhaging labor to the Right, and maybe win some of them back, without having to offer up a dammed thing, and without leaving their fingerprints on this.So, expect our media hordes and social media minders to keep pressing Musk as the face of the Devil as a means of driving that wedge and keeping attention away from the fact that they're one big corporate sponsored party that would rather labor not exert any collective influence over getting any kind of concessions from an opportunistic GOP filling the vacuum.Edit: I made this reply [its own post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/1hqiixk/why_all_the_musk_hate_pt_2_the_follow_up/?)","title":"Xpost: Elon Musk is unintentionally awakening class consciousness on the right."},{"text":"Thanks I think this is helped me change my view","title":"CMV: People who died from or attempted suicide are people who were failed by the people around them"},{"text":"They probably kept him on life support just long enough to hit that time frame..  squeezing that last drop of use outta him sounds petty af but considering who they are, it's plausible.","title":"Libs giddy over US flags at half-staff to mark Jimmy Carters death even during Trump inauguration"},{"text":"Trump's presidency has already gone through its entire life cycle before he was even inaugurated.

My response to this is that the Republican Party is still a coalition of different interests and is not a complete MAGA monolith. Sure, you have to be very much on board with Trump to be in any standing with the party nowadays. However, those who are in Trump's coalition include the likes of foreign policy hawks like Marco Rubio and Lindsay Graham and isolationists such as Tulsi Gabbard and Tucker Carlson. It includes economic libertarians like most of the House Freedom Caucus to economic-populist communitarians like VP-elect Vance.The recent infighting over skilled immigration between the Tech Right types, like Elon and Vivek, and the hardcore nativists is also a key example of how MAGA is a coalition, not a monolith.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"Trump isn't gonna do shit, Elon is the president, Trump ran for president again to stay out of jail, he'll sign whatever this guy says as long as his money is coming in.

Yet when the Chinese government is subsidizing the cost of doing business with the aim of driving the competition out of business you either balance it out or let the other companies fail on an unequal playing field.

Someone who was slandered can go to court saying \\"Here is this false thing that was said about me, here is proof that it was false, here are the damages I incurred as a result, make me whole.\\" Someone who was defrauded can say \\"Here is the false thing that was said to me, I relied on it and this harm was done, make me whole.\\" Or in the case of incitement to violence, the government can say \\"He advocated for these specific acts, this other person took this specific act, harm was done, we're holding him responsible for incitement to violence.\\" In these cases people can go to court, openly discuss the truthfulness of statements and the harm that resulted.

Then in a couple months Republicans will realize he isn't actually any better than Johnson was, because their demands are impossible to meet.The Republican House right now is full of enough people who care more about performing for social media than governing. It's been true more or less since Paul Ryan in 2015.

That power gets abused continuously to get the rich richer and to further push the world into a late stage capitalism that they have achieved inside the dog shit country that's the US. When a country uses its power to manipulate the world so that they can get richer, it's pretty valid criticism that the riches are not even close to being used by the actual Americans, and the money keeps piling up in the rich person's pockets.

What precisely is the difference between \\"absolute freedom of speech\\" and freedom of speech?  The only conceivable and honest answer must be that freedom of speech is like absolute freedom of speech, but with various restrictions that make it not exactly free.I can *say* I'm in favor of freedom of speech, but if I start making exceptions I'm not actually for that.  I'm for permissive controlled speech.However, I personally believe that one's freedom ends where it encroaches on the freedoms of others.This doesn't mean anything.  Two people can claim to agree with it in principle while disagreeing on virtually every practical point based on disparate understandings of legitimate freedom.  For example: you obviously don't regard freedom of expression as fundamental and inherent, but rather contingent.  So you're willing to ban certain speech to protect the freedom to not be exposed to misinformation - I think that's absurd, but we can still both credibly say we believe your initial claim.Absolute free speech is paradoxical issue because it would allow speech that advocates for the suppression of speech itself, such as calls for censorship or authoritarian rule.That isn't really a paradox.  If someone appeals to their right to freedom of speech while calling for suppression of speech, it would be hypocritical.  But there is nothing contradictory, paradoxical or hypocritical about someone advocating for freedom of speech saying \\"yes, that too.\\"  You're misapplying the paradox of tolerance.that doesn't mean far-right parties or remnants of old regimes should have the right to participate in it.I mean...they will whether you want it or not.  They'll do it under other guises or in extra-political ways; de-Baathification in Iraq proved that when former Baathists caused a bit of a ruckus after being kicked out of Iraq's government and military.One of the most important benefits of free speech is *clear sight.*  People are allowed to say what they think, and you in turn know what they think and so know what your real political situation actually is.  Without that, you're simply betting that, just because you've excluded them from your field of view, the ideologies you want to ban won't one day grow strong enough that your ban just doesn't work.Germany has extremely stringent speech laws that were aimed at preventing the existence of a politically ascendant far right.  The AfD nevertheless exists and ascends.  Did the laws work?Historically, unrestricted hate speech has contributed to atrocities. During the early years of post-2003 Iraq, the US under Bremer and later through Al Maliki let sectarian TV channels and media outlets to be completely free. Which fueled tensions between Sunni and Shia communities, contributing to the violence that accrued.Yes, if only there had been more suppression of sectarian media, the conflict between Sunni and Shia in post-Saddam Iraq wouldn't have blown up.Come on dude.  That's wishful thinking at best.Even in societies like the United States, where free speech is a fundamental right, certain speech, especially in politically sensitive contexts (such as criticism of foreign governments like Israel or criticism of a formerly oppressed group), can face legal restrictions.....what are you talking about?

The democrats dont care about liberation of people, they care about using you to perpetuate their neoliberal capitalist ideals. They have literally supported a genocide, so no they dont care. The same is true of the republicans, except they are more outright fascist. We are seeing the same thing there with the MAGA crowd being ripped about by the fact that their billionaire supporters dont actually care about their views and just want exploitative labour in the form of h1b visas. And no Im not an advocate for a totalitarian dictatorship of the proletariat, we see the same problems in state socialist societies - Stalin, Mao, pot etc. Once the workers are elected into power, they are no longer the working class and are part of the ruling class. To quote anarchist philosopher Mikhail Bakunin - when the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called the peoples sticks.

The left, just like the right, is a spectrum.

Republicans know this and are utilizing this knowledge to grab up all the independents. Hell, they even got the young vote for the first time in generations. Trump's first term was the beginning of the reversal of any progressive action taken in the past century (taking the Supreme Court). This next round will be the final nail in the coffin.

Nigeria is a country I'm very concerned about because the current state of affairs of a isolationist america and the cold war between France and Russia in Africa could mean a Boko Haram resurgence in an ethnically very complex nation with a lot of tensions and 200 million people.There's the Central Asia question that ties in with the Caucasus and the increased tensions over gas rights, water rights, the enclaves an exclaves and ethnic minorities being persecuted like the Tajiks in Afghanistan and the Hazaras.

YIMBYs are just objectively right, the statistical case in their favor is incontrovertible. But in cities across the country, you cant build a duplex on a parking lot, without progressive orgs descending from the rafters to sue to stop it. And progressive politicians are broadly against reform. They cite the typical left-NIMBY arguments, complaining about imaginary empty houses, and proposing a rotating array of convoluted ownership restrictions, that would accomplish nothing even if they got passed.That ties into degrowth and decels. But thats a separate rant. The second is the habit of throwing money at problems, and aversion to reform of those systems. The most prominent example is California high speed rail, but you can find similar instances with the post-pandemic stimulus. Huge amounts of money get allocated to the problem, but NEPA lawsuits and the like means that the projects get massively delayed, and money gets wasted. Progressives have been strongly against gutting NEPA, and instead have been throwing money at these stalled out projects for over a decade in some instances, with no intention of fixing the issue thats stalled them.Third there is Lisa Khan. Shes lost basically every case shes filled, because rather than actually enforce the law, shes waging an anti-business harassment campaign.Fourth, Biden has been way too friendly to unions. From the port union, that is directly hurtling American consumers across the country, to the various unions he funneled money towards, that ended up voting for Trump anyway. Unions arent automatically our friends, they can be anti-consumer, like the port one, and should be broken up, or just republicans.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"Mission accomplished, solved in one day.","title":"Russia rejects Trumps Ukraine peace proposals"},{"text":"There is no chance they would be pissed at him being caught banging some 16-17 year old Russian prosty.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSfF60-2S4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSfF60-2S4)And yeah... it isn't all roses and rainbows, the video ends slightly less optimistic than the last one in 2014. But honestly with the number of people who get sucked into and get \\"facts\\" from tiktok.. Even though they can be very easily influenced. It is a valid question. Tiktok is prime for being able to spread conspiracy theory, fake news, deepfakes, etc and has already been used to do so.   \\n  \\nExample: [https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/06/facebook-posts/no-president-elect-trump-didnt-pledge-to-help-paki/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/06/facebook-posts/no-president-elect-trump-didnt-pledge-to-help-paki/) TL;DR a deepfake was created with Trump promising to get ousted Pakistani Prime Minister out of jail/exile. It was posted on tiktok-reels and spread from there. Arab American's were a driving demographic in Trump's win. While not 100% tied to this deepfake it certainly didn't help. Even a coworker of mine in Germany from Pakistan mentioned he was happy about trump winning because he would help this prime minister come in and end the corruption in Pakistan.   \\n  \\nSo yes while, ideally we wouldn't give a shit about tiktok it is the next big thing in election meddling, either by local actors, but also foreign states. We will start to see it more and more in the next 10 years. While Twitter helped to organize and win the 2008 election for Obama. The next election (if we have one) will be heavily influenced by tiktok.","title":"Whats the effect of Trump on TikTok ?"},{"text":"You mean a narrow issue like a highly publicized genocide that Biden was cheerleading?","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"The rich want you to believe the gender toilets are the isssue, not the wealth inequality, low wages, and health-care insurance scams","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"your phone, trumps phone, and everybody elses that still falls for the dumbass chinese spy app shit. every piece of technology you use is used to spy on you. heres a crazy idea what if yall just went totally off the grid forever? lol","title":"Whats the effect of Trump on TikTok ?"},{"text":"No need to fear if you more not illegal.

H1Bs sponsorships have even declined in 2024 because of this.This issue is far more nuanced than a political campaign strategy centered on immigration reform and border walls - designed to attract votes.Education reform will not work: The comparatively lower cost of higher education in India allows them to flood / saturate the global job market, Decades of outsourcing and offshoring have destroyed the domestic demand for skilled US workers. There's no incentives for Americans to attend college to pursue these careers any longer.We don't stand a chance until enough of us  clearly understand the gravity of the situation. Unfortunately this only happens when it's too late.Poverty has driven these Indians (and other foreigners) to be very determined, driven and desperate. They've found multiple ways to displace you. And, good luck competing against 90 hour work weeks for lower salaries.Indians are not to blame and the left will attempt to divide us over racism. Nothing short of an insurrection targeting these corporate crooks fixes this. Fanboying billionaires and corporate overlords isn't helping matters. These billionaire appointments should be a very strong and clear signal of what's to come. The only thing that matters to these greedy billionaires / centibillionaires is jockeying for position on the Forbes' 100.They will not sympathize with you.

This data will be leveraged to justify investment in intelligent, self-driving vehicles that will displace you (\\"DISRUPTIVE\\") workers.Uber, Door Dash, mail delivery, all transportation jobs - all gone!

In any two party system, any major party will be a coalition of different groups of people with different ideological groups. With the leadership of the party looking to meet them in the middle. Progressives are only around 6% of the American electorate, it would be unrealistic for progressives to expect the remainder of the Democratic Party to unilaterally bend the knee to them and give up their own interests in the broad Democratic coalition. Elections are also won at the margin, and you're competing for the votes for people who may otherwise vote Republican in close elections, suffice it to say those people are not dyed in the wool left-wingers looking for strongly left-wing change.I also want to add that progressive policies are facing many headwinds right now. We recently had a surge in left-wing values and beliefs playing a much larger role in our culture, and there was a backlash accordingly. People did not want to see their police departments defunded and property crime and public disorder tolerated, as many progressives wanted. For example, in San Francisco - one of the most left-wing places in America -  voters recalled their left-wing DA and left-wing school board members largely because the voters viewed their policies as extreme and destructive.Progressive economic policy as well is also facing numerous headwinds. Most progressive economic policies are effectively calls for the massive new government spending programs, be it Medicare for All, tuition-free public college, etc. However, never articulated a way of paying for this without drastically increasing deficits and the national debt. For example, a lot of progressives point to the Nordic model as an example to follow but never talk about how the average person paying an effective tax rate of nearly 50% of their income makes their expansive government possible, and how taxes there largely impact the middle class - notably a Value-Added Tax (VAT) on all goods sold. American progressives, on the other hand, mostly seem to believe that we can build an expansive welfare state without these broad based taxes and seem to think that we can do so by deficits and only heavily taxing the wealthy. \\nEffectively, progressive economic policies like this would be something that would in aggregate balloon deficits, increase aggregate demand, and hence extremely accelerate inflation if implemented. We already experienced massive government stimulus followed by inflation in the wake of COVID, yet progressives haven't adapted their model of deficit-financed demand-driven economic policy proposals in the wake of this.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"Trump told Gaetz to withdraw.

In Russia, the statements were interpreted to mean that Trump isnt really opposed to foreign wars of conquest after all.\\nTo them, Trumps tirades revealed thatjust like Russian President Vladimir PutinTrump would be delighted to invade any country that couldnt fight back. He would expect accolades and a lavish victory parade after seizing foreign territories, just like the fallout from Russia stealing Crimea in 2014.\\nTrump infamously described the annexation of Crimea as a genius and savvy move.   Putin tried to repeat the trick and take the rest of Ukraine in three days in 2022, and the Kremlin insiders believe Trump only disapproves of the war because it turned out to be lengthy and costly.\\nRussias premier propagandists and experts already believe that Trump can be persuaded to go along with Moscows wish list if Putin gets to influence him, tte--tte personally. They are vehemently opposed to the idea of negotiating with retired Lieutenant-General Keith Kellogg, Trumps Ukraine envoy. The dream scenario that they envision would include legitimizing Russias invasion of Ukraine and recognizing Moscows territorial demands.   In the meantime, Trumps stated intentions towards Greenland, Canada, and Panama are being celebrated as implicit validation for Russias current and future land grabs. During Sundays broadcast of Vesti Nedeli (The Weekly News), host Dmitry Kiselyov devoted an entire segment to Americas planned expansion under Trump. He pointed out, Trump isnt joking. He is determined to expand American territorial possessions. Personally, I am convinced that he will succeed. Kiselyov predicted, Trump will grab strategically important parts of the world for America. It isnt funny. What is funny is to see whether anyone in the Old World will try to sanction the United States in response to its territorial expansion. This is when we will find out how principled the lovers of sanctions truly are.   He added, Think about it. If Trump gets away with all of this, inspired by his success, he might look at the rest of the globe, focus on vulnerable spots, and keep going. Where will he stop? Doesnt it mean that others can do the same?    Last Thursday, pundits on the state TV show The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov spent most of the broadcast rejoicing about the way the world will change during Trumps presidency. Host Vladimir Solovyov said, Trump politely announced that the U.S. will be expanding its borders.   State Duma member Andrey Lugovoy, notorious for his involvement in the deadly poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, noted, It feels like we spent the last four years in Bidens madhouse and now were gradually transitioning to Trumps circus. He speculated that the incoming president will resort to the madman theory as his political strategy, akin to the foreign policy of former U.S. President Richard Nixon. Lugovoy said that no one knows whether Trump is joking when he is making statements about Greenland, Panama, and Canada.\\nHost Vladimir Solovyov vehemently disagreed. He said, These are awesome statements! No, he is not joking... of course he isnt joking! Do you think Im kidding when I say that Finland, Warsaw, the Baltics, Moldova, and Tallinn should come back home? Do you think Im joking? No! They should all rejoin the Russian Empire. Followed by Alaska, by the way. Give it back.   Solovyov added, The way he is rationalizing it is tremendous. We should follow his example and quietly take everything back. Echoing the statements of Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, Putins top propagandist argued that Russia should now take more than the four Ukrainian regions it has already constitutionally decreed to be Russian.    Lugovoy stated, My friends, Trumps insane statements show that there should not be any ceasefire. Why would we need a ceasefire when were confidently moving forward?    Solovyov surmised, I believe that what Trump is doing benefits us greatly. Trump is totally destroying any illusions that anyone might have still had about the summit of democracies, about respecting opinions of NATO allies. Its like hes saying, Who are all of you? Youre all nobodies! I will talk to Putin and Xi Jinping... He is a great guy, an awesome guy!    Professor Dmitry Evstafiev said, Trump did something fantastic for Russia and for the whole world... He clearly answered a question, Leadership or hegemony? and chose hegemony. With his approach of geographical enlargement, he buried the entire collective West. There is no collective West, and it will never be united again.\\nAmerica expert Dmitry Drobnitsky emphasized, Based on the team Trump is bringing along and who he is himself, its clear that he is certainly not a builder of a new world order. He is a destroyer. He will tear down the old world order. Solovyov added, By taking Canada, Trump is basically saying, Russians, you can take the Baltics.\\nMilitary expert Mikhail Khodaryonok noted, After the statement of President-elect Donald Trump about Canada, Greenland, and Panama, in my opinion, we can now consider special military operations as the norm for resolving arguments between countries. The silence of European leaders clearly confirms this.\\nPolitical scientist Dmitry Kulikov added the era of nation-states is over and that the world will return to the era of empires. He confidently said, The new world is dawning. Solovyov agreed, This is the era of the strong.","title":"Kremlin insiders reveal how Trump is already secretly helping Putin"},{"text":"Like Trump said he loves the poorly educated","title":"It's Elon Musk over MAGA: Donald Trump makes his pick"},{"text":"OPs opinion is a sick communistic perversion of the American month/day/year system.

Only the right talks about taking away gunsThe current VP is on record stating that she is in favor of mandatory buybacks, which is mass seizure by another name. Democrats have in general supported gun control measures taken in Canada, which has gone so far as to seize privately owned firearms to send to Ukraine.
