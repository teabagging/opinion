I have always thought, and continue to think, that \\"FRAUD!\\" is the laziest post-mortem possible and it can be explained without fraud. There are a lot of people who are registered to vote but basically never do. ESPECIALLY in our modern political environment where every election is viewed as a \\"both candidates suck\\" election by a massive percentage of the public.In 2020, many states sent out absentee ballots proactively to EVERY registered voter, whether they requested one or not. This, combined with the fact that there was nothing else to do and with the fact that Covid hysteria created an environment where everyone was engaged with at least one major political issue and caused millions of people to vote who never had before and never have since.The people who normally can't be bothered to do something as quick and easy as voting skewed heavily Democrat. Or, explained less diplomatically: there's a very high correlation between being lazy and oblivious to current events and voting Democrat.","title":"Would like to have a serious discussion about the missing votes for Kamala vs Biden in 2020"},{"text":"Is trump worried Russia might abandon their support for him?","title":"Trump says Russia abandoned Assad"},{"text":"It's really not that do you remember that report that when they had the Republican convention grinder crashed in that area no it's always racism the other things come last","title":"Trumps policies should be turning off farmers C why did so many vote for him?"},{"text":"if you have a media that shows that guy...","title":"Republicans just won a permanent Senate majority"},{"text":"We need to get the right people in Trump's ear.

Prices at the stores might go up or might go down, but it seemed that they would go up and down no matter who was in office. Sometimes laws were good and sometimes bad. Sometimes we were at war and sometimes we were at peace. But it didn't seem to matter who won the election. All of these things worked out in the same way no matter what.But when I grow older, I became more aware of things. Particularly after 9/11, when in one afternoon I realized that there was a lot of talk about Iraq, but I did not remember reading anything in the newspapers about a link between the world trade center attack and the nation of Iraq. I ran some searches and couldn't find anything, and even went through my archives of saved articles. And I realized that we were being railroaded. I was not fond of any Republican president, and had some awareness that the Republicans did not have my best interest at heart, and yet I never figured that they would be actually dangerous to me. I was a child of solidly middle-class background with a college education, and was largely insulated from events. My work will always continued on without interruption. In a way, news events were a spectator sport in my own eyes .George W Bush changed all of that for me. And the rise of the Tea Party and the growing extremism and obstruction of the Republican Party became more and more directly frightening. But I had to be almost obsessive in my following the news in order to actually know that things were happening at all. My daily life was largely unchanged. I can understand why for many people the question of (yes Donald Trump / no Donald Trump) is very abstract.I am hoping that the Democrats will not take too many steps to protect America from his extreme actions. I think this country really needs to experience the kind of destruction that historically comes with having an authoritarian in charge. Hell, even a million dead from COVID has had no impact on public opinion. I fear that we truly need to see people dying in the street of avian flu, and American tanks stationed at Street corners to support secret police rounding up civilians for simply having an opinion. We may need to see blood and flames before the idea of a strong man leader can be repudiated in the minds of our citizens.","title":"Trumps policies should be turning off farmers C why did so many vote for him?"},{"text":"The good part about all these guys being old is that our moment to celebrate their passing cannot be long in coming.

My educated guess is that not as many people were able to vote via absentee ballots &amp; thus they didn't vote this time around. In my state especially (wisconsin), Zuckerberg funneled millions of $$ into specifically urban areas in order to increase turnout. In some cases, local election clerks were happy to allow outside groups to effectively run the show. Ballot boxes made their initial appearance all in major cities, and none in rural areas. Democrat strongholds enjoyed a MAJOR, and arguably illegal, advantage just based on \\"Zuckerbucks\\" pouring into select municipalities. The legality of ballot boxes (chain of custody) was not yet established &amp; democrats set them up because they could. No one told them they couldn't. Election rules were ignored or changed by our state's elections commission (unelected beaurocrats) &amp; the guidance they gave local municipalities tested the limits of what's \\"lawful\\" here. Credible reports suggest that Democrat operatives were canvassing nursing homes &amp; filling out ballots for people who weren't coherent enough to know who they were voting for. Democrats literally filled out ballots for people and thrust them into people's faces &amp; said \\"sign here\\".Add to that the fact that States were mailing out ballots to literally everyone, &amp; the fact that special exemptions were made because of COVID (allowing people to claim they're confined to their home), &amp; the disparity between 2020 &amp; 2024 becomes slightly more logical.

If there wasn't any commercial radio, only PBS stations they'd have no monetary incentive to favor one side over the other.  \\nThat's one of the many reasons capitalism and democracy don't mix.  \\nThe other even more fundamental reason is how voting power is warped within a capitalist system.  \\nRich people have the power to use their money to fund causes they like and influence voting behaviour effectively giving each rich person more than just the single vote they should have.All of this are residual problems from the Cold War.   \\nCommunism was an attractive ideology that many people could get on board with.  \\nPower to the little man, cooperation instead of competition, fairness... the reason it spread was that socialism is a really good idea.  \\nAnd the US didn't have any ideology that could compete with it. So they took capitalism, an economic model, and presented it as if it was an ideology.  \\nNow the country is stuck with it. Too many people got it in their heads that capitalism is somehow more than an economic model and that it is something great that has to be protected and has somehow to do with their freedom.   \\nWhen in actuality the opposite is the case.

The president-elect has promised to fire thousands of professionals and replace them with political loyalists, slash trillions of dollars from the federal budget, eliminate departments and relocate others away from what he derides as the deep state of intransigent bureaucrats in the capital.  He issued his most sweeping assault on the workforce at the end of his term  an executive order known as Schedule F that called for removing civil service protections from tens of thousands of professionals, allowing them to be replaced by political loyalists in a return to the system of presidential patronage appointments that disappeared with the creation of a modern civil service in the late 19th century. But his term ended before the policy could take effect, and President Joe Biden quickly revoked it.People talk about this story in terms of Trump's consolidation of power. But it's also important to note that purging experienced subject matter experts in favor of Trump meatriders bodes poorly for the effectiveness of government.One hallmark of authoritarian governments like Russia or Francoist Spain is crazy inefficiency and incompetence because smart people get thrown out of government and replaced with people whose only qualification is loyalty.We're about to learn the hard way what happens when idiots get put in charge of services we depend on.","title":"Federal employees scramble to insulate themselves from Trumps purge"},{"text":"Like the regime itself in the end.?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 8, 2024"},{"text":"I've met Cubans that are whiter than me - and I'm a ghost white European.

For instance, an exhaustive investigation by the Associated Press found fewer than 475 confirmed cases of voter fraud across six battleground states, which is insufficient to change the election's outcome. Moreover, Trump's own administration, including then-Attorney General William Barr, indicated that there was no evidence of widespread fraud that could have affected the election results. In states like Georgia and Arizona, recounts and reviews confirmed Biden's victory, often with even larger margins than initially reported. This persistent disinformation continues to undermine public confidence in the electoral process, with significant numbers of Republicans supporting Trump's claims despite their lack of factual basis.* [AP News: Trumps 2020 election lies debunked](https://apnews.com/article/trump-2020-election-lies-debunked-4fc26546b07962fdbf9d66e739fbb50d)\\n* [PBS News: Fact-checking Trump's false claims about voter fraud and rigged elections](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-false-claims-about-voter-fraud-and-rigged-elections)\\n* [Reuters: Trumps false claims debunked regarding 2020 election](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-false-claims-debunked-2020-election-jan-6-riot-2022-01-06/)^(Hey there, I'm not a human \\\\(sometimes I am :\\\\) \\\\).

Regardless of the last time they voted, regardless if they moved somewhere else, regardless if they have dementia and are confined to a nursing home and couldn't name a single candidate on the ballot.  Voter turnout here is usually around 66% participation.  In 2020 it was 74%.  We mailed these, or placed them into ballot drop boxes in our town.  There was no \\"chain of custody\\" or id verification to figure out who filled out the ballot.  So that's where ballot harvesting came in: a friendly volunteer working to \\"Get Out The Vote,\\" would show up to that nursing home to collect everyone's ballot and drop them off.  Maybe they would convince people to fill it out for Biden.  Maybe they would simply concentrate on heavily Dem areas.  There's various levels of legally but sketchy, and fraud.  Also, Republicans in states with choice didn't trust the mail in process.  In many states, there's no way to track your vote to see if it was counted.  There were actual news stories in my state of mail carriers throwing out ballots from heavily Republican areas.  It was a small time, isolated incident, something like a few dozen ballots.  But it stoked fear.  A lot of these procedures were thrown together last minute due to Covid, so people were skeptical.

For the record: Now Im for trump but I used to be more center/center left on certain things. Mainly I was against trump because I thought he represented something very ugly about us (I no longer think that). Heres how I see this situation and the 4 million delta you mention. I think for Biden, the left was so shocked by 2016 that the thought never again and came out hard in 2020. That is people who care politically but normally think voting doesnt matter much - those people, including myself, came out.Fast forward to 2024 and they no longer felt the same. Why? Three reasons:\\n(1) the left has spent 4 years focusing, from a discourse standpoint, on non-issues (irresolvable) or crazy issues (identity politics)\\n(2) the candidate did not feel like a continuation of good statesmanship Obama/early Biden and was crammed down throats of dems without vetting. She was not particularly competent but more than that she was not very likable. Joe Biden at the time of his electoral victory represented a steady hand and was both likable and compelling in statesman sense *at that time*. Kamala never had that and her messaging was watered down and confusing.\\n(3) but ok Oeuffy does #2 matter if there are never again dems? Yes! Because trump has had 4 more years to normalize his behavior (both in adjusting our expectations and softening his rhetoric) and shift political discourse. He has become much much more palatable. Which means the never againers are chill and de-activated from both ends: they dont find him unpalatable enough to come out, and they didnt find Kamala palatable enough to come out.

My nitpick is that we're also required to *disobey* unlawful orders, but the difference isn't important unless you're actually in the military and having to figure out if said order is lawful.However, the President is the Commander in Chief of the US Military. The President is the only person with the final say on what actions the military will or won't take. Congress can say if an action was good/bad/allowed/overstepping or what have you, but they can't give orders to the US military. The checks and balance part is that Congress has sole control of how much money the Military gets.All of which brings us to the asked question. People aren't concerned because the US government will not be conducting military operations against allied nations. To start with, that would be political suicide, to the point that I'm not sure the US as a nation would survive that type of betrayal. Literally every single nation in the world would cut ties with the US, politically, economically, militarily, everything. Next, there's no benefit, to pretty much anyone. People talk about how war makes money, but that's only true if there isn't total world economic collapse. And again, why would the US attempt such a thing? There's not enough personnel or hardware anywhere we maintain overseas presence that could topple the government of said location. Germany is a good example. You think we can take over *all* of Germany with 35k military personnel? Germany has a standing military of about 180k, and that's assuming that France (270k), the UK (186k), Poland (290k), and the rest of the EU doesn't get involved. And even if we could, why would we? Even if we're successful, all we'd gain is an angry population we'd have to police, more land we'd have to defend, and we'd get nothing of actual benefit out of it.","title":"Why Aren't People Concerned about the Hundreds of Thousands of US Troops Stationed Abroad Who Will Pledge Their Loyalty to Trump Next Month and Could Potentially Follow Orders to Turn on the Countries in Which They are Stationed?"},{"text":"1.

Due to the large push for mail in ballots and people being generally wary of going to stand in line due to Covid, more people were able to vote than usual. It is way easier for people to put a ballot in their mailbox then go stand in line to vote. Due to Covid, mail in ballots were sent to people that normally wouldnt go out of their way to vote, thus vastly increasing turnout.The reason turnout was down this year is due simply to the lack of Covid and the extreme measures taken during that unusual election year.I very highly doubt there was some kind of mass conspiracy that somehow fabricated millions of votes and there is somehow no evidence of that happening.

Even if you dont actively dislike those people or are actively advocating the abolishment of abortion, you're taking an action that directly puts both of those things in jeopardy.  \\nAs far as harassment goes, thats just a matter of opinion on what even qualifies as harassment. If just not being kind to you and actively calling you out on the person you publicly support, thats not harassment. Harassment is usually some kind of behavior that is publicly disruptive or repeated attempts at seeking you out to do something negative.Really, what it seems liek you're saying is \\"I shouldnt be criticized for my opinions because I dont think they're that bad\\".

That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more, by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on legal hiring, by baring healthcare benefits to illegal aliens.  In the budget I will present to you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordon.

A destabilized America is just as likely to lean into an different extremist solution that ends very badly.2. A destabilized America with a wrecked economy will likely cause a global depression, with widespread losses and even death. All that to beat a guy who cant run again. Last time that happened and we got a super socially focused president it still wasnt enough to escape the depression, it took world war 2 to do that. That doesnt seem remotely worth it.3. If all of Trumps plans go his way, then government will be a in a far far worse position to enact whatever positive change you want it to, if it even allows for elections again.?4. People are very reactionary, so, sure, if things feel bad for them under Trump theyll swing the other way, but thats not going to be from some newfound belief in the superiority of leftist ideology; hence it probably wont be a permanent or even 10 year long swing.?5.
