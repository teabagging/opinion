To your first point yes many of us are largely given initial beliefs from our parents. For example because my Mom was more vocal about being a Republican, whereas my Dad wasn't about being Democrat, I had a preference for republicans as a young kid. I remember thinking that the world would end if Obama became president. But as I grew up, became more educated, and started to learn the difference. I realized that the liberal beliefs aligned more with what I thought was good for the world. It started with learning about John Locke's philosophy, and learning more and more about our own history.Basically if you lived in somewhere that education is well funded, and pay attention to facts, even your inherent bias can be overturned because what Republicans say largely disagrees with reality, and with Trump this is more obvious than it has ever been. So the conclusion I've come to is, people who voted Trump or were undecided are most likely lacking so much fundamental information, about how the world and government works, that they cannot see the ways which he is obviously a horrible candidate. It is objectively true that he incited and insurrection and invited Russian influence into our elections and policy, and that alone should've barred him from even running. The only way you can be in disagreement with that is if you reject what is verifiably true. So when people are curt with you saying things like \\"educate yourself\\" it's likely due to the fact that they feel your understanding of reality is so warped they cannot hope to reach you. Essentially if you're not willing to learn, no one can teach you. And it's not that you need to wake up everyday and find the morally correct stance, the correct stance is often obvious, however when complicated issues arise we would live in and infinitely better world if people would take a step out of their own lives to ascertain what's true before coming to conclusions.On the topic of empathy. I saw something recently that explained it very well, and I'll do my best to paraphrase. When one ideology breaks the social contract of tolerance, for example amplifying hatred or harm towards others, then there is no longer a moral obligation to be tolerant towards that ideology. Basically, it's ok to punch Nazis. And even if you're not a Nazi yourself, you're aligning yourself with a political group that is following the same path. People are so frustrated right now because you've had nearly a decade to realize who Trump really is. And the only way you don't by now is because you haven't honestly taken the time to evaluate information about him. Trumps policies are said to cause massive economic disruptions and people are already preparing for it. And you basically just voted to have millions of your neighbors rounded up and deported, as well as potentially endangering the lives of all the women in your life. So I don't think you deserve tolerance if you stand behind these things. Imagine if people had done more to stand up to and oppose Hitler and Nazis in their rise to power, because that really could be what's at stake here, and why would you even play around with that possibility without finding out all the facts? You can't stand behind the marginalization of other human beings and ask for politeness and tolerance. So ask yourself, is that what you stand for? Because if not you may want to find out you really voted for, sooner or later you won't be able to ignore it.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Left leaning myself, lol.

Poor individuals may not have the means to be geographically mobile \\n3) this would likely create the opportunity for wealthier individuals to look for tax avoidance strategies. Suppose you have a high net worth retiree that decides to move to a state where capital gains are not taxed. Likewise white collar workers who work from home may be incentivized to move to a state that lowers their individual tax burden\\n4) this could indirectly impact inflation if individuals keep a higher proportion of income, then demand for goods goes up which drives prices higher.

Harris supports PLA's and the Biden-Harris administration has mandated them on most federal funded projects, Trump banned PLAs on federal projects. Harris is against right-to-work laws, Trump supports a national right-to-work law. The Butch-Lewis Act saved the pensions of over a million union workers, Trump was against the Butch-Lewis Act all 3 times the law was presented to him, the Biden-Harris administration told congress they would not sign the American Rescue Plan unless the Butch-Lewis Act was part of it.Do you really want to keep pretending that Trump is somehow pro-worker?Increase on tariffs is nothing new and is something that was due to take place anyway under the democrats and biden, note the bit on EVs going from 25% to 100% at the link below.

The constitution originally said any federal \\"direct\\" tax on a citizen had to be apportioned among the states, but what you are describing is a direct tax on each state that is then (indirectly) passed on to each person as the state sees fit.  And I don't know of any rules or constitutional power to set a direct tax on a state.But if that was allowed, The states with the highest number of representatives would also have the highest tax bill, and since it's based on population, the \\"average per person\\" would also be very close, otherwise it was not apportioned correctly. So, the only reason this would make the large changes you list is because the distribution of wealthy people is not even across the states. NY currently pays 100bn more than its raw population would require because it has more wealthy people than other states.So, the net effect is to protect wealthy people from being taxed if they conglomerate in a few states, if they move to smaller states (as they would) the protection would be even greater. Also, could states tax people who work in their state but do not live in their states as an official residence? They currently do (which seems to me to be taxation without representation), but this seems even more problematic if the state is taxing people who do not count towards their population to meet their tax burden which is solely based on their population. It's the old Monty Phyton joke about \\"taxing all foreigners living abroad\\".For this to work with the original constitution, the feds would have to make the assignment of individual taxes base on which state a person \\"officially\\" lived in by census definition. So, the feds would set a total tax amount for a budget year, divide it among the states propositionally to their population in the last census, then give a tax bill to each person for an equal share of their state's tax bill.  If a state had twice the population, that state would owe twice the tax of a smaller state, but since it has exactly twice as many people, the tax per person would be roughly equal with any difference being rounding errors only. So, the net result if a FLAT TAX by dollar amount.  So yes, most conservatives would support this with the understanding that this would be an enormous tax increase on the lower and middle and even upper middle class which would result in enormous pressure to drastically cut federal spending, which is what most conservatives really want. The federal cuts would be mostly matched by state tax increases, which would shift the power to the states, which is again a conservative goal that was messed up by the Income tax, because power always follows the money.","title":"CMV: The United States should abolish the income tax."},{"text":"That's because the idiots in the district think she won Superbowl 50 with the Broncos","title":"In Dearborn, Rashida Tlaib Did Nearly Twice as Well as Kamala Harris"},{"text":"This is why I left the US.

With the passage of the 16th Amendment, the proportionality of responsibility to influence was no longer maintained.You've got some important details wrong here.First, the Constitution splits taxes up into two categories: direct and indirect. The Constitution makes it clear that direct taxes include capitations (a flat tax on every person just for existing), but otherwise doesn't specify what falls under direct taxes. It's generally agreed that taxes on real property would also be direct taxes. Everything that isn't a direct tax is an indirect tax. The Constitution only requires direct taxes to be apportioned among states by population. Indirect taxes were never required to be apportioned.With that in mind, in 1894, the US passed an income tax into law. In response, there was a lawsuit arguing that income tax was a direct tax and was therefore required to be apportioned among the states by population, making this new income tax unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ended up ruling 5-4 that taxation of some types of income was a direct tax and had to be apportioned, while other types of income could be taxed without apportionment. Specifically, taxation of income derived from real property and income from assets like stocks and bonds would be direct taxes, while taxation of normal wage income was an indirect tax and didn't require apportionment. Given that the income tax was originally created to put more of the tax burden on the rich, this was highly unpopular, not to mention a lot of people thought the court's legal reasoning was flat out wrong. Regardless, the court had spoken, so the 16th Amendment was passed to clarify that regardless of where income came from, it could be taxed without the apportionment requirement. This made it so all income taxes would work the same way.The 16th Amendment made that Supreme Court ruling moot, so there's never been any need to try to overturn it, but modern legal experts are largely in agreement that it was wrongly decided and all income taxes are actually indirect taxes that don't need to be apportioned. It's likely that the 16th Amendment is completely unnecessary today.","title":"CMV: The United States should abolish the income tax."},{"text":"Exactly my thoughts too.

I didn't want to have lived my entire life and look back and realize that I wished I had made different choices. I saw people struggling and suffering all around me and I simply sat and thought about why it was happening. I didn't go to college until I was 27 years old, so it wasn't access to 'Liberal' ideas in college because my world view was already very well formed by then. I had already written hundreds of songs that are quite specific about what I thought the problem was.none of my friends were anywhere near as political as I was and would often dismiss points that I made mostly out of apathetic indifference. I did have one friend who I had many long conversations with that despite his being confused on about a lot of things really helped me clarify and organize my beliefs.my parents were huge influences on my thinking, and maybe their focus on morality, critical thinking, and anti-racism created the foundation upon which my world view was built. but my politics are quite different from both my parents. my father voted for Trump in 2016 and my mother is a registered independent who thinks that both parties are the same.and maybe having a slightly higher IQ than average played a role.but I worked very hard to come to the understandings that I did. I spent a lot of hours contemplating the way Society worked and everyone's role in it. I saw the ugly parts of my own humanity and imagined what effects that might have on others if I was in positions of of power. and as I figured things out I wrote songs about it so that I would never forget. and anytime I was confronted with information that conflicted with what I already understood and believed, I adjusted my beliefs to better match reality.after looking at the amount of suffering created versus the amount of capital created, and who that Capital typically went to and in what proportions -- I came to the conclusion that the only truly honorable job where you weren't going to be part of the problem was fireman. Then a few years later I found out that if there are two fires at the same time the fire department has to go to the place that's more valuable.and so I have lived a life of poverty out of protest because I refuse to be part of the problem. I think the shareholder system is the best way to spread around the blame so that it's so thin on any one individual that no one can be held accountable, and there is an additive effect where you take in combination the small amount of greed that exists in each investor, which is why so many corporations are doing truly awful things and everyone seems to be okay with it except the people that are directly affected.in my opinion you couldn't have a more perfect system for harnessing Collective greed and dissipating individual accountability. if there is an actual devil, it is his greatest Triumph aside from 'convincing the world he doesn't exist'.I have worked very hard and suffered a great deal not only to come to the conclusions I have but living by them.if this shit was handed to me I would have dropped it like a hot rock a long time ago.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"That might be ban worthy saying that on this platform lol","title":"The Democrats Need an Honest Conversation on Gender Identity"},{"text":"Did you see what she paid celebrities?!?!I did, and it's a pathetic reflection of the \\"values\\" the Circle D Corporation's brain trust wants us to believe are ours.The good news, is that Taylor's gonna make millions more from the [experience...](https://i0.wp.com/www.barnhardtmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_9255-1.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1)","title":"Hilarity of the Leftist Speedwobbles"},{"text":"educating yourself is possible and very easy!

Say someone and I are arguing over why the Earth has seasons. We can simply google it, or go to a library, or look through an encyclopedia or something very quickly, and we both end up knowing more and not needing to argue more. Then lets look at pull yourself up by the bootstraps. This implies that hard work will get you anywhere without the need of other people. Say the scenario is someone is having major financial issues, through maybe a broken bone and has some insane medical bills and not the money to pay it without going far into debt. They don't have the time, money, or ability to learn and get hired fast enough with enough time to make the money needed to pay it off. So while effort can solve some issues, many times it can just end up being pointless without outside help.All in all, educating yourself is feasible and a quick thing to do. Pulling yourself up by the bootstraps can take immense amounts of time that you quite literally do not have, resources and money you don't have, and skills you don't have simply because you didn't go to a school for them or learned them from someone else.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Yep, 100% rigged.","title":"2024 election inconsistencies"},{"text":"Got it thanks, I figured it was along those lines but I wasn't sure. :)","title":"It is time, liberals"},{"text":"They missed...","title":"Elon Musk suggests support for replacing democracy with government of high-status males"},{"text":"They legally cant *send* the weapons to begin with given that they are being used to commit atrocities.

Despite the moral questions, states need to have a budget to offer basic services, if at least to pay for defense and security, and justice, it also includes essential infrastructure like roads, bridges, and in the modern world services like education, healthcare, and more.Previously, the administrative capacity of states wasn't sufficient to tax income, which requires exte sive book keeping and audits. States would tax land, wealth, and different goods.This was ok when states usually offered few civil services and mostly paid for an army, legal system, and occasional major infrastructure projects.Things radically changed though, as the states rapidly found themselves in need to offer additional services like police, education, and basic healthcare. The demand for these services grew with the industrial revolution and the rapid urbanisation.In previous generations, most people lived from agriculture. They formed small communities which were mostly self-sufficient. Peasants made their own tools, hearded their own sheep for wool to make textiles and cloth, and didn't really need money to supply their needs.But, with the industrial revolution people couldn't be self sufficient anymore, they moved to cities where they couldn't grow their food, have their sheep, and have access to ressources to make tools. They required money to buy these items from markets.The early period of the industrial revolution was terrible. Most people lived in abject poverty, worked long hours in dangerous environments, which lead to many revolts, riots, and social unrest.Income taxes were the solution to these problems. The state would tax mostly the bourgeois class, those that had sufficient incomes and benefited from the industrialization, and used this extra cash to pay for sewage infrastructure, better roads, police enforcement, education, as well as to implement more regulations in working conditions, Child labour bans, and in general to uplift the conditions in which the general population lived.This had great outcomes generaly speaking. With better education came skilled labour, and allowed members of the poor classes to access higher positions, meritocracy was implemented, and standards of living increased massively along with the middle class.Nowadays, states budgets have exploded, especially when compared to pre-industrialization. States went from being marginal in the economy to now being the top contributor, varying from 1/5 of the economy to almost 1/2 even in Capitalist states, and income taxes remain the primary and most essential source of income.In many ways it does make sense. It is the average citizen that benefit from the services of the state. They drive on the roads, have access to potable water from public aqueducs, send their children to schools subsidized by the state, enjoy vacations in public parks, etc etc etc, and without adequate alternatives to finance these services there is no doubt standards of living would collapse.The main argument against this system is that not every tax payer enjoys directly the services offered by the state. Yet, there's no denying they almost always indirectly benefit from them. For example: I have no kids yet pay taxes that finance schools. Is this unfair? Well, we can argue that the children that study to be engineers will one day build the roads I'll drive on. The children that study to become doctors/nurses will one day help me heal from any potential sickness, etc.It remains important though to have good democratic processes that can control the states finances and make good decisions for our collective governance.","title":"CMV: The United States should abolish the income tax."},{"text":"How exactly do you figure?

Other candidates could have challenged Harris for the nomination but time was just too short.

The media would have amplified that spreading anger among dems. There was no good way forward because Biden insisted on clinging to the idea of a 2nd term despite his age. That all unraveled in the debate when he was exposed. Winning a debate against Trump should be mind numbingly simple for a democrat because of his previous performance as president and Jan 6th etc etc. Harris demonstrated this when she was on stage with Trump.

I am sympathetic to the fact that poorer states would pay more than they currently pay but  honestly, they tend to vote for limited government anyway while accepting a ton of federal dollars relative to their populations - so I think my counter point would be that we ought to just let them have what they're voting for. With regard to the ultra-rich, I think that has to be handled on a state level as to whether the state chooses to tax them at a higher rate to pay their federal government dues. Certainly the current federal government (and the next one) isn't going to try and get them to pay their fair share anyway, so that's not really different from current state.","title":"CMV: The United States should abolish the income tax."},{"text":"Yep.

We need to be tough, not \\"high\\" ground. You need to fight. And Americans love a good fight. It's just this era is soft and obese.And Americans responds to pain and violence. I have been saying: American media (TV, movies, games) teaches Americans to be attracted to murders, blood, and gunshots. Contrast that with the aversion to casual nudity, not like the TV in Latin America and Europe. They don't respond to shame (they re-elected a vile and shameless Trump, and they gloat about it) but I believe that Americans will respond to pain. **I conclude that Americans don't learn from their own stupidity and vice until they are starving and punished.**My previous spiel, of when I know the liberals have hardened up for the fight:xxxxxxxxxxxMore than the turnover of DNC K-street attitudes (Pelosi-Clinton influence is finally proven wrong and dead), **I will know that the future liberal side is ready to fight and govern after MAGA when they:**1. Guns: Embrace universal and responsible gun ownership, as a matter of safety and American-eagle FREEDOM!!!! School-shooting shaming is not working to attract voters, despite how bad Uvalde and Sandy Hook were. We saw hints of that from Kamala (her Glock) and Walz (hunting rifle), but did not go far enough in their short campaign.\\n2. Muscular prosperity messaging, even when we over-promise benefits to voters. Treat them like electoral cattle, with dignity but also knowing how transactional, contradictory, and ignorant they are. Just being pro-union like Biden is not enough, though Joe did help the recent rise of union activity. We must lie and pander to their dumb minds, for the greater good. We cannot rest our hopes that the electorate is rational enough to see the policy weeds. Just screaming \\"working class\\" like the Bernie Sanders blame letter did is not enough - we must actively manipulate our liberal economic messaging around the idea of FREEDOM! We must tint our messaging with a bit of masculine flavouring, while not completely pushing away our feminist class.\\n3. Latinos: Have a regional, cultural, and economic plan to integrate Latin America into our production system (the Zeihan in me is leaking). This means we will complete our re-shoring efforts, while being powered by Biden-era green energy (the future thanks you, Biden), and while weaning ourselves off of captive China supply reliance. Two, this means confronting Democrat attitudes toward the immigration angle: plug up border holes for the security side, expand legal work permit levels, and fair pathways to citizenship (don't call it amnesty). Three, this also involves Democrat party cultural attitude changes: don't see Latinos as a monolith, but as different tribes that value social conservatism, are racist, and like hard work. Reach a detente with Latinos over LGBT issues, while not abandoning our minority groups. Live and let live.\\n4. How to message: Do our political messaging with GRAPHS and CHARTS. Use diagrams and 15-second ads to show how inflation is doing. Complete our liberal media transition to Threads or BlueSky, and off of Twitter, to counter the Musk digital media capture. Most Americans are politically and functionally illiterate, so spell it out exactly how their wallets are hurting from MAGA. Dumb it down. ALWAYS TIE THE MESSAGING THAT MAGA=BAD, LIBERALS=FREEDOM\\n5. Justice: When liberals regain power, you can NEVER appoint cowardly appeasers and republicans to be special counsels, the Director of the FBI, or Attorney General.

Would voter support of third party candidates have somehow lead to better candidates?  Who could possibly say for sure?  However, given that voter support of Democratic and Republican candidates does not seem to have an effect on the quality of future candidates, would seem to be evidence against your theory. Ronald Reagan got almost 60 percent of the vote. Did that lead to better Republican candidates in the years since?  Democratic leadership seeing a third party candidate as a potential threat does not necessarily say anything about the candidate. It seemed to me that they were worried not about her being a serious contender, but that she might bleed away just enough votes in swing states to deny Democrats a victory. This did not turn out to be the case, as even if every single voter that chose a third party candidate had chosen Harris, she still would have lost. I have yet to see any evidence that popular support of a party, any party, somehow creates better candidates.  Politicians are not created by popular support. Being popular does not somehow empower them to be better.  Politicians are just like anyone else, theyre shaped by their life experiences. You are exactly right about fear. Many voters, millions probably, dont want to waste their vote in a third party candidate they feel has no chance when their vote for a less palatable candidate might cause them to win over an even worse won.

How much greater of a threat would it have been had people supported the building of that party over the past couple of decades?-American voters are generally more populist than the D and R candidates that run. It's not lack of enthusiasm for 3rd party candidates that drives our screwed up system, it's fear; too many voters vote for the D or the R not because they support the D or the R but because they don't want the other one to win.

Sue Collins is still a Senator. Dan Crenshaw is still in the House. They aren't exactly allies, but they aren't \\"Team Trump\\", either.

And I daresay, probably 10-20% of **Democrats** will secretly celebrate it, because most laws relating to it are deeply, deeply unpopular.

Consumers who need a new central A/C today are **fucked**, and no official in either party cares. Democrats go along with Dupont/Chemours' fiction that it'll make any difference at all to climate change, and Republicans bow down to their corporate overlords by enthusiastically banning refrigerants as soon as the patents expire &amp; they start to become cheap (driving prices back up by enforced artificial scarcity). And don't get me started on the sheer absurdity of replacing a $250-400 electric water heater that can realistically last 15-30 years with a $2,000+ heatpump water heater likely to crap out &amp; need total replacement in 10 years or less.

The demographic adjustment are interesting,  but if those missing voters were present, not only would Trump's blowout by much less likely, but he likely wouldn't have won the popular vote either.We might disagree with the voters reasoning, but it would be incredibly naive to think this was just a turnout/messaging problem. Weve been hemorrhaging the working class since 2016 and thought we could triage by running up the score in urban areas. That strategy failed massively.The working class vote was up for Biden in 2020. In 2024, the issue seems moreso to be pertaining to the previous years of inflation and the hangover effects of the COVID economy.

Historically, they're a very pro-labor part of the nation with strong historical ties to labor unions and other left-wing causes. So they're the heart of the working class in America. Now, if you're a voter there who sees Kamala Harris proudly showcasing the Cheney endorsements and other pro-corporate Republicans, considering the end result was Trump still getting the same number of votes but Harris got fewer, what do you think happened when people saw her running to the right? It didn't take away any Republican votes from Trump. But what do you suppose it did to the pro-worker, left-wing base of the Democrats? Do you suppose they were as enthusiastic to vote for her?Imo, I think if the candidate was someone like AOC, she probably could have won because she has very big working class appeal and younger vote appeal(which was a new group that Biden brought in last election that helped him win, which Harris also failed with.)

You can't stop the (diversity) rock. It will keep on rolling forward. It's inevitable. The racial-haters may have won a small battle, but they'll still lose the war. (I'm not sure when that will be.. but they will lose). The thing is, you can't stop immigration 100% (you can't stop BOTH illegal immigration and legal immigration). It's not like there's some magic forcefield to prevent people from coming into the country.THe Brookings Institute did a report that showed https://www.brookings.edu/articles/white-and-youth-population-losses-contributed-most-to-the-nations-growth-slowdown-new-census-data-reveals/ \\"This report focuses on annual changes from July 2016 to July 2017 through July 2020 to July 2021. This period includes three years prior to the pandemic, one year with partial pandemic exposure (2019 to 2020), and one year with full pandemic exposure (2020 to 2021). This allows for an assessment of race-ethnic and age shifts before and during the pandemic. This is also a significant period because, as a previous report shows, the nations white population began to decline in 2016.2 This initial white population loss occurred before the pandemic and is related to the aging of the white population, which has led to fewer births and more deathslosses that are projected to continue. And as shown below, the pandemic has exacerbated this white population loss.  The examination of age shifts shows a loss of young people under age 18 and those in their prime working ages (18 through 59). Moreover, when looking at age and race, it becomes clear that nonwhite Americans, especially Latino or Hispanic Americans, comprise larger shares of the population at all ages.  This report also revisits earlier analyses of notable population declines in large metro areas and big cities. It shows that most of those declines are due to white population losses, both from the national white population decline as well as white population movement to smaller-sized places. While these trends are exaggerated in the prime pandemic year, it is plain to see that **the nation is facing a long-term transition toward greater diversity and aging, both nationally and across large swaths of the country. **Latino, Asian and Black demographics are all growing faster than White.  \\"The new census estimates make plain two facts: 1) diversity is greater for the nations younger age groups than older age groups; and 2) the nation is becoming more diverse at all ages. \\"","title":"Donald Trump has just unmasked the awkward truth about diversity: It was obvious a long time ago that the Democratic nominee wasnt up for the job.

The information media running around trying to report the truth is failing. The NY Times does a great service of providing information, but we all need to be honest about the power of its influence.  Propoganda is winning. The economic message is against the Democrats. Whether or not inflation is tamed, the memory of it and current prices are an easy thing for Trump and the conservative media to hammer on.  Again this is where the NYT reporting is ineffectual. Could the Democrats, could Harris, overcome all this?  I don't think so not without a lot of alternate realities thrusting into our time line.  I don't know who amongst the Democrats could either.  Were in the age predicted by Neil Postman. The Democrats would have needed somebody who they love, that they could be accused of being blinded by their glow.

After the convention especially, the message changed. She brought on Mark Cuban and talked about the Opporunity Economy. $35 for insulin is a great policy, and I love it, but it doesnt make milk and eggs cheaper.She stopped talking about greedflation because the Democratic Party is infested with corporate interests, and her own Brother-in-Law the CLO at Uber asked her to stop talking about corporate price-gouging, which polling shows was one of her best messages with voters she needed to win.Instead they leaned into This is the greatest economy in the world, which is objectively true on a macro level, but it doesnt feel real to the average voter in Middle America because inflation was still pummeling them.I do not for a second believe Trump will help the economy, and Im praying he doesnt end up enacting his tariff policy, even if politically it would help Democrats because the effects on *all* of us will be terrible.

Far bigger margins than any other demographic that Democrats are being blamed for not courting enough. So why are White Christians, the most influential demographic in America, so into fascism right now?The copium answer from White Christians is \\"I'm not a fascist racist or sexist, I voted for the economy.\\" But that is exactly what Fascism looks like in practice. Rejecting mainstream appeals backed up by facts in favor of the word of an extreme Charismatic strong man who tells you comforting but illogical lies and hateful rhetoric. When you decide that hateful rhetoric is an acceptable price to pay for fake promises, and you decide that all mainstream media is out to get you so you don't take their warnings seriously, you're doing a fascism. Also, you can be for a polite god fearing American who waves the American flag, coaches little league, and gives to charity and still support fascism. If you're thinking \\"That's not me, I'm nice\\" despite your voting choices, you don't understand what enables fascists. A lot of people in the Nazi party didn't have a problem with Jews.

It's a question of class.

The working class, most people on earth and anyone that had to work to live and provide for their family, the people who make the world run, have no political party at all.The interests of different capitalists sometimes contrast, but the interests of capitalists always directly oppose and come at the expense of the workers' interests. So while both parties rhetorically appease different layers of voters to keep up their ruse, neither of them care about living up to that rhetoric beyond rarely and meagerly.Trumpism will keep getting worse and we will continue in this race to the bottom until we break away completely, as the working class, from BOTH capitalist parties and build our own party that takes no corporate money, runs on real grassroots democracy, and is built through labor and social movements.

If a candidate wanted to court votes from those delegates they could have. Nobody thought that would be a good idea, either for their own careers or for the party (too much risk of losing after a haphazard last minute campaign). Still, the delegates could have voted for anyone else, even if that person hadn't publicly said they wanted the nomination. Nobody did. They thought Harris was the best bet and they nominated her.There was no back room. There was no procedural malfeasance. We had an incumbent president that wanted to run again. He faced a feable primary challenge, still more of a challenge than what most incumbent presidents face.

There were at least two VERY significant legal questions that needed a SCOTUS ruling before that case would be sufficiently resolved. The first is whether or not the President has plenary power concerning clarification and whether or not any prices must be followed. The prevailing idea pre-Trump was that yes, the power is absolute and no, the President can declassify anything on a whim at any time. This is why Obama can declassify extremely TS/SCI information on live television and not be in trouble. (And that absolutely happened in the aftermath of the bin Laden raid). The DOJ was bringing very novel and completely untested legal theories that would seem to conflict with previous SCOTUS rulings, including one that brings us to the second point: presidential vs personal records. The National Records Act may be unconstitutional in its face, but at a minimum, the issue of who has final say over presidential records designations needs to be hammered out. Ideally, Congress would clarify with an amendment to existing law, but absent that, SCOTUS would absolutely need to arbitrate between NARA's position and Trump's position. There's no obvious reason why NARA should have the final say, not in the law itself and not from any practical perspective either. TLDR: the government case against Trump was novel, untested, and highly unlikely to survive SCOTUS scrutiny.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"Another counter opposition doesnt exist submission","title":"Sore Loser Globalist already playing pandemic"},{"text":"\\\\Imagine if the goal is to raise children in environments of poverty and limited education, creating generations dependent on the economic machine.?You mean, like now?","title":"Republicans vs. Abortion."},{"text":"If she'd promised to stop selling arms to Israel she would have won in a landslide.","title":"She ran a flawless campaign.

That's why Democrats/Harris lost (and Biden not dropping out farther in advance). For all the macro econ numbers that look good, people's underlying wallets do not look good for working class Americans, and we have the same structural issues with the economy today that we've had for decades. In that scenario, incumbents can lose. Trump may be completely a charlatan, horrible in many ways, and un-serious about addressing these issues, but his rhetoric is populist economically. The messaging is key. His populist rhetoric cuts through, and the Democrats have a lack of messaging/outreach that can match.For instance, think back to 2022 when inflation was raging. If Trump were president, he would have been shouting 24/7 scapegoating corporations, greedy boards/ceos, and throwing everyone and anyone elitist under the bus he could. Biden on the other hand was tone deaf and blase; almost completely absent in general (and aside from just the messaging/narratives, he should have actually done something with emergency COVID powers to rein in price gouging, even if courts tried to stop him).Democrats never should have tried to pass off the economy as \\"good;\\" instead they should have said they're a recovery admin, insisted they're still cleaning up the Republicans mess throughout Biden's term, acknowledged people's finances, and pointed the finger at Republicans plus Corporations/Wall St. for out of control price gouging.Going forward, they need to simplify the message and platform, and get big and bold. The power of three. should promote these three exclusively as their party platform going forward:\\\\- \\"We're going to raise taxes on the wealthy and specifically dedicate those funds solely to maintaining and expanding Social Security and Medicare, and nothing else\\"\\\\- \\"The era of the government and our party catering to Corporations and Wall St is over. We will rein in Corporate and Wall St dominance of our government and give a voice to working Americans and small business.\\"\\"We're going all in for working Americans and small business, and will address their needs, particularly by reining in the costs of housing, healthcare, prescription drugs, education, and childcare.\\"","title":"Democrats Deserved to Lose"},{"text":"What does Kari say, tho?","title":"Democratic Rep.

Same thing with a buyback.Which Treasury are you looking at? When we talk about rates being cut we are talking about the Fed funds rate which is short term. Longer term bonds can follow short term bonds but dont have to. As I look at the 90 day T Bill, it was yielding 5.3 percent 6 months ago and is now yielding 4.5 percent.

I had a post blow up after Donald trump won. I talked about being black and voting for trump. I wanna tell you guys something"},{"text":"Article:\\nAfter the last time Donald Trump won the presidency, in 2016, The New York Times confronted its readers with a vivid illustration of how out of touch most of them were with their fellow Americans. In a series of maps, the newspaper color-coded the United States by TV-viewing preferences, highlighting which parts of the country preferred Game of Thrones (cities) and which ones preferred American Dad! (rural areas). The starkest factoid: Trumplands favorite TV show was Duck Dynasty, a hunting-themed reality series that many liberals had never seen one second of.\\nThe Times feature was just one of many pieces of media meant to serve as a wake-up call to blue America, bemoaning how the nation had split into silos. Pundits agreed that restoring unityand curbing Trump-era extremismwould require voters to get out of their comfort zones in order to understand, connect with, and persuade the other side.\\nEight years later, with Trump taking the White House in part by bringing young people to the right, it may seem that those calls were simply never heeded: that liberal America instead drew itself further inward and is now facing the fallout. But thats not quite right. Trumps first term was marked by concerted cultural efforts that spread resistance ideology into conservative enclaves. Hollywoods endorsement of the #MeToo movement rippled into everyday workplaces; calls for racial justice were turned into prime-time football spectacles; enormously popular childrens movies and blockbusters made the case for multiculturalism. These were attempts on the left to do what it knew how to do bestinfluence whatever remained of the mainstream. But the very shape of culture was changing, and its now quite clear that only one side knows what to do about that.\\nArguably the key architect of this ongoing political era was Andrew Breitbart, the conservative punditand compatriot of Trumpisms most cunning culture warrior, Steve Bannonwho founded a series of online publications in the 2000s and died in 2012. The so-called Breitbart Doctrine stated that politics is downstream from culturethat is, the ideas conveyed by popular entertainment shapes consumers worldviews. This proposition called for conservatives to build a shadow Hollywood that tells conservative stories and raises up conservative stars (Duck Dynastys un-P.C. patriarch, Phil Robertson, won an award named for Breitbart in 2015). In the long run, though, the doctrines biggest impact has been encouraging the right to get creative with online culture.\\nSocial medias role in the 2016 electionhelping bundle a variety of grievances into one exciting, factually pliant narrative of elites oppressing regular Americanshas been highly publicized. Whats less talked about is that it triggered a strangely regressive counteroffensive. Democrats, of course, made memes and organized online during Trumps first term, but they also channeled energy into reforming social media through content moderation and regulatory efforts. These efforts were prudent, and notionally bipartisan. But while Democrats seemed to yearn to bring back a less anarchic paradigm, Republicans railed against perceived liberal bias in techmeaning they wanted, in effect, an even better mouthpiece. As media theorists such as Marshall McLuhan have long argued, new communication formats change the way a society thinks ofand speaks toitself. By all rights, an effective political movement should prioritize harnessing such changes, not reversing them.\\nIn the 2020s, as many Democratic voters and politicians stepped back a bit from partisan warfare, the gears of culture were being refitted yet again. The old social-media platforms had been somewhat defanged, but action was happening on emerging platforms like TikTok, livestreams, and podcasts. These hypnotizing microformswhich captured most of young America, but also cut inroads across demographicsmade old cultural fault lines, such as A&amp;E versus HBO, look quaint. Conservative ideas popped up in a flurry of new fads and scenes: the manosphere, the tradwives, anti-woke comedians playing to cryptocurrency conferences. Livestreamers saw an influx of money from right-leaning interests (and, in some cases, Russian ones). When it came time for Trump to mount his comeback campaign, he could plug into a booming world of sympathetic influencers with enormous followings.\\nBy contrast, Joe Bidens signature effort in regard to TikTok was his administrations support for banning it. When Kamala Harris became the nominee, she did unleash a wave of coconut-themed memes that, more than anything, excited fans of the pop stars whose songs were in the background. Late in her brief campaign, she and her surrogates also made some forays into popular podcasts. But in any analysis, these were marginal efforts compared with the old-school influence methods her campaign relied on: ad campaigns, door-knocking, and rallies headlined by mainstream celebs.\\nNow that she has lost, one of the many what-ifs to argue over is this: What if Harris had tried to court the millions of subscribers to Joe Rogans bro-beloved podcast? Trump and J. D. Vance each did their own three-hour conversation with Rogan. The host wanted to talk with Harris, but he and the campaign couldnt agree on the logistical details: Harriss camp had wanted Rogan to travel to her from his Austin studio, and to chat for only an hour. These were reasonable requests when judged by the standards of a traditional politician at the height of campaign season, but they were also a sign of the Harris sides inability or unwillingness to play by the rules of the new media. The refusal may have also been a strategic move to avoid the possibility of making a gaffe on micbut given who ended up winning the election, this, too, seems like an antiquated concern.\\nAfter all, the hottest commodity of todays online cultural ecosystem is open conflict. Chitchat on podcasts and livestreams is transfixing because its unruly, argumentative, and unafraid of causing offense. (Note how videos of dozens of voters engaged in free-for-all debates, produced by the media company Jubilee, took off this election cycle). Theoretically, its not hard to infiltrate the new conservative information environment: Rogan tried to talk to Harris, and the similarly influential podcaster Theo Von booked Bernie Sanders. But most Democratic surrogates seem stuck on a 20th-century performance style, defined by slick sound bites or soaring, cinematic monologues. They seem reluctant to do what these new formats require, which is fight.\\nOne example came when Rogan recently interviewed John Fetterman, the senator from Pennsylvania whose entire brand is allegedly being no-nonsense. Rogan presented him with the conspiracy theory that Democrats were importing undocumented immigrants to swing states, and planning to give them amnesty, in order to expand their voter pool. Fetterman could have debunked that idea in any number of ways, and forcefully. Instead he did what politicians have long been trained to do in contentious interviews: find a point of agreementyou know, immigration is always going to be a tough issue in this nationand change the subject. Rogan, and probably many of his listeners, took this gauziness as evidence that the conspiracy theory was right. The day before Rogan endorsed Trump, the podcaster posted the clip of the exchange with the note I think everyone should understand exactly what is happening.\\nHarris wouldnt have won just by going on a few more podcastsbut if more Democrats had spent more of the past four years in the mix, figuring out how to spar, complicating the rights narratives about inflation and immigration, finding ways to redirect attention toward their own agenda, who knows? This new ecosystem is now so visibleand so obviously connected to the rightward shift among young people that helped reelect Trumpthat to label it alternative seems ridiculous. Still, the temptation to ignore it, for people who are less than enchanted with Trumpism, will only grow under the new administration. Calls to disengage from X, now that Elon Musk has turned it into a white-supremacist haven, certainly have a moral appeal. But if this election showed how difficult it is to meaningfully deplatform speakers you disagree with, it also demonstrated the danger of ignoring the platforms where they speak. Unfortunately, the only way to change whats happening in an echo chamber may be to add your own noise.","title":"Why Democrats Are Losing the Culture War"},{"text":"Our system is SO stupid.

Harris whooped Trump's ass so hard in the debate he (despite earlier saying he would) refused to debate her again. Then he tried to move the goalpost to Fox News thinking she wouldn't bite.

Most people are going to vote selfishly they will not vote for some greater good concept that does not make their life easier. That is simply a fact you cannot change people who want things to be a certain way in our promised it through campaigning whether they get it or not to vote differently. \\nThe Democratic Party did not change their platform to represent the ongoing complaints that people have. Texas and California have ongoing illegal immigration problems for different reasons people feel these problems on a ground level people who vote Democratic do not usually vote on ground level issues they vote on national issues that no other Republican will care about. The Democratic Party did not change their platform on Helene did not change their platform on the economy and the the rise of prices regardless of which administration was the reason for the prices. People in 2017-2018-2019 had low prices and gas was affordable and the Trump administration just happened to be there they will vote for the Trump administration again because they want that economy and they believe that that's what they're going to get because that's what being promised on a ground level issue to most American voters. The Democratic Party's platform did not change fast enough nor did they use the opportunity to actually host Democratic primaries in a way where other candidates can propose a platform that will resonate with the public. You as an individual voter should not feel entitled enough to say that other people do not understand the point of voting because the point of voting is to be self it is the only selfish thing you can do in the country freely is vote for your needs and vote for your wants whether you're going to get them or not. This isn't a messaging issue This is not a giant group of people that just dislike women okay This is a group of people who are centrists conservatives and Republicans being able to use a marketable man for ground level issues that matter to the public and get them to vote that way The Democrats did not do this they drove everyone away with their was there platform Biden had terrible messaging and had terrible everything when it came to him campaigning and the only reason he won was because he was not Trump. There's a quote that hard times make good men good men make easy times and easy times make lazy men This can be applied to men and women we had good times in 2017-2018-2019 with prices we have then since gone through in the last 5 years natural disasters and an epidemic and daring that whole time people were unable to make as much money as 2018-2019 and then had prices increase states who aren't budgeting lower their budget for things like EBT and unemployment make it really hard for people to make money back so they are voting on ground level issues so that they can see themselves see more money whether they're going to get that or not The Democratic Party did not use that insight with their platforms Yes you can say that it's a messaging issue but Democratic Party has always had a poor messaging issue they've always been just anti-republican there's never been a platform and the last 20 something years that wasn't just anti My running opponent. I think if you really want to understand why people voted for Donald Trump in such a huge amount it's because we are facing a point where the middle class is getting poorer. And the majority of voters are not blaming the rich The only people that are blaming the rich is the Democratic Party nobody cares about the rich and their money. They care about their money their taxes their food costs who's going to help make it better who's going to campaign for their wants and their needs not the greater good nobody is going to accept a greater good message when you can't sell the product.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"She barely won ny, dems usually landslide win ny","title":"I love democracy!!!"},{"text":"What loser talk","title":"Was it even a winnable cycle?

At the time, there was a pretty heavily unionized workforce in coal mining, along with plenty of factory jobs, which were a mix of union and non-union shops. The area was pretty heavily Democratic, and there had been a good amount of prosperity. Of course, by those years, the waves of off-shoring had begun to affect the region. It accelerated when President Clinton signed NAFTA into law. Nowadays, when I visit home, its a pretty depressing sight. Most of those factories and coal mines are closed. The younger people who can leave do, and those left behind dont have a lot to look forward to. There are closed up businesses everywhere you care to look in my hometown and most areas nearby. There are a lot of areas where one still cant access broadband. All three of the rural critical access hospitals in the area where I grew up stopped delivering babies decades ago, and the facilities themselves have steadily eliminated services over the years and are on the verge of closure. It is not a pretty picture. When working-class people in these areas think of Democrats, they think of the party that ushered in one of the major trade agreements that helped decimate their towns. There wasnt nearly enough done to help ensure other industries took the places of those that left. There wasnt enough done to help people retrain for other work. All the economic malaise in the area made it fertile ground for the opioid epidemic, a problem which in their eyes has also been largely ignored. They feel as though the Democrats dont care about them. The Republicans dont, either, but theyve at least pandered to them the past few election cycles. I am a liberal and I have never voted for a Republican in my life. But I understand the frustration and anger rural and working-class voters feel. They feel as though theyve been left behind, and theyre not wrong. The party who speaks to them is the party who will win their votes. The Democrats have done a lot for these types of areas during this presidency, but the messaging from them is so poor that the residents of these areas dont realize it. I live in Pennsylvania now, and I see the same issues in the rural areas of this state. John Fetterman won because he went and talked to people in counties like the one I grew up in. Other Democrats can do this, too. Instead of spending money on LV Sphere ads, celebrity endorsements and podcasts, they should do a better job of helping rural/working class voters AND making sure they know it. If the Democrats cant figure this out, theyre going to keep losing. And we will all suffer for it. Bernie Sanders gets it, and the DNC would do very well to listen to him.","title":"Nancy Pelosi tears into Bernie Sanders for claiming Democrats abandoned working class amid Harris election loss: I dont respect him saying that"},{"text":"Trump did say he had already won, that there was no reason to have an election, no reason to vote because he won.

For instance, Elon Musk spent the past couple months performing fellatio on Trump so I'm guessing he's near the top, because Elon knows that's what it takes and his lips were the last wrapped around Trump's mushroom.  Whereas Tucker Carlson is on the record saying he hates Trump passionately and he lost his influential show on Faux News.

Those people dont just believe the BS they are told to believe, by MSM and the DNC. They go look for actual sources and uncut and edited footage of what happened and what was said. Biden/Harris and the DNC have been blatantly lying, to push their agenda, since Trump announced he was running for the 2016 election. All you have to do is look for the actual truth and the uncut and unedited footage on the internet; which is one of the reasons the DNC is now saying free speech is a threat. They want to control what you can say and what you can hear, because they want their truth to be all you get to hear. They constantly rail against misinformation, when they are the biggest pushers of misinformation. Two good examples are the good people on both sides Trump is a racist rhetoric, and the recent Trump is calling for Liz Chaney to be shot by a firing squad rhetoric. They cut the footage to make it look like he might have been saying what they claim he said, and then push those claims, using this edited footage. Thats utterly dishonest. There is also all the lies about what Trump is going to do ( and also about what Harris policy values are  ( as compared to what she previously stated they were )).Video footage of what he actually has said, and the history of what he actually did do, are easy to find on the internet. MSM and the DNC are not the only possible sources of information, people actually do have memories. The party claims of what Trump was going to do have been ridiculous ( and totally false ), and have only gotten worse. Not only the obvious lies about project 2025 or his intention to ban abortions on the federal level, but stuff like Harris telling people he was going to put them in camps, at her rallies. The irony of that last point is amazing, since AOC actually said they ( the Dems ) should put conservatives in reeducation camps!","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Getting people into compromising positions so that you can wield power over them is nothing new.

The US immigration system is extremely strict and they don't just let anyone come in, and the US refugee system is the strictest in the world. It is so strict that ISIS even outright stated to potential operatives to never apply for refugee entry since the vetting will absolutely uncover their connections no matter how hard they try to cover it up.It is so strict that there is no way it can be any stricter... unless your idea is 'no one who isn't white and non-Muslim'.","title":"My Democratic colleagues and I need to face these harsh truths"},{"text":"Not shaking hands with Trump and sitting down for a nice chat puts American lives in danger?","title":"President-elect Trump has accepted President Biden's invitation to an Oval Office meeting next week"},{"text":"thought biden didnt want to run in 2016 due to beaus death?","title":"Chuck Todd: This Democratic defeat  and the rise of Trump 2.0  was a decade in the making"},{"text":"People who view the largest state in the country as an enemy sure love to talk about patriotism and loyalty.","title":"Why the Democrats lost"},{"text":"You say all this but Trump had a record, which was terrible, and had a campaign, which was a disaster.

What happened with January 6 and the conspiracy theories makes it an even bigger uphill battle to talk about voter suppression, gerrymandering, voter roll purges, etc that can have an impact. And whats crazier too is that people were removed, but the lawsuit asking to remove them was thrown out by the judge. Not to mention, my friend never should have been on an inactive list in the first place as shes been an active voter for over 30 years. The whole thing is insane and I wonder how many errors like this happened, particularly if the ACLU says theyre fielding calls left and right.","title":"Drop-Off in Democratic Votes Ignites Conspiracy Theories on Left and Right"},{"text":"This is basically what happens in Europe as well.

Maybe it's why his wildly unpopular platform didn't matter.

Its all about time and consistency, its not a get rich quick thing, but yes you can eventually live off mostly passive income. Takes years though and you have to manage money wisely. And yes its not just sold to men. Ironically selling it to women is a far older concept. MLMs mainly target women. People who arent sucked into the social-media hate train generally just call it micro-business. And anyone who actually does it vs selling courses on how to do it will tell you its a time and consistency thing. Steady improvement, keeping up with it until it becomes profitable, putting in a lot of very hard work up front that will eventually pay off.TLDR: its basically just regular ol business lol. The main reason I see people feeling threatened by it is business generally requires a large investment or loan. Micro-business does not. You can just do it on the side for 3 or 4 years then quit your day job.

Elissa Slotkin: Similar to Kari but less polished, extremely aggressive from the outset and demolished Rogers especially in the abortion segment and had really good one liners3. Jacky Rosen: Really polished answers, very slick communicator but held up well against Brown. Had really good coherent answers to Israel/FoPo4. Sam Brown/McCormick/Casey: Did fine, typical politician mode for all of them, kinda boring cadence5. Gallego: Really needs to work on his intonation. Kept repeating himself and went around in circles when he was talking. Was fine I guess but very weak showing compared to Kari5. Baldwin/Hovde: I love Baldwin but both of them were awful im sorry. They kept stumbling over their words. There was this one segment about false ads and both of them were stuttering and kinda malfunctioned a bit. I think both are up there in age so there was an obvious lag in their answers6. Roger: He did not look like he wanted to be there.

We went to Biden 60/40, and now Harris 55/45.I always get a mail in ballot in case lines are long during early voting or work gets busy, but I prefer in person voting. Never been an issue. I show up, they ask me if I mailed my ballot, I say no, they let me go vote.This year, our town clerk (who is VERY republican), was overseeing the poll stations. The guy at the table asked her what to do since I had gotten my mail in ballot. I explained the situation, that I always vote in person, but like the option to have the mail in ballot if I cant make it.The town clerk went off.She told me there are too many cases of fraud, and she cant have a mail in ballot floating around there after I vote.. She demanded I bring in my mail in so she can destroy it before letting me vote. She said she had already sent 3 others home that day for the same issue.I pulled up the MA website and basically made a whole spectacle over it - told her she WILL let me vote because its the law and never been an issue. She reluctantly backed down, and when I left told me that it would be best for me to still bring in my ballot for her to destroy.I emailed my local state rep right after and told him. Now, maybe the other 3 she sent home were not dems, but the effort to suppress votes is very much a thing, and on the whole, it favors republicans.","title":"Drop-Off in Democratic Votes Ignites Conspiracy Theories on Left and Right"},{"text":"Bushes?

Like a social \\"stamp of approval\\" gives us the permission we need to find fulfillment. Tell us its okay to think this, believe this, say this, or be this. People seeking purpose within society, rely on a shared understanding that justifies our sense of purpose. The broader culture, that \\"Nation of support\\", validates the paths in life we take, our values, even identities we embrace. Which is necessary for many who struggle with self-acceptance and worry about being \\"on the right path\\".Personally, I have the perspective that meaning is deeply personal and doesn't inherently require external validation. People who have inner strength, emotional intelligence or take an unorthodox path can find meaning without that social reinforcement. For many though, just knowing they belong to a supportive social fabric will strengthen confidence in their purpose. \\"This crisis of meaning, compounded by ideological extremism and technological amplification, has pushed America into an existential quandary\\"YES, it has indeed contributed to an existential quandary in America. From the way we perceive truth, meaning, and our collective identity. At the intersection of these forces, polarization has been intensified with widening distrust and echo chambers, which only serve to amplify radical views. Making calm discussion impossible.Social media has magnified the reach and impact of extreme ideologies. I wish more people understood how rapid sharing platforms are designed to invoke an emotional response with sensational and divisive content. Instead we need calm, collected discourse. Worse, someone gets trapped in an algorithmic loop, that is just reinforcing specific beliefs and creates online communities that validate the user but only serves to further isolate them from a more nuanced reality. This is why people find it impossible to find common ground and has so many feeling confused about what's true or moral. Leading to existential unease and rigid ideology, pulling people towards simplified narratives which only serves to comfort those beliefs which hinders that open-minded exploration we need more of. The more complex the world becomes, that rigidity can only lead to people feeling more alienated. How can we ever achieve goals for the betterment of society in this state? As Americans we urgently need to find ways to bridge this divide- balancing the technological with more meaningful and genuine dialogue. And maybe teach more about building resiliency against extremism. Empathy, curiosity, and understanding is the only way our country can get past this existential crossroads.","title":"CMV: It is only when the meaning of life has social proof that we require a nation of support to be comfortable with ourselves."},{"text":"So you would say the percentage of informed, knowledgeable and/or experienced voting-eligible adults with developed brains is basically equal to the percentage of informed, knowledgeable and/or experienced kids with developed brains?Maybe in the future when we have better systems of understanding different people's cognizance, awareness of politics etc we will change things.

Their argument for illegal immigrants, rights, and so on do not make too much sense. Also, the democrat's propaganda and ideas do not make sense. It is not a vote against Kamala or support Trump. It is a vote for Republicans to cool down the Democrats so the next time, democrats will have a better idea for the country. I am not in either party, but I also think Democrats seem to be full of hatred. In another way, many of the democrats calling others fascist and racist sounds like they just resort to pure emotions. In a debate or convincing others not to support the other side, you should not call people by those things. Saying that is pushing many people to the other side. They might still be in the middle. Winning a yelling contest might mean losing the election. So, almost all my college friends went for Trump. Personally, saying Trump will destroy the country and all that extreme stuff may not be as realistic since Trump was president before, the country did not collapse. Also, the Democrats did not remove all of Trump's tariffs in the last 4 years. This indicates that even the Democrat leaders actually supported the tariffs but didn't want to admit them. They probably wanted to do that as well, but none of the previous presidents wanted to be the bad guy. But Trump did it for them, and they probably liked it. Otherwise, they would immediately remove it. Bidden is still in control now. He and the Democrats can try to remove it now, but it seems no plan for it. This means they want the tariffs there. To me, all people, especially politicians, all lie. So, Trump or Kamala does not matter. In terms of plans, Trump is giving some plans, and even if he won't do what he says, it is at least some plan. Democrats need some plan. Plus, laws under Democrats are too loose. It needs to be tightened a bit before going back to Democrats. If Kamala said to remove and handle illegal immigration better, give police more power to knock down crimes, and have more of those conservative ideas. I am going to vote for her. True democracy is not absolute freedom nor letting things go out of control. The country focuses on fixing the major problems before looking at more minor ones. I also want freedom but at times, I would give up some of the freedom just to fix certain problems.","title":"Trump wins Arizona, flipping a swing state Biden won in 2020"},{"text":"\\"Everyone who disagrees with me is a Zionist\\"Bro do you have the slightest idea what a Zionist is","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Lmaoooo","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"How in God's name did you take what I said and turn it into \\"anything that is legitimate is anarchism?\\"","title":"CMV: the political compass should be a diamond (rotated 45 degrees)"},{"text":"This video needs to be on the home page for all to watch.

Trump sold a message that he was going to gut the bureaucracy leading to all the problems in his bases lives. It had promises of prosperity, it had villains - theyll end up eating a shit sandwich but for election purposes that is irrelevant. The Democratic message was a handful of policies that dont help everybody and dragging around Liz Cheney, while antagonizing Trump.Theres a key thing about Bernies rhetoric that the Democratic Party proper never really uses - Bernie actually directly attacks lobbyists, and the individual people running these industries that endlessly fist us - he taps into that element of selling populism with the story, with the narrative. He isnt afraid to just directly attack people the Democratic Party calls donors, and to call them the villains, to talk about them like greedy parasites growing fat on labor, growing fat on the medical necessities of the people.It honestly feels like the Democratic Party just doesnt have it in them to do this. We need a genuine labor forward party that rejects donations from any special interests that expect something in return. That is primarily grassroots driven, where the only funding they are obligated to give kickbacks for is to the people. Thats willing to take the punches from corporate media and beat them on their turf unapologetically. They are unanimous in their hate for me, and I welcome their hatred.This is how MAGAs see Trump. And yes hes going to get in office and hes going to self-deal, and be very corrupt, and keep all of his conflict of interest shit and pump his own shit, and make secret service stay at his resorts at inflated rates and all that shit, he aint doing fuck all that helps the working class but it is irrelevant - that is how MAGA sees him. An actual labor party that can show the receipts that they are not owned I think would be unstoppable, but the DNC and that big establishment club with its donors and corporate advisors are never going to move in that direction, theyll tell Bernie they dont respect it.
