From it, I gathered the following....1. You were terrified that after 9-11, ordinary Americans would react with anger and hostility towards you because of your Muslim background. Your fear was understandable because the hostile reactions of ordinary Americans to such a heinous atrocity that killed 3000 of their countrymen would also have been understandable. But it never happened. There were no pogroms, no riots, no mass expulsions. In fact, our political class, our educational institutions, and most of the mainstream media went out of their way to validate Islam as a \\"religion of peace\\".I'm only guessing but I suspect you never even suffered a verbal indignity from an American in the aftermath of 9-11 (though of course I could be wrong). The remarkable restraint shown by Americans during the period says a lot about the level of tolerance here, don't you think? I do find it interesting that after every Muslim terror attack in the USA (and there have been dozens over the last 30 years), all we ever hear from Muslim-Americans is the knee-jerk attempt to disassociate Islam from the attacks....and then the inevitable fears of an anti-Muslim backlash that never seems to materialize. It's as if Muslims are portrayed as victims themselves after a Muslim terror atrocity. And never a word from Muslims about the need for some introspection within the Muslim community about why so many of their co-religionists are so often predisposed towards religiously-motivated violence.2) I appreciate your acknowledgement that mosques and Muslim associations in the USA are typically oriented towards extremism. This is a remarkable admission. But your main concern seems to be not wanting non-Muslims to associate you with such....instead of trying to quell said extremism from within your own community. Perhaps you refrain from such efforts because you are indeed frightened of the extremists. But this only validates the concerns of non-Muslims like myself who believe that Islam is inherently violent and intolerant, that the canonical texts (Quran, Hadith, &amp; Sira) are the source of Islamic extremism....and because of that, it is not a phenomenon that will dissipate over time.","title":"Imam who refused to call Hezbollah a terrorist organization scheduled to deliver a benediction at Trumps inauguration"},{"text":"Im glad you were able to see the light and come to your own conclusions.

Their approach seems to be blaming minorities, which isnt a solution, its a distraction. Sure, people romanticize the past and talk about low crime or better family dynamics, but they often ignore how those conditions came at the expense of marginalized communities. Its not enough to cherry-pick the good while pretending the bad didnt exist. And lets be honest, crime isnt caused by minorities; its tied to systemic issues like poverty and lack of resources, which politicians from both parties have failed to address effectively.Now, you mentioned that Republicans shop at small businesses and tip better. Thats fine, but it doesnt mean theyre prioritizing small businesses at a policy level. The GOP still caters heavily to big corporations through tax cuts and deregulation, leaving small businesses to fend for themselves. The real focus should be on creating a system that empowers workers and entrepreneurs, regardless of party lines.As for unions, I get that not everyone loves them, but theyve played a crucial role in protecting workers rights and ensuring fair pay. States like Illinois may require union participation, but thats because unions were built to prevent exploitation. If we want workers to have true freedom, we should be strengthening protections, not weakening them.The Industrial Revolution wasnt perfect, and youre right that it came with pollution and crime. But the bigger picture is that it also created opportunities for upward mobility, at least for some. The problem is that mobility has historically excluded people of color. Oprah, as successful as she is, is an outlier. Most Black Americans havent had access to the same opportunities, and its disingenuous to hold her up as proof that the system works. Americas class mobility has always been easier for white people, and thats a fact.When you talk about working across the aisle, I agree its harder now because both parties have become so polarized. But that doesnt mean we should give up on cooperation altogether. Inflation and the cost of living are bipartisan issues. Republicans love to blame Democrats for printing money, but lets not forget that both parties have added to the national debt. Democrats, on the other hand, need to stop taxing working-class people into the ground and focus on policies that grow the economy without making it harder to get by. Neither party is blameless, and thats why we need leaders who genuinely care about people, not just their donors.As for Trump, I stand by what I said. His promises are empty. Sure, 49.9 percent of people saw him as qualified, but that doesnt mean hes the best choice. A lot of people voted for him because they felt the Democratic Party offered no real alternative, not because they truly believed in his leadership. Hes more of a showman than a leader, and his actions often reveal that hes more interested in maintaining power than serving the people.Ultimately, we, the people, need to hold both parties accountable. This constant finger-pointing only fuels the divide while the real issues, like inflation, poverty, and systemic inequality, go unaddressed. Supporting this broken system without demanding better is only encouraging our own demise. Its time we all take a step back, stop treating politics like a gang war, and focus on building an America that works for everyone.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":" realized everyone in this situation would choose the same thing.I wouldn't.

Our family became extremely secretive about where we immigrated from. Mind you, we as a family are secular and we didnt practice Islam or were religious in any way. Even then we didnt want to be associated with the Muslim community or the Turkish community out of fear. Many in our Turkish community who are secular or moderate Muslims felt the same way and went inti sort of hibernation out of fear.?I am assuming there are people who didnt attend because they were afraid to be associated with a gathering like that, especially moderates who are skittish to began with. Most moderate Muslims I know dont go around announcing it, they have been through a lot for being moderate in a Muslim country and escaped to US.?I cant speak for the Muslim community at large obviously. In general the moderates and seculars know to stay away from Mosques and Muslim communities because like you said, they are extremists and there is a little of association for radicalization and terrorist organizations. ?Moderates dont want to organize in big groups either because that means being known as a Muslim and you can easily be grouped with the extremists.?Much like secret conservatives, who are scared of admitting they voted for Trump or are republicans who live in extremely blue states.?So its not that they dont exists, it is that they dont feel comfortable to be in the front lines.

Never did he believe there was fraud. His actions were intentionally done to deceive his supporters and to gain the presidency by cheating and by force. If our policies are too unpopular, create a culture war to distract. If not enough people are fooled by the culture war, then cheat.  If cheating doesn't work, start an insurrection. ~ Republican Party Strategy for winning the White HouseMost of those eager Trump backers were told, Smith wrote, that they were signing up to act as fail-safe electors in the case that litigation by Trumps team was successful.Instead, Trump and his allies pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to certify a list of fraudulent electorswhich he?refused?to do...\\nIf I knew what I knew now, I wouldnt have done it, he said. It was kept from us that there was this alternate scheme, alternate motive.The special prosecutor made clear his view that the ultimate responsibility for the fake electors plot rests with Trump, who set the plan in motion and ensured that it was carried out by co-conspirators and Campaign agents in the targeted states, and monitored its progress.He also determined that Trump never believeddespite his public and private lies to the contrarythat he had won the 2020 election, and cynically chose to leverage the violence that broke out during the Jan. 6 insurrection because it was beneficial to his plan to his plan to interfere with the certification.Mr. Trump knew that there was no outcome-determinative fraud in the 2020 election, that many of the specific claims he made were untrue, and that he had lost the election, Smith wrote, citing multiple sources.Smith concluded that the evidence his office collected would have been sufficient to obtain a conviction of Trump at trial, but his election to a second term in the White House rendered it a moot issue.Whether through his lying to his supporters or to the American public, Smith emphasized that dishonesty was the one consistent hallmark of Trumps actions during the fake electors plot and the Capitol riot.The throughline of all of Mr. Trumps criminal efforts was deceit knowingly false claims of election fraudand the evidence shows that Mr. Trump used these lies as a weapon to defeat a federal government function foundational to the United States democratic process, he wrote.https://archive.is/JHlJh","title":"Lying Trump Took His Own Supporters for Fools: Jack Smith"},{"text":"Totally missing the point. ?","title":"House GOP speaker orders Capitol flags to fly at full-staff at Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"It encourages cheating to the highest level.

They are all in it together. Trump is just accidentally showing everyone, by being a loud mouth narcissist, that the entire thing is that swamp he once talked about so disparagingly. Instead of draining that swamp, Trump discovered its the ultimate con, and everybodys in on it  so hes in, too! Everything he has done (mostly not done except talk) has made this glaringly obvious. Look at the incredible, sustained, high-ratings drama that has unfolded in Washington since 2015.Republicans and Democrats all like the status quo weve been floating in since at least the 70s because it is far more profitable for all of them than actually making things right. This is the USA. A nation born of and built on profit, competition, and racism. Congress just realized a while ago that they can follow those virtues without caring about constituents.

But in a corrupted city this institution grew to be most mischievous. For it was no longer those of greatest worth, but those who had most influence, who sought the magistracies; while all who were without influence, however deserving, refrained through fear. This untoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar results, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and reducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became perfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer to have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and the weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the consulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting for the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those who knew best how to vanquish their enemies. **And afterwards, instead of selecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had most influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their institutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.**\\"Machiavelli, Niccol.

Were on the brink of a proposal that I laid out months ago finally coming to fruition, Joe Biden said in a valedictory speech Monday night.But Biden will not be the president credited with the deal if it is struck at last after 15 months of horror. Sources on all sides point to the influence of the incoming Trump operation as key to reviving dormant negotiations.Israeli officials briefed newspapers that Donald Trumps incoming envoy to the Middle East, Steven Withkoff, has applied pressure to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the compromises necessary to secure a deal.The draft agreements being circulated suggest the Israeli leader did finally bend. Terms include a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and several phases of ceasefire leading to an end of the war C conditions that Netanyahu had sworn to resist.Trump also applied pressure to Hamas and its allies by threatening there would be hell to pay if Israeli hostages were not returned by his inauguration on 20 January.Some analysts suggest this was a hollow threat given that Gaza has already been largely destroyed by 15 months of bombing. But Hamas claims to have made new concessions for the sake of a deal, while maintaining the position that Israeli hostages in Gaza would only be released in return for a full ceasefire.Qatari mediators, asked what had changed to make a deal possible, pointed to the influence of Trump officials.Israels ultra-nationalist right, which has nurtured hopes of permanent occupation and settlement of Gaza, is describing the agreement as a betrayal by Trump, who showered Netanyahu with gifts in his first term C from moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, to recognising Israels annexation of Syrias Golan Heights C and was expected to do so again.It could be that we are the first to pay a price for Trump, said Israeli journalist and Netanyahu ally Erel Segal, adding that he expected the new president to allow Israel to retain control of north Gaza and restrict humanitarian aid.Hard-right former Israeli security official Yuval Malka urged the government to create facts on the ground before Trump takes office.There may yet be sweeteners for the Israeli right and poison pills for the Palestinians. The Trump administration could reportedly green-light new Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank C illegal under international law C or even full annexation of the territory, as a form of compensation.But any kind of ceasefire at the dawn of Trumps second term would mark a sharp contrast with more than a year of failure to secure a deal under Biden, whose top diplomat, Antony Blinken, made more than a dozen trips to the region and a series of optimistic predictions only to return empty-handed each time.Read more here: [https://inews.co.uk/news/world/donald-trump-factor-gaza-israel-ceasefire-joe-biden-failures-3480316](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/donald-trump-factor-gaza-israel-ceasefire-joe-biden-failures-3480316)","title":"Trump factor could drag Gaza ceasefire over the line, and expose Biden failures"},{"text":"His wife said he's not likely to last long at anything..?","title":"Marco Rubio Isnt Likely to Last Long as Secretary of State"},{"text":"damn. not suprised","title":"Biden Trump-proofs $74bn in climate funding but $20bn remains vulnerable"},{"text":"https://smartelections.substack.com/p/so-clean?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=3uqv1m&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=emailJust some journalism about the elections.

These companies are expecting and preparing for??windfall. Right now, the Federal Government Budgets roughly $3-Billion Dollars a year to maintain Private Detention Centers. [Biden extended the Federal Government Private Detention Center contracts in early December 2024.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/biden-immigration-detention-centers-inhumane-conditions)These private facilities are (usually) run separately from the civilian prison system for American. The Federal Government pays for the beds in the detention centers whether we fill them up or not. If this plan is true, then youll see the need for planning to build *a lot* more beds and private detention facilities.[As per Forbes, on January 12, 2025:](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellembekeani/2025/01/12/will-mass-deportation-be-a-moneymaker-for-private-prisons/)\\n**Undocumented migrants are estimated to account for approximately 3.3% of the US population.** According to a special report from the [American Immigration Council](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation), deporting this population in mass is **estimated to cost at least $967.9 billion** if executed over ten years at a rate of 1 million undocumented migrants per year. **However, Congress only allotted ICE sufficient funding to detain 41,500 people at any given time in its fiscal year 2024 budget.** To cut the capacity gap between the current bed availability in ICE detention centers and the minimum capacity necessary to detain 13.3 million undocumented migrants, **it is estimated that ICE will need to construct an additional 216 new facilities per year for a decade, with each facility having the capacity for 500 beds.**While camps are possible, as we saw children being detained on their own in odd warehouses in the last Trump Presidency; theyre not as profitable long term for contractors. Given how this works, its possibly more likely we will see a massive extraction of money handed off to private contractors who will divert American funds and resources to build new private detention facilities. **The aims of this will primarily be to funnel billions of dollars to private detention companies.** In the end, if the contracts remain the same, *the detention centers will get paid whether they fill the beds or not.*If you care about humanity more here, you might take mild comfort in knowing theyre most likely to gouge the US budget first to build the centers they need. That will provide hopefully some cushion of time for when or if they actually try to round up 13.3 million people at once. (Assuming thats possible. The departments seem skeptical that theyll be able to do this physically as they dont currently have near the man power required.)\\nBonus [American Immigration Council](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation)s report also states, mass deportation at once would be economically impactful: Beyond the direct financial cost of mass deportation, we also estimated the impact on the U.S. economy. Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, **we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 4.2 to 6.8 percent.** It would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the U.S. government. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. Undocumented immigrants also contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare.","title":"Will Trump Actually Deport Millions?"},{"text":"Because the National Media told them to.

One Bush official finally conceded in a telling response (anonymously of course): \\"We can't find any moderates\\".He obviously wasn't referring to Muslims in general....just to those who claim to speak for the Muslim community.PS - I travelled quite a distance to attend a moderate Muslim march on the mall in Washington DC about a decade and a half ago. It was designed to celebrate Muslim patriotism and to publicly repudiate the message of Islamic radicals. I swear folks, there was a big stage, a large PA system, there were about a dozen organizers/speakers, a dozen members of the media, and virtually no one else in attendance. The media began pressing the organizers to begin the rally, but one of the speakers said over the PA that they were waiting because \\"there are still busloads of Muslims from all over the country on their way to attend\\".The organizers finally relented and the rally began. The busloads never came. The \\"crowd\\" consisted of 10 to 12 people, mostly individual passersby...just stopping momentarily out of curiosity and then moving on. That was the day I shed all my illusions about \\"the tiny minority of extremists\\" meme regarding Muslims. Not saying for a minute that most Muslims are terrorists, but there is a reason it's so hard to find moderate Muslim leaders to officiate public ceremonies like the Trump inauguration...and that reason is: There is no real constituency in the Muslim community for truly moderate leaders....which is why those leaders don't exist.

There are a couple aspects.1. It often means that the local government will not report a non-criminal who is here illegally to ICE for deportation.  This allows for the migrant to feel safe in interacting with the police when something is wrong or they want to report some other sort of criminal activity.  Let's say a female illegal immigrant is abused by a citizen.  If she reports that, some cities might report her to immigration where she might be deported, despite the fact that she was the victim of a crime.  So, she is more likely to not report the criminal activity and may continue to be a victim of that abuse.  It could also cause the situation to escalate for her to take some sort of justice into her own hands.  So, having these \\"sanctuary city,\\" policies where the police are not going to report the person to ICE in a situation such as the hypo proposed, allows that person to feel safe in reporting crimes and encourages them to do so.2. Another thing it often means is that the sanctuary city will not comply with ICE holds in certain sitautions.  The way things currently work is that if a person who is not here legally is arrested for a crime then the local government informs ICE of that person's illegal status.  ICE will then often tell the city to hold that person so that ICE can come get them.  The problem there is that the city's legal right to hold a person might end before ICE picks them up.  Continuing to hold that person would violate their constitutional right (and yes, even an illegal immigrant has a constitutional right to due process).  So, the sanctuary city basically says that they will not comply with an ICE hold and violate the constitution in doing so.  If ICE gets to the person prior to the person's sentence ending then they can take custody, but the city isn't going to unconstititionally hold a person indefinitely while they wait on ICE.So, in reality these sanctuary cities aren't really as bad as the right might lead you to believe.  They are protecting the rights of guaranteed all persons in the US and are trying to ensure that people are safer by promising that they won't deport people for merely reporting criminal activity.","title":"Trump on fascinating Fetterman meeting: Hes just a commonsense person"},{"text":"brother i asked because i was in a hurry, asking a question is a thing bro","title":"Biden Trump-proofs $74bn in climate funding but $20bn remains vulnerable"},{"text":"We should all send him bottles of booze to test that theory.

The aides politely explained that was in the middle of the Sabbath but that the prime minister would gladly meet him Saturday night. Witkoff's blunt reaction took them by surprise. He explained to them in salty English that Shabbat was of no interest to him. His message was loud and clear. Thus in an unusual departure from official practice, the prime minister showed up at his office for an official meeting with Witkoff, who then returned to Qatar to seal the deal. In fact, **Witkoff has forced Israel to accept a plan that Netanyahu had repeatedly rejected over the past half year**. Hamas has not budged from its position that the hostages' freedom must be conditioned on the release of Palestinian prisoners (the easy part) and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza (the hard one).

The outcome of the election is independent of how this process *should* have been pursued with gusto and celerity....he wanted to rebuild up the trust in governmental institutions...This is the other point that both Biden and Garland use to defend themselves; the proceedings of justice for J-6th (and the classified documents fiasco) needed to be seen as apolitical and without a shred of emotion, lest it be seen as political retribution.&amp;nbsp;This \\"go high\\" approach was completely undermined by the partisan propaganda being spewed for *four years* as the investigations churned. The appearance and actual apolitical approach is the correct one, but taking pains to project this only made the process more laborious, and thus we land on Garland's sin of Delay once again. I'm not saying that the partisan climate in politics and propaganda is to blame, that's an external factor that ought to be ignored. On the contrary, the DoJ should have proceeded with haste regardless of political appearance, as that is what acting apolitically entails. Garland's DoJ (and others like judge Merchan at one point) gave far too much weight to appearance and the potential ramifications of justice deliveredall undermined by the ever-churning partisan propaganda machines we're all accustomed to. If justice could not be pursued purely in a vacuum, then this tone deafness is indefensible considering the political environment they so dearly tried to navigate.&amp;nbsp;Suffice to say that the current outcome, the full death of justice, was reached because the judicial philosophies of Garland's DoJ were flimsy at best and completely at fault, especially with this much at risk.","title":"Special Counsel Report Says Trump Would Have Been Convicted in Election Case"},{"text":"Coach would have put me in fourth quarter, we would've been state champions.?No doubt - Uncle Rico","title":"Jack Smith insists Trump WOULD have been convicted of election interference in bombshell report"},{"text":"Not only does that post ignore the fact that FEMA can only initially issue $770 initially it also does another disinformation trick which is comparing two numbers that represent different populations.

We need to get rid of this fantasy that women havent worked. It reeks of middle class pretension and at this point this idea is primarily driven by the aspirant middle class to emulate their betters.Women want to work and in some cases must work. Thats ok. If hey dont want to work there are plenty of families who already make that work to.

But Trump did not like that answer so he sought out the crackerjack team of attorneys who told Trump what he wanted to hear.This crackerjack team of attorneys included:Rudy Giuliani, who has now been disbarred;Sydney Powell, pleaded guilty to 6 counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with the performance of election duties;Jenna Ellison, who was convicted of a felony for her efforts to overturn the 2020 election;John Eastman, who drafted the coup memo. White House lawyer Eric Herschmann testified that after the January 6 attack, he told Eastman, I only want to hear two words coming out of your mouth, orderly transition. Get a great fucking criminal attorney. Youre going to need it.; andJeffrey Clark who tried to convince Trump to appoint him as acting Attorney General to aid in Trumps efforts to overturn the election.Trumps efforts to overturn the election was not a one time effort. It started with Trump priming the pumps, months before the 2020 election, with Trumps lies about a stolen election.After the December 18 meeting with the team of conspiracy theorists and months of lying to his followers about a stolen election, Trump tweeted out to his thousands of followers, Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!But before this tweet, there were multiple efforts by Trump and those surrounding him to try and stop the peaceful transition of power. This included Trumps pressure campaign on state officials to overturn the election. With the most well known effort being Trumps call on January 2, 2021 to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find 11,780 votes and overturn the states election results. Raffensperger Refused.Then there was the coordinated effort with Republican officials in several states, better known as, the fake electors plot. This was the plot to submit false certificates claiming Trump had won the Electoral College vote in certain states. Dozens of Republican state officials and Trump officials have been indicted as part of the fake elector plot.And of course, there was Trumps pressure on Vice President Mike Pence who refused to go along with Trumps efforts to stop the 2020 election. After railing against Pence during his January 6 speech, his followers erected a gallows and yelled, Hang Mike Pence! Pence stayed and certified the 2020 election, putting a death knell in Trumps multiple efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Trumps incoherent response said in all caps, VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN!!! Yes, the voters, minus about 89 million American voters who did not vote, elected a convicted felon, fraud, and insurrectionist to the Oval Office. This is a disgraceful part of American history, and I believe this president will be judged brutally. As Liz Cheney testified at the January 6 hearings, long after Trump is gone, Republicans dishonor will remain.","title":"Trump pushes incoherent response to Jack Smiths report on election case"},{"text":"Dude.

On one hand, proponents argue that bolstering military spending is essential to addressing rising global threats (China, Russia, and unstable regions) and maintaining technological superiority. On the other, critics see this as a runaway train of spending that prioritizes defense over pressing domestic needs like healthcare, education, or infrastructure. Heres the thing: **is the 4% of GDP target justifiable?** The U.S. already spends more on defense than the next 10+ countries combined. Are we approaching a point of diminishing returns, or is this necessary to ensure readiness for modern conflicts like cyberwarfare and space? Also, lets not ignore how this proposal might exacerbate internal GOP tensions. Some factions are laser-focused on cutting government spending across the board. Convincing those members to back this increase will be a monumental challenge, and could lead to even more dysfunction in an already gridlocked Congress. Whats most concerning is how little attention is being paid to accountability. Programs like the F-35 continue to balloon in cost with underwhelming results. If were writing trillion-dollar checks, wheres the transparency on how that money is spent? A friend in the defense industry once joked that the Pentagons motto could be More money, more problems, and honestly, that tracks.At the end of the day, investing in national security is important, but its hard to ignore the opportunity cost.

I think that was a top priority for him. Hence Garland. The mistake I think that was made, was that at the time Trumps rise to power was seen as a one off. After January 6th many people could never image Trump ever coming to power again - the storming of the capital was just too big. I think in Garlands mind the DoJ there was no clock ticking and going after a former president had to be done meticulously and carefully so as not to seem partisan (you go after the king you better not miss).From our vantage point now the DoJ clearly messed things and Garlands approach proved to be wrong but that is with the benefit of hindsight.
