The return of tariffs might sound like a tough-guy strategy on the surface, but it's just another clumsy, short-sighted move that puts working families directly in the crosshairs.Tariffs aren't just some abstract penalty for foreign companiesthey're a tax on goods coming into the country, which means higher prices for you and me. Need a new phone? A new car? Groceries? Get ready to pay more for all of it. And for what? To \\"punish\\" China? To \\"bring back jobs\\"? The truth is, history shows tariffs rarely deliver on those promises. What they do instead is throw a wrench into global supply chains, squeeze American manufacturers who rely on imported parts, and make life more expensive for regular folks trying to make ends meet.Meanwhile, the oligarchs will profit off our losses, as they always do. Theyve gamed the system so thoroughly that theyre positioned to rake in billions even when the market tanks. Theyll short stocks, invest in hedge funds that bet on economic instability, and walk away richer than ever while the rest of us deal with higher prices, job cuts, and foreclosures. For them, chaos isnt a riskits an opportunity.Morgan Stanley is already forecasting slower growth, but the real pain won't just be in GDP numbersit'll be in the wallets of everyday Americans. Wealthy elites wont notice the price hikes; theyre too busy buying their second yachts or cashing in on bets against the system they helped rig. Its the rest of usstudents, workers, single parentswholl feel the pinch.Whats worse is that tariffs arent even a real plantheyre a soundbite. A distraction. They dont solve the deeper economic problems we face, like stagnating wages, unaffordable housing, or the corporate consolidation thats strangling competition and innovation. Tariffs are just a blunt instrument used to play populist theater, and were all stuck paying the price for this performance.We deserve real solutionsinvestments in green industries, expanded worker protections, a fairer tax systemnot these half-baked policies that only deepen economic inequality and pave the way for the next recession. Meanwhile, the billionaires will keep profiting no matter how bad it gets for the rest of us.

The Nov. 14 dinner came midway through the organizations three-day National Lawyers Convention, a gathering of nearly 2,000 conservative and libertarian judges, academics, lawyers, and law students. In the wake of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republicans tripartite sweep of the White House and Congress, it was a time not only for celebration, but to preen.The Federalist Society, the conservative lawyers network, likes to maintain a public veneer of open debate, and retired liberal Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer was seated beside Gorsuch on the stage. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett looked on from the audience.Gorsuch used the opportunity to launch into an unexpected riff about the late MAGA internet icon Peanut the squirrel and the porn-heavy subscription website, OnlyFans, where Peanuts dad is a model.You might have seen \\\\[a story\\\\] in the newspaper, if the newspapers are to be believed, yes, Im speaking of Peanut the squirrel, Gorsuch said. Referencing OnlyFans  or Just for Fans, as he put it  Gorsuch added with a grin: My law clerks tell me that theres maybe a sordid side. I dont know the details. Im not aware of any allegation that Peanut was involved in any of those actions.The audience needed little help picking up on the jokes, which had previously been largely confined to right-wing media outlets and conservative corners of the internet, responding with applause, hoots, and knowing laughter. Dressed in gowns, tuxedos, and related finery, they seemed a bit at odds with their surroundings in a large ballroom in the windowless bowels of the Hilton Hotel, known colloquially as the Hinckley Hilton ever since John Hinckley shot Ronald Reagan there.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/federalist-society-judges-lawyers-agenda-trump-1235173415/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/federalist-society-judges-lawyers-agenda-trump-1235173415/)","title":"Conservative Judges and Lawyers Detail Their Deregulatory Agenda After Trump Win"},{"text":"Imagine considering Breitbart a serious website.","title":"All Trump Nominees on 'Solid Political Ground' for Confirmation"},{"text":"Poison here, poison there we even put poison in your Water and Air.

In the corporate world one usually is incentivized to spend as little as possible, yet achieve more than the stated requirements, we do more with less. Our government is ripe with overspending, a lack of accounting and accountability.  Outright fraud is rampant.  Employees who shouldnt have a job because they suck, positions that shouldnt exist because theyre made up or redundant.  Entire departments and even entire agencies that do absolutely nothing but make up work.  Many government agencies are incentivized to institute, new rules, and regulations, and enforce them, just to justify their existence.  Corrupt and just asinine purchasing practices.

Its not a cabinet; its a gang of enablers and opportunists, chosen to dismantle the very institutions theyre supposed to lead.Whats particularly alarming is how openly these appointments signal contempt for the American people. Picking unregistered foreign agents, climate deniers, and corporate stooges isnt accidentalits deliberate. Trump isnt even pretending these picks will serve the public interest. Theyre here to serve his interests, consolidate power, and roll back decades of progress in civil rights, environmental protections, and economic fairness.This is authoritarianism 101. You dont need stormtroopers in the streets to undermine democracy. You just need to pack key institutions with loyalists who are willing to gut them from the inside. Trumps administration isnt shaping up to govern; its gearing up to wage war on accountability, fairness, and the very idea of a government that works for its people.Whats at stake here isnt just the next four yearsits the foundation of what democracy even means.

In 2024, they went for Harris 53-45. For younger women aged 18-29, they were +18 points for Harris. Compared to 6 years ago, when they were +33 points for Democrats. It is not just men who shifted towards Trump/the right in general. I also think, in regard to the main premise of your argument, Harris couldve done more to reach out to men, but it didnt need to be inherently a mens rights thing. For example, when we look at abortion, an issue which the Harris campaign ran on- its not necessarily a losing issue, but they didnt do enough to reach out to men and explain why it hurts them too. All men heard was why women not having access to an abortion was bad for women, but not why it was bad for them too. Particularly for younger, single men, the Harris campaign shouldve made the point, if you get with someone and they accidentally get pregnant with YOUR baby you didnt want, then YOU will have to pay child support and you may not be in a place to financially support this baby.It obviously goes beyond just abortion, and Im not saying that this ultimately wouldve made a difference. But it couldve helped. They couldve emphasized their housing plan as well to younger men who feel like theyre getting screwed not being able to afford a house. But my point is that these things arent mens rights issues. Theyre issues that affect everyone. Again, I dont know if this wouldve made a difference, as many people tend to just vote on the economy anyway, but I think ultimately the Harris campaign just didnt do enough to get their points across on issues that affect everyone. Which is again, part of the reason why BOTH men and women shifted towards Trump.","title":"CMV: If the script was flipped and it was mens rights being fought for then Kamala wouldve won."},{"text":"This is how it supposed to always be, we stand for the truth and what is right","title":"Nancy Mace: Based..."},{"text":"It's true you can't know for sure whether or not this is just satire or an actual pick for cabinet members.

Not only will deporting 20M illegal immigrants be expensive (estimated $88B for 1M, well over $1T), but it will decimate the US labor force and supply chain, driving inflation higher. The initial estimate on GDP retraction is 8% (the financial crisis in 2008, GDP retracted 4%).\\n2.\\t?Tariffs, they dont work like Trump described, China pays nothing, the US company importing the goods pays the tariff to the federal government, that cost gets passed to the consumer (you and me!). This means nearly everything costs more, inflation goes up, initial estimates are a 2% GDP retraction. Then there is the trade war that will follow, the retaliatory tariffs by those countries. Trumps trade war in his last term decimated American farmers and we had to bail them out to the tune of $62B. Countries will retaliate with tariffs on American imports, decimating our economy further, mass layoffs, etc.\\n3.\\t?More tax cuts, favoring the rich and corporations. More trickle down BS and more debt, because Trump never cuts spending, but this just makes things so much worse due to 1 and 2, huge deficit spending. This leads to austerity, huge cuts to social programs right when Americans will need them the most.\\n4.\\t?Inverted yield curve (when short term bonds have higher interest rates than long term bonds). The curve just normalized after being inverted for nearly 2 years. This has been an indicator for recessions historically for the past 80 years. This alone means we will likely have a bad recession in 2025. Unfortunately, with everything else outlined above, this recession will be the worst in my lifetime, probably turns into a Great Depression, because Trump does not know what he is doing. It is possible the federal government goes bankrupt, as last fiscal year, we spent $1T just on interest on our debt and the debt will continue to skyrocket under Trump and inflation will be so high, interest rates will skyrocket as well. It will be a snowball effect that takes out 90% of Americans. So bankruptcy or corporations and the rich bail us out and we become a corporatocracy.So get ready, it is going to be terrible and Trump and the GOP will blame the Democrats.","title":"Trump tariffs to push down U.S. growth a great deal going into 2026, Morgan Stanley warns"},{"text":"I appreciate what you do.

Amusingly, I get/hear similar arguments from lawyers. It's surprising how easily they'll throw the legal system and their own profession under the bus, all the way up to SCOTUS with various immunities. France has a very high-profile sex abuse case and they've been able to protect the identities of the alleged perpetrators secret. At least from my understanding, I don't want to Bing that at work. I'm not a big fan of our legal system, but I don't think it's *that bad*. Various non-disclosure agreements or closed court hearings seem to work okay, so not sure why a DUI arrest couldn't be hidden for a few days at least.Like everything else there is no perfect system and it all requires trade offs, and as a general ruleobviously subject to specific circumstances that contravene the ruleI would lean towards more transparency rather than less, largely because having things be secretive gives the secret keepers a potent weapon that history has shown they really cant be trusted with.For sure, but I do think these sorts of fears can turn into paranoia. If police departments didn't make everything public Mugshotz magazine couldn't exist; if they tried, they'd get obliterated from lawsuits over time. Keeping mugshots out of public domain would prevent a lot of online scams, even if they would be erroneously released from time to time.It's still a kind of, hmm, values(?) judgment.

Hes invested quite a lot, but money doesnt mean that much when you are already the worlds richest man. What matters most to him (imo) is making breakthroughs. I feel like his judgement is not the best and he may think that the ends justify the means, which I personally do not think is the case when it comes to peoples lives.","title":"Texas offers Starr County ranch to Trump for mass deportation plans"},{"text":"Yeah, even just choosing exactly what to look into or ask, especially without context, can drastically change how something looks when it is just released to the public.","title":"CMV: all government ethics investigations should always be public"},{"text":"Actually if we got women out of their unnatural roles in the workforce and put them back in their traditional roles of homemaker, this would cut the workforce in half, which would mean that male workers would literally make twice what they make now!

Which I suppose is a decent argument for keeping everything out in the open: you cant leak the fact that your political enemy was arrested if his arrest, along with everyone elses, is public record already. Like everything else there is no perfect system and it all requires trade offs, and as a general ruleobviously subject to specific circumstances that contravene the ruleI would lean towards more transparency rather than less, largely because having things be secretive gives the secret keepers a potent weapon that history has shown they really cant be trusted with.","title":"CMV: all government ethics investigations should always be public"},{"text":"Agricultural tariffs will hit basically immediately when implemented. ~30% of food consumed in the United States is stuff that *can't* be produced at scale here because we don't have the right climate.","title":"Trump tariffs to push down U.S. growth a great deal going into 2026, Morgan Stanley warns"},{"text":"I think anxiety war is acceptable from what i remember, its been years since ive watched his videos.

I work for the cafeteria department in the nutrition group kitchens. We try to come up with recipes that taste good meet the nutrition guidelines but also have ingredients that can be sourced locally. We work for several schools in 3 states so that can be a task. Our company and the schools eat several costs so that EVERY student can eat lunch. In PA (where I am most of the time) has free breakfasts which leaves us room to not only give PA kids better quality meals for lunch we can do so in the states that don't offer it. These types of programs help everyone but mostly the students. It's proven that children learn and retain the information much faster and longer when they have full bellies of nutritious food. Things like that program are just 1 example of what's going to get cut. I know for a fact free lunches are off the table now and I'm worried about the breakfast program being cut after Trump regime gets their hands on it.

Its all easily searchable. The White House interview too. It was all laid out. She just didnt have a good campaign.She didn't have a good campaign because her plan for the economy was essentially \\"keep on keepin' on,\\" and people aren't satisfied with the status quo. Economists don't matter for how most people vote. If they're feeling burned by the current economy, no amount of data telling them they're wrong to feel that way is going to change their mind. I don't necessarily think Trump's plans are going to work out better, but he validated people's feelings about their economic situation and promised to do something about it. ask anyones Trump plans and theyre silentNot really. Trump has been quite clear about two points that will have a significant impact on jobs: Migration and tariffs. People perceive that migration is putting downward pressure on wages, and that cheap goods from other countries are making it impossible to manufacture competitively in the US. Mass deportations and closing the border will reduce the labor force, increasing demand for domestic labor, and probably increase wages. Tariffs will raise the price of foreign goods, making it easier for domestic manufacturers to compete since the tariffs won't be paid on domestically manufactured goods. Both of these points will increase wages. People see that and think Trump has their back, so they vote for him.Now, a big part of the reason I don't think Trump's plans are really going to work out better is that while yes, wages will likely increase, so will the prices of goods and services, and I think it's very likely that the increased prices of goods and services will outpace the wage increases. But while I don't think his solutions will be effective, most people stop at the fact that he's offering solutions that sound compelling at first glance, and Kamala wasn't even offering that.","title":"CMV: If the script was flipped and it was mens rights being fought for then Kamala wouldve won."},{"text":"Hed be too old","title":"If there was a loophole for Trump to run again in 2028 would you vote for him?"},{"text":"*Will, not may*; retailers will raise prices to see whats tolerated and then use that as the new pricing baseline.","title":"These retailers may raise prices if Trump's tariffs take effect"},{"text":"Dont let your children anywhere near the White House","title":"Trump Picks Linda McMahon, Named in 'Ring Boy' Sex Abuse Case, to Run Education Dept."},{"text":"The senate has generally been decent at confirming judges during the Biden admin.

In the state of California if you have a child with disability the waiting list to get help is zero.

In the state of Texas this list is thousands and thousands long. The waiting time is on average 13 years. This means that when these parents hit the age where they can no longer care for their child its too late. But the republicans and the state of Texas doesnt care, why should they? Its not their children right? Its just their neighbors, their friends, their families and their community. Are there people who abuse these systems?

Saying \\"everything was fine\\" isn't popular in our media environment.You may be right in this scenario, perhaps keeping investigations secret is *practically* impossible due to various powers available to members of Congress. Whether it *ought* to be that way I think is still worth considering.Now I dont think its super cut and dried, nor do I believe the difference between full exposure and secrecy is huge, but even if we call it a wash in terms of its affect, I would come down in favor of transparency.I'll provide another example that's generally more serious, public criminal indictments.In the US, the mere existence of an arrest can destroy someone's life. Mugshots, names and charges are public information. \\"Innocent until proven guilty\\" is a legal fiction, simply legal puffery. Amusingly, Trump supporters called his indictments \\"defamation\\", and even though I disagree in those particular cases, there are certainly prosecutions that essentially are abusive and defamatory.Given the nature of the US criminal system, there's no possibility for someone to exonerate themselves outside of a trial. These are extremely expensive, can lead to long pre-trial detentions, risk extremely long sentences and might be impossible if a case is dropped. This could be avoided if charges and arrests were not public information. Given there's no particular reason to publicize *every arrest regardless of circumstance*, and prosecutors/law enforcement aren't exactly trustworthy, this is a situation where greater transparency does more harm than good.","title":"CMV: all government ethics investigations should always be public"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/05iw77svq22e1.png?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e6477400c0284005e3398aa408245b706b31d0cSomeone has mommy issues.,....","title":"Imagine willingly being Trumps Chief of Staff"},{"text":"Don't forget about all those other women who came up to make accusations against him, and him kissing that same coworker","title":"Republican who won county seat pleads guilty to sexual assault of daughter"},{"text":"National divorce sounds so unreal lol","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene calls for national divorce from Trump critics"},{"text":"my biggest worry is when do they strip blue states of their rights. its going to be wild","title":"Trump Picks Linda McMahon, Named in WWE Abuse Case, to Run Education Dept."},{"text":"The Chrinstopher Nolan Trilogy was the best in my personal opionion.","title":"Republican election mean better batman movies"},{"text":"An AI future will require communism.

Oops, looks like that magically got left out of the outrage bait headline...Also, you pretending that a blunt is an ounce and half is another stretch of the truth.Ill also point out the fact that what over 80% of incarcerated people are convicted of or plea to is a reduction of their actual offences or charges.Its incredibly common in the system to do that.  The guy doing 10 years for possession with intent to traffic?  Yeah he was also beating the shit out of multiple women he was exploiting plus a variety of his own and other street level dealers.  But forcing those victims to testify would be problematic and cruel to them, plus it becomes a trial of subjectivity.  A scumbag like that deserves prison time, and the more objective fact that hes a known drug dealer and was caught with large quantities of drugs and trafficking equipment makes for an easy, objectivity-based case, and the kind of sentence he actually deserves.  So instead of a trial which could put him away for 30 years, he strikes a deal for a lesser offence and 10.  Then a few years later along comes a naive Redditor who sees only the paper stat that this poor violent drug dealer and pimp is doing prison time for possession, but has zero awareness of the reality of that situation or the reality of how the justice system works.The fact is hes there because that was the charge that was easiest to prove and had a strong sentence, and it was the most just way of dealing with it given our system and society. If you actually care about this subject, go to law school then spend a few years in criminal court.  Youll never again spread myths about a sweet innocent guy who just smoked one blunt in the park doing prison time.  Ive seen probably thousands of these cases and never, ever, not once, did someone go straight to prison for such minor offences, and certainly not on their first time in court.

His party buddy, Joel Greenberg, is currently serving 11 years for sex trafficking. Perfect pick for AG. He is disliked by the majority of members of Congress on both sides already, so he is uniquely qualified to carry out Trump's campaign of retribution, while adding some names to the list of his own choosing for sure.Hegseth is a man-o-sphere loving gigga Chad. The type of guy that thinks women should be trad wives and LGBTQ people should stay hidden ... or worse.

He is on board with using the US military on US soil to enact mass deportations, so it seems likely that he will be fine using it the same way to crack down on any marches or protests that spring up. He was a FOX News weekend host, so of course he's qualified to manage the roughly 3 million federal and civilian employees at DOD.Gabbard has been a solid defender of Assad in Syria and supporter of Putin's talking points and misinformation since 2015 at least. Some in political circles have even gone as far as saying she is a Russian asset. Our foreign allies do not trust her judgement and will begin withholding intel from us, or giving us bad intel, almost immediately in an effort to protect themselves and their secrets.

Many of the more professional groups are run by intelligent people and they are responsible for a lot of convictions of dangerous predators, I think they do a good job. They're also very aware that sometimes the \\"predator\\" is in fact trying to set somebody else up and if they aren't certain they've got the right person they won't name them.In the UK, online hunters (referred to as decoys) must do the following for the evidence to be admissible in court:1. Not contact the person first or initiate any sexual conversation\\n2. Must state their age within the first few messages\\n3. Contact the policeEdit: Its not a rule, but of the professional groups I watch, they don't pose as 15 year olds. Their fake accounts are in the range of 11-14 years old (and they have no shortages of creeps messaging them)Some of the professional groups do video the predator and there is a reason for this - in the UK sentences for this stuff are abysmal and in many cases it takes 3-5 years before the predator goes to court.Some of the people they catch are awful - we're talking about grown men who have talked to the \\"child\\" for months, built up a friendship with them and then insisted the child meet them. Often they've also tried to manipulate them into sending pictures of themselves or doing physically harmful things to themselves.These people are dangerous and should be going to jail for a long time; instead they're put on bail for years, sometimes allowed to live in close proximity to other children and when convicted they get a community order or suspended sentence. That's it - that's all the punishment they get for trying to groom and lure a child to their house.Frankly if they kill themselves as the result of the videos being put online I don't care, in the UK sex work is legal and many of these people had the money to pay for it (not saying that's right but at least its a consenting adult and not a child) if they wanted.","title":"CMV: Pedo hunters/ Vigilantes are NOT doing the right thing"},{"text":"Demands.

This happened because the U.S. Constitution grants presidents almost unchecked power in regards to American foreign policy. While only the U.S. Congress has the authority to declare war, U.S. Presidents, starting with Washington, used their position to make executive agreements with agents of foreign governments. Also, over the last century, U.S. Presidents have made numerous commitments of American economic and military aid to nations without a formal, Senate ratified treaty. This was true for Israel, Eisenhower and Kennedy both had agreements with South Vietnam, Nixon went to China and Moscow, etc. In many cases, the Senate has fully approved of treaties that grant even more power to the presidency and to their foreign partners. In 1949, the Senate approved Truman's agreement to enter into the North American Treaty alliance (NATO). It may have taken over fifty years to expand it, but by 2005, for the first time in U.S. history, foreign troops from Mexico and Canada were deployed onto U.S. soil, after Hurricane Katrina. As early as 1964, the U.S. Congress was passing resolutions granting the U.S. President broad powers to \\"take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.\\" Known as the Tonkin resolution, the Congress deemed it to be: \\"Consonant with the Constitution and the Charter of the United Nations.\\" By 1992, both the outgoing and incoming U.S. Presidents \\"agreed\\" to adopt the United Nations sustainable development plan for Local Agenda 21 in the United States. Based on the chain of command, it's only natural that our people must all eventually endorse the global system of communitarian law. The UN Local Agenda 21 Programme for Development is an executive agreement endorsed by President Bush Sr. and Jr. and President Clinton. By 1993, every federal agency in the U.S. changed their mission to promote sustainable development principles, after our presidents agreed to adopt the UN plan. It doesn't matter that this new law and the new global system were not exactly approved by the U.S. Congress. Presidential executive agreements have been standard for so long the \\"great silences\\" in the Constitution slipped up and caught us in the rear. Besides, the Congress usually approves the necessary legislation to support the global market and the global police state. By the looks of things, free and independent nations that protect and defend the rights of their individuals are going extinct. If I only read what the communitarians write, I'd be sure it's all over but the crying. The law's in place; it should be easy. What's amazing to me (and maybe to them) about this new kind of global slavery is, America still makes the kind of men and women who can send it all right back where it came from, again.https://newswithviews.com/Raapana/niki6.htm","title":"The goal of NATO is to overthrow The United States"},{"text":"Interesting quote from the article shows they are brainwashed MAGAs?While Harris didnt support most of the positions raised in the poll, Trump was effective at getting swing voters to believe that she did.","title":"Swing voters went for Donald Trump because of trans rights issues, poll finds"},{"text":"The advantage of living in a red state is the schools will just cut services to account for that 15%.

U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, appointed by Trump in 2017 after serving as a Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, spoke during a hearing Tuesday where he reluctantly postponed a trial for riot defendant Edward Jake Lang until after Inauguration Day. Lang has pleaded not guilty to charges of beating police officers with a baseball bat during a lengthy assault at the Capitol. Blanket pardons for all January 6 defendants or anything close would be beyond frustrating and disappointing, but thats not my call, Nichols said according to a court transcript, repeating the sentiment twice for emphasis. Trump has repeatedly promised to pardon Capitol riot defendants without saying what criteria he would use. It remains unclear whether the president-elect would absolve hundreds who have been convicted of assaulting police, rioting, or using dangerous weapons, including 14 convicted of plotting political violence, such as leaders of the extremist Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups.","title":"U.S. judge appointed by Trump criticizes blanket pardons for Jan. 6"},{"text":"I didnt comment on who you were or were not talking about.

There's a confusing of terms that doesn't help.  Child sexual abuser =/= pedophile and pedophile =/= child sexual abuser.   That probably sounds backwards and tends to immediately get people's hackles up so I'll explain.For the first statement: studies of sexual offenders have shown that slightly less than half of them are in the clinical sense pedophiles.  They're not particularly attracted to children and would and do abuse adults if they could get away with it.   Children for them are just vulnerable targets of opportunity and the abuse is about power, not really sexual attraction.   A similar phenomenon occurs with abuse of elderly people in nursing homes or patients in long-term stay mental health facilities.  For the second statement: there is a large subset of clinical pedophiles (people who are actually exclusively attracted to children) who do not abuse or have any kind of sexual interaction with children because they understand that it's wrong.  We don't know how big this population is because who's going to admit to being a pedophile that *doesn't* abuse children (cough) but anonymous studies imply that it's anywhere from roughly half to a large majority.","title":"CMV: Pedo hunters/ Vigilantes are NOT doing the right thing"},{"text":"I clicked on every last one of these.

The actual reasons for this are highly multi-faceted and complex.The progressive sledgehammer response is to say that the classes are simply racist and thus should be canceled. The idea is that because advanced classes lead to better outcomes, and relatively few Black students take those classes, Black students have less access to those better outcomes, and thus the classes reinforce oppression and must be canceled. The obvious logical flaw here is that there are *reasons* why fewer Black students take advanced classes; it's not just a handful of racist administrators deciding to keep Black students out of them in order to keep them down. Banning the classes doesn't eliminate the socioeconomic factors that cause the disparity; it just makes them less visible (which is great for making white people feel less guilty, and useless for anyone else).The actual solution is to address those root factors that result in fewer Black students being able to take advanced classes, but that's hard, and honestly, most of those are entirely out of the control of a school district. School administrators can't do anything about the fact that almost half of all Black kids live in single-mother households, compared to about 8% for Asian kids, which obviously has massive effects on child prosperity in general (https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-economic-status-of-single-mothers/)  So it's easier to just eliminate the classes that are awkwardly full of Asian and white kids and say that you've taken an important step towards \\"equity\\" (until the pissed off parents eventually vote to fire the school board).","title":"What drove Asian and Hispanic voters to the right in 2024"},{"text":"Dont forget that Hitlers original plan was to deport all of the Jews until it turned out that other countries werent looking to take massive numbers of new immigrants.","title":"Texas offers Starr County ranch to Trump for mass deportation plans"},{"text":"[CIA admits to losing dozens of informants around the world: NYT](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/575384-cia-admits-to-losing-dozens-of-informants-around-the-world-nyt/)Don't know how this wasn't a bigger story","title":"LA enacts sanctuary city ordinance to prepare for potential mass deportations under Trump"},{"text":"It was a thing to start messing with police budgets and change how to approach crime, but that's been very, very unpopular.

A lot of people agree if the punishment is too light for the crime the criminal will repeat. So now were in a grey zone where a lot of people get a slap on the wrist for a serious crime. (A person from my Highschool got a fine for touching minors outrageous).We get repeat offenders or worse who can just eat the punishment then back to business.Overall our current system is inconsistent on this topic  and lenient in favor of the perpetrator. The people have taken it into their hands. Its bad because uncontrolled violence is never a good thing. Its good because its sending a message that the community wont be victimized. Predators look for easy prey so creating the idea that it will be more difficult, it may not stop everyone already commiting these crimes but a chunk will slow down and dissuade future criminals from starting.  (Another thing: we still do have countries were pedophillia is ok so these public displays can dissuade them from coming here assuming the rules are the same)I think this is the perfect example of grey.

This approach can lead to their idolization rather than condemnation, reinforcing rather than discouraging bad behavior. The Prodigal Son NarrativeThe parable of the Prodigal Son, found in Luke 15:11-32, emphasizes themes of forgiveness, redemption, and unconditional love. In this story, a wayward son returns home after squandering his inheritance, and his father welcomes him back with open arms, celebrating his return rather than punishing him?. This narrative is deeply ingrained in Christian teachings and is often used to illustrate Gods grace and mercy. Application in Evangelical CultureWhen evangelical leaders or influential figures are involved in scandals, this narrative can be invoked to frame their return to the community. Heres how it typically plays out:1. **Initial Denial and Attack (DARVO)**: Initially, there may be denial of the allegations and attacks on the accusers, following the DARVO pattern1. This helps to deflect immediate backlash and maintain support from followers.\\n   \\n2. **Confession and Repentance**: Eventually, the figure might confess to their wrongdoing, often in a highly publicized manner. This confession is framed as a moment of repentance, aligning with the Prodigal Sons return.3. **Redemption and Forgiveness**: The community, drawing on the Prodigal Son narrative, is encouraged to forgive and welcome the individual back. This act of forgiveness is seen as a demonstration of Christian grace and mercy?.4. **Reinforcement of Status**: Instead of being shunned, the individual often regains their status, sometimes even more revered than before. Their journey is seen as a testament to the power of redemption and the strength of their faith. Impact on BehaviorThis cycle can inadvertently reinforce bad behavior by:\\n- **Minimizing Consequences**: The focus on forgiveness and redemption can overshadow the need for accountability and justice.\\n- **Creating a Heroic Narrative**: The individuals return is often celebrated, creating a narrative where overcoming scandal is seen as a heroic journey rather than a serious breach of trust.\\n- **Encouraging Repeat Offenses**: Knowing that forgiveness and restoration are likely, individuals may feel less deterred from engaging in unethical behavior. Examples in Evangelical CultureSeveral high-profile cases illustrate this pattern. For instance, leaders like Jim Bakker and Ted Haggard, who faced significant scandals, have managed to return to positions of influence within the evangelical community12. Their stories are often framed in terms of redemption and forgiveness, reinforcing the Prodigal Son narrative.Reframing Scandals as Redemption Stories:Example: A political or religious movement might take a scandal involving one of its leaders and frame it as a story of redemption and forgiveness. This aligns with the Prodigal Son narrative, portraying the leader as a repentant figure who has returned to the fold, thus reinforcing the movements values of grace and redemption.When movements successfully co-opt narratives, they can shift cultural perceptions and norms. By framing unethical or controversial actions as part of a larger, noble cause, movements can normalize these behaviors within their community.Redemption and Forgiveness: Scandals are often reframed as opportunities for redemption, with the community encouraged to forgive and welcome back the individual. This reinforces the narrative of grace and redemption central to evangelical teachings.Victimhood and Persecution: Movements may portray themselves as victims of a larger societal persecution, using DARVO tactics to deflect criticism and rally support. This can create a strong in-group identity and a sense of being under siege, which can be a powerful motivator for collective action3.ConclusionBy co-opting narratives, movements can effectively manipulate public perception and align broader cultural dynamics with their goals. This strategy leverages deep-seated archetypes and psychological tactics to create compelling stories that resonate with peoples emotions and identities.Source: Conversation with Copilot, 11/20/2024\\n(1) Prodigal Son Meaning: Understanding Its Cultural and Biblical .... https://beautifulbible.org/prodigal-son-meaning/.\\n(2) The Sexual Abuse Scandal Thats Engulfed the Evangelical Movement. https://newrepublic.com/article/185907/evangelical-movement-sexual-abuse-scandal.\\n(3) The Scandal Rocking the Evangelical World - Ethics &amp; Public Policy Center. https://eppc.org/publication/the-scandal-rocking-the-evangelical-world/.\\n(4) The Evangelical Church Is Breaking Apart - Ethics &amp; Public Policy Center. https://eppc.org/publication/the-evangelical-church-is-breaking-apart/.\\n(5) The Prodigal Son: Cultural Reception History and the New Testament. https://vridar.org/2016/05/12/the-prodigal-son-cultural-reception-history-and-the-new-testament/.\\n(6) Prodigal Son: The Untold Bible Story Behind Its Meaning - Bart D.

And most parents prioritize other thing rather than visualizing the future sex lives of their children. In fact most see grandchildren as a blessing.When people vote there is a segment of the population who are ideologically driven, who cares about policies from an outwards scope not necessarily related to them. But most people vote based on what will benefit them. And in some extreme situations, like economic depression, war, crisis, they ideological people completely disappear. People don't care about rights if it means that they will struggle, if they won't afford a home or food.

Trump would just go all in on womens rights and superiority, which would drag in a lot of women who felt isolated from Kamalas rhetoric.If you had a demographic who was socially isolated and told their issues dont matter, then introduced a politician that told them otherwise and tried to unite them socially, theyre going to dominate the vote for that politician.

The military is illegally deployed for law enforcement purposes in violation of the Posse comitatis Act.  They place you under arrest for violation of some law, disorderly conduct or failure to disperse or something.   If they had no authority to conduct an arrest, the arrest is illegal and the charges are likely to be dismissed.   It might even become the basis for a 1983 suit.  petition.

It arrives at the wrong conclusions reliably enough that it needs modification.For example, you said household economics doesnt appear to be a useful classification tool for political messaging.When polls seem to suggest that household economics was a major deciding factor in the last election. Trump connected with his household economics political messaging much better than Harris, so he won.Democrats and liberals at the moment are essentially pitching a globalized version of trickle down economics. The stock market goes up, sure, but that has been tracking alongside wealth inequality. It should be a chilling condemnation of the party and platform that so many people wanted Trump over it.But look at all these statistics that show Americans are actually better off! Youre absolutely correct, instead of turning a critical lens on ourselves, the positions we hold, where we have missed the mark, and how that manifests in the world - we simply blame the electorate for being stupid for not realizing how good we are for them. As though that is a winning political strategy.Here is an example of a winning political economic strategy for Democrats.Military budget.We dont just spend billions of taxpayer money on it, we overwhelmingly funnel poor people into a system that, among other things, guarantees the free flow of trade and ensures our global economy can operate.There is a socio-economic class of people in the United States called draftees. People without enough access to money and power such that when it gets down to it, they have to go to war and people like Trump dont. Even in times of peace, our military is overwhelmingly comprised of this powerless class.The thing is the very same people who get to avoid military service also receive the lions share of the economic benefit from that military. They get to build factories in Southeast Asia. They get to extract resources from Iraq. They get the new open markets to sell their goods and services in.We should be having those businesses pick up more of the tab. If we need a bunch of carrier groups near a place in order to ensure the status quo of good business, shouldnt the economic beneficiaries have to pay for that? Isnt the US military simply one large cost of doing business line item for almost every business that does business internationally?To put it bluntly, if the only reason a business owner can relocate a factory from Indiana to China is because the US military makes it possible, why aint that person picking up the tab?That right there is the philosophical foundation of a winning economic message that can also roll right into sound policy.I am from the orthodoxy, I know the argument against what I am saying. But a rising tide raises all boats, all that increased economic activity globally has greatly benefited everyone. That may be true, but it is also trickle down economics with a global coat of paint and the electorate does. not. want. it.Until we change the liberal orthodox perspective to be more contemporary to the times we live in, we are on a global shift to the right.","title":"America doesnt really have a working class || Noahopinion"},{"text":"Why doesnt Joe use his newly minted  super power of you can do anything when your president the SCOTUS gave him and say until transition rules are met, there will be no transitionplay hard ball for once!","title":"Trump ignores transition rules.

An extreme example might be, if someone tries to kill you, pretty much anybody would agree that that gives you the right to try and kill them first in self defence.However, in practice I think it's much more of a grey area to say that acting immorally in order to thrive in an immoral organisation (whatever your definition of immoral may be) is a matter of survival. Even if acting morally at that organisation or working for a different, more ethical company might mean a lower salary or something, it's probably still a plausible option and you might think that is a necessary sacrifice in order to adhere to your principles. I'm also personally against using the logic of \\"people in power do it, so why shouldn't I\\", because you could twist this logic to justify lots of immoral things, and because you are also part of the system, and even if it's in a small way, you're still perpetuating it rather than improving it.As such, I think the question is, what are your principles, and why do you need them? You mention that you value honesty and sincerity when it comes to friends and family. Would you feel bad if you lied to a loved one to get some money out of them? I assume so, so why wouldn't it trigger guilt to lie on a job application and potentially steal a job from a more qualified, honest candidate? Is it because they're a stranger, or because they should be punished for being naive enough to be honest on their application? I don't think there's necessarily a right answer, but I think it's important to ask ourselves these kinds of questions in order to arrive at our principles. And I think that's exactly what this post is - you feel uneasy being insincere or dishonest, even when it's arguably justifiable, and you're wondering how to square it with yourself.I think principles are useful because, outside of examples like killing people in self defence, we are rarely presented with completely black and white binary choices. If you do have a set of unshakable principles and ethical red lines, then you can more easily evaluate your remaining options. If you don't have well defined principles, it can be easy to let yourself off the hook for morally grey decisions that may lead you to do things that worry your conscience later.Also, if we don't have principles to guide us, we won't make proactive ethical decisions. You might need to work for an immoral company as a matter of survival - but if you can define what an ethical company is for you, you can actively pursue a more ethical job once you have secure employment, and save yourself from unnecessary moral dilemmas in the future.So, to answer your question - it does make sense to me that I should behave more or less honestly, even when so many people in positions of power are dishonest. I think it creates a kind of self-selecting effect - I end up essentially filtering myself out of organisations where I would need to act against my conscience in order to succeed. I would never lie on my application, and I've probably missed out on opportunities because of it, but that gives me peace of mind when I do get a job, because I know now that I'm more likely to be at an organisation than does value honesty.I'm actually not opposed to a lot of the things that you mention in other comments - I have no issues playing up to people's expectations or acting slightly out of character if it helps my career. For example, if somebody that I need to flatter gives a talk, I might pretend to be more interested in the subject matter than I actually am. I'm comfortable with that because I think it falls under the \\"white lie\\" category of dishonesty, in that it's not really hurting anyone - if they feel like they gave a really interesting talk, when it was actually just ok, then there's not much chance that will hurt anybody in the future. But even typing that out made me pause and wonder if my internal justifications for it are really consistent!I hope this wasn't too much of a ramble, haha","title":"CMV: Manipulation should be used as a tool."},{"text":"Not to mention the accents ??","title":"With the completion of the election...is there anything at all that you admire about harris?"},{"text":"He will get his own show on Fox News within the week. ??","title":"GOPer Forced To Resign In Disgrace Just Days After Winning Election"},{"text":"Or when watermelons were close to $10.","title":"Evil liberals"},{"text":"If there's one thing Republicans love, it's hurting children.

Almost all politicians are bought and paid for, and try to implement their hidden agendas. The left, the right, it doesn't matter. That said, you have to judge someone based on their actions. *just* because someone has money or has hob-nobed with other rich folk doesn't mean they like/agree with the agenda that's being pushed onto the country. And with Trump, any time I see this argument, it's only justification is becuase he has wealth. And while people will say Trump is a millionaire/billionaire he was a self made business man. He made his money by marketing himself, really. Trump is alot of negative things. One of those things, while i'm not qualified to make a diagnosis, is that he is likely a narcissist. But because of that, he isn't going to implement anyone else's ideas. His ideas are always the best and greatest (reguardless if they are or not, he believes that). I do not think he would be a good puppet. Its likely they tried, and they failed. And that's why the media and the government itself turned on him. For all intents and purposes, what it seems to me, from Trumps actions and future proposed actions, that he is trying to *dismantle* the Rothschilds power, control and influence. The Rothschilds have spent the last 100+ years slowly working behind the scenes to pass legislation and create government organizations that give them a massive amount of control of the population. For example, the Department of Education. It was Rothschild funded. And it was created to make sure people are only educated just enough so they can be functional employees. Wage slaves, if you will. And Trump, atleast from his words, wants to dismantle this. It is yet to be seen if he will follow through, though. Trump has also talked about (although, not recently) dismantling the Fed. If he did that, that would be the single biggest blow to the Rothchilds power. And if he did do it, he would absolutely not be controlled. It would effectly sever most of their influence from the country. That said, talking about dismantling the Fed is a one way ticket to murder town, because the last two president's  that discussed real plans to dismantling the fed (Lincoln, passed legislation that created a new system of money, called \\"greenbacks\\", that was owned and controlled by nationally funded and owned banks (i.e. the government itself), which was meant to circumvent the creation of the FED, and severed as a major road block for the rothchilds. Prior to the Fed being established in 1913, the rothchilds were hard at work trying to create a centralized, privately owned bank, and Lincoln forsaw the problem. The real reason he was killed wasn't becuase of the civil war, it was because he was becoming an annoyance to the Rothchilds. JFK frequently talked about dismantling the deep state, to include many occasions where he wanted to abolish the Fed. But, before he actually inacted any legislation that would dismantle the fed, they murdered him.)","title":"How can you call yourself a conspiracy theorist and also claim a party"},{"text":"Yes!

Competent people don't want to waste the time and energy on the kind of narcissistic fantasy BS that fascists do and which always drags their country to hell.People thought Hitler wouldn't be so bad because he and his picks were so incompetent, but it's that incompetence which made them so scary. They ran on deporting all the jews, then couldn't manage it so turned to killing them and covering it up, along with other groups such as gay and trans people, artists, progressives, etc.His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \\"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei?em und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaosand it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \\"the greatest actor in Europe,\\" and wrote to a friend, \\"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childishhe would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \\"prodigious amounts of cake\\" and \\"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\\"He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.**Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \\"half-mad rascal\\" or a \\"man with a beery vocal organ.\\"** In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and **it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.**","title":"GOP No-Shows Help Dems Push Through Biden Judicial Nominees"},{"text":"Private Universities will now get education oversight with no controls.Welcome to Fascism","title":"With a Republican trifecta in Washington, a new era of college oversight is on its way"},{"text":" The country is really about to be run by comedians, actors, and snake oil salesmenSaid the dude who voted for a literal reality TV star.

It follows that not having the possibility to do so due to circumstances in early life makes it harder to escape from poverty. These classes and programs are, therefore, inherently discriminatory, and further disadvantages and class divide. I personally disagree with this idea, as I think it fails to take into account the cultural significance different groups assign to higher education, and it ends up depriving people of the opportunity to advance in life. I think it is a position that values too much the circumstances of one's birth and is too quick to discount the importance of hard work for future success in life.","title":"What drove Asian and Hispanic voters to the right in 2024"},{"text":"Even weirder is that she worked in his last administration, so by virtue of that couple years of government work she might be his most qualified pick","title":"Donald Trump nominates Linda McMahon to lead Education department"},{"text":"Ahem... compared to their old (all white ghosts) version, it's now rainbow-ish.","title":"Dem Border State Governor Says She Will Buck Trumps Plan For Mass Deportations"},{"text":"It doesnt look like they have the votes to override Coopers veto.?","title":"NC's GOP led legislature votes to strip power from incoming Democratic governor, AG as part of hurricane aid bill"},{"text":"Youre going to have a hard time getting people to stop sticking up for human rights because it might scare transphobic friends and family.

Through the resistance years and into the COVID era, liberal institutions from universities to media organizations to nonprofits cathartically swung left, which bred further denial about what voters cared about and were experiencing. A partial catalog of progressive denialism, listed in no particular order: that alienating left-wing positions or rhetoric were confined to college campuses; that the externalities of pandemic shutdowns, such as grade-school learning loss, were overblown; that the rapid adoption of new gender orthodoxies, especially in settings involving children, was not a popular concern; that the defund the police movement would be embraced by communities of color; that inflation was overstated; that the pandemic crime wave was exaggerated; that concerns over urban disorder represented a moral panic; that Latinos would welcome loosened border restrictions. Thanks to these and other issues, the gap continued to widen not just between liberals and conservatives but between the highly educated elite and the moderate rank and file of the Democratic Party.#Asian votersHarris received the lowest percentage received by a Democrat in 40 years, losing 7 points of support compared to Joe Bidens exit polls in 2020.In the wake of COVID-19, hate crimes against Asian Americans skyrocketed [...]. Russell Jeong, a professor at San Francisco State University, said, If you are a victim of crime, and your family is a victim of crime, then thats probably the most visceral in your face election issue to address, because you dont want your family in danger. In essence, Asian American voters felt hung out to dry by local governments, and the party in charge of those governments was the Democratic Party.But, crime isnt the only issue that is causing Asian Americans to shift right. Many Asian Americans, who prize academic achievement, are angry at the Democratic Partys opposition to educational excellence [...]. While the Biden-Harris administration never endorsed attempts by local and state Democrats to get rid of advanced math classes or gifted programs, national Democrats rarely if ever publicly condemned those initiatives. Moreover, these attempts by local Democrats to crack down on merit-based admissions at magnet schools and make it impossible for public school children in San Francisco public schools to take algebra in the 8th grade, had statewide and national implications.    The crux of Asian Americans rightward shift is about policy disagreements with Democrats and a fundamental disagreement on values and priorities. Asian American voters are angry that crimes against their elders are not being prosecuted by local Democrats, and that issue can theoretically be addressed through more tough on crime policies. However, to many Asian Americans, the issue of crime is indicative of the Democratic Party not valuing their safety. Similarly, for many Asian families, education and academic excellence has been a primary tool of class mobility, and since they see the Democratic Party as an affront to those values, they vote against the party.\\n#Hispanic votersGallego ran sharply to the center on immigration [...] focusing on border security since Latinos in Arizona, as Gallego put it, saw refugees pouring into the country as chaos. [...] Gallego explicitly stated, \\"We didn't actually speak about immigration reform because we know that the Latino voter just doesn't believe it anymore.\\"That said, the Latino shift rightwards isnt just solely due to immigration and in fact, was arguably driven primarily by economic concerns [...]. In 2023, Blueprint discovered that Latino voters cared most about lower prices and least about creating more jobs, which they considered Bidens priority over lower inflation.Moreover, some Hispanic voters also believe the Democratic party is out of line with their values. Arturo Laguna, a Mexican-American first-time voter in Arizona said, \\"The three biggest things of importance are family values, being pro-life and religion. I don't feel like Kamala represents those values.\\" If the Democratic Party wants to win, it must reach out to the voters it has lost to Republicans and understand why they shifted right. While theres a very high chance that Republicans will mess up the country (again) and Democrats will regain Congressional majorities and/or the presidency due to thermostatic politics and negative polarization, the reality is that Trump won in 2024, and moreover, Harris, and the Democratic Party, lost. Unlike 2016, Trump didnt just squeak by in the electoral college, he didnt lose the popular vote by almost 5 million like in 2020; he turned out hundreds of thousands, if not millions of voters that voted only for him while leaving down-ballot races blank, flipped a substantial amount of Biden 2020 voters, and won a record percentage of non-white voters for a Republican. The sooner the Democratic Party can accept these facts without bending over backwards to prove the loss isnt actually an indictment of them, the sooner it can recalibrate for the next two years, and beyond. Overall, I think these considerations by the voters aren't ridiculous, and shouldn't be brushed off. I'm particularly surprised by the job number vs. inflation one, since I would have expected people to generally miss this tradeoff.","title":"What drove Asian and Hispanic voters to the right in 2024"},{"text":"Can we get Ric Flair for Department of Sex?","title":"Linda McMahon, co-founder of WWE, named Trumps education secretary"},{"text":"In the latest episode of Offline, they talk to this guy who writes a substack called Infinite Scroll.

He had the popularity of being a famous \\" Pilot \\".. pushing the bounds of aeronautics of the time with his first transatlantic flight and subsequentr world publicity tours. \\nLindbergh received unprecedented acclaim after his historic flight. In the words of biographer A. Scott Berg, people were \\"behaving as though Lindbergh had walked on water, not flown over it\\"He also had a second  family in Germany. He was a complete spineless appeaser to Hitler. He was trying to fourth column the united states. In the months before the United States entered World War II, Lindbergh's non-interventionist stance and statements about Jews and race led some to believe he was a Nazi sympathizer, although Lindbergh never publicly stated support for the Nazis, he condemned them several times in both his public speeches and personal diary. However, like many Americans before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he opposed not only the military intervention of the U.S. but also the provision of military supplies to the British. He supported the isolationist America First Committee and resigned from the U.S. Army Air Corps in April 1941 after President Franklin Roosevelt publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave a significant address, titled \\"Speech on Neutrality\\", outlining his position and arguments against greater American involvement in the war.In 1938, Hugh Wilson, the American ambassador to Germany, hosted a dinner for Lindbergh with Germany's air chief, Generalfeldmarschall Hermann G?ring, and three central figures in German aviation: Ernst Heinkel, Adolf Baeumker, and Willy Messerschmitt.[198] At this dinner, G?ring presented Lindbergh with the Commander Cross of the Order of the German Eagle. Lindbergh's acceptance became controversial when, only a few weeks after this visit, the Nazi Party carried out the Kristallnacht, a nation-wide anti-Jewish pogrom which is now considered a key inaugurating event of the Holocaust.[199] Lindbergh declined to return the medal, later writing, \\"It seems to me that the returning of decorations, which were given in times of peace and as a gesture of friendship, can have no constructive effect. If I were to return the German medal, it seems to me that it would be an unnecessary insult.Following Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia and Poland, Lindbergh opposed sending aid to countries under threat, writing \\"I do not believe that repealing the arms embargo would assist democracy in Europe\\" and[204] \\"If we repeal the arms embargo with the idea of assisting one of the warring sides to overcome the other, then why mislead ourselves by talk of neutrality?\\"[204] He equated assistance with war profiteering: \\"To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war\\"\\nIn late 1940, Lindbergh became the spokesman of the isolationist America First Committee,[211] soon speaking to overflow crowds at Madison Square Garden and Chicago's Soldier Field, with millions listening by radio. He argued emphatically that America had no business attacking Germany.In a 1935 interview, Lindbergh stated \\"There is no escaping the fact that men were definitely not created equal..He was banging chicks all over europe and not taking care of the kids. \\nTen days before he died, Lindbergh wrote to each of his European mistresses, imploring them to maintain the utmost secrecy about his illicit activities with them even after his death.[273] The three women, none of whom ever married, all managed to keep their affairs secret even from their children, who during his lifetime, and for almost a decade after his death, did not know the true identity of their father, whom they had only known by the alias Careu Kent, and seen only when he briefly visited them once or twice a year.*Anybody who doesnt get the similarities here is not thinking clearly.*","title":"Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch SpaceX launch Starship rocket"},{"text":"This means more religious charter schools and the continued theocratization of America.","title":"Trump names Linda McMahon as his pick for education secretary"},{"text":"Wow!

Many businesses rely on migrant labor , and many of those migrants do not have the legal paperwork. Sure they make raids, but do you see laws enacted that actively take out a business that repeatedly hires undocumented labor? I cannot remember one news story where a business was taken out. Some chicken plants were temporarily closed in NC - but that was because the workers were locked in to keep them from taking breaks and they burned to death in a fire when they could not escape Agribusiness twisted Desantis' arm when he tried to stop immigrant farm labor. \\nThe meat packing companies have been known to send busses across the border to recruit.These plants once hired locally, but made a decision to raise profits by slashing the pay to a point where Americans could not survive on those wages. Alabama intentionally harassed migrants and made them so fearful they left the state, but locals refused to do the work for so little pay under such grueling conditions. Profit was rotting in the fields. Alabama then tried prison labor - the prisoners were not highly motivated.\\nThe state quietly invited the immigrants back. Reagan gave amnesty and a path to citizenship because businesses needed the labor and Bush tried to raise the number of visas allowed and give a path, but he didn't come close to legislation.  Incoming VP Vance invested in a large greenhouse facility in Appalachia hoping to give employment to out of work coal miners. But the conditions were poor and so was the pay. The locals refused, the company had to bring in hundreds of migrant laborers. According to trump and Vance the people coming here to work are murderers and rapists and destroying our culture. Vance went after the Haitians in his own state even though he knew full well that they had legal status to be there. So even legal immigrants are a problem according to them. Vance insists they are taking Hines away from us. Where I live they are the people building them.   Americans do not want to live crowded in substandard housing barely existing while doing grueling work.  Can you blame them? Every year as jobs are offshored and outsourced in order to keep profits up and sustain competitive pricing, generations are living more poorly than their parents did. Let's be clear - having a subculture that is paid abysmally and treated horribly and often poisoned with weed killing  chemicals and are locked in to buildings where they burn to death is not moral.  But the US economy runs on its existence and Americans need to make a decision. Shall we force higher wages, safe working conditions, and pay more for food?

Specifically, former ring announcer and ring crew chief Melvin \\"Mel\\" Phillips Jr. was accused of sexually abusing underage boys, known as \\"ring boys,\\" who assisted in setting up wrestling events.Evidence suggesting the McMahons' awareness includes:Public Statements: In the 1980s, Vince McMahon reportedly acknowledged to journalist Phil Mushnick that he and Linda were aware of Phillips' \\"peculiar and unnatural interest\\" in young boys. Employment Actions: Phillips was fired in 1988 amid sexual abuse allegations but was rehired within six weeks. Upon his return, he was allegedly warned to \\"steer clear from kids,\\" indicating the McMahons' knowledge of his prior misconduct. Internal Culture: The lawsuit filed by former ring boys asserts that Phillips' behavior was \\"common knowledge\\" within WWE, with some incidents occurring openly in locker rooms. Despite this, the McMahons allegedly took insufficient action to prevent further abuse. \\nThese points suggest that the McMahons were aware of Phillips' inappropriate behavior but failed to implement effective measures to stop it, leading to ongoing abuse within the organization.So basically they talked about it openly that he was into young boys, then fired him, then hired him back on the just said \\"be on your best behavior!\\". They enabled a known pedophile... The only reason why you would ever do that would be if being a pedophile is not that big of a deal to you... Why is it not a big deal to them?

And somebody who is why to alleviate the racism inherent in older generations. As well as straight to alleviate the homophobia that is pretty rife in those same generations.2028 is an pivot year in as much as the boomers will fall behind the millennials in eligible voters and with nearly 15 million fewer voting age people Gen X does have the heft that millenials do whilst Gen Z isn't old enough to run for the white house. What this means is that you want somebody in that age group to appeal to them and their concerns. Simultaneously you can't afford to turn off older voters because collectively Boomers and Gen X will have the majority over voting aged people until th 2032 election.Ruben Gellego is the youngest on your list but he's still a Gen X.  My advice is find a younger candidate that fits those criteria first and then fits the Democrats platform second. Don't get me wrong these are all good candidate but if you want to win you want somebody who will be in the late thirties early forties come 2028.I don't make people's feelings but I do understand them and if you want to win you need to address those feelings both good and bad if you want to win with an understanding that people are at times more motivated by fear than by hope and the closer you get to a candidate that fits the ideal president of the electorate the more likely you are to win.So while I agree that all of these candidates will make for an excellent short list for VP I also think you are failing to understand the personal biases that run in large swaths of the American electorate. You might personally not like it hell even I don't like it but it is there glaring you in the face every time you see Donald Trump in the white house. You want to win you need to understand those biases and play to them whether you personally like it or not. After all you can't change the direction of the nation if you don't win elections.","title":"2028 DNC primary poll"},{"text":"It's in extraordinary occasions.  What is the extraordinary occasion?
