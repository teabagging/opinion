This marks a shift from August, when Harris led by 2%.The respondents are viewing the former Attorney General increasingly unfavorably: In August, less than half of voters49%viewed her unfavorably; by October, that had risen to 53%.By comparison, the Trump camp has seen its fortunes swing the opposite way: Unfavorable views of Trump are down 3% from August to October, to 50% at the time of writing.Another problem facing the Harris campaign is that voters views of her performance are still fresh.\\nIn a national survey of 1,500 voters, 47% said they would vote for Trump, while 45% favored Harris. However, the results are within the margin of error, leaving the race too close to call.Is Harris fading?Digging deeper into the data, it appears Harriss initial star power is fading.Under the Biden administration, consumers suffered high inflation rates and tight Fed fund rates, squeezing their disposable income.As a result, voters criticism of Harriss performance is still fresh. According to the Journals survey, 42% of respondents approved of Harriss performance as Vice President versus 54% who disapproved.Converselyand with four years to smooth the recollectionperceptions of Trumps presidency are only improving.A total of 52% of respondents say they approved of the former presidents years in office, versus 48% who disapprove.Likewise, a poll from the Financial Times and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business indicates that the Democratic camp has yet to convince voters that theyre better off now than they were four years ago.In a survey released this morning, 44% of voters said they would trust Trump with the economy, while 43% said they would trust Harris.While the general consensus on the economy is still a hotly contested topic, Trump also has a significant advantage over Harris regarding how much better households would be doing financially under each administration.While 45% of voters in the swing states thought theyd be financially better under Trump, just 37% said they would prosper more under Harrisa blow to the candidate whose key pledge has been lifting up the middle classes.That being said, the poll of 1,007 registered voters does have a wide margin of error3.1 percentage points either waymeaning the closer aspects of the race may still be up in the air.A dead heat in another major pollBloomberg is still polling the candidates as neck and neck.A survey released last night found that Harris still has a marginal gain in key swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan.Harris is leading by a minute percent in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, while Trump is slightly ahead in Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin.Overall, Harris leads the poll of more than 5,300 registered voters in swing states by 49.1% to 48.5%.Voters were also divided on which candidate they believed would be better for their purse strings.On taxes, the rivals were equal, with 46% of the voters saying the respective candidate had better policies.On healthcare and housing costs, Harris polled significantly better than the Republican nominee: 51% to 42% and 48% to 43%, respectively.Meanwhile, Trump leads on interest rates, gas prices, and the cost of everyday goods by similarly healthy margins: 47% to 42%, 50% to 41%, and 46% to 48%, respectively.","title":"2 major polls show Donald Trump gaining slight edge over Kamala Harris in election race"},{"text":"Valid","title":"Reddit is so liberal ?"},{"text":"If he really is that bad, then why aren't you beating him in every poll?","title":"I cant imagine why people try to assassinate him."},{"text":"Well to be fair, owning chickens is the most expensive way to buy eggs.","title":"FBI finds hundreds of weapons at home of suspected shooter of Arizona Democratic Party office"},{"text":"Subs been taken over homie.","title":"Kamala Harris Chickens Out of Joe Rogan Interview"},{"text":"What a momentous and iconic election cycle this is.

There is too much money not tied directly to the US economy. Cuba is doing this to themselves, which is fine. They can do anything that they want to. Their GDP was 100 billion last year. To even double or triple that amount is not something that the US could prevent. No country has this much power. The world economy was 100 trillion last year. You are saying that the US is able to control almost the entire world economy down to billions.  We have power. We could even control maybe half of the world economy. Maybe even 75%. But that would still leave 25 trillion, we wouldn't control. You're saying that these US controls 99.999% of the world economy. That is not possible.Edit: Think of it this way. Lets remove all the large numbers. Lets just say that the world economy was 100 dollars total. Cuba made 1 dime last year (0.10). Just one dime of that total 100 dollars, not even 50 cents, not a dollar. One dime. And you are saying that the US controls so much that it can control the entire world economy down to the dime level. Again, we might control 50 dollars of the world economy, maybe 75. But Cuba would only have to find dimes to better their economy significantly. There is too much money out there. We control a lot but we don't control down to that level. There may be other external reasons why Cuba sucks as much as it does. But those external factors and any internal factors that you are downplaying are not at the direct control of the US.

What happened exactly we may never know. We do know that an inmate was able to be Un alived while in custody. The 34 counts is a miscarriage of Justice. The court and prosecutors charged each action as a separate charge. The prosecutors made one count for each check written, one count for each ledger entry for the check, and one count for each invoice for legal services. This is not how anyone has ever been charged in the past. This would be similar to a person stealing a carton of eggs and being charged for each egg, 12 counts, the carton, 13 total, and each step to exit. This is not how the system works. This is Lawfare.

I also think there should be stricter rules on buying guns from unregulated markets so these guns dont fall into the hands of people not allowed to own them, like violent felons.

The new milestone was reached on Sunday at 11.15 (AEST) when the share of renewables past 75 per cent for the first time in a five minute trading period, beating the previous peak of 74.4 per cent set just 14 days earlier. On Monday, the record was broken again when renewables hit a new instantaneous peak of 75.3 per cent. The biggest contributor on Sunday was the output of the more than 21 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels mounted on rooftops across the main grid, with rooftop PV also setting a new record share of 52 per cent, up from 50.4 per cent that it set a week earlier. Of course, when there are winners there are also losers, and the nations slowly dwindling fleet of ageing coal fired generators posted a new record low share of 24.1 per cent at 11.05 AEST, and a record low output of 6,042 MW at 11.50 AEST, much below the previous low of 6,380 MW. Operational demand on the main grid also fell to a new low of 10,489 MW at midday AEST on Sunday. Another demand measure C market demand C dropped below 10,000 MW for the first time ever, according to another data source at Watt Clarity. Coal fired generators are being forced to dance around the surging output of rooftop solar, particularly in spring time when mild temperatures mean that demand is not high. Many units are forced to ramp down and up rapidly, some are even being switched off and then back on in the same shift, and those that cannot manage that bid the wholesale price into negative territory to ensure they are dispatched. As coal continues to decline, and renewable energy reaches new milestones, the focus on energy storage and grid management becomes even more critical to maintaining stability and supporting Australias clean energy future, Geoff Eldridge, an energy analyst with GPE NEMLog, wrote on LinkedIn. State-based records also fell. As we reported on Saturday, the share of rooftop PV hit a stunning new record of 112.9 per cent of state demand in South Australia, while on Sunday rooftop PV hit a new peak of 55.2 per cent in NSW, the countrys biggest grid and with the biggest coal fleet. Queensland, normally Australias most dependent coal state in terms of generation share, posted a new record instantaneous renewable share of 77 per cent on Sunday afternoon.!ping ECO&amp;AUS","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The key word is better candidate.

Kamala is the current VP and has to balance that with her campaign. Trump is basically unemployed. Kamala is generally also much more active in her campaign, while Trump regularly finds time off to golf. It shouldn't be unimaginable that Trump is able to fit more of these kind of engagements into his diary because it would depend as much on Starmer's diary as it would on who he is meeting. It's also probably not as necessary, and hence lower priority than meeting with Trump. Again, because she's the current VP, her administration would be similar to Biden's, one which the UK has been involved with for the last 4 years. The Labour Party has also thrown in with dems, so there is likely already a fair bit of discourse already going on. There may not be as much to discuss with Kamala that makes a face-to-face meeting that critical vs having one with Trump, who represents a regime change, a possibly very radical one.You misunderstand the purpose of these meetings as well. Starmer has no control over who gets elected, so this isn't about which candidate is popular in UK. This isn't performative and I doubt Americans give a flying fuck who a foreign PM is meeting with. This is simply a sit down with potential US presidents who will be in power for the rest of Starmer's current term.Idk if it's on purpose or if people are looking for a reason to be offended but there's no indication that Starmer considers this a \\"snub\\". He's attributing it to diary conflict simple as, the article is quoting unrelated comments made by Starmer of how much he values personal relationships as a way to make readers think Kamala doesn't by not meeting him?

But you are right in that he is just an example of the product of the war machine and that is scary. I would however even point out that this kind of thing hasn't stopped and repeats often. Of course not reaching the same level but US involvement in other countries historically serves the plutocracy. Most immediately those in south America have felt oligarchy exploitation, the United Fruit Company/Chiquita funded known terrorists and the courts tried to hide it. Bush famously lied to get into the middle east and threw the name Al-Qaeda around while failing to mention funding of Mujahedeen fighters and direct involvement of the subsequent rise of the taliban.Only two well known examples but too many to count exist.

I always tell people that a big part of being pro-choice includes the desire to have programs that can influence the choice being made. There are a lot of ways to lower the number of abortions without banning abortions.Abortions needed for the health of the mother: We need a much improved health system that improves the health of women period. The US has a lower maternal health index than most other developed nations, and that disparity is even greater for women of color and women in poverty. Pregnancy is already a health risk, but that risk is amplified if you are pregnant in the US. Improving maternal health across the board would reduce the risk of complications for the mother. At the same time, women who already know that any pregnancies would be difficult or life threatening should have easier options for birth control including sterilization if so desired. Healthy women increase the chances for healthy pregnancies which increases the chances for health babies. Even then, if there is a risk for her health, or the health of the child, fucking deal with it, she has autonomy over her body.Abortions needed for economic reasons: Increase protections for pregnant women in the workplace, increase PARENTAL (not just maternal) leave to be paid and protected so both parents can stay at home during this important time. Paid (and available) daycare so families can return to the workplace if desired, paid school meals. Better healthcare for children, and better healthcare and support options for children with chronic medical conditions. You know, the whole \\"how about being pro-life even after they are born\\" thing. If there is no economic barriers to carrying the pregnancy to term, and the mother still wants an abortion? Fucking deal with it, she has autonomy over her body.Abortions needed for the non-medical safety of the mother: Have better options for keeping mothers safe from spouses, families, faith leaders, communities, etc. Abortions because the mother wants an abortion even if all the other options have already been solved and addressed: Fucking deal with it, she has autonomy over her body.","title":"Here we go! Highlights of the Kamala Harris CNN Town Hall event!"},{"text":"It all happened roughly within 2 years. First it was an arms embargo on Cuba meaning no firearms or munitions but everything else was fair game which was more or less standard operating procedure during the Cold War between the US and non capitalist countries. Then the USSR and Cuban became allies, paint it as standard diplomatic interaction all you want but thats not the case. They were allies, it wasnt like Cuba had an embassy in Russia and thats it. Then the full embargo came down. After the embargo Cuba wasnt standoffish with the US, they were outright hostile just short of shots being fired. You bring up wanting nukes as a deterrent, one country that actually has nukes has expressly used the threat of nuclear war if theyre invaded, and that my friend is Russia. Every other country that has nukes has used them as a deterrent for nuclear war, not a deterrent for invasion. Allowing the USSR to build launch sights in Cuba was about as close to declaring war as you could get without actually going all the way in. Tensions were heating up rapidly and sides were starting to be picked, and you either sided with the USA or the USSR. Unless youre actively at war with another country then youre going to maintain diplomatic relations but theres a difference between that and collaborating with another country. Cuba bet on the wrong horse and pushed all their chips to the center of the table when they did it. If the USSR had grown and prospered instead of struggling to maintain basic necessities then were not having this conversation, but at the end of the day they made their choice and things played out the way they played out. As for why we didnt start trading with Cuba after the Cold War, what does Cuba have thats worth trading for? Cuba doesnt have the manufacturing and production capabilities to be a serious trading partner. Theyre too far from natural resources that would be used in making goods sought after world wide so essentially theyre left a few raw natural resources which can be gotten closer to the manufacturing hubs as well as from countries that are more ideologically aligned with the US, then theres cigars. Sorry but cigars and a handful of raw natural resources isnt enough to get you a seat at the table with the superpowers. Theres no one single country that owes another trade services, you either bring something worth trading to the table or you agree to tweak your government in a way thats beneficial to the trading partner bringing more to the table. Thats the way this work, and thats the way its always worked. Countries dont have to trade with others simply because it would help the weaker one. Thats a large part of the reason why the USSR failed, instead of focusing largely on home turf they poured money into other communist countries.You see the part you posted about censorship just reinforces my point. If the system was as good as you claim then let them print all the BS that they can, people go off what they physically see far more than what they read. It doesnt matter if anti communist propaganda plays 24/7, if the system was working then people would see that propaganda and think what the hell are they talking about? There has to be some truth to it for propaganda to really be effective outside of the most desperate situations, if everyone was healthy, fed, housed and happy then anti-communist/pro-capitalist propaganda isnt going to do much. If the system relies on suppressing disagreement with the system to remain functional then thats a problem. It will never truly represent the people because at the end of the day the people dont have a choice because theres only one choice.Im not saying that the US doesnt have a hand in where Cuba is now, but the vastly majority of it belongs to the USSR. The USSR bet big on their ambitions and came up short for a variety of reasons, but Cuba backed their bet. When youre a small island nation that gains outsized power on the world stage by being belligerent then problems are going to arise if the superpower you backed crumbles. That level of belligerence is also going to make it so other countries are less inclined to help if you end up on your ass. To put it in everyday life terms, if your dog loves you and your family but growls and snaps at everyone else then you cant really be surprised if you need to rehome the dog and everyone says no. The little bits Cuban improved were because the trade deals they got with the USSR more often than not ended the USSR taking a loss. They were overpaid for what they could give, which was fairly common for countries aligned with the USSR. Aside from the brutal human right violations, the USSR was economically never soundly ran. The USSR largely propped Cubas economics and in return they were the thorn in the side of the US. Once the USSR collapses and the economic support ends, now youre the impoverished nation that was just looking to start a fight on behalf of the Soviets.","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"[80% of the sugar that Cuba produced was sold in the US](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/jq085j963/sf2688339/ft848t829/ERSF-03-07-1962_Cuba_Shifts_Trade_in_Farm_Products_to_Soviet_Bloc.pdf)","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"I am not exactly a fan of their economic system and certainly would rather them liberalise it and allow more worker cooperatives and so on","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"without making them one bit more free.

In Firth (in Nuremburg, which would be a key place of nazi power) in 1932 as Hitler rides through Firth he and his entourage gets pelted with rocks. Several SA and nazi members get beaten up. The police in Firth did very little about this, they were well informed enough about the rock throwing (it was along a good portion of his route from the airport to Nuremburg). Within 6 months of the above, Hitler was chancellor of germany. Within another few months, the nazi flag is raised over Firth with 20k in attendance.Thats fast. Thats a strongly devoted fanbase. Thats with a large group of people actively hating him. Thats without a majority or pluarity vote before 1933. Firth was considered a very liberal and accepting town with a high jewish population and integrated schools. I think you are looking up resistance after the Nazis got into power which will naturally be lower since they killed a lot of people. There were politicians, political thought leaders, intellgentisia, etc. who were very agaisnt Hitler and also not willing to leave their country. They were killed in two nights of violence across Germany (night of long knives), that was what he did to his political rivals once in power to maintain it. At one point there were in fact political disagreements and adversaries to Hitler, they got way votes in many places. Resistance and mass group acts of violence agaisnt Nazis was not uncommon in the lead up. They had incrediably devouted followers but many who hated them.","title":"CMV: trump is too hated to become the next hitler"},{"text":"Kamala bots at it again","title":"I cant imagine why people try to assassinate him."},{"text":"\\"And why would you only accept it as reality if you hear it from them?\\" - Because the genocide convention literally requires proof of conspireracy to commit genocide which is very hard to prove unless the nation or group has a policy in place that calls for the complete eradication of the group.

(If Trump wins, that interview will go down in the history books) Most Democrats can't stand her, and democratic voters are pissed she didn't earn the nomination in the first place. RFK was the right candidate to run, but he scares the shit out of the Clinton/Obama cabinet that's been in power for almost three decades.It's gotten so bad that she's running ads against Jill Stein to keep from splitting the democrat vote in Wisconsin and Michigan. It really is remarkable. Trump was always going to be fighting an uphill battle running for a third time, but the last two weeks have completely opened the door for him. Vance was an incredible pick for VP too, he's been killing it on the campaign trail.This last week and a half is key. If Trump can stay on this heater he's on right now, I think he's got it. I hope people see the immediate difference he makes if he gets back in so we can have a strong Republican ticket for the next two elections.TLDR: Kamala is blowing a 28-3 lead, and Trump is Tom Brady.","title":"Curious why the Dems did a full court press tonight?"},{"text":"I think shes got it","title":"Why Kamala Harris was always destined to lose"},{"text":"They'll be called \\"enemies of the state\\" by Donald, and will go shocked Pikachu when he goes after them.","title":"Kamala Harris calls Trump a 'fascist' as she argues he's 'dangerous' and unfit for office"},{"text":"I, can, relate, to, this,","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"oh god 6.78 was over a decade ago (Also I was wrong and the op bonelord era lasted from June-October 2013 according to the dota2 wikis changelog)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Fascists are vicious, not smart.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 23, 2024 - 13 days until election day!"},{"text":"When does Trump die?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Cock carousel is much more fun to say though","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You mean Donald McDonald?","title":"Kamala Harris calls Trump a 'fascist' as she argues he's 'dangerous' and unfit for office"},{"text":"Yeah to me it just feels like a man hating sub with extra steps.","title":"Witches are unable to cast spells on Trump.

He blamed the communists and the wealthy jewish community, but mostly the communists but he viewed both as kind of a fifth column.  I have not read his book but his soldiering is the first thing in his life he was respected as and made him intensely nationalistic.  You can read Storm of Steel, a war journal by another German soldier in WW1 where you see the young idealist soldier become hardened by war and becoming more nationalistic despite the horrors he witnessed first hand.  This was not an isolated thing.  The German navy for instance refused to recognize the peace treaty and tried to fight on by itself becoming kind of a pirate fleet for awhile.  The german soldierate had been fighting to a stalemate and felt bitterly betrayed.  It's a mistake to single out Hitler as some freak out of nowhere.  He became what he became because there were a ton of people that went though the same crucible of WW1 and  identified with his ideas.

The US prohibiting ships that have docked in Cuba in the last 6 months from engaging in trade in the US is far from doing as much as possible.This is not true, as per [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba#:%7E:text=The%20United%20States%20embargo%20against,with%20Cuban%20interests%20since%201958.). \\"The embargo was reinforced in October 1992 by the Cuban Democracy Act and in 1996 by the Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act (known as the HelmsCBurton Act) which penalizes foreign companies that do business in Cuba by preventing them from doing business in the U.S.\\" So yes, your policy is true, but there are much more strict policies. My point would be that if your choices are between liberalizing or becoming more authoritarian, you don't get a free pass on culpability just because your dictatorship of the proletariat is threatened.Well, it's not just the dictatorship of the proletariat, which I don't care for. It's women's rights and gay rights, for example. It's true that these have been tremendously increased since before the revolution, and seeing situations such as the coup in Iran, it's not unreasonable to think that any US-led replacement would be incredibly conservative.But ok, as I have said, I'm not a fan of the authoritarian policies of Cuba. But it is understandable given their situation against the US, and as someone in the west and currently living in the US, it makes far more sense to criticise the US's role in these policies. If the US lets up the sanctions for example, there's no excuse to have these policies anymore. Maybe the next round of Cuban protests will succeed. I think Ukraine's press restrictions are pretty reasonable given that they're in a war. Some of the UK's restrictions were reasonable, interning \\"dangerous\\" foreigners was overbroad. But the UK has always had issues with overbroad censorship, even now.Cool, that's good to know. Obviously Cuban censorship goes too far, far beyond either of these countries. But given your opinion about Ukraine, it is reasonable for Cuba to have some restrictions on their press given that they too have been at risk of an overthrown government since their inception. You can argue about the extent, and I certainly won't disagree when you say they go too far. But if the US stops its antagonistic policy towards Cuba, there is no reason for censorship at all. Even if it continues, it can't be justified to the population. I'm not arguing that Cuba is some irredeemable economic shithole, it's definitely on the more successful end of socialist states, mainly due to Soviet aid and trade deals. But we shouldn't pretend that that puts it on par with liberal democracies in terms of standards of living or that socialist states are generally as successful as capitalist ones.Well, I would never argue with you here. Cuba has never been on the level of the US or any country in Europe. My position is just that it's primarily due to the US sanctions. Do you think those two things are related? Or do you think that Cuba's reliance on Venezuelan oil might have something to do with that. Cuba keeps putting its self in situations where it has to rely on foreign powers to support it through sweetheart deals. And it does this for ideological reasons.This just does not align with reality. What other option does Cuba have? They can't buy oil from essentially any other country due to the sanctions, so of course they rely on oil from Venezuela. Your implication is the wrong direction. Of course, by the DRF.Who do you think organised this operation? As per the [CIA review](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Internal-Probe-Bay-Pigs.pdf) The spring of 1961 was seen as the last opportunity to administer\\nsuch a shock (without actually committing US troops) before Castro's military received more shipments of Eastern Bloc weapons. A CIA-trained force of Cuban exiles would seize an isolated area along Cuba's southern coast, allowing migr political leaders to return to the island and offer the populace a democratic alternative to Castro. Assuming the migr force gained control of the air and consolidated its beachhead, the Brigade's aircraft (obsolescent but potent B-26 bombers allegedly purchased on the black market) would then negate the Cuban Army's numerical superiority and demonstrate Castro's impotence to the Cuban people. Over the next few weeks, Cuba's populace and military would finally mount an active resistance to him, setting in motion his eventual downfall. If worst came to worst, however, the Brigade could be evacuated by sea, and elements might be able to \\"go guerrilla\\" in the not-too-distant Escambray Mountains. These assumptions proved disastrously mistaken.The invasion by the DRF was organised by the CIA, and given the green light by JFK. This was not some independent event. That's what tends to happen when you lose a war. Germany wasn't too stoked about the concessions it had to make in peace deal that ended WWI, but that didn't justify Germany reaction.There's a huge difference here. Cuba was not some state that organised a horrible war. It was a colony where the population was already repressed under the Spanish. What right does the US to take over ownership of that repression? Of course, not enough brown people in the US.Mhm, that's exactly it of course. Your reading comprehension is incredible!

Whether you agree with it or not is one thing, but if the appellate court throws out the case, then he'll get off scot-free.~~Just to push you on this slightly, a judge asking a tough question is not an indication of their ruling and should almost never be taken that way. The judges in the immunity decision at the district court level had a ton of harsh questions for the feds, but ultimately ruled in their favor.The state case against Trump on his fraud is so tight that the decision was what is known as a partial summary decision. That is to say, the judge looked at the evidence, looked at trump's defense and said \\"Yeah, this is fraud, we don't need a trial on the facts because you have not presented a meaningful defense\\" and went directly to damages on a number of the claims.The only thing they are quibbling about is whether the amount of damages might be too high, which seems unlikely to go anywhere.There is no universe in which it gets thrown back on the facts, because the level of fraud there was so blatant as to be undeniable.The Jan 6th stuff is dubious, but it will never go to trial unless someone has evidence he was involved in some capacity. If that evidence existed, prosecutors from all over the nation would've hopped on this case immediately. Since this evidence doesn't exist, no court will hear this case.There are literal mountains of evidence, a huge chunk of which got released to the public last week. The problem isn't evidence, it is that the Supreme court decided that the president is functionally immune to most criminal prosecution.To be specific, one of the most damning charges against trump had to be removed because they are no longer able to use the fact that Trump told his AG to lie to states about election fraud as evidence, due to the fact that he was president.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is literally immune to consequences"},{"text":"I've seen way too many people talk this way on reddit, and I'm just so fucking done with it.

There are a lot of lip service leftists who love to virtue signal just how liberal and open minded they are, but refusing to do the work and fight the fight, and turning on anyone who disagrees on single points.  I won't deny that group exists, because they are a massive frustration to me as well.  These are the people more interested in virtue signaling and equivocating (like literally equivocating some very different definitions of the word liberal) to sound enlightened than they are on acting on itBut i resent the idea that there are not legitimately invested white liberals either, and that we are not just as numerous. We may not be as loud but we are here, and in numbers. Sanders is a wonderful example, even if a lot of his loudest supporters are examples of the opposite. The problem with this group is that they are less likely to be known by anyone but the locals, because they aren't interested in making it national news every time they do the right thing. But if you look, they are there, and lumping them in as a monolith with the others isn't fair.This second group may or may not show up to rallies and protests, but they show up to the ballot box.  They listen more than they talk, they nod rather than say yes. I normally would not even make a post about this because it feels too much like virtue signaling just saying it, but i am tired of letting the idea that the loud portion represent all of us.  if you want to find the politicians in this second group, you have to look, they rarely announce themselves.  if you want to find the citizens, you have to be super aware.I'll give some examples. Racism and sexism in the workplace, most of us have seen it.  the first group is the ones who will loudly call it out, then track down the minority and tell them how much of an ally they are, and concern themselves with ingratiating themselves.  The second group is also shutting down the bigotry, but they don't assume that makes them your new friend and come to you like you owe them a thank you.  instead they make a complaint to hr as well, or if in management, file formal paperwork about the incident. if you are clearly in need of immediate support, you will likely get it, but if you appear fine they will assume you are an adult and don't need them treating you otherwise.   Of the two, the first one is the one you noticed and made the judgement in your post about, and the second is the one you never did but just lumped in with the first.Another example is the loud group screaming about wage slavery and constantly trying to equate it to chattel slavery, trying to co op an entire race into their cause by using loaded language, and accusing anyone who disagrees of being pro slavery.  Then you have the ones who know the economic imbalance is a problem, and push for labor rights and unions without relying on loaded language.  discussions about gentrification and urbanization and suburbia can all have the same discussion...  and it just is worth pointing out that not every white liberal is using this issues to platform themselves... many are legitimately concerned and listening to those affected for their prefered solutions, not declaring their own.so not wholly disagreeing, just disagreeing that its an ALL thing.","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"campaigning in a swing state which he currently leads in RCP by 2.2 is an indication that he expects to lose?","title":"Curious why the Dems did a full court press tonight?"},{"text":"How is this surprising at all??","title":"FBI finds hundreds of weapons at home of suspect in Arizona Democratic Party office shooting"},{"text":"Behind the seal of the President of the United States!!!!!!!","title":"Despite the media caterwauling, voters aren't buying that Trump is a 'threat to democracy'"},{"text":"We call him Gecko Man","title":"I cant imagine why people try to assassinate him."},{"text":"Not around here didn't.

People have to choose yet again between their own survival vs those abroad in this dumbass 2 party system.My concern with Israel are the followings. 1. AIPAC lobbying both to all U.S. political parties to siphon tax money. When most of the government spending is on the military and foreign nation it piss citizens off struggling with things like a recession and pandemic.2. Several U.S. states been sued for violating freedom of speech in boycotting and protesting Israel. Google American politicians making laws for a foreign nation at the cost of US citizens rights.3.  Look at how the IDF helps trained American police force and a fine example is the controversial Atlanta Cop City. Basically further militarization of cops and environmental damage despite massive and fierce protest by residents in how their tax dollars are used. The Republicans, Democrats, and even the non-partisan official are all in support of Cop City.4. The association of Zionism with Judaism allow fake cries of anti-semantic hate crimes especially with regards to protest on college campuses. This can censor free speech and research on certain topics. Doesnt help if you have X group students enrolled and their love ones in the Middle East is being bombed by Y group, whom the university majorly support organizations and corporations that funds the conflict that benefit Y group. Privileges be reinforcing stereotypes.5. As long there is war there will always be an enemy to identify and dehumanize. 20-30 years of western nations involved in the Middle East has lead to a surge of anti-brown skin Arabs/muslims sentiments, hate crimes, and invasive policies. Also the fixation on this target allow unchecked growth of far right groups such as white supremacist and Christian extremists to be more bold and rebrand themselves for the mainstream political stage.6. Israel being a fascist prick for land has lead to most of the middle eastern nation to unite against it despite attempts of tolerance for political and business deals with the West. Doesnt help when major superpowers get involved on both sides that the regional war could be part of a world war. Israel, the token white illegal settlement from 1948 in the predominantly brown Arab region could be the one to start WW3.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Which may get pushed back if he wins.

He was tried and convicted for 34 counts of falsifying business records, but he will never actually be punished for this because they keep pushing sentencing back.Have you ever wondered why so many lawsuits suddenly hit Trump all at once? It's not just one caseit's a wave of them, all happening simultaneously. The reason is clear: it's a political witch hunt. Trump has been a public figure for years, but the political establishment only began targeting him after he labeled them \\"the swamp\\" and vowed to \\"drain the swamp.\\" Beyond the lawsuits, there have been attempts to take him down through impeachments, the Mueller investigation, and even two or three assassination attempts. Trump has faced not just legal battles, but assaults from numerous directions, yet he remains resilient. Many people in his position would have folded already under pressure.He's been shown in multiple ways to have lots of deep connections to Jeffery Epstein.Trump, actually isn't the one who is scarred to have the Epstein client list released, it is many other former and current politicians. And they will do anything to keep it under wraps. Because of this, I believe that Donald Trump is immune to consequences, and will die without ever having received an actual punishment for his actions.The people I see who seem immune from consequences are the Clintons, Biden, and his son. Take the Hunter Biden laptop, for instanceits contents are out there for everyone to see, showing him in compromising situations, including being naked with minors and engaging in other despicable acts. Yet, he still hasn't been arrested on pedophilia charges. These aren't just allegations; this is actual evidence, and he should have been arrested long ago, but he's still walking free. Why? Because the same political machine thats targeting Trump is turning a blind eye to actual criminals with clear evidence. I could list many more examples of this kind of double standard. So, if you're angry that Trump seems immune to consequences, just know that many conservatives are equally outraged that Democrats seem to be. I think your hatred for Trump has given you tunnel vision, where all you can focus on are his alleged crimes. Thats not a healthy perspective.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is literally immune to consequences"},{"text":"This makes absolutely no sense seeing that we never seen a former president face any consequences for what they did.\\nTrump is legit the only president that has been held to fire for things that most would call bullshit if it was a democrat","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is literally immune to consequences"},{"text":"He should be fine in Georgia.

The pre-revolutionary Cuban government was literally a US-backed dictatorship, so I'm not sure what your point is there.My point would be that if your choices are between liberalizing or becoming more authoritarian, you don't get a free pass on culpability just because your dictatorship of the proletariat is threatened. Well certainly there are major restrictions on press in Ukraine now, and there were too in Britain in WW2.I think Ukraine's press restrictions are pretty reasonable given that they're in a war. Some of the UK's restrictions were reasonable, interning \\"dangerous\\" foreigners was overbroad. But the UK has always had issues with overbroad censorship, even now.  The paper still generally puts Cuba's health statistics as very high for the region (especially given its position in the economy), but I can buy that the stats are inflated.I'm not arguing that Cuba is some irredeemable economic shithole, it's definitely on the more successful end of socialist states, mainly due to Soviet aid and trade deals.

For the uneducated like myself, is he well liked among the populace? Does his word carry much weight?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 23, 2024 - 13 days until election day!"},{"text":"The timeline you imply is not accurate. The proper timeline is as follows: * The Cuban revolution succeeds. * Castro was generally willing to maintain friendly relations with the US, although relations became strained after he was rejected by the President. * Cuba implements the first agricultural reform act, which causes the US to begin the hostility we know towards Cuba today and start planning the overthrow of Castro. I personally think it is important to note here that taking back land that was essentially stolen by US companies (by forced stipulations written in the constitution after the Spanish-American war and by US-backed dictators) is not really a moral wrong, but that's personal preference I guess. * Cuba and the USSR establish diplomatic relations (not necessarily being allies, as the US and the USSR also had diplomatic relations at this time). * More nationalisation of land and properties, with compensation towards landowners that was comparable to the land reform of Japan post WW2. * The US imposes the economic embargo on Cuba.So to me, a reading of the [timeline](https://1997-2001.state.gov/regions/wha/cuba_chronology.html) implies that Cuba only really became strong allies with the USSR after the embargo. This is not all how it's generally presented.You make a good point that trade with China and Vietnam only really kicked off after the USSR fell, but why not for Cuba too? Also offering to house nuclear launch sites for a country fundamentally opposed to the one you want to trade with is a great way to take that trade off the table.Again, this was after the Bay of Pigs invasion and the terrorism of Operation Mongoose (I'm not choosing this word lightly, this is the word the CIA themselves chose). I too, would want a deterrent if I had been invaded by a much more powerful country and they were discussing another invasion. What does international trade have to do with gay rights? What does it have to do with censorship? What does it have to do with human rights violations? Nothing. Those things have nothing to do with international trade. Labor laws theres a slightly argument but at the same time international trade doesnt have a lot to do with workplace safety and anti discrimination.For gay rights, I'll copy what I posted in the main post: One other notable area of improvement, especially given the awful policy I detailed in the last section, is that of LGBT rights. Now, while there were still horrible stains on their policies throughout the 80s and so on (such as the Mariel boat lift), [Cuba decriminalised homosexuality in 1979](https://coha.org/from-persecution-to-acceptance-history-of-lgbt-in-cuba/), well before other Western nations [such as the US which only decriminalised it everywhere in 2003](https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/19/us/lgbt-rights-milestones-fast-facts/index.html). Moreover, in 1979 [Cuba established the Multidisciplinary Commission for Attention to Transsexuals, which treated gender-transition issues as a health problem](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6293354/) (although this was of course flawed and cancelled) and [since 2008 have provided all health care for gender reassignment surgeries to its citizens](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN06395397/), something which the US is not close to doing at all. [Cuba was the first Latin American country to celebrate LGBTQ+ history month](https://www.reuters.com/article/cuba-lgbt-history/cuba-marks-latin-americas-first-lgbtq-history-month-idUSL5N2WV5FH/), has [set up a government agency to promote acceptance of sexual diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Sex_Education), and while it was certainly a bit late [has legalised same-sex marriage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/24/cuba-same-sex-marriage-referendum/). For censorship, it can be linked back to the fact that the US has previously used freedom of the press to overthrow other governments. See my detailing of the situation in Guatemala in the OP. I recognise it's long, but I do genuinely think that while regrettable and I certainly don't agree with it, it is completely understandable why you would want to shut off an avenue that has previously been used by the US to overthrow governments.Now you're a bit vague on the other human rights violations, but I agree there are others. For example, the crackdown on religion. But this is as the US has literally used the Catholic church in other countries as an avenue regime change, again see my OP if you're interested for (Western) sources. Or freedom of movement? Well, the US has literally trained Cuban exiles in other countries to then come back and commit terrorist acts via Operation Mongoose, so there is reason to be cautious of this.Again, I want to make clear that I don't support the curtailing of freedoms. But it's clear that there is a direct link between most specific human rights violations and US policy that has been used to either try and overthrow Cuba, or at least other countries.If you have specific examples you wanna discuss, do let me know.","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"[80% of the sugar that Cuba produced was sold in the US](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/jq085j963/sf2688339/ft848t829/ERSF-03-07-1962_Cuba_Shifts_Trade_in_Farm_Products_to_Soviet_Bloc.pdf)","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"I am not exactly a fan of their economic system and certainly would rather them liberalise it and allow more worker cooperatives and so on","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"without making them one bit more free.

The Biden administration came in with a majority in the house and senate, knowing who Trump was, and what he did after Jan 6, and he hasn't faced a single consequence for his actions and has been allowed to come a hair's-breadth away from being the most powerful man in the country again.

Harris and the Democrats need to go on offense when it comes to the topic of inflation.  What I mean by that is they simply should bring up the fact that the United States has had less severe inflation than a large part of the rest of the world post-pandemic. Sure thats not going to help peoples own financial burdens, but a lightning bolt isnt going to come down on her and everybody if she mentions it.  Theres a delegate way to articulate it without offending people I guarantee it. I also guarantee you *many* Americans do not know this about inflation because many voters are tuned out of the news, and the news also barely mentions it to begin with. Mention stuff how there was a manufacturing recession under Trump, and that was before Covid.

Also, I know Biden statistically is an unpopular President, but its not going to hurt for Harris to bring up some of the basic accomplishments they got done during the administration  (Infrastructure bill, Chips Act, ARP bill, IRA bill, expanding the ACA, strengthening NATO).

They know he is, or they don't. But more importantly, they don't care. It doesn't matter that he's a fraudster, a felon, a fascist, a fake. They don't care that he's a pervert and a pedo. It's why all the truth-telling about him hasn't ended his campaign like it literally would have for anyone else who had done merely a fraction of the shit he has done.I think Trump's supporters really do see him as a way to get even with the people they hate. And if he wins and wrecks the country, they'll be miserable, but they'll blame it on the Democrats because that's who they are and what they do. Just like him, they would rather be miserable than own responsibility for how they got in this mess.

You acknowledge that policy wise (which is what matters) there is little to no difference between Biden, Harris and Trump. Sure Trump is more openly bigoted, but I dont think it is even practically possible for Trump to be worse than Biden in terms of actual policy towards Israel/Palestine.?2.?Currently the Israel lobby can boast it has a bipartisan consensus of support: i.e it doesnt matter who wins.??there can be a stronger push with protests and grassroots movements in the next 4 yearsThe evidence seems to suggest that the Democratic leadership will just ignore any progressive policy push - at least when it comes to Israel.?Politicians change the policy stance when they think they need to do so to win more votes. Otherwise they dont care.?For instance, after Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 Democrats spent much, much more effort trying to appeal to the blue collar men the lost in the Rust Belt to Trump. If all those people had voted solidly blue they could have been safely ignored.?So the only way to get the Democratic party to change, so as to get *any* US government *ever* to actually change policy and try to prevent Israels actions against Palestinians, is to convince Democrats that they will pay an electoral price if they dont, and that is why some people dont want to vote for them this time. Not because Trump would be better, but because it might mean a **future president** could be better, as opposed to the status quo.?Also remember **Harris could still change before election day**. All the messaging about people saying they wont vote for her because of her stance on Gaza could very well convince her or her team that she needs to embrace a different policy to win - which then allows all those people to vote for her, get her elected, **and** have her actually get tough on Israel and save the lives of people on the ground. A win-win.?3. Some people think thousands of people being murdered, in what they see as genocide, in some cases including their friends or relatives, is more important than any issue of domestic policy, even Supreme Court seats.?Can you see how this might be the case? Imagine it was your own community being killed: would you be inclined to vote for a candidate supporting that, regardless of the alternative??4. Some people vote on principle: they arent willing to endorse in any form, such as by voting, a candidate they think is morally bankrupt, whether Trump or Harris. Not everyone is so cynical as to be willing to back the lesser of two evils, especially if you think that someone who cant express empathy for children burned alive in Gaza is unlikely to care about people at home either.?-Im not saying I personally agree with this cost-benefit analysis about not voting vs voting, but I tried to explain why some people are making that choice, or at least threatening to withhold their support.?","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Which aerospace company in Phoenix was applying on his behalf for top secret clearance?

Maricopa County prosecutor Neha Bhatia said at Jeffrey Michael Kellys initial court appearance on Wednesday that federal agents told her about the large seizure made after Kellys arrest. Scopes, body armor and silencers were also found, she said. A machine gun was discovered in the car he was driving. The sheer size of the cache led authorities to believe this person was preparing to commit an act of mass casualty, Bhatia said. Police said Kelly, 60, allegedly fired BB pellets and then gunshots at the glass front door and a window of the Arizona Democrats field office in Tempe. Police found three .22 caliber bullet casings while searching Kellys trash, according to court documents. Nobody was inside during the shootings in the early morning hours of Sept. 16, Sept. 23 and Oct. 6. Kelly is also accused of hanging several political signs lined with razor blades on Tuesday in Ahwatukee, an affluent suburb of Phoenix where most voters have chosen Democrats in recent elections. Authorities said he also hung plastic bags holding a white powder labeled biohazard from those signs. Authorities said the hand-painted signs were attached to palm trees and appeared to criticize Democrats and their presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. Kelly was being held on three felony counts of acts of terrorism and four other counts related to the shootings, according to police. A $500,000 cash bond was set with a requirement for house arrest and an ankle monitor in the event he is able to raise that amount. Kellys next appearance was set for the morning of Oct. 29 in Maricopa County Superior Court. The Tempe location was one of 18 Harris field offices in Arizona where Democrats gathered to organize Harris campaign efforts. It was shut down after the last shooting, police said.","title":"Suspect in shootings of Democratic office in Arizona had over 200 guns in his home, officials find"},{"text":"Yeah.

And communist countries can't really credibly complain that they're not allowed access to the very same exploitative capitalist markets that they seek to destroy.I mean from a geopolitical perspective I totally get this, it's why the cold war happened after all. But alright, sure, the US decides not to trade with Cuba. Why does the embargo attempt to prohibit foreign companies from trading with Cuba as much as possible then? This isn't just a decision that they'd rather not trade with Cuba, but a genuine decision to attempt to cripple the economy. And it has been described as such in CIA documents. Why is that certain? And why does that matter? If you can't survive as a country without being authoritarian why do you deserve to continue to exist? And does whatever justification you have for this apply the pre-revolutionary Cuban government.Well, just look at the unclassified documents regarding operation mongoose and the bay of pigs invasion. The pre-revolutionary Cuban government was literally a US-backed dictatorship, so I'm not sure what your point is there. Depends on the restrictions.Well certainly there are major restrictions on press in [Ukraine now](https://rsf.org/en/shrinking-press-freedom-ukraine-urgent-need-implement-roadmap-right-information), and there were too in [Britain in WW2](https://theconversation.com/world-war-ii-began-75-years-ago-with-censorship-chaos-that-echoes-down-the-decades-31607). Almost any country that views itself at risk of losing a war does this, I'd like to see any example to the contrary. Well, for example, Cuban doctors were found to be classifying neonatal deaths as late fetal deaths to reduce their infant mortality numbers.Sure, okay this appears to be reasonable, so !delta for that. The paper still generally puts Cuba's health statistics as very high for the region (especially given its position in the economy), but I can buy that the stats are inflated. Yes, as a leftist you infantilize non-white people because your worldview relies on Western Countries being the only actors that can influence world events.Ok, thanks for telling me how I think, I guess. This just isn't true though? There is obviously China to point at in the modern day, and historically this just isn't true in the slightest. The most powerful regions have shifted over time, and it just so happens that today and recently it happens to have been the US and Europe. I don't see why this fact is somehow infantilising. I don't feel infantilised to know that our prime minister (Australia) was undemocratically sacked in 1975, for example, or that we are currently undergoing one of the most insane trade deals in our history with AUKUS due to our need to say yes to what the US wants, or even the fact we have so many military bases in our country that our government is not even allowed to understand what happens. It's just a fact.  The Cubans literally did that.Sure, and that was incredible. But do I expect it? No, of course not. Do you expect it? Do you think it's somehow shameful if someone doesn't rise up in arms to likely throw themselves into death at the hands of their government? Indeed, liberalizing the economy is very good for standards of living. Cuba should consider it.But [they have](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55967709)? The [percentage of workers in the private sector has risen from 8% in 1981 to 35% in 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Cuba), and the economy has only regressed. If you're talking about the Bay of Pigs, the US didn't invade but, Cuba expropriated property from American companies.There certainly was an attempted invasion. It is considered a failed invasion by every source I've seen. A failed invasion is still an invasion. Yes, Cuba expropriated property from American companies, but those companies literally only owned it in the first place thanks to the stipulations put on Cuba in the Spanish-American war, and then the series of US-backed dictators to let the amount of Cuban land owned by foreign companies grow at the expense of the people. Ok, what does this have to do with Cuba or its responsibility for its own mismanagement?It has to do with what I was responding to?

Capitalist countries can only trade with other capitalist countries, and communist countries can only trade with other communist countries?Capitalist countries might not want to trade with communist countries that expropriate the property of companies. And communist countries can't really credibly complain that they're not allowed access to the very same exploitative capitalist markets that they seek to destroy. Yes, there is some fault on the Cuban government. But there is the important implication that the US certainly would have overthrown the government without those restrictions.Why is that certain? And why does that matter? If you can't survive as a country without being authoritarian why do you deserve to continue to exist? And does whatever justification you have for this apply the pre-revolutionary Cuban government.What do you think of the restrictions of freedoms in Ukraine right now, for example? Or in Britain during WW2? Do you support those?Depends on the restrictions. What things did I point to that were lies?Well, for example, Cuban doctors were found to be classifying [neonatal deaths as late fetal deaths](https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/33/6/755/5035051?login=false) to reduce their infant mortality numbers.But regardless, I don't think the South Koreans were responsible for the brutal policy of the dictator Syngman Rhee that the US imposed, or Indonesia's awful policy after the US-backed coup to install a dictator in their place.Yes, as a leftist you infantilize non-white people because your worldview relies on Western Countries being the only actors that can influence world events. Frankly, I'd find it hard to remove a dictator from my country if there was one, especially one that was supported by a powerful foreign country. I don't see why we expect other people to be any different.The Cubans literally did that.The Soviets in say, 1980 lived a much better live than the Cubans did.And? China genuinely has gone through an insane economic growth, especially since the Deng reforms.Indeed, liberalizing the economy is very good for standards of living. Cuba should consider it. The US invaded Cuba. What did Cuba do beforehand to lead to this?If you're talking about the Spanish-American war. Maybe blew up an American ship. If you're talking about the Bay of Pigs, the US didn't invade but, Cuba expropriated property from American companies.

If that evidence existed, prosecutors from all over the nation would've hopped on this case immediately. Since this evidence doesn't exist, no court will hear this case.Trump won't get consequences for these things because either the prosecution fucked the case up or there's simply nothing to prosecute him for due to a lack of evidence. This is not me 'defending him' or whatever, I'm just explaining why he will likely not get punished for these three things.My attempt to change your view: I would say losing the election was a consequence of his own actions. It's safe to assume that it was his own doing that lost the election; people didn't like him, so they didn't vote for him.

Mot hiring sexist anti-worker Larry Summers for a 3rd administration is kind of a low bar, but fair enough.I am arguing that forcing the Dems to build a coallition through the primary process did far more to get progressive policy wins than 2% voting for an independent ever has.I am arguing that Democrats move right unless challenged from the left. You seem to agree other than that you think the challenge can be from inside the Democrats in a Squad sort of way.What you were arguing, in correspondence with this, is that \\"vote blue no matter who\\" moves the Democrats to the right and that threatening mutually assured destruction by voting third party and costing the Dems the election will push them left.I am arguing that specific point. I am arguing that we must organize to move them left before the elections and then organize to move them left after the elections. I absolutely do not agree with you that we should try to move them left by refusing to vote for them during the election itself (unless there is no credible Republican challenger, in which case the playing field is very different).What? So lgbtq activists have to fight the system and deal with condescension from their self-declared allies and moral panic and death threats from Republicans and then the Democrats can take credit after the fact and say look the system works?Life isn't perfect. Lincoln is universally acclaimed for freeing the slaves despite the fact that he dragged his feet on the issue at every stop. He was not some sort of morally pure abolitionist. He resisted emancipation as a manner of trying to keep the Union together up until the Civil War itself, when he no longer had anything to lose.Giving credit where credit is due is the job of historians and biographers. At the end of the day, the slaves were freed. A moral tragedy was ended. Millions of lives were vanquished from literal hell and society was able to move forward.We voted blue no matter who on Obama despite his pathetic stance on gay marriage. Doing so meant that millions of gay people in this country could finally get married. If you think it wasn't worth it because Obama is getting more credit than he deserves then I completely disagree. I don't think many lgbt people would agree with you that they'd sacrifice basic human rights in order to prevent too generous of a canonization of Obama.This isn't a moral purity test. You are not voting to signal to everyone your virtues. You are using a tool at your disposal to try to make the conditions as good as possible for making society better. If the next four years is Kamala and the Democrats regretfully enacting progressive policy that hey've resisted for years and then championing it as their own then sign me the fuck up. It isn't perfect, but it's far better than the alternative.Shame is weak leverage. Have you heard the press secretary talk about Gaza politicians have no shame.Shaming the Dems about healthcare reform did nothing for years. Until it did. Shaming the Dems about gay marriage did nothing for years. Until it did. Shaming the Dems about marijuana legalization did nothing for years. Until it did. Unfortunately change is sometimes hard and messy and takes longer than we wish it would.You know what has never worked? Abstaining/voting third party as a fuck you to the Dems with hopes that they will learn their lesson and move to the left. We've seen time and time again that this strategy does absolutely nothing to win progressive policy. Your argument that shame isn't a perfect solution does nothing to change my point that voting in a manner that helps Republicans is a non-solution.As opposed to real reality where people did what you said works and we got a conservative court and an abortion ban anyway?We got this for many reasons but a big one is that people like you ABANDONED VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO. If Hillary had gotten even normal Democratic turnout, or if Green party voters in Michigan had instead voted Hillary, she would have been president and she would have appointed three liberal justices. We could have had either a 6-3 or 7-2 Supreme Court for fucking DECADES.

The author of that piece goes into the fact that reasonable people would never follow someone that breaches the peace like Mr. King.  And in that article they reference his number of arrests, and how his followers only seem to follow him more, and there are more of them after each arrest.  Now, you have the benefit of retrospect and you get to draw conclusions about those charges they put on MLK, and you get to see the movement that he created and how the people in that movement viewed those same charges at the time they were being applied to MLK.  Looking back it is pretty easy to conclude that those people in the moment those charges were being made were able to draw the correct moral conclusion about those charges and see past them.I dare say that in this analogy, you are one of the people so hellbent to believe the charges you are unable to see why MLK has a following.  And just like those people unable to see why MLK has a following you seem more concerned with chasing your own tail about your version of propriety and viciously stay in your own bubble rather than try to think outside of it.So you have removed any of the topics that would cause you to face things outside of your bubble.  the legal mechanism to get those 34 convictions had never been used before.  And it overlooks that the counterparty is not claiming any injury, they did not lose a cent on the loans they made.  But the DA ran a political campaign that said she was going to get Trump.  Get that, the person running for office said that they would explicitly \\"get\\" Trump and they have to invent new legal theories to even try.  If this is not government overreach then no such thing exists.  So, if you are a supporter of Trump and you see this, are you going to be persuaded that Trump did anything wrong?  The New York appellate court proceedings about this case are an absolute disaster for the prosecution.  So now the actual legal minds seem to be on the same page as the Trump supporters.Here is another thought experiment.  Let's say that the legislature in your state passed a law that said that any acts from 20 years ago can now be brought in a civil court overriding the previous 7 year limitation for the sole purpose of allowing a case against u/razorbeamz  and then that case is brought against you.  Do you think your supporters would think that is fair?  What if your accuser seemed especially wackadoodle?  Do you think your supporters would think that was fair?But as for your actual question, that wackadoodle person brought forth a civil case against Trump saying he assaulted her (After the law was changes expressly so that she could do this) and Trump was found civilly liable for the assault.  He had to pay.  You want him to pay consequences, this is it.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is literally immune to consequences"},{"text":"Reopen the 2022 case against him?

I thought it was weird and rude that the media refused to call Zimmerman Hispanic.  That was when there was first a media implication that being called white was an insult.  At the same time, in Maricopa County the School Board was having a pitched battle trying to remove one Hispanic CRT program from one high school.  It was the same CRT -- oppressor, oppressed, colonialism, human value based on skin color, etc.  Marxism using race instead of wealth.  They had a charismatic teacher with Mexican heritage and many Hispanic students in a poor school district.  Their activist marches and posters, significantly about La Raza (spelling uncertain, translation \\"The Race\\") alerted concerns of many parents and staff, as well as the anti-American slant.  So back then I believed that CRT was in fact some random obscure college subject.  Only to see it had rolled in again full blown, disguised as African American History, after George Floyd died.Watching the exact same CRT \\"defenses\\" used in Maricopa County trotted out in exactly the same deceitful way again was infuriating.  Many people teaching their kids at home during Covid started complaining about the \\"woke\\" curriculum.  Only to be immediately attacked with claims that people are just racist and objecting to true history and that CRT is never taught except at colleges and all the same lies and nonsense.  Florida shut it down in their K-12 public schools exactly the same way that Maricopa County did.  They passed a law saying that no one can teach that people are oppressors or oppressed based on skin color, heritage, things that happened long before they were born, etc.So, thanks Obama.","title":"Obama Cant Understand How America Got So ToxicDividedBitter.

NOW, in current times, I think more working class voters are more savvy, striving to be more informed, and demanding results right now, then you'll get the votes. I think this has been pretty salient with Progressives or those who have Progressive leanings at times, because many Arab-American voters and Muslim voters also share many viewpoint alignments with many Progressives. Watching the nomination get stolen from Bernie Sanders in 2016 drove off a lot of Progressives. Then seeing Fetterman, Sinema and AOC basically turn into establishment cutouts also was pathetic but also a betrayal. Then Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush, just descending into total lunacy which basically poisoned any chance of moderates finding common ground with many Progressives. I can see why Cenk Uygur keeps screaming into the camera. Don't get me wrong, I disagree with Cenk on a lot of things. But his mantra was always to win elections, get Progressives into a true small voting block that could force change. If you had enough seats in the House or Senate, you could leverage the entire Party for more populist policy to help the working class. Instead it's clear that winning elections alone isn't going to do it. Because you'll just get more pathetic turncoats like AOC. Wearing a dress that says \\"Tax The Rich\\", an expensive one, going to a gala with the \\"elites\\", being unmasked while all the \\"servants\\" were masked, then taking in a ticket worth 30K, violating FEC regulations, is gutless. It's embarassing. She's only a Progressive as cosplay. The worst hypocrites will only regret their choices if it costs them their seat, their elected office, their job, their career or all their money. So I think the current Muslim strategy against Harris now is the right long term decision. Show what it costs you to choose a different path.

Capitalist countries can only trade with other capitalist countries, and communist countries can only trade with other communist countries? Why can the US trade with Vietnam and China, then? But you get that even if that were true it would still be the fault of the Cuban government, right?Yes, there is some fault on the Cuban government. But there is the important implication that the US certainly would have overthrown the government without those restrictions. In a way, these restrictions can be seen as self-defence.

The average Soviet or Red Chinese lived in poverty compared to the average American.The Soviets in say, 1980 lived a much better live than the Cubans did. Sure, it wasn't like someone in Manhattan, but they weren't destitute. China genuinely has gone through an insane economic growth, especially since the Deng reforms. And you'd be unwilling to countenance the same argument if applied to the US. I.E. The US' actions were Cuba were in response to Cuba so it's Cuba's fault.The US invaded Cuba.

It implies that the majority of Americans have given this maniac a pass. That simply is not the truth.

For example, Trump has been ordered to pay \\\\~$450m for civil fraud after a Feb 16 2024 decision; I would certainly consider that \\"facing consequences\\", even if Trump will do his best to appeal/stall.However, the list also includes costs that we know that Trump has actually paid. (There could be more, but we know of at least several cases.) For example:* Trump really *did* have to post a $91.6m bond for defamation. (Even if an insurance company helps post the bond, Trump will obviously have to pay the insurance company.)\\n* Trump really *did* pay $400,000 in legal fees to the NYT after a Jan 12 2024 decision.\\n* Trump really *did* pay $5m to a court-controlled account after being found liable for sexual assault and defamation in a May 9 2023 decision\\n* Trump really *did* pay $1m in sanctions after a Jan 19 2023 decision\\n* The Trump Organization really *did* pay $1.6m for tax fraud after a Jan 13 2023 decision.These are all pretty clear examples of actual money that has actually been transferred out of Trump accounts to someone else after definitive legal decisions.Also, even given your addendum, these certainly seem \\"significant\\" to me. A $91.6m bond is a significant chunk of money for someone with \\\\~$400m in cash and liquid assets (per Forbes again), and a $450m fine for civil fraud is *huge* for someone with only \\\\~$2.6b total net worth in comparison (per Forbes again). That's about 20% of his worth in legal costs from that suit alone!","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is literally immune to consequences"},{"text":"Let's deal with your examples:**1. He was tried and convicted for 34 counts of falsifying business records, but he will never actually be punished for this because they keep pushing sentencing back. I'm fully convinced if he eventually does get sentenced, it'll be a pathetic slap on the wrist.**This is... a hypothetical? You're *assuming* he won't get punished and using that as an example of him not getting punished? This is completely invalid right off the bat.**2. He's been shown in multiple ways to have lots of deep connections to Jeffery Epstein. However this is not taken seriously by the media and his supporters completely ignore it.**Jeffery Epstein was a socialite. He knew lots of people, and being his associate or having visited his home doesn't necessarily mean someone is guilty of sex crimes.(Do you feel *exactly* the same about Bruce Willis, Cameron Diaz, and Cate Blanchett? They have also been associated with Epstein in released court documents!)It's absolutely worth investigating if any of Epstein's associates were complicit, but unless you have evidence that Trump *participated* in sex crimes or that sex crimes occurred while Trump was actively at Epstein's home, I don't see how you would ever impose consequences for mere association. The US legal system is founded on a presumption of innocence until proven guilty.**3. Everything involving Jan 6.**This is... again a hypothetical. The election interference case to determine whether Trump will face consequences for Jan 6 or not is still in progress.It's not even *stalled*; Jack Smith has actively revised his motion given the SC ruling, and the judge permitted early release of a vast swathe of evidence (despite Trump's objections). The trial was delayed by the SC but the case is still very much in progress.Complex legal trials very often take years. Trump's case isn't even taking *particularly* long for the context.**4. Generally, he's just immune to scandals. Nothing he's been attacked with has ever stuck.**This is not an example, just restating your belief as an assertion.So of your 4 \\"examples\\":* 1 is not an example at all, just an assertion\\n* 2 are hypotheticals; you are *assuming* he will not face consequences in legal trials that are still ongoing\\n* 1 is unclear as to what consequences you would even *want* given the evidence; are you SURE you want legal consequences imposed merely based on association? And if you just want 'social' consequences (e.g. a damaged reputation), are you saying Trump's reputation was *not* damaged by the Epstein files?","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is literally immune to consequences"},{"text":"Republiguns","title":"FBI finds hundreds of weapons at home of suspected shooter of Arizona Democratic Party office"},{"text":"how the *fuck* does one acquire **hundreds** of guns...

My general thesis on the authoritarian policy of Cuba is that most of it can be attributed as a way to avoid the regime change that the US had organised in many other countries which had similar elections or revolutions.But you get that even if that were true it would still be the fault of the Cuban government, right?Other countries trying to destabilize your country isn't a free pass to be authoritarian.I know I labour the point [\\"labour\\"](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/inglouriousbasterds/images/2/26/Archie_Hicox_and_his_three_fingers.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130430144921)Now, despite the many awful policies that Cuba has domestically, despite this they have managed to push the country forward in so many directionsYa, lying about your social statistics was really revolutionary. Here, I generally want to make the point that much of Cubas foreign policy was good, actually, and where it wasnt again it is understandable in the light of being at risk of being overthrown by the US government.Again, I get that you're a leftist so your first instinct is to infantilize brown people, but fundamentally a country is responsible for it's own policy. Finally, I want to talk about the economy. I want to point out that first of all, Im no fan of central planning. I generally support more libertarian approaches such as worker cooperatives, and the idea of public and private competition in markets to get the best of both worlds. But its clear through, say, the rapid economic development of China and even the economy of the USSR that central planning alone does not condemn a country to poverty.Ehh, kinda does. The average Soviet or Red Chinese lived in poverty compared to the average American. At the end of the day your view relies on viewing Cuba as solely a reactive state. Which it obviously isn't. And you'd be unwilling to countenance the same argument if applied to the US. I.E.

The only option I see is to push away the USSR while under embargo to massively hurt their own economy, and hope the US finally decides it's been too harsh and lets up the sanctions. To me, that doesn't sound like a reasonable policy.","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"[80% of the sugar that Cuba produced was sold in the US](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/jq085j963/sf2688339/ft848t829/ERSF-03-07-1962_Cuba_Shifts_Trade_in_Farm_Products_to_Soviet_Bloc.pdf)","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"I am not exactly a fan of their economic system and certainly would rather them liberalise it and allow more worker cooperatives and so on","title":""},{"text":"","title":""},{"text":"without making them one bit more free.

Alright.","title":"I'm Billy Graham's Granddaughter and I'm Voting for Kamala Harris | Opinion"},{"text":"Probably? Just because they have the most influence does not mean people listen.All those corporations just throwing away billions on ads for no reason and no effect on public ideas?It is not just anacdotes lol.Ok so what are the stats or studies on this specifically?Huh? This is not about good and bad, this is about better and worse. One direction makes the country better, and one direction makes the country worse.Good/bad better/worse this is a strange semantic argument.Lesser evil voting is not a direction though. No matter who means that the direction doesnt matter as long as its not the Republican. Right?Me to my friend. If you havent met a single leftist who doesnt vote because they say they cannot stand voting for the right wing democrats, you must not be talking to the same people.I have but I am in a blue state and a town with only democrats elected to office. But yes I am likely more familiar with leftist internal discussion than someone on Reddit with not IRL experience.  Other than anti-electoral anarchists who think any democratic vote legitimizes power or the state anyone serious on the left has a strategy of some kind they are pushing but typically the largest contingent even among anarchists is harm mitigation or lesser evil.It is odd to me to stress out over this marginal mostly blue-state vote when the total number of non-voters is the size of the Republican or Democrat vote.If midwestern arabs dont vote for Biden, Democrats will blame socialists in Oxnard California rather than admit theyd rather support genocide and alienate swaths of the population.This is just not commendable though. How does making things worse for Gazans by enabling Trump to get elected help the cause? It doesnt. Why are Democrats funding and aiding a right-wing regime that openly wants Trump\\nTo be President. Imagine Biden giving Putin 17 billions.In order to go to the far left, we have to first move left. We cannot get to the far left by moving right. Like, how does that even make sense?Democrats arent left though - thats the problem. Lack of left wing opposition in the US, so the country always officially leans right regardless of popular sentiment.This is the nonsense part. If people actually voted blue no matter who, then we would be moving rapidly to the left. Liberalism is not left. I think we just have different ideological understandings.The reason that we are moving to the right is not that blue no matter who is a bad strategy, it is that we do not employ the strategy nearly enough. When was a third party a legitimate threat in an election? Democrat pundits love to scapegoat the left.You are operating under this strange assumption that blue no matter who is a reality, it is not. How is it not has the left coalesced behind Stein or West when I wasnt looking?It is a saying precisely because it is not a reality, and people say the saying in order to advocate that we adhere to the strategy. If everyone voted blue no matter who, no one would need to say vote blue no matter who.They are saying it to stifle dissent and get everyone in lock step. Ive spent a year on here and when I criticize democrats without ever advocating non-voting, I get attacked as a bot, a Trumper, a Putin agent, etc etc. There is no winning coalition on the left outside of democrats. That is the point. Well ok, I agree this isnt actually a democratic system and should probably be replaced wholesale.Left wing parties other than the democrats just enable rightward movement. The Democrats are not a left-wing party. They sometimes claim to be social liberals but officially outside the squad maybe theres not much of a left in the Democrats anymore.","title":"CMV: Vote Blue No Matter Who is why US official politics skews right"},{"text":"To attempt to amend one of your points: even if the embargo hurt Cuba economically, that doesnt mean they would have fared well without it.
