It allows people to enter the country and they will be treated like dirt from their employer and they have to constantly look over their shoulder. Also and I know it is a trope from racists but let's say you are a criminal and seek to get into the US, you literally can't get in legally in most cases. Stronger border security and allowing in a lot of the contributing immigrants legally is ideal and Republicans will probably support that more now that they have a strong share of the Latino vote in this election.Another is Israel. A lot of dems falsely see themselves as left wing. If you're looking into left wing standpoints, you will see a love for Palestine. With Israel constantly getting worse there and less of a consensus on Israel, this may become a real issue for dems.

Everyone completely differs on when personhood begins and ends. And once again this is just a distraction from the main issue, because lets say the embryo/fetus is considered a full person right at the moment of conceptionso what? That still doesnt give them the right to use another persons organs when that person doesnt want to share their organs with this person. So why are we even taking about the concept of personhood when it doesnt matter even if the fetus is a full person?(Note: I'm not pro-life at all)The entire point of the personhood argument is that it *does* matter. This is the heart of the pro-life position, and it is very consistent. If you think that life begins before birth, then you *h*ave *to* believe that abortion is murder (and that miscarriage is manslaughter, although few people were willing to just outright say that until recently), and thus you *have* to oppose it if you don't support murder.So there are three reasons pro-choice arguments lean so heavily on personhood:1. If you don't think life begins before birth, and if you can demonstrate that, then the entire case against abortion is just dead, kaput, gone. It would be like arguing that an appendectomy is wrong because the appendix is alive.\\n2. The development of a fetus has grounding in scientific evidence, and at least some people still value science.\\n3. If you concede that life begins before birth, then you now have to justify killing another living being, which is a much harder and uncomfortable argument to make. You get into trolley problem-type thought experiments and strained analogies that aren't convincing to most people and just come off as weird or suspicious.The famous \\"violinist argument,\\" for instance, is just really weak to me. The intuitive position of many people is that unplugging someone from life support constitutes an act of pre-meditated murder that is different from just letting someone die without action, and even pro-choice people might have that intuition. But more importantly, if you believe that *fetuses are not alive,* then the whole argument is an unnecessary concession to a pro-life talking point.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"They did so many things that could never be done today.

Its also obvious what his goals are (America making more money and having peace) and hes focused on getting the deal done, not playing nice with the deep state/MIC like most presidents.

Nearly half of swing voters who chose Trump made their decision in the final weeks, including 27% in the final days (15% in the last week, 12% on Election Day), suggesting they were genuinely up for grabs. This is substantially later than swing voters who broke for Harrisjust 15% of whom decided in the last week or on Election Day.* Misaligned Democratic Brand: In the eyes of swing voters who chose Trump, Democrats were misaligned on their top policy priorities. These voters were more likely to view Democrats as too focused on identity politics (67%) and not doing enough to address crime (68%). 75% of swing voters who chose Trump said it is accurate that Democrats are too focused on fighting Trump rather than bringing the country together. * Perception Gap: Over 80% of swing voters who chose Trump believed Harris held positions she didnt campaign on in 2024, including supporting taxpayer funding for transgender surgeries for undocumented immigrants (83%), mandatory electric vehicles by 2035 (82%), decriminalizing border crossings (77%), and defunding the police (72%).* Trust Crisis: Only 22% of swing voters who broke for Trump believed Harris prioritized Americans like me versus party activistsa stark contrast with the 80% who said Trump prioritizes Americans like me over party activists.[...]# The Democratic Brand ProblemSwing voters who broke for Trump express profound skepticism about what they perceive to be Democratic Party priorities. A striking 80% believe Trump prioritizes Americans like me compared to 22% who say the same about Harris. This fundamental trust gap extends across multiple high-salience issues.The data shows the swing voters who ultimately chose Trump see Democrats as misaligned with their values across three key areas. All percentages below represent the sum of those who rated each critique as extremely or very accurate.**Immigration &amp; Border Security**The consistency and intensity of border-related critiques from swing voters who chose Trump suggest this issue serves as a gateway for broader skepticism about Democratic priorities. *Percentage of swing voters who chose Trump characterizing the critique as extremely accurate or very accurate:** 77% C Democrats arent tough enough on the border crisis* 73% C Democrats support immigrants more than American citizens* 72% C Democrats dont care about securing the border**Economic Management**Swing voters who chose Trump delivered a comprehensive economic critique on both policy and priorities: 73% believed Democrats dont know how to manage the economy, and 59% saw the party as unwilling to tackle inflation.*Percentage of swing voters who chose Trump characterizing the critique as extremely accurate or very accurate:** 73% C Democrats dont know how to manage the economy* 65% C Democrats support out of control deficit spending**Cultural &amp; Identity Issues**Republicans cultural critiques stuck to Harris and to the national Democratic brand, tapping into existing anxiety about Democratic Party priorities. For example, these voters were more likely to view Democrats as too focused on identity politics (67%) and not doing enough to address crime (68%).*Percentage of swing voters who chose Trump characterizing the critique as extremely accurate or very accurate:** 75% C Democrats are too focused on fighting Trump rather than bringing the country together* 67% C Democrats are too focused on identity politics* 64% C Democrats divide the country instead of uniting it* 63% C Democrats have extreme ideas about race and gender* 62% C Democrats dont share the values that make America special# Policy Perception GapsThe Republicans successfully created and exploited large disconnects between Harriss 2024 policy positions and what swing voters believed about her views. These misalignments persisted despite the Harris campaigns messaging, showing how sweepingly the Republican narrative on Harriss positions took hold and shaped the lens of these voters. This, in turn, created the impression for too many swing voters that Democrats hold the most extreme possible version of left-of-center positions and would enforce them through policy.For instance, swing voters who chose Trump in the end believe Harris supports:* Using taxpayer dollars for transgender surgeries for undocumented immigrants (83%)* Requiring all cars to be electric by 2035 (82%)* Decriminalizing border crossings (77%)* Banning fracking (74%)* Defunding the police (72%)# ABOUT THE POLLBlueprint surveyed 3,262 national and swing state 2024 voters fielded over web panels on Nov. 6 and Nov. 7 and weighted to education, age, gender, race, and 2020/2024 election results. The margin of error is +/- 2.1. Full topline available here. [https://blueprint2024.com/polling/swing-voters-post-mortem-topline/](https://blueprint2024.com/polling/swing-voters-post-mortem-topline/)* Definition of swing voters: Our definition of swing voters includes those who are undecided in the presidential race, have changed their voting preference since 2020 (voting Democrat in one election and Republican in the other), or are independents who either indicate they split their votes between Democrats and Republicans, or who hold either favorable or unfavorable views of both Trump and Harris. We collected 3,623 total voters in our targeted swing states and 757 swing voters. \\n* 59% C Democrats are unwilling to reduce inflation* 54% C Democrats arent willing to stand up for working people","title":"Lost in Translation: Swing Voters Misperceptions of Harris And Late Turn To Trump"},{"text":"He would have had to have it removed when he was hospitalized after suffering a stroke and being gone for a long period of time.

That's a huge damage to Democracy that will now forever be ignored.  Republicans are allowed to coup, Democrats are not.We also normalized that Republicans can be violent and attack institutions of Democracy like voting centers and ballot boxes.  But Democrats cannot.  So now Republicans are allowed to destroy ballots they don't like and get away with it.We also normalized Republicans allowed to be racist, xenophobic, and bigoted all around.  They are allowed to say/do the most awful things and get more support from their party for it.  Republicans face no consequences for this.Republicans are allowed to steal national secrets and sell them to allies.  Or give them away publicly for free.  They can do this to the enthusiastic support of their base.  Democrats cannot.Republicans can commit blatant federal crimes and get away with it.  Trump, Gaetz, and the rest of the MAGA criminals are all guilty of various crimes but get pardons/case dismissals with roaring approval from Republicans.  Democrats face consequences for crimes but Republicans are all above the law.We have normalized 'sports teams politics' where Republicans happily vote explicitly against their own interest.  Sometimes they're even intelligent enough to see it and don't care.  Whereas Democrat voters pick over their candidate with a fine tooth comb, and will absolutely sabotage their own candidate whereas Republicans will vote anyone in with a pulse so long as they're Republican.  The more crimes the better it seems.These are the things we have normalized and more.  Republicans are allowed to be piles of absolute garbage and win elections.  Say the wrong thing a decade ago as a Democrat and you will lose.  We expect perfection from Democratic candidates from both sides of the aisles political lens.  But for Republican candidates there is no such examination, any loud criminal who lies enough will win.This means that Republican candidates will get even worse then Trump in the future but Democrat candidates will become increasingly scarce in victory as their own base tears them apart and let Republicans win.  That is what I see for the future, and it's rather bleak.","title":"It could take America 90 years to recover from the damage Trump is going to inflict on Democracy (also ditch X and go to BlueSky - spread the word!)"},{"text":"Hurt as in...

I ended up doing about 10 hours of work, comparing early versions of Linux and Minix, looking for copied code. To summarize, my analysis found no evidence whatsoever that any code was copied. When I called him to ask if he had any questions about the analysis methods or results, and to ask if he would like to have it repeated with other source comparison tools, I was in for a bit of a shock. Apparently, Ken was expecting me to find gobs of copied source code. He spent most of the conversation trying to convince me that I must have made a mistake, since it was clearly impossible for one person to write an OS and 'code theft' had to have occurred.Kenneth Brown in his own mind didn't knowingly lie, he was simply completely convinced of his beliefs and even though the researcher he commissioned disagreed, he held onto his opinion.

In fact, one could very well argue that they understand some things far better than the rest of the people. They are all about the cognitive side of human interaction, so they have a deep understanding about some sides of the human nature.You're wildly mistaken on the context of this quote. Spoilers obviously - Dumbledore's spirit gives this quote to Harry near the end of book 7 in a dreamlike version of Kings Cross, after Voldemore has \\"killed\\" Harry and presumed that he won.\\"That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and childrens tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.\\"Voldemort failed - over and over and over - because he failed to take notice of things which he considered beneath him. He didn't understand fairytales (the Deathly Hallows), so he never truly \\"earned\\" the Elder Wand by the terms of the legend - Draco Malfoy did, not Snape, so killing Snape accomplished nothing. He never understood love, so he could not understand how Lily's sacrifice protected Harry as a baby, nor did he understand why Snape would still be carrying a torch for her 17 years later and betray Voldemort over it. He didnt understand Narcissa's love for Draco, which is why *she* betrays Voldemort immediately after Harry resurrects. He didn't understand house elves loyalty to one who freed them, which led to Dobby saving Harry and his friends from Malfoy's dungeon. And he didn't understand how Harry could \\"beat\\" death as the character in the riddle did - by meeting him willingly.","title":"CMV: Harry Potter depicts human nature poorly"},{"text":"I didn't vote for it either, but until the American people realize there are consequences to poor electoral decisions, the beatings will continue.

When we say \\"women and children first\\" we aren't sanctioning the killing of men.  We are prioritizing the lives to save.  Conflating one with the other is a problem here.  Since you're not choosing between lives that will live in _most_ abortion scenarios, a prioritization based argument is non-sensical.  On the flip side, the prioritzation scenario does come into play when the mother's life is at risk which is why most pro-lifers make an exception for when the life of the mother is substantially at risk.2. Consciousness is cornerstone to when we think it's OK to kill humans.  While we allow suicide in some scenarios, we have no scenarios where we kill conscious humans without their consent other than capital punishment (or things that are clearly illegal - aka murder).  So...if you have a principle of \\"don't kill HUMANS that are conscious\\".  Your argument that consciousness requires memory is full of holes - we don't say people with memory problems aren't conscious we say they have memory problems.  The lack of memory of something shouldn't be conflated with \\"i wasn't conscious\\".  You were at 2 very, very clearly conscious by any reasonable definition.  That you don't remember it is no different than the fact that i was clearly conscious at dinner last night but I can't remember what I ate.3. The bodily autonomy argument does have problems itself, but they aren't problems _for you_.  However, a great number of people think that _for example_ if you don't use your body post birth to protect and care for your child then you're being neglectful.  E.G. you pick your kid up and if you just leave them there while they are having problems you're a criminal.  That requires your body to be used and if the child dies or you decide to kill them because you don't want to deal with the hassle, that's something we generally think is a problem.  Dependency on the parent is actually the very reason we have ideas of \\"neglect\\" in law, so how is it that you have decreased autonomy under law AFTER birth than you'd want while pregnant?","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"Bots often repost the same thing over and over.","title":"Undecided Young Voters Reveal Why They Chose Trump: Make America Normal Again"},{"text":"Sad thing is they still wont care","title":"Trump tariffs will make video game consoles up to 40% more expensive"},{"text":"Its the stupid, stupid.","title":"The educational divide driving American politics to the right"},{"text":"Chris Commuter will shrug, and go back to a very special \\"The Voice.\\"","title":"Underage Sex and Drugs Probe, Naked Photos and Secret Son: The Complete Guide to Matt Gaetzs Scandals"},{"text":"Like an even less competent Rumsfeld.","title":"Trumps Defense Secretary Pick Hopes for a Christian Crusade"},{"text":"And if there's one thing the Roberts court stands firmly behind, it's precedence!","title":"A pregnant woman sues for the right to an abortion in challenge to Kentuckys near-total ban"},{"text":"Gonna be recess appointment, and \\"deeply concerned\\" language from the likes of Collins.","title":"Gaetz Nomination Seen as Doomed by Some Senate Republicans, More Than 30 Republican Senators Might Vote No"},{"text":"MAGA globalism hits differently","title":"Putin claims 'new world order' is forming, congratulates Trump on election victory"},{"text":"I would pull my son from school so fast itd make his head spin.","title":"The boys in our liberal school are different now that Trump has won"},{"text":"That's disappointing.

I could talk all day about reasons to support Trump. Here's some:That just goes to reinforce the general idea. The vast majority of these points are just pure fantasy that no reasonable media outlet would report positively on. 1, 2 and 6 are just weird pablum for low information voters. Trump's track record on policy does not support, at all, a belief that he can achieve any of this (or is even interested in it). Trump could barely manage the debt (which he blew up) and his administration was woefully inneficient across the board. On top of that, nobody that knows anything about public health is reassured to see RFK Jr., a crazy person, \\"reform the FDA\\". There's no positive coverage of these things because they might as well be farts in the wind. I guess I'll grant 3 to an extent. 4 is more pablum. Trump couldn't even negotiate with his own government to get wall funding and some of the people in that government liked him. Meanwhile, he's an international laughing stock. There's no real reason to believe he'll manage to negotiate Putin out of a war, especially since he's shown to be a big fan of him (something that's apparently not worrisome at all for his voters). Again, there's no ground for positive coverage of these things. They're fantasy.   5 is pure fantasy. You won't find positive coverage of Trump's economic plan because the main building blocks of his economic plans - namely large, broad tariffs - are widely understood by experts to be damaging to the nation's economic health.

Since when is consciousness our main reason for determining whether its okay to kill a living being or not? We kill and torture animals all the time even thought it could be argued that some of them have an even greater sense of consciousness than we do (certain animals like orcas have more advanced areas of the brain compared to humans).As far as I know, consciousness as determinant of moral value is used in conjunction with other traits and tends to be within the scope of our species. By expanding it beyond this scope in the way that you have here, I'd say one trait, in conjunction with the capacity to deploy a subjective experience (eg consciousness), could be that the living being belongs to a species of rational thinking agents. To my knowledge, only a few other species are probably rational thinking agents (dolphins, ravens, orcas, other apes, etc) , so \\"killing other animals all the time\\" isn't always immoral under this framework. Therefore, once a fetus can deploy a subjective experience, it has moral value  I think the only good argument (and the one reason Ive always been pro-choice) is the argument of bodily sovereignty. Since bodily sovereignty is a value judgment, it is contingent on the capacity to deploy a subjective experience, such as consciousness. This means it cannot serve as an alternative to consciousness or other necessary subjective experiences, as it fundamentally relies on the existence of a subject capable of valuing autonomy. The judgment of bodily sovereignty presupposes a being with the capacity to experience and assert their autonomy. Therefore, bodily sovereignty is not a stand-alone argument but rather a derivative of these foundational traits.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"I think Gaza is overblown as an issue.

He has said this directly.3. He is committed to securing the southern border and greatly reducing the illegal immigration issue (or Asylum Loophole Abuse if u prefer that term). He is especially focused on deporting criminals who are here illegally and securing the border so they cannot just come back in. Yes he has said this directly.4. He is committed to ending the wars in Ukraine and Isreal, and is a strong negotiator with the ability to do so. He has said this directly.5. His economic plan is controversial but I believe it will be a net positive for the nation. Not going to go into grest detail here but I do think the economy will do better under him.6. He is bringing in RFK Jr. to reform the corrupt FDA and to get them to actually do unbiased studies on the effects of various food additives, pesticides, etc. I think this will improve the health of our nation significantly.

They trade blows with the US Air Force, US Navy, US Marines and the US Coast Guard. If Trump starts creating a dictatorship the first thing he will need to do is start counting allegiance and start cutting swafts of military personal out as even a die hard republican Marine practicing Grunts and Crafts can demo a ship and a group of them can effectively level a base. He won't be looking for republicans or even Trumpers to keep but absolute Trumpers. This will put the military out of commission for months. But that's the least of Trumps warries. You cannot tell me that a Trump dictatorship does not result in a Pacific state succession with the only remaining red state being Alaska. Add in all the other states this is how I would honestly see the 5 branches go (note the National guard is more likely to stay with the state).ArmyLikely Trumps biggest asset unaffected as most of it sits in the Plains and South though the Rockies installations may be someone effected dependent on Cascade and Utah successions. However it will be severely diminished as Trump throws out all none Trump loyalist (some of which will not go peacefully)Navy. (and Marines coast guard as well)This will be the worst for Trump as he is likely to loose all industrial production. Not because most production is in democrat areas (They are mostly in Red states), but because it is pretty easy for a anti Trump worker/soldier to fuck something up then it is for a pro trump worker/soldier to proactively stop it. Something that will be hard to even start enforcing during the few months of Schism as the heads are being counted.And that is nothing to say about the loss of the entire Pacific fleets territory. HI, CA, OR, and WA will succeed and while Alaska will remain the Pacific fleet will not get re-supplied adequately as Trump would need to start a way with CA, OR, and WA, Canada or Panama to make it efficient as shipping through the horn of South America will be logistically impossible and Panama is likely to side with NATO (though the US would likely take it over).I won't go into the ship looses as well that's a very big if in a sea of if's but if 10% of a aircraft carrier mutinied against Trump it takes seconds to detonate a bomb and hours to try to stop the flood if a 100% of the crew was on 1 side.Air ForceThis one would be more 50/50 as US strategic operations like bombers and the likes will be fairly in Trumps. That said interceptors and air superiority fighters are likely to be split up equally. And while the US strategic bombers are going to be more useful most of them are none stealth or use stealth technologies that the US already has counters for so except the B-2 and similar which are resource intensive any other bomber will likely be removed due to lack luster defensive capabilities.Especially given NATO will probably be keeping behind forces to defend against further Russian expansion.After Trump finished his restructure the US (Trump) Military will likely be on par with NATO (and definitely so if fortified by US (Democrat) assets). and sure their is the Putin card but the problem is Putin has to contend with BRICKs who mostly hate the US and hate Trump more so if Putin were to support Trump he would be isolating Russia from Putin's form of NATO. That's something Putin cannot really afford (and likely will still not in 4 years).Russia has shown that their military can't beat a tiny country who's only support is equipment being sent and global volunteers. It's been years now and while Ukraine while loosing is showing Russia can just barely beat a tiny county. This means any European expansion will need the full support of China, and Iran of which will require he never help Trump out unless they can get Trump to back off on his anti China/Iran redirect. If I was to place the betting odds Trump whether with Russian support or not is going to have 50/50 in odds as Russian support would come with NATO support and Russia loosing it's two biggest allies.","title":"CMV: The US military is about to become trump's personal plaything"},{"text":"The alternative is literally communism...","title":"Vaccine stocks plummet after Donald Trump names RFK Jr health secretary"},{"text":"You're hoping that someone teaches the President you voted for a basic lesson in economics??","title":"President-elect Trump with President Milei and Elon Musk (11/14)"},{"text":"A happy ending?

Crashing the economy usually is profitable for the most powerful political and economic elites and comes with the advantage of allowing stronger politically and economically oppressive institutions. By destroying the capacity of the state to fairly enforce laws, investigate wrongdoing or protect the labour and property rights and interests of the vast majority, its true that the economy suffers considerably. However, this change also makes it far easier for the ruling clique to take a far larger slice of the pie. Even in the worst case scenario if the economy collapses to a quarter its current size, 20% of $ 7 trillion is far more than 1% of $28 trillion. That's normally the pattern you see with major captured economies. Russia has a smaller GDP than Canada. However, Vladimir Putin, a career civil servant with an official salary of $140,000/year, has an estimated personal wealth of somewhere between a couple of billion to almost $200 billion (which would make him the richest man on earth). The wealthiest oligarchs of Russia certainly suggest wealth on that scale for the Don who rules their cabal - despite the considerable poverty of the Russian people throughout most of the Federation. The 1% - or at least, the 1% that Trump keeps around - will be fine. Better than fine. They're going to have access to fabulous, unchecked wealth as long as they cut Trump in. Look at the opportunities provided by tariffs alone. By putting up 20%+ tariffs *and* cutting the IRS and other enforcement agencies *and* expanding the number of political appointees in mid tier management positions, he is setting up a perfect replica of a classic corruption scheme where Trump and his loyalists can sell either official or grey market exemptions to tariffs. These will be enormously lucrative. Imagine those 60% tariffs on Chinese imports he's promised. This means American businesses being cut off from critical supply chains.... *unless* your company agrees to pay a 10% bribe under the table to get the 60% tax removed - at least on some shipments - which in turn gives your company a massive competitive advantage over everyone else. And now MAGA has blackmail material on you - you committed a crime and they have proof - so they can demand another cut of the profits on the back end. Some of this filters into local crime enforcement groups who help \\"manage\\" discontent on the ground. Best part? With the gratuities ruling, most of this would be entirely legal. Trump could make himself the richest man on earth within a few years.","title":"How bad could a second Trump presidency get?

No President could get 76million+ votes and win an election if they were a complete disaster. Trump does have a lot of things going for him and a lot of popular policies. But if u listen to these Mainstream Media outlets you would think he has no actual positives to a reasonable person. This has actually led to unfortunate takes such as that people only support Trump because they are brainwashed, or stupid, or just racist, etc. But no there are many reasons to support him, they just aren't covered fairly by these media outlets. And in fact these media outlets often give bad-faith takes on things where they assume the worst of Trump. For example, let's look at the instance where Trump's team's came up with a plan to follow procedural steps in selecting alternative electors so that if his legal challenge to the 2020 election succeeded it wouldn't be too late to \\"correct\\" the results at that point due to a technicality. The Mainstream Media has portrayed this as a scheme by Trump to trick people and cheat to steal the election, which leads to the claim/belief that Trump is a danger to democracy and tried to outright steal an election. But in truth he was only trying to win a legal challenge to the election results. Do u see the issue? People like yourself have a worldview in which Trump is an unbelievably terrible and dangerous person due to the media you consume, and yet this doesn't line up with the fact that so many people support him. It's delusional to still believe that no all those tens of millions of people are wrong/crazy and you are still clearly right. And I worry that it's this kinda perspective- created by the Mainstream Media- that will prevent our nation from coming together going forward","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"With what?

Reagan went so far as to promote Stallone's Rambo movies at press conferences. The thing that struck me the most was how disinterested Reagan was in actually governing. There were stories of him staying up late watching movies and talking on the phone with Stallone and not prepping for meetings or knowing materials because he was still enamored with Hollywood and his acting years. Reagan wanted more than anything to still be hobnobbing with celebrities.

He couldn't even explain why Trump would improve any of his anecdotal scenarios outside of pointing to Elon Musk supporting him.There were multiple polls leading up to this election that showed that 65% of people thought the economy was bad while another 65% thought their personal economic prospects were good and improving.

Then they would ask the viewers how fast they thought the cars were traveling.

Man bitten by dog sounds like a dog bit some guy. Dog bites man says the same thing but, to me, sounds slightly worse.

Start choosing different words to say that and you can have wildly different interpretations, even when youre trying your best to be as objective as possible.These very small differences that result in different interpretations of reality can be measured. We can objectively measure the speed of cars. We can objectively measure the amount of blood drawn or the number of stitches needed, etc. But it still breeds subjectivity on the front-end.Now, while all this might not bring *as much* subjectivity as you would like, it does bring *some amount* of subjectivity to warrant OPs claim correct.","title":"cmv: \\"Objective\\" Journalism isn't real and never was"},{"text":"J.P. Morgans connection to the Titanic disaster is tangled with both business interests and rumors of manipulation. His company, International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM), owned the White Star Line, which operated the Titanic. Notably, Morgan had planned to travel on the Titanic but canceled at the last moment. This has fueled speculation, especially since several other prominent figures with ties to Morgan, like industrialist Henry Clay Frick, also canceled their trips. Some conspiracy theories suggest that Morgan or his company may have had foreknowledge of the disaster and even benefited from it through insurance.The Titanics insurance coverage was a subject of intrigue, as it was insured by multiple companies. Among the largest was the London-based Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance, which was one of the insurers that covered the ship. Furthermore, some believe there was a deliberate insurance scheme, perhaps involving the sinking of the Titanics sister ship, the Olympic, as part of a larger corporate fraud plot. There were also rumors about life insurance policies tied to some of the passengers, potentially benefiting companies connected to Morgan. Although no definitive proof has emerged linking Morgan directly to the life insurance policies of Titanic passengers, his companys financial involvement raises questions about the broader financial impact of the tragedy. Some believe that Morgan may have used his extensive business network to benefit from both the loss of the ship and the insurance payouts, though this remains speculative.The role of his other ships, including the SS Californian (which allegedly failed to intervene during the Titanics distress calls), further complicates the narrative. The Californian was also owned by Morgans IMM.https://historyheist.com/the-sinking-of-the-titanic-insurance-scam-was-jp-morgans-sunk-ship-actually-the-titanics-nearly-identical-sister-ship-the-olympic/https://www.marketmemoir.com/blogs/the-memoir/titanic-the-tragedy-that-sank-j-p-morgans-shipping-empire","title":"Putin claims 'new world order' is forming, congratulates Trump on election victory"},{"text":"There were a lot of assumptions that the voters/EC wouldnt pick someone who wouldnt even care about whether someone theyre considering for their cabinet was trustworthy.","title":"Trumps team skips FBI background checks for some Cabinet picks"},{"text":"The fuck you candidate was Ron Paul when I was that age, and definitely appealed to us for some nebulous reason","title":"The boys in our liberal school are different now that Trump has won"},{"text":"It truly is","title":"So long WA!!"},{"text":"Getting nearly as many  voter switchers, though - especially in states like GA, where she got more votes than Biden did.

What looks like is basically 3 things\\"1. When talking about a topic, report all relevant facts without leaving anything of significance out. For example, if reporting on the state of the economy an objective take would discuss all major economic statistics and cover both the negative and positive ones.2. When talking about controversial/political topics, accurately share the perspectives of both sides. For example, if talking Abortion, accurate share what pro-choice and pro-life individuals are saying. Don't misrepresent one side even if u disagree with it.3. In both of the above situations, don't give your opinion or reaction to it, just state what the facts/arguments are.I think a big part of the problem tho is that people don't actually want to watch a show like that. It would be kinda boring if a news show just told u something like \\"The President wants to pass Tariffs. Many people including liberal economitst say it will cause prices to increase with little benefit. Others say the price increase concerns are overblown and the tariffs will create more jobs in the U.S. The Tarriff plan will likely be clarified over the first months of the presidency.\\" Isn't it much more entertaining to hear \\"Trump's plan is so dumb! What an idiot! It's going to tank the economy!\\" Or \\"Trump's plan is secretly brilliant! It'll bring in lots of reve  ue and create a booming American economy!\\" - both said confidently?So I understand why many media sources prefer to only give one perspective- it's what makes the shows entertaining for their audiences. But the result of this is that people begin to have vastly diverging worldviews due to only ever really hearing one side of the story. I think there need to be some prominent media outlets  that actually strive to be as objective as possible as I outlined above so that people can get the full picture and better understand why other might have a differing perspective. Idk for sure, but I believe CNN and the NYT used to be fairly close to that standard, but now no longer are unfortunately.","title":"cmv: \\"Objective\\" Journalism isn't real and never was"},{"text":"It is, when they decide to suddenly include 60,000 provisional ballots, that were never verified, which somehow happen to be 90% blue.","title":"WI GOP Senate Candidate 'Shocked By What Unfolded'"},{"text":"To be fair, Roe V Wade was overturned in June of 2022 which is why the issue was brought up this election.

A brand-new luxury ship is about to make its maiden voyage across the Atlantic, promising a one-way ticket to eternal glory (and hopefully not the bottom of the ocean). But as fate would have it, the unsinkable ship sinks. Tragedy? Sure, but as the saying goes in certain circles, Never let a good crisis go to waste.Enter J.P. Morgan, the man who essentially controlled the ships parent company, White Star Line, through his conglomerate, the International Mercantile Marine (IMM). A titan of finance, Morgan was as powerful as he was strategic. He wasnt just in it for the novelty of a grand vessel; he had a keen eye on the bottom line. Titanic was heavily insured, reportedly covering the bulk of its construction costs. So, when the ship went down, the payout was in the millionsenough to cushion IMM from the loss. Call it a lesson in disaster capitalism: for Morgan, Titanics fate wasnt just an oceanic catastrophe; it was a financial strategy.But this story doesnt end with the insurance payout. Morgan had an uncanny knack for showing up to solve problems he was, lets just say, well-prepared for. Take the Panic of 1907. When a financial meltdown threatened to tank the U.S. economy, Morgan swooped in like a modern-day superhero, shoring up failing banks and rescuing the markets. Only, it wasnt charityhis solution conveniently amplified his control over the economy and cemented the need for the Federal Reserve, which hed indirectly set the stage for.Morgans moves were classic Hegelian dialectic at work: problem, reaction, solution. Except he was always one step ahead, ready to roll out a well-calculated solution when the moment struck. Whether it was railroads, shipping, or banks, crises came with a silver lining for those who knew how to play the game. He didnt need to create the crises; he just knew how to make them work for him, every single time.So, the Titanic wasnt just a ship; it was a cog in the greater machine of Morgans financial empire. While the world mourned, Morgan cashed in.

Our obsession with proving we can after being told we cant is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. Youre not special, youre not original, youre not the first; this is just another boss fight.","title":"Trump tariffs will make video game consoles up to 40% more expensive"},{"text":"Yup. Even worse than Halliburton are companies like Booz Allen Hamilton and The Carlyle Group and their ties to the Bush and Obama administrations- Booz Allen Hamilton was a private consulting firm hired by the National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assist in monitoring, recording, and analyzing (without search warrants) phone calls, text messages, internet activity, e-mails, and other communications believed to be conducted outside of the United States, even if the other end of the communication lies within the US.- Surveillance programs conducted in part by Booz Allen Hamilton include: Pioneer Groundbreaker (2001-2007), Project Trailblazer (2001-2007), PRISM (2007-), Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (2001-)- Booz Allen earned $240 million in profit on $5.9 billion in revenue in 2012 when 98% of Booz Allen's $5.9 billion in revenue came from US government contracts.- At that time, the Vice Chairman of Booz Allen was John Michael McConnell, former director of the NSA under George H.W. Bush and Director of National Intelligence under George W. Bush. The Vice President of Booz Allen was Robert James Woolsey, Jr., a former director of the CIA under Bill Clinton. Barack Obamas Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, was a former Booz Allen executive.- In 2008 Booz Allen Hamilton was acquired by the Carlyle Group for $2.54 billion. The President of the Carlyle Group is Frank Carlucci, former US Secretary of Defense and National Security Advisor under Ronald Reagan and Deputy Director of the CIA under Jimmy Carter. Frank Carlucci was also a former wrestling partner of Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense under George W. Bush, during their time at Princeton University. The Vice President of the Carlyle Group is James Baker who served as US Secretary of State and White House Chief of staff under George H.W. Bush. Former Carlyle Group employees include George H.W. Bush, former US president and director of the CIA under Gerald Ford, and John Major, a former UK Prime Minister.- The Carlyle Group received multiple multi-billion dollar contracts from the US government to rebuild Iraqs infrastructure and to equip the Turkish and Saudi Arabian armies with aviation defense systems.- The Carlyle Group also manages the financial assets of the Saudi Binladen Corporation (SBC). The SBC is headed up by members of Osama bin Ladens family, and played a principle role in helping George W. Bush win petroleum concessions from Bahrain when he was head of the Texan oil company, Harken Energy Corporation, a deal that was to make the Bush family millions of dollars. Salem bin Laden, Osama bin Ladens brother, was represented on Harkens board of directors by his American agent, James R. Bath, an SBC advisor. The Carlyle Group held a meeting at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in NYC one day before the 9/11 terrorist attacks. According to the Washington Post and the CBC, in attendance at this meeting were former president George H. W. Bush and another of Osamas brothers, Shafiq bin Laden.- The connection between the Bush and bin Laden families can also be traced to the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in the 1990s. Members of the banks board of directors included Richard Helms and William Casey, business partners of George H. W. Bush and former CIA agents. During their time at the BCCI both Helms and Casey worked alongside fellow director, Adnan Khasshoggi, who also represented the bin Laden familys interests in the US. The CIA held numerous accounts with the BCCI, these bank accounts were used for a variety of illegal covert operations, including transfers of money and weapons related to the Iran-Contra scandal, according to Time Magazine. The CIA also worked with the BCCI in arming and financing the jihadist Afghan mujahideen during the Afghan War against the Soviet Union, including Osama bin Laden (who also held an account with the BCCI) and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar (Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993-1996). The CIA used the BCCI to launder proceeds from trafficking heroin grown in the Pakistan-Afghanistan borderlands to the mujahideen soldiers, boosting the flow of narcotics to European and US markets and arming future enemies of the United States.the government has always just been one giant revolving door of corruption","title":"Trumps New Oligarchy Is About to Unleash Unimaginable Corruption"},{"text":"gaza is a false flag operation?","title":"Inside the Republican false-flag effort to turn off Kamala Harris voters"},{"text":"There goes the Rogan bro demographic for the midterms.","title":"Trump tariffs will make video game consoles up to 40% more expensive"},{"text":"I think the important argument is that nobody has the right to another person's body, organs, tissues, etc. We don't even force parents to donate a little blood to their own living and breathing children.","title":"A pregnant woman sues for the right to an abortion in challenge to Kentuckys near-total ban"},{"text":"Pollyannish","title":"How bad could a second Trump presidency get?

To me, that is alarming in itself, but so be it. They have the right to support it.But then there are the others. Voters who didn't know (or care) that this would happen. I would argue that If f you paid any attention to fact-based media (and contrary to popular belief, it does exist), you saw it coming. People either didn't pay any attention to the warning signs, or outright ignored them. They voted purely on the price of eggs or the so-called immigrant threat or whatever else. The looming threat to American democracy was not the main driver of their vote, but was (in my opinion), driven by pure selfishness.These voters who supported Republicans, (and, frankly, those who didn't vote at all), placed us in this precarious position as a country.

Other presidents have used that limited constitutional power when faced with delays by the opposing party, but Trump might be considering a twist  circumventing his own partys opposition to some nominees.Edward Whelan, a conservative legal scholar, said in?[a Washington Post opinion article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/14/trump-gaetz-cabinet-appointment-johnson/)?Thursday that hes heard that Trump is considering triggering an obscure constitutional provision that would allow him to force a recess over the objections of the incoming Republican Senate majority. The move would permit him to put any nominee in place at will.President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to turn the Constitutions appointment process for Cabinet officers on its head, wrote Whelan, a distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative Washington, D.C., think tank.Even though its never been done, experts said the authority exists in the Constitution  although it would likely face a legal challenge.Its not crazy. Its in there, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston. Its just never been exercised before.The Constitution says the president may, on extraordinary occasions adjourn the House and Senate in case of disagreement between them on when they should adjourn. Once the Senate is adjourned, Trump could use the power elsewhere in the Constitution for him to make temporary appointments during a legislative recess.I think its pretty clear that he has that authority, said William Yeomans, a former Justice Department official who served as?the late Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedys chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

He is abhorrent. His eyes are permanently rimmed with the red rings of chemical boosters. In person, he smells like overexposed Axe Body Spray and stale Astroglide. The fact that he boasted on the floor to multiple colleagues in the House of Representatives of his methods of crushing Viagra and high test Red Bull to maintain his erection through his orgiastic evenings is perhaps the least offensive of his many crimes against womanhood and Christian faith. The man has less principles than your average fentanyl addicted hobo. He likes them underage and hes not ashamed about it. Matt Gaetz isnt just your average extreme Florida MAGA Man, hes a hypocritical ass with the worst Botox money can buy, pursuing an ever-thinner nose and higher cheekbones at every opportunity like a Real Housewife gone mad for fillers. Every Republican in Washington has an opinion about Matt Gaetz, and 99 percent of those opinions are Keep Matt Gaetz away from my wife/daughter/friend and anyone I care about. He is a walking genital, warts included as a bonus. If I was merely attempting to count the number of women I know who have had bad experiences with Matt Gaetz, I would run out of fingers and toes. If you vote for him to be the Attorney General of the United States, you dont just need your head examined, you need to be committed to a mental institution. The man is absolutely vile.

Most of the tax revenue is paid for by the rich. So yes, cutting their taxes takes a massive chunk away from all that. Okay another point, whether we cut their taxes, keep them same, or increase them substantially, theyll still be insanely rich and live like kings. So much suffering to please a few thousand greedy assholes is insane and immoral.One last point, our wealth inequality is on par with corrupt countries like Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mexico, and Zimbabwe.

The number objective of American conservatives today is to rebuild the USSR, increase their land/power/weapons.Americans also naively think if that money is not spent on Ukraine it will be spent at home. No. That money is going towards weapons no matter what. Better to let Ukrainians fight with it than putting American lives at risk.","title":"Tulsi Gabbard is my friend.

An article devoted to the views of the Democrat party that does not even mention the views, rhetoric or policies of single Democrat politician isn't a serious analysis.The political reality is that people on the left - as do people on the right - have some batshit views, and will occasionally obtain a small amount of political power to try and implement their views and inevitably fuck up. For whatever godforsaken reason, voters (and journalists) believe (or pretend to believe) that this is a reflection of the party as a whole, regardless of the reality that a) it isn't, and b) the vast majority of Democrat politicians actively reject politically toxic shit like defund the police. Any serious analysis of the image problem the Democrats have really ought to take in account the reality of what Democrat politicians do rather than just go hurr durr progressives are so woke.I suspect the solution we all want is for Democrats to more aggressively punch left when shit like defund the police happens again, but we should perhaps take into account the possibility that with a conservative propaganda network devoted to portraying Democrats as out-of-touch woke hippies - and a liberal media that loves to self-flagellate - this might not work. In a country of several hundred million people, there will always be examples of progressive whackjobbery to make an example of and raise the blood pressure of normie Americans.","title":"Graphs from \\"Trump broke the Democrats thermostat\\""},{"text":"I just asked a question.

How if they say theyre a Democrat, the Trump supporters will not get mad and will show them hospitality. But if a person went to a Kamala rally and said theyre a Trump supporter, they scream at that person and dont want them around. I personally dont care whichever politics a person has. Most of my relatives on my mothers side are Democrats. I recently found out my brother who moved to NYC was so disappointed when Kamala lost. I was like, WTF? My brother who used to idolize Trump. He used to watch The Apprentice as a kid. I guess his college friends and maybe his British wife changed his mind? I wont disown him because of that. Trump fans seems more understanding whichever side youre on, while Trump haters are always angry if you dont share the same views as them. Yet, Trump is the divisive one? The one with hate speech?

It depicts Jesus Christ appearing to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection. Specifically it depicts John 20:17 \\"Jesus saith unto her, Do not cling to me; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\\"There's no hidden meaning here. Ivanov wrote and corresponded extensively about the creation of this painting, which took him five years to complete. He wasn't trying to communicate any deeper truth or dark secret. He was moved by the passage and the complex emotions and circumstances he imaged were at play here.Mary had seen her friend and teacher die brutally, and now is seeing him alive again. She is in awe, she is overjoyed, she is in a state of disbelief. At the same time it is something of a cold reunion because Jesus is a man on a mission. There's no tender embrace. He's no longer the man she knew just a few days prior. It's obviously joyful, and her next action is to run to all the disciples and proclaim to them that the Lord is risen, but you can also imagine in the moment that she might've felt confused, maybe even unworthy or dismissed.That's ultimately the message translated into the painting. Do not cling to Earthly things and memories of the past--they will only bring you sorrow.
