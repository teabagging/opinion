Children, like all humans, are not just cogs in the labour machine, they are individuals, citizens, the people responsible for carrying a democracy. Children are costly is you only look at the money it takes to raise and educate them, but the investment is necessary in the bigger picture. You can see that in the most wealthy countries with the best welfare, education is crucial. Your view signals a problem (a growing segregation between rich and poor, the inability to raise a family on a single or low income), and your solution is to manipulate the people affected by this, instead of doing something about the cause.If vocational skills are in shortage, lowering the payment for them will drive people away. Skilled people will look for jobs with better compensation, and companies who have become used to not paying a livable wage to their underage 'interns' or illiegal immigrant who are too scared to be deported to fight for their rights, will balk at having to pay more.

We have what's called 'Studiefinanciering'. The closest what you guys have (i think) is the 'Federal student aid' program. I haven't read too much about it from your end, but here, we hand out these 'loans' to every student from every level of education when they go to college, any education before that is free. The calculation of how much the student gets is determined by the income of the parents, so they get fair compensation. If it's not enough, the student can opt to loan even more. If the student manages to complete their education in X amount of time, the **base** loan amount (so not any additional loans that the student decides to get) is converted to a gift. Whatever is left of the loan can be paid back in around *30 years.*This incentive eases the load on the parents, while allowing kids to complete their education while not having to contribute meaningfully to the family, financially.","title":"CMV: Responsible Child Labor is the Solution to the West's Fertility Crisis"},{"text":"104% to -4% poll is owning the libs -MAGA","title":"Listen up liberals, my wife left me."},{"text":"What was her response?

It is that the nation is fighting a international market that has lots of low wage workers perpetuated buy bad governance and market controllers. One traditional market (manufacturing) had been previously thrown oversees for the cheap labor cost and lack of regulatory practices. Now it is starting to migrate back to the original nations as markets realize they have developed subpar goods, unsteady supply chains, and unverifiable labor statistics as technology improves. The difficulty of changing markets and times is that they take time. they can take generations to change to something steady or useful.

The concept of democracy does not = Democractic Party It does not mean alignment with left-leaning viewpoints. It means power that comes from the people. There are some members of Congress who dont understand this and go on TV and say otherwise. A Republic is a structure of government. A Constitutional Republic, by definition, uses representative democracy. This means citizens elect officials to represent their interests and make laws and policies on their behalf. We do have some direct democracy, in the form of things like ballot initiatives. But we mainly use representative democracy in the United States. The United States is both a democracy and a republic. Anyone who says otherwise is either operating from a place of ignorance and should not be trying to educate on government, or they are intentionally trying to mislead and should not be trying to educate on government.

Ilan Pape, an israeli historian wrote a book on it called \\"The Ethnic cleansing of Palestine\\" and that's your answer. More than half the Palestinian land was stolen, villages destroyed and the inhabitants driven away in droves. That's how the state of Israel came into being. It was founded on violence, terrorism, theft, murder and rape. Such a kind of state or anything has absolutely NO RIGHT TO EXIST. \\nThis hostility isn't new.I agree but if EVERYONE throughout history seems to be opposing the Jews, maybe ask the question why? Is everyone else just plain evil or maybe, maybe there's something more to it? \\nThe Romans drove out the Jews from Judea. I only see unlimited praise for the Roman empire in the west, aren't they the biggest anti semites in history? Even worse than Hitler maybe? Why did they do that? \\nThe Jews rebelled against them. There is a reason. If something keeps happening again and again and again, you seek the reason. I'm not saying they were never oppressed, yes they were, absolutely. But I don't agree with the whole poor jews argument. \\nAnd funnily it was the Europe, it was the Christian Europe that did the most amount of jewish oppression. Why are they taking it out on the muslims? When are they gonna bomb europe? I'd be waiting for that. Take the 1975 UN resolution declaring \\"Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination\\"Because it is. The same UN granted almost half the Palestinian territory to jews for Israel when they only constituted less than 20% of the total population. Why didn't you mention that? how do you justify the involvement of other groups like Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria? These aren't \\"freedom fighters\\" - they're Iran-backed terrorists.These militant groups were formed or created as a response to the Israeli occupation of Palestine and their tendency to repeatedly attack anyone around them. The ethnic cleansing was done in 1948, occupation began in 1967, and in response Hamas was formed in 1987. \\nIsrael invaded Lebanon in 1978, Hezbollah was created as a response in 1982.  \\nNow the question is why are they backed by Iran? I don't know the definitive answer but I can try to explain. Israel has been opposing Iran since forever, it purposely destroyed any negotiation between the US and Iran whenever they tried to normalize relations. Israel murdered Iranian scientists, nuclear scientists many times, no wonder Iran sought to ally itself with enemies of Israel. They'd be fools if they didn't. Now, even if we assume that Israel bears significant responsibility for the current conflict,It absolutely does. You have the ethnic cleansing, the occupation, the mass detentions, the mass rapes and the unprovoked murder of Palestinians. Iran is part of what some call the \\"Axis of Upheaval\\" or CRINK (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea). These regimes are not just territorial aggressors; they systematically violate human rights and oppress their populationsSo does Israel and US. And you're just spewing the US propaganda atm. To Iran, Israel is the enemy. To Russia, US is the enemy. Israel, whether you like it or not, agree with its policies or not, is still a liberal democracy.Okay first of all no, Israel is not a democracy. Roughly half the people inside are Palestinians and they can't vote, they have no rights. \\nSecond, even if it was, even if Israel was the most democratic country on the planet, who gives a fuck? It's committing a genocide, it has occupied a whole country. It has been ethnic cleansing, raping and murdering MILLIONS of people before the day it was founded. free elections, an independent judiciary, and freedom of press.Another commentator has responded to this point. And no there's no freedom of press. Israelis don't let international journalists in and they did ban Al Jazeera a few months ago so all lies.When you oppose Israels existence rather than its policies, you're siding with these authoritarian regimes, whether you mean to or not.That's a nice way to spin it. If a pedophile thought hey this Hitler guy is bad, you'd be sharing your views with a pedophile. Shit argument. You can criticize Israeli policies. You can advocate for Palestinian rights. But the moment you start questioning Israel's right to exist, you've crossed a line.That's one of the most enraging lines I've ever read. Let me give you a bottom line, Israel does not have a right to exist. Israel was founded on stolen land and the blood of the indigenous population. This is not a \\"Jews reclaiming their home story\\", this is a colonialist project and the world is realising it now.","title":"CMV: If you oppose Israel's right to exist, you are indirectly supporting the Axis of Iran-Russia-China-North Korea"},{"text":"If youre playing cod, I am told loud and frequent racial slurs are thirsty work","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Home ownership just wasn't in the cards.

If you think the bad outcomes now are intolerable, imagine trying to get a diverse, divided country to agree on what a new constitution should look like. The process itself could be a disaster.

He warned that this would divide families, but that it was necessary to achieve the ultimate liberation. Anyone who has ever had to separate themselves from overbearing parents who try to control their lives at every step should be able to easily understand this verse. It is not always a peaceful process to individuate and stand firmly on your own two feet, and the sword of discernment helps us divide those aspects within ourselves which we want to keep from those aspects that are culturally outdated programming, usually inherited from our parents.","title":"CMV: Democrats align more with Jesus than Republicans"},{"text":"Thats in the Old Testament though.

It is a broad term and can encompass both boys and adult men.

This means that the prohibition in Leviticus applies to males in general, not specifically to children. If the text had intended to specifically address relationships involving children, a more precise Hebrew word like yeled (child) or naar (youth) could have been used, but the text does not. This indicates that the prohibition is meant to address male-male sexual relations broadly ? ?.Essentially all biblical scholars, translators, and theologians agree on the translation of these passages, as the wording is clear in Hebrew and has been translated consistently across different Bible versions.\\nThe Bible is one of the most morally repugnant books written, and Jesus explicitly condoned or advocated for the old law despite the couple instances of love thy neighbors in there.","title":"CMV: Democrats align more with Jesus than Republicans"},{"text":"they have trouble with policy that takes more than four words to explain","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"So shes another Melania / Ginny Thomas.Check.","title":"Listen up liberals, my wife left me."},{"text":"Your truly, genuine concern is duly noted.","title":"Kamala Harriss Fox interview: our experts are united in their verdict"},{"text":"She held her own brilliantly.

That's why the high streets all end up empty and boarded up. I saw all these shops in my local neighbourhood disappear one by one. Some of them went over twenty years ago and some only a few years ago. The baker was the last to close up shop. But we first lost the greengrocer and then the cheesemonger. And that was all the way back in the early 2000s. Later, the video rental also closed. They were replaced by a Primark-type shop and and an ethnic grocer.

So we have inflation, inflation, inflation, and immigration.  And you're fixated on 2 years ago instead of the present. Also, economists have said that Trump's plans are inflationary, so if you want to avoid inflation then you should vote Harris.  Now let's also address the core fact that you're missing.  The difference between 2019 and 2021 is COVID.  That's why inflation happened.  That's why inflation was global.  Because COVID fucked everything up for over a year and when the system was ramped back up there were supply chain issues that were subsequently used as an excuse by companies to raise prices.  Companies raised prices but demand remained high so they raised prices again.  To act like the whole thing was just Biden getting the inflation reduction act passed and not being cozy enough with the oil and gas companies is stupid. You're ignoring data and context in order to convince yourself that Trump was anything but mediocre on the economy and lucky in inheriting an economy (from Obama) that had been in a bullish run for 5 years.","title":"Kamala Harriss Fox interview: our experts are united in their verdict"},{"text":"mfw my wax body starts meltinghttps://preview.redd.it/4ld2r50ggavd1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fc2089007a41c115da23989ae109e2204f404e","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"On the other hand, there are also absolutely heaps of measures that stack the decks in favour of large corporations.I really think zoning deregulation, urban planning reform, carbon taxes, increased tolls on roads and some licensing reforms could go a substantial way in forming an organic, economically efficient, resilient localism.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"This interview didn't move the needle, she did well enough for this type of interview but this certainly won't be make or break for the campaign.","title":"Harris distances herself from Biden, bashes Trump in tense Fox News interview"},{"text":"She went into hostile territory and handled herself very well.

While court challenges have left other debt-related programs in limbo, these borrowers have benefited from reforms to the governments public service loan forgiveness program, which was previously riddled by poor management and low acceptance rates.Public servants saw their applications fall victim to fine-print technicalities, red tape, accounting errors and a wall of indifference from the Trump administration, Education Secretary?Miguel Cardona?told reporters. The process is fixed and will continue providing forgiveness to public servants for years to come.More than $73 billion in loans have been forgiven through the 2007 initiative under Biden, according to an Education Department press release.

Through an empirical exploration guided by three explanatory perspectivespsychological, bureau\\\\organizational, and agenda\\\\politicaldeveloped from the strategic surprise, public administration, and crisis management literature, the authors seek to shed light on the mechanisms that contributed to the underestimation of the coronavirus threat by the Trump Administration and the slow and mismanaged federal response. The analysis highlights the extent to which the factors identified by previous studies of policy surprise and failure in other security domains are relevant for health security. The paper concludes by addressing the crucial role of executive leadership as an underlying factor in all three perspectives and discussing why the US president is ultimately responsible for ensuring a healthy policy process to guard against the pathologies implicated in the federal government's sub\\\\optimal response to the COVID\\\\19 crisis.","title":"Kamala Harriss Fox interview: our experts are united in their verdict"},{"text":"You are on some military grade copium.

No illegal immigration. It is a crime.Now crimes do happen and the world isn't a perfect place, but if a government failure to enforce a law is systemic, and even intentionally caused by some who politically support illegal immigration despite it's official legal status, then arguably those same people also bear responsibility for the consequences of what they've enabled because isn't mere 'chance' or 'fate' that lead those events to transpire. It was a dynamic allowed by the government in contravention of the laws they are required to enforce.It seems obvious if Democrats were as anti-immigrant as Republicans more could be done about it. Immigration certainly went down a lot during the Trump admin compared to Biden's. Many democrat controlled stats and cities even actively create legislation that gives them the 'sanctuary' status creating conditions that as a 'pull' on more illegal migrations since in a way your holding up a sign welcoming them with such legislation.To see how wrong you are let's apply your logic to some other examples. Say the government laws mandates for no lead in drinking water. But the government doesn't really enforce this well because one of the political parties actively campaigns for laws and low enforcement that makes it easier for lead to get into the drinking water. How is the govenrment then not responsible for the lead in people's drinking water? It is literally against the law but people actively subvert enforcement of the law to a level well below what would be possible if the enforcement had unanimous support.We can also turn some of your other logic on its head to demonstrate how it is entirely subjective.For example \\"I don't like foreign people coming into my country because there's a .000001 chance that one of them could kill my family member\\" is easily reversed into;\\"I like foreign people coming into my country so much 0.0001% of American citizens should happily have their first born child killed in front of them in pursuit of that endeavor.\\"There is a reason why you are arguably simply morally wrong outright. Those who are not allowed to immigrate the vast majority probably won't die staying in their home countries. If order to offer them a better life your willing sacrificing the lives of some citizens; but who are you to offer the lives of others in pursuit of your ideal? And how can you equate 'better life' for illegals in the US to the 'deaths' also caused statistically by the criminals or negligent among them? It is like the train switch dilemma except instead of killing one person to save 5 you are killing one person just to give a 1,000 a cushier life than they would have otherwise had which seems only more morally dubious than the standard train switch dilemma.","title":"CMV: Saying that illegal immigrants came from the border and killed your daughter because of the Biden administration is just xenophobic."},{"text":"Look, she's not \\"distancing\\" herself from Biden.

Primaries eventually became adopted as part of the process, and came well after the existence of conventions, but at the end of the day it's state/party delegates who nominate the candidate. Biden never received that nomination. Harris acquired enough delegates for the nomination months ago, and while no one stepped up to challenge her.The Constitution has little say on this matter, there's nothing inherently illegally or unconstitutional about any of this, and most Democrats have been onboard since Biden stepped aside. In fact, most democratic voters expressed their reservations about Biden being the nominee. Polls consistently showed concerns from a majority of voters, which means that if Biden stayed in the race, it would have actually invalidated those voter's concerns and desire for a new candidate.The only thing that can be said about this outcome, is simply that it hurts your *feelings.*Harris has met all of the qualifications, and Biden didn't zip-line into the convention to take the nom back from Harris like Trump suggested he would because Trump can't fathom doing what Biden did, he prioritized country over party and over self. Trump on the other hand, has consistently shown us that he's only capable of the opposite. Donald Trump is Trump first, not America first.Keep in mind also that there's no precedent for this situation really. An ostensible incumbent is through the primaries and steps aside while waiting for the convention, this is a very rare thing, which means there's no distinct guidelines either, there's also no \\"primary do-over\\". Harris followed the process, she has the delegates, she has the support, she has the nomination. She was made the nominee because she is the natural successor to the president, and she was voted in as that successor by 81 million Americans. Both she and the Democratic party have done nothing to deserve this criticism. For all intents and purposes, Harris followed the Democratic process and she absolutely has the support of the Democratic party, In fact, she has more support than Biden did, which means her candidacy is more democratically symbolic and practical, and guess what? there's nothing Trump or his seething followers can do about it except whine incessantly like children on social media.And by the way, this half baked argument/deflection of yours, whatever you want to call it, isn't doing you any favors. Because all it's doing is highlighting the Republican party's capitulation to Trump, their decision to make Trump ringleader of the circus, three elections in a row, while democrats have offered three different candidates. Term limits my ass...  It also highlights their unabashed and shameless sycophancy, cronyism, favoritism, and deification of the narcissistic manchild.I mean, the humiliating fact is that Trumpism is its own religious order and his supporters have wrapped their entire identities and personalities around him, living vicariously through him in a soon-to-be emotionally scarring way.But most importantly, what it highlights is the difference between Democrats and Trump. Where one is willing to step aside, where one is willing to speak out, express concerns about the leader of their party without being branded a \\"DINO,\\" a traitor, an outcast, without being alienated, slandered, burned at the stake... Where one is willing to hear those concerns, willing to give up another chance at power, for whatever reason, we see someone like Donald Trump, a malignant narcissist, who would never, no matter the circumstances, drop out of the race or relinquish power. This is how a king behaves, these are the actions of a tyrant.","title":"Kamala Harriss Fox interview: our experts are united in their verdict"},{"text":"Those laws exist on the state level.

It was obvious the CNN debate was a setup to torpedo Biden. Why even schedule it before the primary? Never been done before. We can all see the way they kept him up on the split screen looking terrible when they didn't have to, the moderator treatment in that debate was night and day compared to every other Trump debate, and notice even what they did with the sound and how they made Trump sound soft vs. the usual crass sound they give him. And does anyone seriously believe all these news outlets just magically noticed Biden's decline all of a sudden? They saw numerous situations like this in the past they would explain them away every time. Just not this time. Why is that?We could see them preparing for this with the Hunter case where they built up leverage over him and his family's business dealings to be in play right at the perfect time to push him out. Maybe they weren't always set on it 100% but I suspect it was in the works as part of their strategy to have Trump waste hundreds of millions of dollars of resources and time campaigning against Biden only to do a last minute swap out to catch him off guard and ride the high of a new candidate. I suspect though the plan was not for it to be Kamala but to be someone else decided by a different faction of the democrat party (e.g. the Obama wing, Clintons, etc.). But the Willie Brown faction didn't go along with it and one upped them by posting the Kamala endorsement and stole the nomination.This may have been their plan all along if their attempt to get rid of Trump before the primary failed. If they got rid of him (e.g. in the attempt in PA) before the convention and before he named Vance, they could have put their own establishment person like Nikki at the top of the ticket and had a win-win situation and no need to replace Biden.","title":"Kamala Harris Fumes When Confronted Over Covering Up Bidens Cognitive Decline"},{"text":"The Libs think she killed it during this interview but she got absolutely smoked by one of the less aggressive correspondents.

Under the model, people enrolled in a participating Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) plan would have access to these drugs for a low, fixed copayment of no more than $2 for a months supply per drug. The model would provide individuals more certainty about the out-of-pocket costs for these generic covered Part D drugs that would target common conditions, such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure. CMS issued this RFI to support continued development of the model.  \\n...  \\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovations (Innovation Centers) Medicare $2 Drug List Model aims to test whether a simplified approach to offering low-cost, clinically important generic drugs can improve medication adherence, lead to better health outcomes, and improve satisfaction with the Part D prescription drug benefit among people with Medicare and prescribers.The generic drugs under consideration for inclusion in this model would not be subject to utilization management requirements (except for safety-related requirements) at any network pharmacies. Participation in the model would be voluntary for Part D sponsors and, pending further development, could start as early as January 2027.  \\n...  \\nThe Innovation Center incorporated numerous data sources in a quantitative and clinically driven process to develop the sample drug list. The information was then reviewed with an external technical expert panel that included physicians, pharmacists, and health policy experts. Their input helped inform the sample list of drugs presented in this RFI.The idea of a standardized drug list with predetermined out-of-pocket costs is already well understood by individuals and providers. Many large retail pharmacies and grocery chains have successfully offered defined lists of prescription generic drugs at low, fixed prices. The Innovation Centers approach in the proposed Medicare $2 Drug List Model is informed by these options, building on the concept of standardization but tailoring the approach to the needs of people with Medicare. This model aims to include a sufficiently comprehensive list of covered Part D drugs so that when a person with Medicare is prescribed a covered Part D drug, most of the time, there will be a treatment option that may be suitable for their condition available on the $2 Drug List.New generic drug launches, changing clinical indications, and trends in pricing will necessitate updates to the $2 Drug List, both prior to the launch of the model and at regular intervals during the lifespan of the model. The Innovation Center is seeking feedback on this ongoing update process through the RFI and intends to continue incorporating feedback from interested parties.  \\n...Additional details about the list can be found in a link at the end of the press release. Statement from HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra:We want generic drugs for common chronic conditions to be affordable for people on Medicare.  Reliably low copayments for essential generic drugs make it more likely that seniors and people with disabilities can afford the drugs they need to stay healthy, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. This is the latest action taken by President Biden and Vice President Harris to lower drug costs. This Administration has already capped the cost of insulin, made vaccines available at no cost for people with Medicare, and now is, for the first time in history, ensuring Medicare has the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs for seniors C and we will continue to do everything we can to make health care more affordable and accessible for everyone.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Takes Next Step on Proposed Model to Lower Prescription Drug Costs for People with Medicare"},{"text":"She speaks very professionally and kept her composure in enemy territory.

Over 79% of US national debt is owned by people who buy bonds which is basically americans paying more money to the government in exchange for a IOU which will be paid back with interest. So if i buy a bond for $100, i get a IOU promising they will pay it back to me and then give me whatever interest is on it. So if it takes 10 years for the US government to pay me back, i could get maybe double or triple the amount of money what i put in.The remaining 21% is owned by various countries and is because the US needed money to bankroll certain projects and government projects.

You also state that if the death penalty were applied more consistently, it would work. First, we don't actually know thisCthe factors that go into murder are complex and multifaceted. Even if we did, how would you logistically go about increasing the usage of the death penalty without significantly increasing the rate of wrongful execution?Also, the rate of wrongful execution is at least 1 in 25. you migt think that's a tiny amount, but if 1 in 25 people were murdered, that would be an incredibly high homicide rate. This is also a deliberately conservative estimate, so it's likely higher.\\"Carried to its logical limits, we would also have to refrain from saving drowning victims if a number of people were drowning but we could only save a few of them\\" makes no sense to me. Refraining from saving drowning victims does not help the others; if you told me that we could reduce wrongful conviction significantly, but only in one group, if it didn't negatively affect the others I would be fine with that. I would also make the argument we should give the death penalty to people with 3+ prison sentencesPeople with addictions to illegal substances, for example, who were sentenced 3 times should be killed? Who does this law help? Certainly not the people's communities. The impact of executing so many people would be unimaginably high on many marginalized communities.

First off you state that there is no proof that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime, but there is no proof it is not.  If I said aspirin cures schizophrenia, it is up to me to prove it. It is not up to others to disprove it.  It is difficult to prove a negative.For something to be a deterrence, it depends on the target people to do a rational cost/benefit analysis. We might do that in deciding whether or not to cheat on our taxes or to park in a no parking zone so deterrence would work there, but it is a stretch to think people do that when deciding to murder another person.I think you could group murderers into three classes, 1. The crimes of passion (including political passion, aka terrorism), 2. The psychopaths or the mentally deranged, and 3. the cold blooded killer for gain.In the case of 1, say a husband killing a spouse when he finds her cheating, the passion means they are not doing the rational cost/benefit analysis that would have the death penalty a deterrent. Of course society needs to be protected from such people because most spouses confronted with a cheating partner would go to a divorce lawyer, but the fact remains that a crime of passion is almost a temporary psychosis. The subset of 1, the political crime of passion or terrorism is similarly immune to the type of thinking that would make the death penalty a deterrent. Frankly the death penalty might be what the offender wants in order to be a martyr.In the case of 2, similarly we are not dealing with rational actors. Whether or not a person meets the legal definition of criminally insane, the deranged or psychopathic killers are clearly not playing with a full deck. I think the thought processes of people like that are so different from normal people that deterrence or death penalty never even enters their minds. How could the threat of the death penalty affect the mind of a Jeffrey Dahmer or a Ted Bundy?Only in the case of 3 could an argument be raised about deterrence. Surely the professional hitman or someone who kills a partner for insurance money can be deterred. But that is hard to prove and there are certainly people who are either hitmen or killing for insurance money or to get out of a marriage without being taken to the cleaners. Why would they do that if they were facing death? Because they believe they won't get caught. Even a long prison sentence means the person will not enjoy the fruits of his murderous labors so they must believe they will not get caught. And according to [this website](https://www.statista.com/statistics/194213/crime-clearance-rate-by-type-in-the-us/#:~:text=Clearance%20rate%20%2D%20crime%20clearance%20rate%20U.S.%202022%2C%20by%20type&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20murder%20and%20manslaughter,clearance%20rate%2C%20at%209.3%20percent), they are probably right.Finally if the death penalty was a deterrent, we should expect to see states with no death penalties have higher murder rates than those with the death penalty. We do not. It seems like the death penalty makes no difference at all. It is true that the murder rate hinges on a lot of factors so you can't definitively say that the death penalty makes a difference, but let's try to take to fairly similar states, like New York and Pennsylvania, both in the northeast, both with large cities and rural parts dotted with rust belt towns that had seen better days. Perhaps there you should see New York with a higher murder rate. [According to this](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates/murder-rate-of-death-penalty-states-compared-to-non-death-penalty-states), you don't.  (Granted it is from an anti-death penalty org, but the article states how they derived the charts and the source for the data so you can go check the original data out for yourself.)  \\nOn the miscarriage of justice argument, you cite a study from almost 40 years ago, way before modern forensic methods. I frankly question the relevance of that study. The latest I can come up with is this 2014 study, [Rate of false conviction of criminal defendants who are sentenced to death | PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1306417111)The estimate about 4% wrongful convictions, but that is obviously only the ones we know about and that doesn't take into account some who might have copped a plea to avoid the death penalty. 4% might not sound like a lot but if 4% of buildings collapsed or 4% of airliners crashed there would be an uproar.","title":"CMV: The death penalty is morally justified and is a necessity for redtrisbutive justice as the \\ndeath penalty is a fitting response to evil.

The question that's most important here is fundamentally relative. That is to say: what is most important is whether or not the death penalty serves society's interests relatively more than life in prison.I submit that the death penalty does not create additional deterrence relative to threat of life in prison. IMO life in prison sounds worse than dying.Furthermore, in the case of wrongful conviction people sentenced to life in prison can be released. However people cannot be bought back from the dead.In practice this means that many states have made it much harder to sentence someone to death rather than give them a life sentence in prison. They do this to reduce the chance of killing an innocent person. In the end this makes the death penalty more expensive than life in prison. Altogether this means that life sentences don't have any less benefits than the death penalty, and yet have much less drawbacks than the death penalty.","title":"CMV: The death penalty is morally justified and is a necessity for redtrisbutive justice as the \\ndeath penalty is a fitting response to evil.

That year, Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about having an affair with Monica Lewinsky and it was expected that the GOP would make gains in the House. They LOST 5 seats. Their outrage machine didn't pan out. I don't remember what polling was exactly, we didn't have big data then the way we do now, but I do remember the thinking being that Republicans would do well and they didn't.There are likely more silent Harris voters in red areas than are being reflected in polls. Particularly with White women, the largest race+gender voting bloc, she is running up the margins, and she's killing it with college-educated folks, as the OP article says. Plus Dems are voting early, making plans to vote, not leaving their vote to chance. Plus in all swing states except AZ and NV, the gov is a Democrat, and the president is a Democrat this time. And I'm glad Harris went on Fox. Like Pete Buttigieg says, it's not the person who put the TV on Fox that you're aiming for, it's those in the room with that person.I agree that she is basically making the right moves and that if Trump wins, it was likely an inevitability, and we do live in weird times. But I'd also like to think that the 8-year-cycle of outrage, upheaval, and party realignment that we see repeating every 50 or so years (1964-72 was the last big one) is exhausting itself, that people are tired of being jostled and flamed and just want a country where folks can get along, and Harris is constructing that narrative.

But specifically with the death penalty I think we're missing out on a source of valuable information. The more we can learn how and why people are driven to do vile things the more we can prevent it or make better decisions when it happens which should be the goal more so than punishment. If we killed off Manson straight away we wouldn't had decades of direct insight on how he accomplished what he did. Besides life in prison is a really brutal punishment. Profoundly worse than the death penalty I would think. With the death penalty you feel the life you wasted up until they kill you. So the person is punished for 5 to 10 years while the paperwork goes through. Then they get a relatively painless death. Where life in prison they have to live with the pain of their choice for however much life they have left. It'll likely end with some awful natural cause that withers them away like most of us have to suffer. It'd also has a great potential for preventing. If Manson was put to the death he might be seen as a martyr or somehow more legendary than he is now to some folks. But the world got to see he wasn't some mystical being.

My question to you is who in the government do you trust to decide what is and isn't moral? In certain circumstances it may be morally justified to have the death penalty, however, some circumstances may be more complex. Which crimes does this apply? The Philipines a few years back under President Rodrigo Duterte, had death squads made up of police officers that would find drug dealers and execute them on the street. This was a reaction to the wide reaching level of crime in the country, but it also resulted in the death of teenagers who were caught up in the drug trade. It was certainly a deterent and crime fell, but it left in its wake a bitter taste in the mouths of many who felt this was too far. Some felt though it was morally justified and lauded him.

This is common with white working class voters. However, just because they're registered Dems, doesn't mean they vote for them, especially in the Trump era. Eventually, they get around to changing their registration to Republican. The second factor is that younger voters tend to register more as Independents, even though they're more liberal. The decreasing party registration edge the Dems have in PA (from 12% in April 2008 to ~4% in April 2024) is a combination of these two factors.

We already do that pretty well. The issue, which you allude to, is recidivism rates, multiple offenses. Im guessing youre American and the American prison system is built for recidivism. Very few prisons offer tools to help those that are serving time get their lives back on track through education or skill building. Putting money into helping prisoners get skills or an education while they are serving their time would be money that is much better spent there than on litigation of the death penalties.37 states have ban the box laws that fight discrimination against former prisoners and allow them to have a better chance at getting a job. That should be a policy nationwide. This is the land of 2nd chances and the American dream. Why shouldnt we help those who have served their time and would rather not go back to prison land jobs so that they dont have to return to a life of crime. Many prisoners return to crime not because they enjoy criminal behavior or because they love prison so much. They return because our country leaves them with very few opportunities once they get out.Another issue is education. The school to prison pipeline is a real thing. Wouldnt we be far better off by putting resources into our schools and providing the next generation with opportunities rather than spending that money to litigate all the death penalties that would happen if your plan happened? I would rather see that money go to schools.People arent inherently good. We do have a social contract that needs to be held up. But that doesnt mean turning our backs on people because they messed up once.","title":"CMV: The death penalty is morally justified and is a necessity for redtrisbutive justice as the \\ndeath penalty is a fitting response to evil.

Like Walz, she had a background in the school system, and bases her platform around bringing legislation for public education. Although she styles herself as an independent, her listed causes show that she would be pretty willing to caucus with Democrats on pressing issues like climate and tackling blockage to healthcare accessibility. Shes a lot like Mo Green, so having two local Democratic voices for the North Carolina public education system would be much appreciated.

Far more direct than climate change causing the hurricane. I believe in climate change but hurricanes have always happened in that area of the world. Climate change makes hurricanes worse, but a hurricane of that size and scale could have happened regardless.The government to my knowledge is not in control of hurricanes but it is in control of the legal system.  It is the duty of the government to take action to enforce the law.

Real immigrants - from everywhere across the world - Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, you name it.  If you're accepted, your entire future hinges on your ability to keep your job and apply for a visa with a cap of roughly 65,000 and it only works for so many attempts. And when the CBP tells them \\"it's time to go, your visa is expired\\" they leave on a moment's notice despite building a life in America. Their house, their car, their boyfriend, everything. I love immigrants, because they go through all that shit just for a *chance* to be American.It is perfectly valid to be against illegal immigration in light of the above. It's not xenophobic.

Trump certainly didn't help himself by saying he would use the military against \\"internal enemies\\"He didn't say that. Now you are just lying. Post the clip. I saw what CNN did they took one clip where he was talking about the \\"enemy within\\" and then they cut and spliced it with his comments about the military which was in a different context.

They basically say that these immigrants flooding in are illegal with no background checks or safety measures, and it causes problems because criminals can flood across the border. Arguing that illegal immigration is bad because the lack of regulation means that cartels and other criminals can enter America unchecked isnt a xenophobic stance. If that person whose daughter was killed said a damn Mexican killed my daughter, fuck all Mexicans that would be xenophobic. Saying, Bidens policy let this illegal immigrant stay in America and he killed my daughter, thats criticizing not deporting illegal immigrants. Its the same criticism of a DA letting people out of jail and then them reoffending and hurting people, with people arguing that those policies are too lax. Its a legitimate argument.","title":"CMV: Saying that illegal immigrants came from the border and killed your daughter because of the Biden administration is just xenophobic."},{"text":"Well don't keep us guessing","title":"Colin Allred says his campaign raised $1 million after his fiery debate with Ted Cruz"},{"text":"you advocate for your daughter, yes.

That wasn't his intention, just like the mayor didn't shorten yellow lights to cause fatal crashes, but it is a clear result of his policies.It seems that your argument is zooming into one particular aspect of this. You're no longer debating whether or not it is Biden's fault, you're claiming that blaming illegal immigrants as a category for a loved one's murder is xenophobic, distancing the argument from Biden. However, it's the same argument, just one step further removed.It's not seriously disputed that Biden's new set of policies have increased the number of illegal immigrants entering the US. Some portion of those immigrants have committed crimes, which would not have occurred had those immigrants not been here. While it's unlikely in general that any particular illegal immigrant is the one to commit any given murder, it is not disputable that many murders are the result of Biden's actions. If illegal immigrants as a whole packed up and left, many murders would be prevented in the US.","title":"CMV: Saying that illegal immigrants came from the border and killed your daughter because of the Biden administration is just xenophobic."},{"text":"Anybody can, but in this instance, it was an illegal immigrant","title":"CMV: Saying that illegal immigrants came from the border and killed your daughter because of the Biden administration is just xenophobic."},{"text":"\\"Whatabout Trump!\\"","title":"Fox News Interview May Have Finally Exposed Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Or, when asked about breaking up Google/Alphabet, he talks about Virginia and the DOJ stealing the election or some BS like that","title":"Harris distances herself from Biden, bashes Trump in tense Fox News interview"},{"text":"Nah, your general republican just says it because it sounds like Republican and democracy sounds like Democrat.

There is not much we can do. Such cases are increasing in which children are born with a human form, but are not really human beings in relation to their highest I; instead, they are filled with beings that do not belong to the human class. Quite a number of people have been born since the nineties without an I, that is, they are not reincarnated, but are human forms filled with a sort of natural demon. There are quite a large number of older people going around who are actually not human beings, but are only natural; they are human beings only in regard to their form. We cannot, however, create a school for demons. A teacher: How is that possible? Dr. Steiner: Cosmic error is certainly not impossible. The relationships of individuals coming into earthly existence have long been determined. There are also generations in which individuals have no desire to come into earthly existence and be connected with physicality, or immediately leave at the very beginning. In such cases, other beings that are not quite suited step in. This is something that is now quite common, that human beings go around without an I; they are actually not human beings, but have only a human form. They are beings like nature spirits, which we do not recognize as such because they go around in a human form. They are also quite different from human beings in regard to everything spiritual. They can, for example, never remember such things as sentences; they have a memory only for words, not for sentences. The riddle of life is not so simple. When such a being dies, it returns to nature from which it came. The corpse decays, but there is no real dissolution of the etheric body, and the natural being returns to nature. It is also possible that something like an automaton could occur. The entire human organism exists, and it might be possible to automate the brain and develop a kind of pseudomorality. I do not like to talk about such things since we have often been attacked even without them. Imagine what people would say if they heard that we say there are people who are not human beings. Nevertheless, these are facts. Our culture would not be in such a decline if people felt more strongly that a number of people are going around who, because they are completely ruthless, have become something that is not human, but instead are demons in human form.","title":"Are reptilians just demons?"},{"text":"People say Harris is courageous to go on a unfriendly network to deal with tough questions.

Many are abusing the asylum process which is meant for people who are fleeing from much worse than economic turmoil. By definition they are taking advantage of the system. I sympathize with their living conditions at home but unless they came to the US as children without consent, I don't see why we should care about their 'fighting chance' when I have coworkers on their third go-round on the H1B lottery who may need to drop everything and leave the country their applications are unsuccessful.","title":"CMV: Saying that illegal immigrants came from the border and killed your daughter because of the Biden administration is just xenophobic."},{"text":"Why on Earth would China and Russia suddenly switch to allying with Israel?

Republican presidential candidates win in these two places by a single digit margin.Meanwhile, the Democrats' two biggest electoral prizes (the #1 and #4 biggest states, California with 54 electoral votes and New York with 28 electoral votes) are always won in a landslide by the Democratic presidential candidate.Additionally, representation in the Electoral College favors smaller states (e.g. more rural and thus more GOP-dominant states) due to the number of electors each state gets being equal to the number of Congress members that state is allotted. Since each state gets 2 Senate seats no matter what, more rural states are overrepresented in the Electoral College.This is how Harris could win the popular vote by millions and yet lose the Electoral College if those ever-important swing states should swing for Trump.2 - Trump's star power. Whatever you think of him, his celebrity defies gravity. Nothing he does is fully held against him, and he has a lot of fans who will show up to vote for him out of love for him (not even out of any policy issue, just love for the cult leader) who wouldn't otherwise vote. That stubborn support, which no other Republican has been able to duplicate, keeps him close.3 -  Institutionalization of Trumpism. Now that Trump has been around a while, he is normalized. He has institutional, stuck-around political weight (the same kind of thing that can get Sherrod Brown elected in Ohio despite Ohio going red otherwise). Many folks who might have been shocked at his behavior early now might wonder, \\"if after all this they haven't taken him down, he MUST be something special, there MUST be a reason they can't get to him, maybe things aren't like I was told by the media\\" ... and some such people open up to him in a way they didn't before. Black and Latino male voters in particular are doing this in larger numbers than before.This election is so important because if he loses, his star will expire politically, and that stubborn Elvis-fan-like adoration of him will not continue to be a factor at the ballot box once he's gone. He's the big boss at the end of the level. To level up, you gotta beat the big boss.","title":"'Dobbs Dads': The sleeper coalition that could turn out for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Yeah but what about hunters penis?

She ignored his setups and stupidly configured questions with no good answers, and she just steamrolled all over that garbage with her own actually good and useful information voters actually need to hear.She was smart to keep talking and eat up all his time.  I bet he had 4x the questions vs what he actually got to ask, and each and every question prepared was a trap intended to only create bad answers and talking points to follow up shows.  It was VERY smart to not give him time for any of that crap.  And when he did ask a dumb question, she just ignored it and did her own thing.This was very much NOT an interview, and there was no good faith in the setup at all.  Every single question presented was built with nefarious intent, every single one.  None were built to create discussion on anything.  Every single one was just a narrative bullet point.She took a great path through it all.  She took that path that placed no power in their hands through the whole thing.I also like to think that her presence and demeanor might have also swayed some voters, perhaps.  She was calm, respectful, but also assertive, and authoritative.  She presented good qualities of leadership taking ownership of a situation and managing it.My only gripe is a personal one.  She's purposefully being emotionally conservative.  She's reserved.  If this is good or bad, I'm not sure.  It's a neutral position, but there's value in emotion.  There's a natural want of people to develop buy-in to the emotional state of a person, a natural want for empathy.  If she was perhaps slightly more candidate, more natural to her feelings, that dynamic would engage more significantly with viewers.  But, she runs the risk of creating conflict with personalities that don't align.

As that narrative stumbled Israel changed the narrative to her throwing bricks at the soldiers. That changed story also fell apart because video came out showing she was 200M away from the soldiers and no human can throw stones or bricks that far, so the narrative then changed to her using a sling to hurl stones (not bricks) at the soldiers, but that also fell apart because slings require a great deal of practice and skill to master and there's no record of Miss Eygi having ever used a sling, or owned one, or competed with one which is the skill level needed to use one over 660' away.

The whole national party is fighting to keep the Latino voteshare high.I do think the state Dem party has got their shit together now and is building some foundations, but if we keep moving rather to the right, we could be lost. On the other hand, if the right stops moving here due to costs, insurance and Hurricanes, you would imagine we could shift some back to the left with young voters. Again, a catch 22 because they register as NPA and turnout even worse than they do nationally.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 16, 2024 - 20 days until election day!"},{"text":"I'm still mad that Trump has not apologized for what he said about Khazr Khan's wife.","title":"Kamala Harris interview on Fox"},{"text":"Hey, Cabba! ??

A \\"coup\\" is a sudden action by military or governmental elites resulting in an illegal change of government. Since President Biden remains in office and (*deo volente*) will remain in office till the end of his elected term in January of next year, there is no illegal change of government.You also, I think, don't understand how politics works. It is extremely common in democratic societies for senior members of political parties to place pressure to resign or decline to remain in office on heads of government, generally because they fear that the president or prime minister in question is losing public support, or is likely to lose an upcoming election. President Biden came under such pressure because questions about his ability to continue effectively in his role for a second term became a matter of severe political concern. Democratic Party members wanted to win the election this year, so placed pressure on the President to allow an alternative candidate to be placed in contention. Given the electoral timetable, there was only one reasonable candidate, if the Democrats really wanted to win the election. I don't know for sure, but I think it very likely that President Obama encouraged President Biden to retire from the election gracefully, and those of us on the anti-Trump side of politics are very glad he did. But this certainly wasn't a coup. It was just politics as usual.Consider some other resignations: the 1974 resignation of Nixon; the 2022 resignation of Boris Johnson; the 2022 resignation of Liz Truss; the 1917 resignation of Aristide Briand; the 1974 resignation of Willy Brandt; the 1990 resignation of Margaret Thatcher. In each of these cases, senior party members placed pressure on their heads of government to resign, and after appropriate constitutional activity all duly did so. Are you seriously claiming that these were all coups? Because if you are, I think you just don't understand how politics works.By the way, what exactly do you mean by the phrase \\"neoliberal shill\\", please? I get the impression that you think this is a bad thing, but I don't really understand why. Please would you explain.

I would also contend this has been one of the worst weeks for Zionism in many decades. It all began with Hezbollah's drone attacks, which cost the lives of 4 IDF soldiers and injured dozens more (practically an entire company has been wracked; very few 18-year-olds will be able to continue functioning after seeing their friends dismembered in front of their eyes). It reached a new peak today with the US practically announcing that Israel is committing such a criminal campaign of ethnic cleansing, starvation, and extermination in Gaza, that the US may be forced to stop arming it.Yes, Israel has been given a month which it will use to extort and manipulate in DC and murder in Gaza and Lebanon, but in terms of the narrative war, the US government basically admitted that the pro-humanity, pro-Palestine protest movement was right, and Israel is an international criminal against humanity. This is freaking huge, even if the US doesn't follow through, or not completely. It is huge. It is a historic admission and landmark.And this administration, bound to Zionism as it is, made this letter public: they want the world to know what they think about Israel at this moment. Finally, in between the drone attacks, against which Israel is practically helpless, the US is placing a THAAD system in Israel, announcing further that Israel is incapable of defending itself even with billions in aid.Israel's air defenses are no match for Iran's missile and drone capabilities while committing internationally-recognized war crimes.It was also the week hundreds of reservists declared they would refuse to go into service if no hostage deal was made. \\n-\\nIsrael's military and diplomatic standing suffered huge blows, and its indefensibility has gotten strikingly more pronounced. \\n         \\nI also watched Netanyahu's video from the military base where Hezbollah's drone hit, and he looks clearly panicked, and out of balance. He cannot even mimic his usual fake nonchalance anymore. \\n-\\nThis week marks a turning point in this war and genocide. And it means what it always means, and what I always predict: Israel is about to escalate significantly against Lebanon and Iran. It is going to suffer some major damages, perhaps even of the debilitating sort. This will not result in empathy for Israel, on the contrary. The more fragile Israel looks militarily, the less fearful people and organizations will feel to act and speak against it. Zionism only inspires fear, no love. When the fear abates, a very loaded truth is going to emerge. \\n-\\nIsrael just ordered more evacuations in southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah said that if the war continued, they were going to spare no one and nothing in Israel.  I think things are about to experience a drastic and violent twist. This whole thing is entering its moments of truth.","title":"I don't know if you've noticed it in the nonstop stream of major events, but this last week or so has been not only one of the worst in Netanyahu's demonic career.

With several swing states too close to call, including battlegrounds that Ms Harris needs to win the presidency, she has just three weeks to convince Republicans to vote for her.It is hard to see how Wednesdays interview achieved that goal. On almost every subject, Ms Harris batted away policy questions and opportunities to push her plan for the White House in favour of slamming Donald Trump.Ms Harris described?[border security](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/09/27/kamala-harris-to-visit-us-border-for-first-time-three-years/)?as a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have, but then didnt talk about it. She talked about Trumps role in blocking Joe Bidens border deal, and offered no solutions of her own.She was then asked why voters do not trust her to tackle inflation, and she talked about Trumps economic plan, not her own. A question about transgender operations in federal prisons produced a response about Trump.Even in the most newsworthy section of the interview, about how her White House?[would differ from Mr Bidens](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/10/15/kamala-harris-has-sabotaged-her-own-campaign/), Ms Harris suggested she would avoid the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump.It is hard to imagine that this strategy was compelling for Fox News viewers, who are almost all likely to think Trumps policy positions are at the least defensible, more probably laudable.Ms Harris has spent weeks on the back foot, unable to answer detailed policy questions even in softball interviews with Left-wing outlets. When she finally sat down with Fox, she could only attack the man the network most supports.The other theme of the interview, which got heated at times as Mr Baier tried to interrupt Ms Harris, was Mr Bidens legacy.Ms Harris is stuck with the inheritance of his administration, including a record of high inflation and record border crossings.She must support him and continue the fiction that he is mentally agile, while trying to run a campaign based on a new generation of change.Many Republicans will have tuned in to hear Ms Harris face their favourite anchor on Wednesday.After hearing her answers, my instinct is that they will still support Trump. What alternative did Ms Harris offer?\\"**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/16/kamala-harris-fox-interview-our-experts-give-their-verdict/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/16/kamala-harris-fox-interview-our-experts-give-their-verdict/)","title":"'Kamala Harriss big Fox gamble did not pay off': our experts are united in their verdict"},{"text":"I have full confidence that Trump will take the record back very soon, when he sits for an interview with Fox after being sentenced to federal prison","title":"Harris interview with Fox News showcases a change in strategy for Democrats with network"},{"text":"I'm tellin ya, there is something wrong with the polls.

This comment is for those not adverse to some important reading:This guy, with this lineage ruled the Colonies that would become the United States:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\\\\_III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III)[https://ancientpedia.com/king-george-iii-family-tree/](https://ancientpedia.com/king-george-iii-family-tree/)[https://www.treesofblue.com/king-george-i-family-tree-1660-1727/](https://www.treesofblue.com/king-george-i-family-tree-1660-1727/)Notice that German influence in the British lineage?Well, anyway, they claim George might have been bipolar or had some type of psychiatric condition.  But, suffice to say, he sure was mad about the revolutionaries that became rivals on the world's stage.  For the rest of his life.Meanwhile, down the road to the East, he had some competition rising:[https://www.thelist.com/871788/the-untold-truth-of-the-house-of-windsor/](https://www.thelist.com/871788/the-untold-truth-of-the-house-of-windsor/)Reaching it's plateau right around the time of WWI.I suspect Germany wasn't happy that their long game was thwarted, even though the \\"Allies\\" were infiltrated in lineage.So, the Germans re-group for a third time:[https://www.britannica.com/place/Third-Reich](https://www.britannica.com/place/Third-Reich)And their leader tries for world dominance again in WWII, and epically fails.  Or did he?If there's a little truth to this:[https://www.history.com/news/how-south-america-became-a-nazi-haven](https://www.history.com/news/how-south-america-became-a-nazi-haven)And/or this:[https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/nazi-super-fortress-in-antarctica.html](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/nazi-super-fortress-in-antarctica.html)Then, there might be this:[https://www.fpri.org/article/2015/04/germany-in-the-21st-century-part-i-the-fourth-reich/](https://www.fpri.org/article/2015/04/germany-in-the-21st-century-part-i-the-fourth-reich/)And, maybe some truths to this, too:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\\\\_Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip)Which means that this guy may not have been completely wrong:[https://www.britannica.com/event/McCarthyism](https://www.britannica.com/event/McCarthyism)And in this public \\"splintering\\" of those guys, might there have been a very private kill-switch type plan?  Kind of like, we've put a long time in our strategy in the past, and many measures in contingency for the future, regardless of our public \\"loss\\"?If my dots all connect, or at least several of them do, it would make perfect sense for Nixon to take the United States off the Gold Standard in 1971, moving the US ever closer to it's own growing empire having it's organized fall from power.A lot of things happened after 1971 as a result of that action, along with the march to give China \\"Favored Nation\\" status, which carved out the heavy industrial dominance of the US.I suspect if we're not careful, one of the things we might see, sooner than later, is the emergence of that pesky 4th Reich.

If you previously thought that some people had zero risk of betraying your trust then you weren't really trusting them at all. Trust implies some level of potential for it to be violated, otherwise it would just be \\"knowing\\". So if you don't think they can be trusted it means you have set a bar of confidence above where you judge them to be. Also can you provide and answer to the rest of what was asked?What, this? Or more common for this sub in particular like a woman being assaulted by a man and then saying she's cautious around men because any of them could decide to harm her?Anyone can always be assaulted by anyone. Women can be assaulted by other women, men can be assaulted by both men and women. The women who do the \\"bear vs. man\\" bit are unfairly labeling all men as **likely** predators, not just the potential. Potential exists everywhere. Altruism is a concept but not a reality like any other religion or philosophy. It's just something people try to live by but that doesn't mean they actually are bound to live that way.Well of course, people have what at least resembles free will. Are you just now recognizing and mourning the fact there are no guarantees in life?There are good people out there who will try to do right by you. Those people can be trusted by any meaningful use of the word. Are they infallible robots with no potential for straying or messing up? No, of course not, but that is an ideal that only exists in your mind. Not even in you. What you seem to be saying is that I should've deemed these people to be untrustworthy before they showed they were untrustworthy which doesn't make senseNo, what I am saying is that just because those people showed themselves to be untrustworthy doesn't mean that *nobody* is worthy of trust. Hell, we don't even know that **you** are portraying what actually happened accurately, you might be an unreliable narrator and these \\"betrayals of trust\\" are far more mundane and of questionable fault.Are you expecting a reality where you never are disappointed? That isn't realistic. Before I say no I'll give you a chance to explain which part of my view you think you've changed hereYour title, which should be representative of your position, states \\"The only person you can truly trust is yourself\\".

Also they keep reporting this myth that there are millions of women held hostage in Republican-led households that don't get to consume anything but Fox News and that's who the interview is for. They also seem to assume that these women are pro-abortion when women occupy *both* extreme ends of the abortion opinion spectrum more than men. Race, marital status and education level influences the abortion opinion among women by quite a bit. White, married women possess some of the most extreme anti-abortion sentiments in the country while white single women pull the other direction. Conservative and/or religious Latinas are also present on the furthest end of the spectrum as being anti-abortion. When they say, \\"women are pro abortion\\" it really mostly tracks with the general electorate in that the more educated classes of both men and women tend to go hard for abortion. You may as well say, \\"more educated women vote Democrat\\" which... I mean, no shit Sherlock. This also tracks why younger women are more pro abortion than married women by common knowledge younger women are more likely to be in college and unmarried.This idea that there are millions of white and latina women held hostage in their homes enslaved to Fox news is not rooted in reality but this lie further drives home the point that liberals have a vested, political interest in keeping women single, childless and miserable for as long as possible.","title":"Bret Baier Questions Rattled Kamala Harris on Deadly Consequences of Her Open Border Policies in Fox News Interview"},{"text":"Connedservicopes","title":"Harris interview with Fox News showcases a change in strategy for Democrats with network"},{"text":"Everyone is entitled to their opinion.

Of course this is not a set number because it depends on the load that each unit is putting out. Higher load is higher emissions, both coal and gas fired. A unit putting out 230 megawatts has less emissions than one running at 750 megawatts. There are third party companies that come to every power plant and does a separate test of all the equipment concurrently at different loads to compare plant vs auditor equipment and the plant equipment has to match within a very small margin of error. This test is called a RATA test.

They spent most of it bickering so sure she was off putting but when it comes down to substance the only topics Brett covered were the border, trans issues, and Iran (not counting Bidens decline because she successfully slipped that one).Nothing new came out of the first 2 topics and she got away with the 3rd topic since the interview ended without Brett being able to explain the loopholes in the Iran deal and how their financial situation has improved enormously under Biden/Harris.So what did we learn? Harris is off putting and has bad border and gender policies. We already knew that. She also had an opportunity to present her opinion on Trumps bad Iran policy and didnt suffer and adequate rebuttal.I dont see how that equates to negative sentiment to her but I do see how people could view Brett as too combative &amp; now praise her for finally doing a hostile interview. Final footnote here- I think Brett neglecting to bring up FEMAs diversion of funds &amp; consequential lack of money for NC residents is a fucking travesty.

All well after Biden was already President. The F Brandon and I did that type of garbage was out of control. Ive been very pleasantly surprised to see extremely minimal signs of outward support here now, the vibes are much improved. That said Ive been a Florida voter for almost 20 years and have been disappointed time and again. Recently a lot has been made of Floridas rightward movement and if National Democrats should even invest here statewide. I dont know the answers and dont know if Harris or DMP can pull it off but I am starting to be sure of one thing. This environment is as Dem friendly as we can hope for in Florida and I think this election will be a good bellwether for the states future. If Harris and/or DMP can pull it off that bodes well and shows a need to keep investing here. However, if neither of them get across the finish line in this environment and with both marijuana and abortion on the ballot; I hate to say but Florida is only going to get more out of reach in the near future. Personally hate to see it but then again trading Florida for solidifying Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, etc. (and hopefully coming soon N. Carolina and Blexas) is a good trade.

Had a best friend in high school that I used to hang out with everyday. He knew I liked a girl and for some reason, without my knowledge, decided to message her asking if she was into me and she said she didn't know me enough to answer. He then bad mouths me and tries to take her out himself. Only reason I find this out is because he logged in on my computer and left the messages up in a different tab.2.  I went away to a different country for a couple weeks and when I get back someone has broken into my dorm and stole a single bottle of alcohol. None of my friends know and one friend drives me to go report it and jokes with the cops about how I drink a lot so I probably drank it and forgot. Well a week later they pull the video and before I go see it my 'friend' reveals that it actually was him but at that point it's too late. He then goes and tells everyone that he told me it was him from the start and I just wanted to get him in trouble3. I'm at a bar with a group of friends the 2 guys are 'best friends' and the girl is dating one. The boyfriend leaves and for the next 10-15 minutes the other friend is trying to hit on the girl and is buying her drinks saying they should hook up again and bad mouths him. He comes back and both of them go right back to normal as if nothing happened.4. A different friend went away and allowed a friend to borrow his car saying only she can use it to get to and from work. Well she lets her boyfriend drive it, he crashes it and totals the car. She doesn't tell him until he gets back, says she's not paying for it and also lies and says it was something faulty with the car and that he should reimburse her.5. Finally I had a friend who went to drink with her friends and she got completely wasted and they abandon her to go with some guys to a different party. She didn't know anyone so she had to call me to come drive 45 minutes to pick her up","title":"CMV: The only person you can truly trust is yourself"},{"text":"Because its the plan.
