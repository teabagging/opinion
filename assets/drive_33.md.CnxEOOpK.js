The right offers simple answers, scapegoats, echochambers. The issues in reality are far more complex and nuanced, and spaces where the issues like patriarchy, toxic masculinity, rape culture, feminism, etc are examined in detail are overwhelmingly created by and for women.Men don't create spaces for themselves so that we can educate and support eachother.

[Earl Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Silverman) was a male domestic abuse survivor and advocate for male DV victims, starting the first and only male DV shelter in Canada. When he escaped his own abusive wife, he couldn't find any DV support shelters for men, only outlets that treated men for anger management. As he said \\"as a victim, I was re-victimized by having these services telling me that I wasn't a victim, but I was a perpetrator.\\" He started the DV shelter for men in the early 2000s and struggled for the following decade to keep it running in the face of constant public ridicule and financial struggles. He ended up taking his own life in 2013 after having to sell the DV shelter when it went bankrupt. His suicide note condemned the Canadian government for refusing to recognize male DV victims.And he's not the only one. [Erin Pizzey,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey) the woman who basically invented the concept of the DV shelter, found that most DV is reciprocal (a claim that has since been backed up by [basically all of the research](https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230705/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VA21.pdf) since, with some studies even finding that non-reciprocal violence is [perpetrated mostly by women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/), though men are more likely to commit physical injury when violent). According to her, 62 of 100 of the women who entered her shelter had violent tendencies--not merely as a self-defense reaction to DV, but independently violent on their own. From this, she concluded that an equivilent male shelter should be established for male victims.This basically ruined her career as an advocate for women's shelters; she was banned from the shelter she helped establish, and more generally publicly exiled from the UK, with people claiming she said things that she never said (like \\"women invite abuse\\"). She ended up needing to get constant bomb squad supervision because of the ubiquity of the threats against her, and the risk that someone would act on it and mail a bomb to her. She has long blamed \\"militant feminists\\" for all of this.So when someone claims \\"the left ignores men\\", this is why. It's not unreasonable in this regard to make the claim \\"the left is *hostile* to men\\", as it so often has been the case. I can say as a personal anecdote, while I was in college, I had a feminist friend who posted a meme on Facebook that I thought was insensitive to male rape victims (which I am, by the way; the perpetrator was a woman). It was a quote by George Takei saying \\"no one asks a male rape victim what they were wearing\\". I understood his point, it was a about victim blaming, but the reason it's insensitive is because no one asks male rape victims *anything*, unless we are a convenient rhetorical device to use for a different argument (as was being done here). Indeed, until recently, it was legally impossible (and still is in some jurisdictions) for a man to be raped by a woman. We are a completely invisible demographic until we're convenient for another argument, and all I did was point out how that quote was insensitive to such victims, including myself. Low and behold, I get dogpiled by her and her friends for \\"mansplaining\\" and the hostility evolved into actual death threats in my DMs, saying \\"the next person to mansplain to me is getting a broken neck\\". The truly astonishing thing is that when I ghosted her, she had the audacity to be upset about it; my feelings, as a man, were completely inconsequential to her. They didn't exist.Suffice to say that pushed me head first into the proto-manosphere that existed in the early 2010s for a good long while, and while I was in that space, I heard countless stories not unlike my own. I ended up leaving that space after some time, however, as I still considered myself fundamentally a leftist, and a lot of the people in that space I felt were exploiting the pain men feel for darker purposes (folks like Andrew Tate are just more modern examples of what I was afraid some corners of it were becoming). But I also haven't ever really forgotten the mindset I was in, and what lead me to that mindset in the first place.My story is just one anecdote, but it's one that runs parallel with countless others like it. If you want to know why men feel like the left ignores men, it's because frankly, they *do*, and that's an \\"at best\\" case. At worst they are actively hostile to them. And with absolutely no other outlet to turn to, it's incredibly easy to fall down the right-wing rabbit hole. I'm not trying to cast blame on the whole of the left, mind you; a lot of this is chicken and egg shit. I'm just relaying the way the left is perceived by these people as someone who used to consider himself one of them.","title":"What Should Democrats Say to Young Men? | Young men appear to be drifting right.

Based on the thin substance of your post and some of your responses, you're basically asserting that \\"democracies\\" are uniquely susceptible to short-term thinking/planning in governance. Firstly, to the extent that any specific country is more exemplary of \\"democracy\\" than another, you haven't really identified the key characteristics. Since you mention \\"presidents,' Trump, and since most users are from the US, it would seem you're talking about US politics. To what extent is the US \\"democratic\\" and which elements are non-democratic? And how much do these elements contribute to the long/short term planning you mention?We could look at the Federalist Society, which is, frankly, how we got W. Bush as President over Gore and a major part of how Trump was able to appoint 3 Justices to create the 6-3 supermajority in the Supreme Court and overturn *Roe.* The Federalist Society was formed around 42 years ago by conservative attorneys and justices largely as a reaction to the broad success of liberals post New Deal and the celebrated liberal successes of the Warren Court. With some billionaire funding and concerted efforts to \\"standardize\\" conservative politics, the federalist society has been working for decades to capture the conservative votes where possible to appoint ideologically conservative judges to shift the laws to the right and restrict the progress of any liberal congress or president. Was this democratic? Well if the US is a democracy, and conservatives winning elections is good enough to say \\"democracy,\\" then I'm not sure how you could argue that it isn't. I think it's actually much more mixed, but so is most of this. Point being, some people with long term ideological vision captured the votes of the conservative base to fulfill a multi-decades-long mission of shifting the courts to the right and overturning a key law based on fundamentalist Christian morality. Is that not long-term planning? How many of the most influential congressmembers have been around in their office for decades? From Mitch McConnell to Nancy Pelosi to Joe Biden, Chuck Grassley, Susan Collins, and Chuck Schumer, many of these politicians have had 20+ years in their current office, usually with previous experience leading to that seat. There's actually a good deal more continuity in our politics than one might think, because if you can win multiple elections, you usually have the opportunity to work on longer-term projects. Like any job or just life, we can work on more than one thing at a time. So congressmembers might work to make immediate progress for their constituents to make sure they feel the benefits of electing them and help secure re-election, but they can also simultaneously or in parallel work on longer-term goals and projects as well. So unless you're going to get more specific to strengthen up your argument, I think this is a lame point.","title":"CMV: Democracy does not encourage long term planning\\n"},{"text":"We are rehabilitating Trump now?

Everyone agrees its unequivocally bad, thats not a nuanced discussion or even really one thats unheard. Society isnt exactly tap dancing when some twenty-something is suicidal. But what do we blame? alpha-male influencers tend to blame emasculation, incel communities tend to blame women, evangelicals say its because of a lack of good Christian morals. All of that is *easy* to say. People want one group or issue to blame, rather than discussing complex society wide failures to provide support and opportunity to young men who see nothing but stagnation and isolation in their future. The right can and does do that frequently, with no concern for those scapegoats. But what if you care about the people involved? Thats the lefts problem. Do you blame men for fostering a culture of toxic masculinity that puts down other men for expressing genuine emotion? that sounds like victim blaming. Women for not being more emotionally available and helping to foster friendships with isolated and socially challenged individuals? sounds quite tone deaf in the me-too era. Society at large, for not creating enough opportunities for men and providing them with a strong sense of purpose and identity? Loops back around to the first problem, when older men still tend to hold most positions of authority in government institutions and business and things like individual identity and self expression are more likely to be repressed by friends and colleagues more than strangers and out-groups. The right can argue each and every point because they dont give a shit if women are treated fairly in their accusations, or if weaker men are put down to make others feel better, they dont care if the boogeyman they blamed for our problems even *exists*. The left, in trying so hard to avoid being *wrong* in any way, dances on a tight rope for ages desperately trying to avoid the *perception* of unfairly targeting a group.","title":"What Should Democrats Say to Young Men? | Young men appear to be drifting right.

Instead we have a system that represents the rich donors who elect our politicians. Lobbyists write laws, corporations fund campaigns, and widely popular policies fail to actually become reality.

The United States calls itself a Democracy, but yet it espouses anti-democratic processes at every single level of its bureaucracy.  It has private corporations(DNC/RNC) that have argued they have no responsibility to field candidates with any regard to the populace.  The media infrastructure has pitted the two teams against each other, and created gridlock which benefits both sides.  Both sides demonize the other, and fundraise off the boogeyman.  It creates a system that does not effectively and adequately address the needs off the populace.  Instead it functions as bread and circuses for the population to perceive they have power(once every 4 years) to quell dissent, and have an enemy to point to when things inevitably go against the needs of the populace.

It wasnt some grand social necessity; it was a reaction to a unique situation with invading toilets. This framing of it as a direct result of Nyan Cat oversimplifies a really complex evolution.And its not like the Lizard governments response was inevitable or anything close either. Sure, there were tensions Nyan Cat, but the policies that led to the Skibidi Toilet were shaped by specific local circumstances, not by some lingering effects of a global meme explosion. The meme farmers were dealing with real, immediate problems that required practical solutions, and the cultural response was a misguided attempt to manage wildlife, not a symptom of war-induced chaos.Of course, other memes might have emerged Online, but Skibidi Toilet was a product of its own peculiar context.

[They are not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeSEx7veNKI).Either way, good long term planning depends on what you consider \\"long term planning.\\" In the past, governments used to come up with, 10-year, 30-year etc. development plans, and then stick to it. That's one way of thinking of \\"long term planning.\\" Another way is by thinking of it as planning in which the planners take long term considerations or plan better into the future.The problem with the former approach (fixed time bound plans) is that it sounds cool to most people, but society is very dynamic, problems are dynamic and unpredictable, economies are dynamic and unpredictable, and plans must be the same: DYNAMIC. The important thing is that one sustains the goals, while adapting plans, however variables might change, to achieving those goals. But if you set yourself up to follow a fixed plan you drew up 5 years ago, you're planning to fail.Either way, good planning is a function of technocratic expertise. And for that reason a democracy (a true democracy) is actually the best form of government to encourage better planning.(Edit: note that planning is an actual field, that often requires a background in it. At the moment we leave our planning to lawyers and politicians. That's like lawyers/politicians becoming \\"experts\\" on neuroscience or linguistics, or an economist becoming an expert in law simply because they established a law firm. That's one of the flaws of the current system; I'd spend all day trying to expand this properly)In an autocratic or oligarchic system (a combination of which is what we currently have) might seem to encourage that because it reduces the number of voices and therefore seems to allow consistency. Pay attention however, to the fact that THIS is currently the system we have, which you actually feel is problematic, because this problem has been bedeviled with party politics.A true democracy does not vest ultimate power in a single individual (a president) or small group (like congress or SCOTUS) but keeps the people in charge and ensures that all citizens, have equal opportunity to contribute to governance (wither directly or indirectly). A true democracy therefore means you have avail all the best minds in the country, for good long term planning; professors, seasoned planners, innovative entrepreneurs etc. can all better contribute, not just a few politicians or a single president.However, the problem of \\"noise\\" in a democracy can be controlled in a number of ways including even how debates are structured, and so many other strategies possible. So a true democracy offers the best opportunity for long term planning (by availing the best minds in the country) as long as you take steps to control the deliberation process (structure of debates, voting systems, dealing with the problem of toxic politics etc.); and there are several ways to deal with all those which we simply can't cover on social media.","title":"CMV: Democracy does not encourage long term planning\\n"},{"text":"What do you think the odds are trump will win though?

They face EVEN MORE pressure for immediate result and their rule can be significantly less stable than Democratic rule. Being able to be assured of entire 4-6 years of rule (like in elected systems) is often a giant luxury unavailable to a  dictator.It's very simple can you provide me examples of 5 dictators who lead their countries to better medium/long term outcomes than democracies in the same time period?","title":"CMV: Democracy does not encourage long term planning\\n"},{"text":"Im a 24 year old guy in Texas and Im proudly voting for Harris and Walz.

There are many societal reasons for that. Cultural norms that need to be changed. A real realization that young men are struggling. The suicide rates among young men will show this, both higher than women and higher than its ever been. Its actually an issue many countries are facing, its not exclusive to the US.That being said this ignorance to the issues of men, isnt a Democrat thing or Republican thing. Its a societal issue in general. I dont think the Dems mean to vilify men, but I can see how it can come off that way as they prop up gender equality, womens rights, or minorities rights while ignoring men entirely. Traditionally we should admit that minorities and women have been on the back burner in society, second class to the leaders who are men. In an effort to correct that inequality, they may have shot too far, so in this short term men are being left behind. No one acknowledging their issues. But if society self corrected to bring POC and women up, that means they could also self correct again as men are left behind. I think we are at that point now where men are left behind, and like POC and Women who were left behind before, it may take some adjustment period before we can get it all equalized I think articles like the one in OP and books by Richard Reevers who study mens issues are shining that light on this issue as we speak.

I think people have this impression that because men are overrepresented that's in itself a de facto positive message, but over time I'm less convinced of that. Women are underrepresented but women in e.g. STEM, politics etc will be explicitly praised as women in those roles. Whereas when men are mentioned, it's usually negative or critical, even if the criticism is necessary. It is only natural that you feel negatively if all the commentary you see about your demographic is negative. 2. Criticism of the wider patriarchal effects on men, which includes how unexamined patriarchy affects attitudes towards men. I'm a bit disappointed that the top comment at time of writing is a fairly boilerplate \\"yeah men just don't want to help themselves\\" comment, which is like the progressive-sounding version of \\"man up\\".

The layoffs are constant and soul crushing in tech and academia if you aren't old. Yes, the irony isn't lost on me. So, currently, I'm spending my 30s high playing videogames because what the Hell is the point? 18 years I've been playing the American grind and it is ALL bullshite. It is all a lie. People deal with cultural derealization differently. What we have is mass cultural derealization bordering on sustained global unrest. This is the last best chance for the elite to usher in full cyberpunk dystopia and/or global fascism before the climate catches up. Yeah, I get it, conspiracy theory, but I promise you someones in power are thinking intimately about these outcomes. I can't even begin to unravel all the problems of this conversation in a reddit post. No one can, but here are some counter thoughts in the 8th or 9th straight year of democracy's global decline. Even if you remove these susceptibles from triggers and try to rationalize them as the problem - the problem doesn't fix itself. Fascism promises what it will never give. It takes advantage of moments of extreme duress for people. Post pandemic, climate apocalypse, economy that is shite for regular people, but great for whatever big corp make number go up, global war, and more have thrown anyone's idea of normalcy to the wind.  The Biden administration's retraction on how great the economy is underscores that the \\"economy\\" isn't good despite claims to the contrary.People are suffering. People have to be suffering in order for fascism to take root. While fascism is created and recreated in digital space, it isn't the people, the videogames, or the weed that are the problem. Choosing to spend your time on hobbies isn't the problem. Hell, the weed makes them less so, I would wager. I'd almost argue this judgmental shit about how people choose to spend their time aids radicalization far more than an incel playing anime waifu games. Maga's success cannot be boiled down to one problem because that's the point. Men in the US are in a bad spot. You have toxic masculinity and the reinforcement therein, you have other groups of people defining masculinity, and finally you have the person who has to choose one form of masculinity or other. What they didn't do is choose one identity for themselves. So now you're stuck between the 50s and the new millennium to choose an identity. It has to be both simultaneously while being neither. People are told conflicting things about what life will be. You can be this, do that, own this, own that. You'll have a partner and a house and a car if you just do x. Well, people do x and they don't know why they fail. Then we enter another facit of this: critical thinking and the tools to realize when you're being manipulated. I've spent a lot of time in digital spaces where Nazis fuck around. They don't know I'm a fly on the wall anymore than your harmless weebs know of the Nazi in the discord slowly, but surely, turning the discord to fascism. You start to see fascists appear in your spaces. Then, the fascists start isolating people who might be susceptible (poor, lonely, no job maybe, likely not conventionally attractive) to prey on vulnerabilities and insecurities. Slowly, but surely, the Nazi replaces all of the targets friends, all of their media, their games, their music.People grew up and realized that the degrees only buy you a grey white prison cubicle, bullshit work, 9-10 hours a day of monotonous nothingness, a 2 hour commute, and extruded TV dinner lunches, none of that is what we were promised. Life is so exponentially worse for adults now compared to the boomers it is laughable.  We have no safety nets and people need them, men included. You're describing depressed and lonely people falling to fascism because it has \\"answers.\\" Where were you?This shit happens in part to our own myopic bullshit. We don't check in on the friends who seem to falling victim to fascism. Who is talking about therapy?Who is talking about societal reintegration?Who is talking about what de-Magafication will look like?Instead we push people further and further to the outskirts and to the brink. I don't know what the answers are. Economic and metal help as well as self determination for the 3 young generations would be a start.  Short of shutting down all social media platforms and banning social media, There isn't much of an answer to the disinformation aspect of fascism.To be clear, I am a staunch antifascist, but I study fascism and I'm willing to admit that the global proliferation of fascism in our current age is immensely complicated. I also have a friend who can't seem to get right, but I am trying. We need to look in on the people in our lives and talk to them.","title":"What Should Democrats Say to Young Men? | Young men appear to be drifting right.

(You can also buy savings bonds without an auction.)The Federal Reserve does buy Treasury securities on the secondary market, but that doesn't change the amount of federal debt. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve buys 15% to 20% of the federal debt. Since the Federal Reserve gives almost all its profits to the government, the more the Fed buys federal debt, the *less* the government pays in net interest. The downside is that this causes more inflation. This is known as \\"monetizing the debt\\".The Fed  has a lot of influence on the size of the money supply by Open Market Operations (mainly by buying Treasury securities) and by influencing interest rates. Open Market Operations could be said to be \\"printing money\\" since the Fed buys Treasury securities (and sometimes other securities) using money it just makes up, but the physical currency is actually printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, part of the government.","title":"The DNC and RNC are private corporations.

Proletariat vs. bourgeoisie. If you were not a a silver spoon child - you struggled to relate to Young Republicans. If you were not an evangelical Christian - you didnt feel welcome in the Young Republicans group. Back then the Republicans were the purity-testing, gate keeping political party.

Harris's best path to victory is to win by margins similar to what Joe Biden had 4 years ago. She needs to carry the same voters that he carried then. The WOW counties in Wisconsin, just outside Milwaukee for instance, Wayne County and surrounding suburbs, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and surrounding counties, Erie, and interestingly enough Scranton. The Biden Line helps establish that route to victory through the critical \\" Rust Belt\\" states. If Harris wins them on similar margins she is the president. The same goes for Trump, if he wins those voters back to an extent and cuts into Harris's margins, he is the president. Of course The Biden Line also applies to Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada. Its won on the margins, winning the margins in those states would give the winner 303 electoral votes to the expected loser's 232. Our current system is still first past the post, save Nebraska and Maine ( for now at least) meaning its winner take all.

Growing up in the 90s, I constantly remember that when social securities programs were discussed there was a heavy push against including men because they \\"should be able to take care of themselves and get jobs.\\" Meanwhile, women and children were easier to provide for because they needed \\"men's\\" protection. Minority and gay communities were a targeted group and so they needed protections carved into the law. Meanwhile, white men were not a targeted group and were expected to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. It's not like liberals wouldn't carve out benefits for white men but conservatives pushed back against \\"socialism\\" and social causes had an easier time protecting women and minorities who have been historically discriminated against.The goal of the conservative party has never been to convince Americans that social welfare is a good idea and that white men should be included. The idea has always been that we are crabs in a barrel and that the only option is removing the entire system at it's base.

The DA have tried to work with the EFF and then with ActionSA and many others in coalition. Neither coalition has been stable.Senior DA leader, Helen Zille, thinks that parties grow and die because of principles or a failure to have principles. Zille is smart and makes good arguments and I respect her opinion. But I don't think the evidence completely bears that out. Instead I think that parties win based on their agility and adaptability and their willingness to compromise in the short term.The ANC has pivoted remarkably well from majority partner to plurality partner that picks the winners.

Go to the Democratic party website and click on who we are and then scroll down to the section who we serve.You'll see a list of 16 demographic groups for everybody under the sun and the only group that's missing is men. So why would young men support a political party that is constantly telling them that most major issues in society is the fault of men, yet the Democratic party desperately need mens votes or democracy ends, but if the Democrats win and gain political power they are not going to put any resources to materially improving the lives of men? It's an imperfect metaphor but it's sort of like the political version of a 1 sided open relationship and anybody with self-respect ain't going for that. Unfortunately most people's political leanings are myopic. So if they want the votes of young men it's simple, as with any other constituency group, the need to tell them what they are going to do to improve their lives. And it can't be lumped in with other groups and 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. It also can't be solving existential problems. No, it has to be specific to them. Unfortunately they can't do that because since cis men are labeled as the problem, outward support would appear to be anti lgbtq, poc and half of the groups listed under who they serve. So they are stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing their votes but having nothing to offer them for them.","title":"What Should Democrats Say to Young Men? | Young men appear to be drifting right.

White families have more money than Black families, but the average white couple in the USA is far older than the average Black couple, and much less likely to live in the deep south.

True or not, it can be bad politically.Working-class white guys who are 25 years old are often struggling just as much as any person of any race. No degree, no savings, no prospect of buying a house, weak benefits, weak skill acquisition opportunities. Telling these guys that they have white male privilege is alienating.

At this point, theres quite a bit of radical feminism thats outdated or straight up androphobic.I spent my teens on Tumblr and my introduction to more in depth feminism (beyond simple equality of the sexes) was a brand of radical feminism that proclaimed men, by nature, were ugly, violent, and seemingly incapable of being found attractive, much less trusted around a woman by himself. I internalized a lot of that. It took several women (and gay trans men), including my current partner, to actually break that ideology of men arent objectively attractive. Most women sincerely understand that individual men are not the problem, that not every man is toxic, nor violent, nor untrustworthy. And if a woman is, you dont have to agree with her and you certainly dont have to associate with her. Toxic masculinity, like white privilege, dont describe groups as a whole, but rather specific actions in specific circumstances that perpetuate unhealthy attitudes or behaviors, like a man not crying because its not a manly thing to do. Or being overly possessive of something you have not been given permission to consider yours, especially when it comes to people. Toxic masculinity is just a term for an unhealthy, hypermasculine caricature of manliness/masculinity that literally damages the emotional well being of men, and in many cases women by extension.Radical feminism is absolutely not the end all be all of feminism. Theres legitimate man-hate, but most women Ive come across are merely wary and cautious around men, and will 100% check out a guy that isnt conventionally attractive. Just try to chill about it, and let things happen. Last thing you want to be is desperate.","title":"What Should Democrats Say to Young Men? | Young men appear to be drifting right.

Salmon in the Yukon, Kuskokwim and Norton Sound regions in Alaska hold deep cultural, subsistence and ecosystem significance. In partnership with Tribes, Indigenous leaders, other agencies and community partners, the Departments new initiative is bringing Indigenous Knowledge and the best available science to the table to inform plans for collective action to support resilient ecosystems and communities in the region and make immediate investments to respond to the salmon crisis. Todays funding implements C through partner award C part of the $36 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding dedicated to the Gravel to Gravel initiative. The project work, implemented in partnership with the Salcha-Delta Soil and Water Conservation District under Good Neighbor Authority, includes efforts to restore areas impacted by historic land uses.  \\n...  \\nBLMs current restoration focus has been within the Birch, Beaver Creek, and Fortymile Wild and Scenic River systems. These rivers are (or were historically) habitat for salmon. This additional investment supports expanded restoration and resiliency efforts beyond these Interior Alaska river systems to areas located throughout the Keystone Initiative region. Future work is expected in more remote areas of the Keystone Initiative region, including the Salmon River near the community of Platinum. The BLM and partners are also working to finalize the development of a mapping tool coupled with a prioritization framework using a variety of factors such as salmon habitat potential, land status, and access. Once fully developed, the tool and framework will be shared with regional stakeholders interested in restoration to leverage local knowledge, including Indigenous Knowledge, to target future work in the areas with the highest salmon habitat restoration and resiliency needs. Near-term efforts continue to focus on the headwaters of salmon-bearing rivers along the road system. This allows the BLM and partners to intensively monitor and refine restorative techniques while minimizing overall costs. This data-driven adaptive management approach helps to guide the strategies and techniques used on more remote restoration projects to help maximize restoration and resiliency results. Project work under this new agreement is estimated to begin in early September 2024 and continue through the end of summer 2029.  The BLM has made immediate investments in the foundational science and projects needed to respond to the salmon crisis and invested in restorative projects to heal the broader ecosystem. BLMs focus remains on the expansion of stream habitat assessments across the entire Yukon, Kuskokwim, and Norton Sound regions to create a network of hundreds of permanent monitoring sites. The information gathered will inform restoration plans and serve as long-term habitat monitoring sites across the region to improve our understanding of climate-driven change.  Statement from Matt Varner, Fisheries Resources Lead for the Aquatic Resources Program:Restoration is an important aspect of the BLMs mission, and this partnership allows us to continue our effort to improve watershed health, said Matt Varner, Fisheries Resources Lead for the Aquatic Resources Program. This Keystone Initiative is about working with everyone to urgently address Pacific salmon habitat restoration. Agreements, such as this, help expand the collective work to support the Pacific salmon populations that are so vital to our culture, ecosystems, and economy.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Invests $3.25 Million for Salmon Habitat Restoration | Investment advances the $36 million Gravel to Gravel initiative to advance Pacific Salmon habitat restoration"},{"text":"Yeh its sad.

Youre also mistaken in thinking that a partys platform would be too broad to handle local issues. In fact, proportional representation encourages **more localized representation**, since smaller parties with more focused platforms have a greater chance of winning seats.

Author Richard Reeves outlines the three major issues boys and men face and shares possible solutions.*Boys and men are falling behind. This might seem surprising to some people, and maybe ridiculous to others, considering that discussions on gender disparities tend to focus on the structural challenges faced by girls and women, not boys and men.But long-term data reveal a clear and alarming trend: In recent decades, American men have been faring increasingly worse in many areas of life, including education, workforce participation, skill acquisition, wages, and fatherhood.Gender politics is often framed as a zero-sum game: Any effort to help men takes away from women. But in his 2022 book Of Boys and Men, journalist and Brookings Institution scholar Richard V. Reeves argues that the structural problems contributing to male malaise affect everybody, and that shying away from these tough conversations is not a productive path forward.","title":"What Should Democrats Say to Young Men? | Young men appear to be drifting right.

Two of the notices are for Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grants C one funding opportunity for Tribes and intertribal consortia and another for communities (such as cities, counties, and parishes) across the country. The third notice is for EPAs Recycling Education and Outreach grant program and is focused on food waste prevention and composting. All three opportunities are made possible by President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provided the largest EPA investment in recycling in more than 30 years.  \\n...  \\nSome communities that lack waste management infrastructure do not have curbside waste collection services, recycling, or composting programs, which increases the strain on local waste management systems and increases greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, mismanaged waste contributes to health and economic issues in historically underserved and overburdened communities. Increasing recycling reduces climate, environmental, and social impacts of materials use and keeps valuable resources in use instead of in landfills. Preventing wasted food from ending up in landfills plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The grant opportunities announced today will improve waste management systems and consumer education and outreach on waste prevention and recycling, meeting Congress goal to create a stronger, more resilient, and cost-effective U.S. recycling system. These funding opportunities also put the concrete steps identified in the National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics into action.The projects that EPA will fund under the Recycling Education and Outreach grant selectionincluding a national education and outreach campaignwill lead to more recycling through composting, less wasted food from households, better markets for selling compost, and less contamination in the compost stream. Projects funded through the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grants will improve post-consumer materials management and infrastructure. In addition, the grants support EPAs National Recycling Strategy goal of building an economy devoted to keeping materials, products, and services in circulation for as long as possible C whats known as a circular economy. EPA anticipates releasing its final National Strategy to Prevent Plastic Pollution in the coming months. All are part of EPAs series on creating a circular economy for all.Both the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling and Recycling Education and Outreach grant programs advance President Bidens historic Justice40 Initiative, which aims to deliver at least 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other investments to communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.About the *Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) Grant Program*The recycling funding for Tribes and intertribal consortia will provide approximately $20 million total in awards ranging from $100,000 to $1.5 million each. The recycling funding for communities will provide approximately $58 million total in awards ranging from $500,000 to $5 million each. This includes projects that will improve collection, transport, systems, and processes related to post-use materials that can be recovered, reused, recycled, repaired, refurbished, or composted. Read more about eligible applicants and activities for these funding opportunities for Tribes and intertribal consortia and those available to communities. EPA anticipates announcing a SWIFR funding opportunity for states and territories next year.About the *Recycling Education and Outreach (REO) Grant Program*The funding for the REO grant program will provide approximately $39 million for one award. EPA seeks coalition applications that include the following elements: (1) a project to develop and implement a national consumer wasted food reduction campaign; (2) a project that will increase the market for and sales of compost; and (3) a project that will increase education and outreach to households on composting. Applicants must demonstrate they will subaward a portion of the total award to implement education and outreach activities locally, which will benefit local communities. Read more about eligible applicants and activities for this funding opportunity for recycling education and outreach.Statement from EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan:\\"Today we make another historic investment to reduce waste across the Nation,\\" said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. Thanks to President Bidens Investing in America agenda, EPA is deploying unprecedented resources to improve recycling services and increase educational outreach to communities. When we work together to prevent waste that contributes to climate change, we support local economies, create jobs that pay well, and better protect the health of everyone in the community.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $117 Million in Grants Available to Advance Recycling Infrastructure and Prevent Wasted Food"},{"text":"Who gives a shit if Harris is black, white, Indian, etc?

Neither represents a successful way to be a man today, much less a practical way to help young men. In contemporary America, where women are doing better at school and are overrepresented in the most rapidly growing occupations, Vances prescription for women to return to the home is as much a fantasy as Trumps unapologetic male domination.

Gender equality does not preclude a vital masculinity, any more than teamwork on a playing field does. The masculine virtues are still virtues on a team, and no, masculinity is not a pathology. Men and women complement each other. They need each other.A major part of the message that Walz could carry to the online audiences of young men concerns the Democrats economic program, including their commitments to expand housing construction and aid for first-time homebuyers, forgiveness of student debt, child tax credits, and policies aimed at bringing back manufacturing jobs that pay well and dont require a college degree. Democrats shouldnt expect to win the competition for young men with policy proposals, but the odds are that young men havent heard about their proposals, which convey a message that Democrats want to make a practical difference in their lives. Democrats dont have to pull back on abortion rights to win their support; theres no evidence that young men have turned right on abortionthey just dont vote on it.In talking about the issues affecting young men, Democrats ought to listen to Richard Reeves, author of?[*Of Boys and Men*](https://www.amazon.com/Boys-Men-Modern-Struggling-Matters/dp/0815739877), who has been arguing for a positive view of masculinity that is compatible with gender equality.?[Obama listed his book](https://www.obama.org/stories/president-obamas-favorite-books-and-music-summer-2024/)?as one of his recommended readings for summer 2024 even though?*Of Boys and Men*?came out two years earlier, a sign of growing interest in what Reeves has been saying. Some Democratic lawmakers such as Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who has been especially concerned about loneliness and mental health issues, have called attention to Reevess research. Reeves rejects the idea that feminism has gone too far in empowering women and insists that paying more attention to boys and men does not mean backing off the cause of women  A world of floundering men will not be one of flourishing women, or vice versa.","title":"What Should Democrats Say to Young Men? | Young men appear to be drifting right.

Despite representing only 3% of colleges and universities, HBCUs provide college access to twice as many Pell Grant-eligible low- and middle- income students as non-HBCU institutions. HBCUs have produced an astonishing 40% of all Black engineers, 50% of all Black teachers, 70% of all Black doctors and dentists, 80% of all Black judges, and the first Black American and first woman to be Vice President of the United States, Vice President Kamala Harris. HBCUs foster more upward mobility than most US colleges: about 30% of HBCU students move up at least two income quintiles compared to 18% for non HBCUs. And research by the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) found that, compared to the Ivy League and other top-ranked non-HBCU institutions, HBCUs help more than five times as many students move from the bottom 40% to the top 60% of U.S. household.A report by the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) published in May further underscores this point. The report found that, even in the face of historic underfunding, HBCU enrollment was associated with an increased likelihood of completing a bachelors degree and higher household income, and noted that HBCUs have seen a surge in applications and enrollment in recent years C indicating that students increasingly recognize and appreciate their value.But beyond just serving as an engine of economic mobility for students and their families, HBCUs make a substantial contribution to the national economy. New research by the UNCF finds that HBCUs generate $16.5 billion annually in economic impact on communities across the United States, as well as over 136,000 jobs, and $146 billion in collective lifetime earnings for their graduates.As a component of this outsized economic impact, HBCUs play a significant role in the research and development (R&amp;D) that drives vital progress in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). As such, the Biden-Harris Administration has made it a priority to expand the capacity of HBCUs to offer high quality STEM education programs and to compete for federal R&amp;D dollars. In August 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act C which requires federal research agencies to provide funding and other support for expanding the R&amp;D capacity of HBCUs. The Biden-Harris Administration has worked diligently to implement this law.The Biden Harris Administration has advanced racial equity, economic opportunity, and educational excellence through HBCUs since Day One, including by reestablishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The Biden-Harris Administration is the most diverse administration in history and many members are HBCU graduates, including Vice President Kamala Harris,  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Willie Phillips.-**The additional $1.3 billion in federal investments announced today will further build on the Administrations commitments and on HBCUs demonstrated track record of delivering excellence. These investments include: **$188 million** in competitive grants to HBCUs through the Department of Education, including grants that will support R&amp;D capacity building.\\n* **$1.1 billion** in funding to support students at HBCUs directly through need-based grants and other federal programs, including Pell Grants.  ...The article further includes how a whole of government approach has been committed towards partnering with HBCU's, their students, and communities.-Related press releases:* [Secretary Cardona Opens 2024 HBCU Week Conference, Celebrates Record Investments](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/speech/secretary-cardona-opens-2024-hbcu-week-conference-celebrates-record-investments)* [Biden-Harris Administration Awards Grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities to Diversify the Educator and STEM Workforce](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/biden-harris-administration-awards-grants-historically-black-colleges-and)","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Announces $1.3 Billion in Additional Funding and a Record of Over $17 Billion in Total Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)"},{"text":"October 23rd is very late to request a debate if Kamala needs the debate according to internal polling.

Prior to the farming days, you had nomadic tribes of people pumping out kids to become warriors and defend the tribes.

We used to live in tribes, villages, towns with dozens or hundreds of people who we knew and cared, and they too took care of us when needed. Children wouldn't be raised by their parents, but by the whole group. But then the elite realized that the most individualized society becomes, the more they consume. They began to enforce urbanisation and place more focus on private propriety. Land wasn't owned/used by the whole village anymore, it was owned by families, and later by individuals. Whole extended families used to live in one household, then they started to sell the idea that each nuclear family must have their own. There used to be one car, one phone, one TV in each home for each family. Now each person owns their own, even if they still share the same house. We have reached the point where even nuclear families are being dismantled, in favor of individualism. You're supposed to hate your family and not want to form your own. You're supposed to live alone or with a single partner. Each one of you should own your own appliances, so more of them get sold.

Is she confusing Harris with Obama who had a white mother?No. The notion that Kamala is not \\"black\\" probably comes from more than one source but most recently \\nIt was being pushed by Judge Joe Brown who claimed that Kamala's father, Donald J Harris, told him that he was \\"Irish\\". This spread through the lower rungs of the MAGA camp like wildfire and quickly became a \\"gotcha\\" that they salivated over springing on unsuspecting Harris supporters.Donald J Harris, an Afro-Jamaican man, _has_ been open about the fact that there is possibly some Irish ancestry somewhere way back in his family tree. His paternal grandmother claimed that she was descended from Hamilton Brown who was an Irish slave owner in the late 1700's.Donald probably joked to Joe once that he was \\"Irish\\", kinda like I sometimes joke to my friends that I am Swedish since I do in fact have a single Swedish ancestor if you go back about 200 years. But I'm not really Swedish, and Donald is not really Irish. Or maybe Joe simply mistook being of \\"Irish descent\\" for being Irish. Probably something along those lines, though it must be hard to think that when you're looking at someone who is obviously not white.If his Grandmother is correct Donald is probably at least 87.5% Afro-Jamaican which makes Kamala pretty close to half Afro-Jamaican. Afro-Jamaican people are mostly from West Africa.","title":"Janet Jackson Questions Whether Kamala Harris Is Black, Thinks Election May Bring Mayhem"},{"text":"are you seriously arguing that Trump understands economics?

Still, it's not effective to be so antagonistic on my part, so again, my bad.   Allowing people reasons for bad choices  is a mistake no matter what is going on, though Simply put, the US will be destroyed if Trump becomes president.  He has a plan in place that everyone can go read that shows exactly how he would dismantle the US and everything it stands for.  He would put sycophants in every federal employee position.  He will deport all immigrants, legal or illegal.  He will remove Obama care with no plan in place to replace it. He will dismantle our ability to vote at all or at least meaningfully in the future.  He is a criminal, a misogynist, a homophobe, a racist, a pathological liar, and a complete fraud.  He tried to steal the last election in front of everyone's face.  Trump and his party's railroading of SCOTUS has destroyed the trust in our highest court by the vast majority of people for the first time in almost a century.  Every decision they make is disagreed upon by at least a majority, usually more than 60+ %.  He and his party don't care for or want to work for the citizens of the US.

Why did I mention all that?  To illustrate that I've never gotten what I truly wanted and that I've never voted for a candidate I truly even liked very much.  It comes down to civic responsibility, emotional maturity, and protecting democracy.  I only have a chance to get to where I want by voting for one party in this election.  Up and down the ballot, I can only vote blue as any truthful person should.  This election is about future proofing.","title":"CMV: As a Palestinian-American single issue voter, not voting or voting third party is the best way to achieve my political goals."},{"text":"I guess seers2025 is a real thing, shithttps://apnews.com/article/fact-check-pandemic-seers-virus-2025-784933703300","title":"They are trying to warn you"},{"text":"Dont believe your eyes for the past 8 years","title":"Republicans ask for more civility in politics.

Off the top of my head, there are two important sources of inspiration for George to write 1984:1.)?Orwell was deeply disturbed by the rise of totalitarian regimes during the early 20th century, particularly Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler and Stalinist Soviet Union. He observed how these governments used propaganda, censorship, and fear to maintain absolute control over their populations.2.)?Orwells own disillusionment with Communism after witnessing the Spanish Civil War significantly impacted his worldview. He fought on the side of the anti-fascist forces but became deeply suspicious of the Soviet-backed communists, who suppressed other socialist factions. This deepened his fear of how totalitarian ideologies, even those claiming to fight for the people, could lead to oppression.2a.)?His earlier work, Animal Farm, satirized the Soviet Union and the betrayal of socialist ideals, which foreshadowed his exploration of these themes in 1984.This is how I know a lot of the youth today has been brainwashed by communists. They think communism will solve everything, yet they fail to realize the atrocities that many of their favorite writers, artists, philosophers, etc were all deeply traumatized by the horrors that emerged from communism in Eastern Europe.?Orwell never wouldve written Animal Farm or 1984 had he not been traumatized by what he saw from Soviet Russia. The West flourished and thrived while Eastern Europe experienced a dystopian nightmare.

Trump has very clearly stated he will take action that would stop you from consolidating such power within the US.

The pagers exploded in areas where civilians were nearby, such as marketplaces, hospitals, and even a funeral. Thus many civilians were seriously injured. The company that was used to manufacture these pagers was a Mossad shell company from what reports are saying, and thus showcases deception on Israel's part. Attacking an enemy when they are not engaged in active military actions or combat with yourself is considered a war-crime, those this attack is unacceptable. Despite your assertion that it is a terrorist organization, Hezbollah does run a vast apparatus of social services and healthcare facilities. The people operating these services were the ones attacked by the pagers.

I am a staunch anti-Zionist. Thus I don't consider any sort of military action by Israel to be legitimate, even if it complies with international law. I will say that despite these opposing views, I commend you for being critical of Israel and the IDF (or the IOF as my circle calls them). I'll also refute your belief that most of these people who are talking about Palestine are doing so to be trendy. There are some who see it as trendy yes, for example the people who posted the \\"Eyes on Rafah\\" AI image after several months into the conflict in Gaza (I assert that it is a genocide, but I will not try and argue that point with you). The vast majority of the people protesting and advocating for Palestine however, have been doing so for quite a bit of time. I myself have been talking about the Palestinian issue for years, in addition to other social causes. Some of the people talking about Palestine have also advocated for labor rights, Black Lives Matter, etc. So the Palestinian cause is seen as a related issue, and they naturally are drawn to talk/advocate for it also.As I previously said, it is good that you don't try to make excuses for all of Israel's actions. I won't argue with you, but rather encourage you to take that criticism further and cease advocating for the Zionist cause. Many people will assert that Zionism is a racist, anti-Arab, settler-colonialist ideology, that it is antithetical to Jewish values and morals, and that it a tool of white supremacy and US imperialism in the SWANA region. I'll let you decide on whether or not those beliefs are true.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Easy fix: Put Harris/Walz signs in every every yard.","title":"Ohio sheriff condemned for saying people with Harris yard signs should have their addresses recorded"},{"text":"Who the fuck cares what Janet Jackson thinks!?","title":"Janet Jackson Questions Whether Kamala Harris Is Black, Thinks Election May Bring Mayhem"},{"text":"She should really be able to take a joke, thin skinned like Trump isnt a good thing.","title":"Kamala Harris to skip historic Al Smith Dinner - She's Afraid of Being Roasted!"},{"text":"What a fraud, how the country cant see it is beyond me right now.","title":"Kamala Harris to skip historic Al Smith Dinner - She's Afraid of Being Roasted!"},{"text":"Rusty has had a hate boner for the term \\"Mormon\\" since the 70's.

Harris has dual heritage, I say, and, given this moment, does Jackson think America is ready for her - if we agree shes black? Or, OK, a woman of colour?I dont know, Jackson stage whispers.

The majority of sex offenders never even get caught. I dont trust polls like this anyways. I only read things from official government websites. You can read the statistics for sex offenders [here](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Sexual_Abuse_FY21.pdf).

(I'm a bot)\\n**\\n PHOENIX - Vice President Kamala Harris is stepping up her efforts to win over voters who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, enlisting prominent members of the faith to make the case in pivotal Arizona that Donald Trump does not align with the church&amp;#039;s values. Latter-day Saints supporting Harris in Arizona make a faith-based appeal for backing the Democratic ticket despite any reservations, pointing to church teaching that the U.S. Constitution is divinely inspired. It has not helped that Trump has feuded with U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, among the best-known members of the church, and former U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. In Arizona, Latter-day Saints make up an outsize share of the population in metro Phoenix&amp;#039;s East Valley, a suburban area where ticket-splitting voters have rejected Trump-backed Republicans, helping to push a reliable GOP state into a battleground.\\n**\\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1fmfv19/kamala_harris_steps_up_outreach_to_church_of/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \\"Version 2.02, ~694169 tl;drs so far.\\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \\"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Saint**^#1 **Latter-day**^#2 **Church**^#3 **voted**^#4 **members**^#5","title":"Kamala Harris steps up outreach to Church of Jesus Christ voters in battleground Arizona"},{"text":"Added a pic I snapped in Wilkes-Barre, PA last weekend while volunteering for the rally.","title":"Are you canvassing?

It simply describes Freemasonry's universality, the fuller quote:\\n And as to the adoption of the Christian reference, Hutchinson, and after him Oliver, profoundly philosophical as are the masonic speculations of both, have, I am constrained to believe, fallen into a great error in calling the Master Mason's degree a Christian institution. It is true that it embraces within its scheme the great truths of Christianity upon the subject of the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body; but this was to be presumed, because Freemasonry is truth, and Christianity is truth, and all truth must be identical. But the origin of each is different; their histories are dissimilar. The institution of Freemasonry preceded the advent of Christianity. Its symbols and its legends are derived from the Solomonic temple, and from the people even anterior to that. Its religion comes from the ancient priesthood. Its faith was that primitive one of Noah and his immediate descendants. If Masonry were simply a Christian institution, the Jew and the Moslem, the Brahmin and the Buddhist, could not conscientiously partake of its illumination; but its universality is its boast. In its language citizens of every nation may converse; at its altar men of all religions may kneel; to its creed disciples of every faith may subscribe. Freemasonry is not Christian, nor a substitute for itSame idea, it's not that Freemasonry is anti-Christian, just not necessarily Christian.  The Blue Degrees are but the outer court of the portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry. The whole body of the Royal and Sacerdotal Art was hidden so carefully, centuries since, in the High DegreesAlso legit, but also not necessarily Satanic. Why do you assume true interpretations are Satanic?  Lucifer represents... Life... Thought... Progress... Civilization... Liberty... Independence... Lucifer is the Logos... The Serpent, the Savior It is Satan who is the God of our planet and the only God.That's Blavatsky lol. That Theosophy praises Lucifer is no secret. Lucifer, the Light-Bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls? Doubt it notTaken out of this context: \\"the Apotheosis of that Sublime Faith which aspires to\\nGod alone, and despises all the pomps and works of Lucifer\\" That which we must say to a crowd is C We worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstitionTaxil hoax, not a real quote.  The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is Yahweh(God) reversed; for Satan is not a black god, but a negation of God. For Initiates, this is not a Person, but a Force  [Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, pg. 102]This quote would actually be alright by itself, but the context is: For the Initiates, this is not a Person, but a Force, created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will. They represent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, under the mythologic and horned form of the God PAN; thence came the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Light-bearer or Phosphor, of which the poets have made the false Lucifer of the legend\\n \\nSo uh, he basically thinks Satan is a force of free will... That's weird and certainly very un-Christian, I agree for once! I don't think it amounts to a solid proof of Freemasons being \\"Luciferians\\" in the conspiracy theorist sense, after all some Sufis also had weird ideas about Iblis, while remaining faithful to Allah/God.  First Conjuration Addressed to Emperor Lucifer. Emperor Lucifer, Master and Prince of Rebellious Spirits, I adjure thee to leave thine abode, in whatever quarter of the world it may be situated and come hither to communicate with meThis is Waite, who was indeed a Freemason, but this stuff is from his other esoteric interests which were black magic in a quite proper sense of the word (basically check out the Wikipedia page on him, he even inspired a Lovecraft character)The same goes for Manly P Hall. That isn't necessarily a problem for Freemasonry itself, though, anymore than Eliphas Levi is a problem for the Catholic Church. There are guys like that in every institution I suppose.","title":"I am not a Freemason, nor do I think Freemasonry is necessarily an evil conspiracy as such, but the normie understanding of what it is is so implausible and nonsensical compared even to the wildest conspiracies I just don't understand how come"},{"text":"They fact checked Trump four times;  when Trump claimed that Democrats were murdering babies after they were born;  Haitian migrants eating pets;  Trump won in 2020; that violent crime has increased.Trump and the baby murder thing was referring to former Virginia governor who made claims on government non involvement in abortions, leaving a non viable birth to die, if the mother wanted that, vs resuscitation.

But ironically, the swell in the evangelical ranks may have loosened some of the rhetorical power of the religious right, simply by diluting their actual religious intensity.

To sit an election out, or to vote third-party in our electoral college system, because you arent happy about one issue, does not change the trajectory of that one issue.  Specific to Israel and Palestine, US Presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have historically shown nearly unconditional support for Israel, over several decades, in times of conflict.  Former President Donald Trump, a staunch defender of Israel and Netanyahu, rejected any attempts to criticise Israel for the killing of dozens of protesters in Gaza in May 2018.  Biden has spoken to Netanyahu multiple times and Secretary of State Antony Blinken has traveled to the Middle East in person to try and negotiate and work out a hostage deal at least 10 times, to no avail.  Historically, multiple US presidents have also tried to negotiate a two state solution that have been rejected at every turn.  Rather than basing your US presidential vote on an issue that frankly will not sway Netanyahu in any way, vote for your neighbors, your family, your friends.

In 2021, Pew Research Center put out a poll that validated what some had already been noticing anecdotally: During Trumps presidency, the number of white people who identified as evangelical increased.Ryan Burge, a political science assistant professor at Eastern Illinois University, explained what he saw going on in an analysis in?[the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/opinion/evangelical-republican.html):To be a Republican culture warrior is to be an evangelical, as these new cultural evangelicals see itand what matters is the cultural victory, not the theology behind the politics.  \\nSo as Trump supporters have said again and again over the years, he is a fighter for their cause. It doesnt matter how much of a believer he actually is. But ironically, the swell in the evangelical ranks may have loosened some of the rhetorical power of the religious right, simply by diluting their actual religious intensity. If cultural evangelicals care more about having a fighter than a spiritual leader, the culture war issues can become more secularly political while still working as a political tool. And then Republican candidates, standing on a debate stage, dont need to say?God.\\"","title":"These evangelicals are voting their values  by backing Kamala Harris"},{"text":"P-Diddy party club governing council member","title":"What pin is this?

Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods: darkness being necessary to the stature, and the brake to the locomotive.

You started this thread by saying that the age should be lowered to 16. I was merely pointing out that there is no maximum age and this makes the voting outcome more likely to be conservative than liberal because people are living longer and longer, no one is exactly getting younger and younger. Your first two scenarios are all about temporary unemployment in people of employment age which I would say that it shouldn't matter because they are of employment age.The United States in particular, already ties health insurance to employment and I would say that the right to medical care is a bigger right than the right to vote, especially since voting is not actually mandatory in the States. US &amp; UK both have 10%-oracies not true democracies because only about 10% of the total population actually shows up to vote on election night. The scenario you brought up about disability, specifically someone who can never work, that same disabled person presumably can't line up for hours at your voting booths anyway, and once they get to the front of the queue, there probably isn't a lot of disability support for them. If they can put in the effort that is required in the US to vote then they are abled enough to have employment. You dont see it because you probably have nothing to compare it with, but the US has one of the most obstructive election and voting rules and practices for a white Western democracy in the world. Anyone who can make it to vote under your system should be able to be employed because your voting is *harder* in a lot of cases than what is actually required for people in employment.","title":"CMV: The voting age in the United States should be lowered to 16."},{"text":"Yes, pretty much everyone on Reddit.

An individuals vote matters in the aggregate, but only if it is winnable. And we could argue that with enough rallying and for the right candidate any state is winnable.

Now, you'll still typically get better bang for your buck in Haiti than America, but (for example) $2 Haitian medical gauze is not going to be as effective as the $5 American equivalent. Is it really worthwhile to write off entire countries as deserving of charity because of their corrupt governments?No, I'm just saying that factors like this ought to be considered in the calculus if you're talking about the \\"most effective\\" form of charity. Corrupt governments aren't the only obstacle; there's a whole bunch of logistical barriers, from organized crime to the increased bureaucracy needed to deliver overseas aid to the difficulty of promoting domestic interest (and thereby an economy of scale) to the actual physical logistics of delivering aid and supplies. Of course it's still worth making an effort to try to help Haiti, but if (as a hypothetical) 99 cents of every dollar you donate will be absorbed by these logistical difficulties, you can surely see why the math might work out in favour of prioritizing domestic issues where the relative \\"cut\\" is much smaller. I doubt the actual difference is _that_ severe, but my point is that these factors shouldn't be dismissed off-hand.Of course the positive impact ignoring additional costs will be higher in Haiti than in America, so it's difficult to judge which is superior. I'd wager that the best approach for an informed philanthropist would probably be some sort of hedge position where they donate to both causes and consult with experts to determine the exact split. But the average American probably doesn't have the information or expertise to easily judge that, so I can't really blame them for donating to the cause that seems to be more directly implementable and that is more personally relatable to them (after all, the most likely alternative for the average middle-class American probably isn't \\"donate directly to Haitian aid groups instead\\", it's \\"don't donate at all\\"). The effective international charities i'm aware of succeed in countries comparably corrupt to Haiti quite often.You might be right! Again, I'm not particularly familiar with Haiti in specific. I'm just saying that the argument of the person I'm replying to (it's equally easy for _us_ to make a credit card payment to either cause, so there's no point thinking about logistical difficulties or relative opportunity costs since \\"either way we're just giving our money to a middle man\\") is erroneous in the general case.","title":"Help Show Support for Haitians in Springfield!"},{"text":"He means 9pm is too late cause he's really old.","title":"Trump Says October 23 Is Too Late for a Debate After Previously Facing Biden on the 22nd"},{"text":"Obviously fake.

For a swing state it is more complicated but essentially, whichever party is in power, the election is close enough that splitting your votes could hurt your preferred candidate substantially rather than help them. For example, in the case that all the major swing states split their votes 50/50 Kamala Harris would win, which is not a desirable outcome for the most red swing state which, lets say is  Georgia. Georgia could then decide they will not split their votes but, if all swing states except georgia split 50/50, Trump wins which is not desirable for the bluest swing state (lets say michigan).  Thus, even if we start with all swing states splitting votes, this back and forth sort of forces swing states to commit their votes if they don't want to lose.  Essentially, there is always an incentive for states that lean one way or the other to fully commit that way.","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"Unfortunately there is so much misinformation being injected from those trying to demonize guns, giving the impression that guns are a magical object","title":"The Most Surprising New Gun Owners Are U.S. Liberals"},{"text":" Harris does not have to listen to Muslim-Americans or make promises to them.

But, part of the problem as usual is the shifting of words and their meanings for political reasons. Woke is one, grooming another, and now Evangelical. More and more the term Evangelical is being connected to Trump rather than Christ. Checks notes. Not the same guy.It used to be that when many people thought about evangelicalism, they conjured up an image of a fiery preacher imploring them to accept Jesus. Now the data indicate that more and more Americans are conflating evangelicalism with Republicanism  **and melding two forces to create a movement that is not entirely about politics or religion but power.**Ryan Burge, a political science assistant professor at Eastern Illinois University, explained what he saw going on in an analysis in?[the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/opinion/evangelical-republican.html):This is happening in two different ways. The first is that many Americans who have begun to embrace the evangelical identity are people who hardly ever attend religious services.  The evidence points in one direction: For many Americans, to be a conservative Republican is to be an evangelical Christian, regardless of whether they ever attend a Sunday service.The second factor bolstering evangelicalism on surveys is that more people are embracing the label who have no attachment to Protestant Christianity. For example, the share of Catholics who also identified as evangelicals (or born again)?[rose](https://religioninpublic.blog/2019/07/18/the-curious-case-of-born-again-catholics/)?to 15 percent in 2018 from 9 percent in 2008.?To be a Republican culture warrior is to be an evangelical, as these new cultural evangelicals see itand what matters is the cultural victory, not the theology behind the politics.So as Trump supporters have said again and again over the years, he is a fighter for their cause. It doesnt matter how much of a believer he actually is. But ironically, the swell in the evangelical ranks may have loosened some of the rhetorical power of the religious right, simply by diluting their actual religious intensity. If cultural evangelicals care more about having a fighter than a spiritual leader, the culture war issues can become more secularly political while still working as a political tool. And then Republican candidates, standing on a debate stage, dont need to say?God.","title":"These evangelicals are voting their values  by backing Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Which is why president should be by popular vote","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"Theyve used it in NYC a lot historically.

Your position is that voting is an inalienable human right.  This is central to your thesis.  I disagree - inalienable means that it applies to noncitizens and voting is citizen dependent.  **If nothing else, your view on this should change - giving foreign nationals the right to vote in domestic elections is not ok.**  Voting is not inalienable.  Your amalgamation is comprised of (1) unique concerns, (2) ability to work, (3) proximity to the current voting age (16/17 not that different - my opening salvo), and (4) potential to promote lifelong engagement. These are the four discreet elements of your amalgamation in your original post. You then rebut some counter arguments.  Everything else, driving &amp; etc., is included in your rebuttal. So lets take these four, with suggested adjustments as described below. So, if we look at an average 16 year old with four factors vs an average 18 year old with four factors.  Im excluding proximity to 18 because Ive already tackled that and introducing legal dependency because that matters. 16 - average 16 year has unique concerns, is a dependent on another adult, does not work or only minimally works, and yes has potential to create lifelong engagement in voting. Score: 2 on a scale of 4. 18 - average 18 year old has unique concerns, is not a dependent on another adult and is considered a legal adult themselves, is expected to work or have fiscal responsibility well above 16 year old levels, and has potential for lifelong engagement in voting.  Score: 4 on a scale of 4. Results:  16 year olds are only 50% of the way towards voting readiness on a composite scoring system relative to their 18 year old peers.","title":"CMV: The voting age in the United States should be lowered to 16."},{"text":"Anyone up for a Donny the Chicky nickname?","title":"Trump Says October 23 Is Too Late for a Debate After Previously Facing Biden on the 22nd"},{"text":"I respect the effort.","title":"Democrats and Republicans finally agree on something: America faces a retirement crisis"},{"text":"Bird needs a left and a right wing to fly.

I keep seeing people say how this is a war crime, which shows the general fundamental misunderstanding of IHL that so many of these activists actually have. Hezbollah members are lawful combatants under international law, and the pagers were being used as military equipment. The precision of the pager attack demonstrates an approach to *retaliate against Hezbollah attacks on civilian neighborhoods* that adheres more closely to the core principles of IHL compared to the alternative of airstrikes or bombing of Hezbollah targets in civilian areas. Article 48 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, emphasizes the Principle of Distinction, which requires that parties to a conflict must distinguish between combatants and civilians, and target only military objectives. By specifically targeting Hezbollahs military equipment, this attack conformed to the principle of distribution. Additionally, the attack conformed to the principle of proportion, which prohibits attacks expected to cause civilian harm that would be excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage. As I said, the pager attacks focused nature minimized the risk to civilian lives and infrastructure, unlike airstrikes that would have a broader impact. Although civilians were injured, this was due to Hezbollahs deliberate violation of IHL, as they operate within civilian areas, breaching Article 58 of the Geneva Conventions, which obligates parties to avoid placing military targets near civilians.Israels approach, despite the difficulties posed by Hezbollahs embedding within civilian areas, shows a huge distinction between the two combatant forces. Not only does Hezbollah embed themselves with civilian populaces and infrastructure, but they openly admit to targeting them when attacking Israel. Hezbollah fired unguided rockets into civilian neighborhoods in Israel, Israel targeted only Hezbollah militants in response. Hezbollahs tactics on the other hand. such as using car bombs and \\n indiscriminate weapons, highlights their disregard for civilian safety. The people who saw information about this attack and automatically fed their confirmation bias about Israel, are usually either people who couldnt point to Gaza on a map 12 months ago or just hate the Jews.

Politicians can and have completely neglected campaign promises and promises to constituents. Campaign promises are not legally binding. You have no leverage. Leverage doesnt exist. You arent levering anything against anything else. The game of chicken youre playing? If you lose we all lose. There is a legal process for redressing grievances within our government. If Harris wins, you can use that system to try to effect the changes you want according to the rule of law. Project 2025 is exactly about disassembling and removing these systems and protections that exist and the agencies that enforce them. So again. The game youre playing? Its lose-lose for you. But in one scenario you lose significantly less. There is no scenario in which America stops selling arms to Israel. Both sides have said they are willing to go against the UN, and trump has personally broken sanctions. Again, I have no horse in this race. Im a completely generic straight white man.

It's about the amalgamation, the preponderance of issues that affect adults begins at roughly 16 years of age. Taxes are one of them, driving is another, taking a voice in your own education is another one, both at the public school and college level. Presidents elected when you're 16 will still be in office when you're 18. Same with most other elected offices. The list goes on.It's no one issue, it's the amalgamation of all of these issues being something that people deserve a voice in. And those issues don't start affecting you when you're 18, they start affecting you when you're around 16.?\\nAll of the issues you described that face a 5-year-old Also face 16-year-olds, along with a whole bunch of other issues as well. Yes, you could point to many single issues that a 16-year-old faces and contort that into something a 5-year-old has to deal with.... But there are few, if any, 5-year-olds that have to deal with all of those issues at once the way a 16-year-old does.?\\n16 is where it all comes together. A 5-year-old might earn an income as a child actor or something, yes, but that demographic is dramatically smaller than the demographic of working teens. A 5-year-old also isn't driving or being led by a president whose term won't be up by the time that 5-year-old is a legal adult.?\\nSo take the focus off of single issues that can be transferred between the two, and instead look at the big picture- the totality of The issues affecting the majority of 16-year-olds, which are not transferable to the majority of 5-year-olds.","title":"CMV: The voting age in the United States should be lowered to 16."},{"text":"If soybeans were a person","title":"Just your friendly neighborhood liberal with Trump derangement syndrome"},{"text":"Every accusation is a confession.","title":"Republicans ask for more civility in politics.

I don't see how I'm contradicting what the above poster, Desperate-Fan695, said.That poster said that a state allocating its votes as winner-take-all is in the best interests of the state in cases where that state is a swing state, i.e., can be won by either side. Making it winner-take-all increases the prize, so to speak, making the state more important to presidential candidates. When a state is more electorally important, candidates will take more care in catering their politics to suit the needs/wants of that state. They also said this doesn't necessarily apply for non-swing states.I agreed with them that this isn't the case for safe states. If we know with 95% certainty that every single electoral vote in, for example, California is going to go to the Democratic candidate, then neither candidate is going to seriously contest the state. Being winner-take-all makes California *less* important to the candidates.If, however, California were to award its electoral votes proportionally, suddenly there is reason for both candidates to campaign there. By moving the margins even a few percentage points to either side, they can net more electoral votes toward their total. Suddenly, presidential candidates might start caring about what California voters think about their politics. Not to the same degree those candidates care about what swing-state voters think, of course, as those are bigger prizes (compare all the votes in a swing state vs. just moving the margin of electoral votes in a safe state). But still more than the basically 0% that they care about California voters now.Of course, I'm just using California as an example. But this holds true for basically any medium or large safe state. You could replace California with Tennessee, or Illinois, or Massachusetts, or Kentucky, etc., and the analysis is basically the same.","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"Perhaps you misread my comment?

To make a metaphor here, let's say you're ordering 3 pizzas for nine people. 6 people want peperoni and 3 people want cheese. If you want one more peperoni pizza you'll have to convince 2 of the cheese people to change their vote. But 2 of the cheese voters are vegetarians, they'll never change their vote.But if there were 30 pizzas for 90 people with 30 votes for cheese pizza you'd still only have to find 2 people willing to change their vote, but there's now 30 people to pick from. Even if 20 of them are vegetarians you can still potentially find 2 people out of the 10 non vegetarians.So even though all the ratios are the same its impossible to get more peperoni out of the first scenario, while you can potentially get up to 3 pizzas from the second scenario.

Leaving the details up to the states.  Many states have passed laws that require delegates to vote by popular opinion in the states, some have not.  I am not really going to look up every states election law to find out which ones do what, but that is why some states like Maine have that free delegate they talk about during elections every four years. As far as Trumps \\"fake electors,\\" from what I can tell whilst the January 6th riots were going on to distract us.   That is all they were a distraction.  There was no real chance they were going to take over the government, I think it is foolish to call it an insurrection.  Similarly, CHAZ was not a separatist movement.  I know that is not popular on reddit, but that is how I see it. Ok, so every election, the representatives of each state stand up and read the results of the election in the state and call out the decision of the College delegates for that state while the Vice president follows along with the official votes on a certificate of asertainment signed by the delegates.  Normally, this is the same as the representatives' claims, but it was supposed to keep the whole system honest in the old days.  This is usually a ceremonial thing now.  Trump was \\"allegedly\\" attempting to get Pence to change out the certificates with \\"fake\\" ones to change the College vote to his side.  So when the representatives were challenged, they would turn to the certificate it would be different he could say they tried to steal the election blah blah blah.  It is way more complicated than that, but that is my very simplified understanding of events. The point I was trying to make is that we have 54 separate political entities, 50 states, the federal government, the legislative executive, and judicial branches all trying to keep or attain as much authority, power and resources as they can.  When you start looking at the U.S.A. through that lense, a lot of the stuff that doesn't make sense kind of starts to clear up.","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"Make it a couch instead.

The current policies continue and worsen. Israel will have 4 years to proceed with ethnic cleansing of Palestinian territories without US opposition / with shelter from the US / probably with significantly more material support.You are now much farther from a two state solution (in fact, if Israel is successful, it may become straight up impossible, if Palestinians are sufficiently depopulated, displaced, and disempowered.Even if you elect a sympathetic politician who cuts off aid to Israel afterwards, you will best case have to re-establish Palestinian political governance from the ground up (and more likely it won't matter, because there won't be enough people alive or in the area to do anything even with US support).Meanwhile, you still have no guarantee that the Dems will try to win you back next time -- the fact that you didn't vote at all just means they don't have to worry about you, and can instead just focus on competing with Republicans for a smaller pool of swing voters.Because unless you vote Republican, you have removed yourself from the pool of voters. Which means they aren't going to care any more about you than the rest of the 33% or more of people who don't vote.2) Harris wins without your vote. Going forward, the Democrats just ignore you like they ignore all the other non-voters, because they know you aren't going to vote Republican.They would obviously rather have your vote if they can get it...but if you don't vote you're just reducing the pool of voters the Dems have to worry about. They can then stop trying to appeal to you at all and instead focus on competing with Republicans for the smaller numbers of swing voters.In other words, you completely marginalize yourself. Next time you ask for something, the Dems will just shrug and say they don't need you.Uncommitted in the primary was brilliant, and super effective. I participated in it myself. And it has resulted in concessions -- not good ones, but concessions nonetheless.If the Dems make those concessions and you still refuse to vote for them, they will be *less* inclined to work with you in the future (especially if they win without you).You are making a classic mistake: you are assuming politicians miss you when you don't vote. They don't. Not voting makes their job *easier*, because it reduces the people they have to appeal to. In fact, it lets them more easily appeal to your *enemies*, because they can actively *hurt* you make your enemies happy without any fear, because you're not voting (ie not doing anything to challenge their power).And that's the key: refusing to vote does *not* challenge anyone's power. It is self-marginalizing.And unless you live in one of a handful of places that allows ranked choice, voting third party is the same problem -- you aren't going to actually elect a third party, so all you do is remove yourself from the concerns of the major parties.Respectfully, I think you are mistaken in your read of the situation. You can of course do whatever you want with your vote...but not voting/voting third party will *not* meaningfully and materially work towards the goals you have articulated. That is a simple, mathematical fact, and no amount of wishful thinking is going to change that.","title":"CMV: As a Palestinian-American single issue voter, not voting or voting third party is the best way to achieve my political goals."},{"text":"Trump will lose again and he knows it.

Second, he had already agreed to the second debate and would have had to actively back out; hes under no such obligations here.  He was never going to not do the first one, he drank his own koolaid too much to see that it would likely result in far more damage than a new cycle of him being a chicken, but I seriously doubt he will accept this one. That said, yes I agree its a strategic risk precisely because I think Trump deeply underestimated Harris in a way that I dont know he would do a second time.  My guess is the Harris campaign is betting on him chickening out, and calculating that on the off-chance he does accept the risk/reward is worth it if she can push his buttons a second time so close to the election.  Hes very easily manipulated after all; and that debate appears to be the first time hes truly been damaged by getting media attention.

Also, if you are of the opinion that installing a wannabe dictator is going to reduce the size of our military industrial complex, you are woefully misinformed.

They'd love to, but prices have far outpaced their earnings.  It isn't that they're buying avocado toast, it's that the price of rent has gone up (inflation adjusted) by 160% since 1985 where income has gone up (inflation adjusted) by only around 35% in the same amount of time.  Meanwhile, these Boomers aren't retiring even though they are now in their 70s, because they can't afford to.  They squandered their money, expecting the rest of us to take care of them.  This leaves Gen X and younger unable to move into positions of greater authority and higher pay, FURTHER impacting this discrepancy.This is a failure on the part of the Boomers, and the rest of us are left cleaning up after them (as usual).

However, the FRSO is merely Marxist-Leninist, while the Sisonites are Marxist-Leninist-Maoist.

At 16, I might vote for things very differently than I would at 36, and while I understand from the 16 year olds perspective that makes it seem like the reason they should be given a vote; however, they are not the ones that have to be financially and legally responsible for their lives or bear the burden of new policy impacts.

If you must redefine your words to make your point your point is moot.Two: Contrary to what religions and politicians would have you believe, there is no such thing as a universal morality.

[In the US Roe vs Wade is supported by anywhere from 56% to 75% of the society depending upon how you phrase the question.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-americans-stand-on-abortion-in-5-charts/) There is also this.

Wade](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/08/29/u-s-public-continues-to-favor-legal-abortion-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/)Why should the majority give in to the whims of the minority. People have the choice to not have an abortion as one will never be forced upon anyone by society. Why should a vocal minority force their views on the majority?What you're failing to realize is that the progress of morality is on the side of choice. [This is aptly demonstrated by the fact that choice is expanding.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2022/05/06/abortion-legal-illegal-countries-list/9672276002/) Look at Ireland or Poland. Yes there are setbacks. The United States is an example of a small but vocal minority forcing their antiquated morality upon the majority, possibly successfully for a time. But morality eventually, inevitably progresses.So, any discussion of abortion must accept that, morally, what a minority wishes to believe is only relevant to decisions for themselves and should not have an impact upon others. Laws should reflect this fact. The only valid topic for discussion surrounding anti-choice is whether the majority supports choice or not. ...and it has been amply proven that the majority does, in fact, support it (see Ohio, Kansas, Florida, Montana, et al and as sourced above). If you're against abortion, it's simple, don't have one.

On the one hand: vote for the party that has proven time and time again to make things demonstrably better for the LGBTQ population in America, thereby helping to keep out the party that has proven time and time again to make things demonstrably *worse* for that population (and others). In other words, there is a clear and predictable result that affects the lives of a large number of people. Your vote can directly help or hurt them.On the other hand: you have a theory that *maybe* abstaining (which is the same as third party, lets be real) will send a message that will *maybe* influence policy at some point in the future. When? If Trump - an unapologetic supporter of Israel - wins because the Muslim-Americans dont vote for Harris, do you think hell take that to mean he should *stop* supporting Israel? It would only embolden him with the message that you support *his* support of Israel. But, sure, the democrats will probably get the message, and thats all well and good, except the democrats will have no ability to *do* anything about it even if they want to, since you voted to keep them out of power. So *maybe* in a few years, theyll have a chance to do something? Who knows what the situation will even be by then. That also assumes an awful lot about the power the US has to control the situation in the Middle East. We can cut off weapons supplies, which will hinder Israel but certainly not stop them. Theyre well-stocked and their army is strong. We can also sternly say, hey, we dont like this, cut it out, but Israel can and will ignore us. Peace deals have been proposed left and right and they keep getting rejected, so I dont think a more motivated US president will magically discover the solution. Ultimately, the Middle East needs to sort out their own shit. We can try to broker peace or we can stay out of it altogether, but we cant force two assholes to play nice when they both refuse. So you have to decide between the road that has a guaranteed, proven direct effect on a group of people well say you care about secondarily in that you support them but they arent your priority, and the road that *might* have some small positive effect sometime in the future, but will likely have an immediate *negative* result for your primary cause.

The majority of Americans support Israel and [the War](https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/03/21/majority-in-u-s-say-israel-has-valid-reasons-for-fighting-fewer-say-the-same-about-hamas/). To do so will cause a loss in support and possibly in the election. Furthermore, Harris would never want to contradict Biden's policy before the election as it would be a talking point for the other side.Because Biden and Harris has been more sympathetic to Palestinians in general, negotiating ceasefires and providing humanitarian aid, they are better for Palestine than Trump, who truly seems to hate Palestinians and Muslims in general. He has said that he will allow Israel to use any method necessary in the war, which we truly don't want. Just because of this you should support HarrisVoting third party will contribute to Trump winning the election, which will cause other candidates to shift their own rhetoric and strategies to align with Trump to eat away at his support. This will not benefit Palestine in the long run and will shift the country further into supporting Israel without skepticism. No politician will see a winning candidate and adopt views of the losing candidate.Secondly, you should not want Harris to be confronted with making a firm decision right now, as her and her administration will be held to that promise during her presidency if she gets elected. Further pressure to make a pointed decision will only result in Harris committing herself more to Israel as that what the country wants. If you let Harris win without making it a big issue about her campaign, it introduces flexibility in policy changes.This is why no candidate who has caused controversial large change has run on doing that change. Lincoln ran on stopping slavery from expanding, not abolishing it all together. He only did it when he was in a political position to do so. Similarly, Obama did not run on expanding the rights of gays, and only proposed changes when he was in a politically secure position.If you really want to secure change, you should vote Harris and pressure her when she has the political security to change policies without worrying about the immediate consequences of this. If Harris does not change policy, you could vote against democrats in the midterm. Showing disapproval after providing support is considered more than showing disapproval without providing support in the first place.","title":"CMV: As a Palestinian-American single issue voter, not voting or voting third party is the best way to achieve my political goals."},{"text":"You know what won't help this retirement crisis?

Legally, sure, but when it comes to the practicality of their existence it's.... Pretty rough. Disabled folks are often unable to be financially independent. Disability benefits are usually too low to break the poverty line, and there are a ton of insane things that could cause you to lose your disability. For example, If You're disabled and receiving disability checks and your friends get together and buy you a PS5 for Christmas, that increases your net worth and could push you over A reporting threshold and as a result disability payments could be cut and you don't make rent. This is not an edge case, this is a story I hear frequently among the disabled community.?\\nA great number of disabled people are neither financially nor legally independent by any practical definition of the lived experience, and yet they still have the right to vote.?\\n(As to your assumption in this regard..... I would encourage you not to make that assumption in this case)?\\n2) As for becoming a stay-at-home parent.... Not to be too political, but simply acknowledging the legal reality that no, that's... Not necessarily a choice anymore, as of the last couple years. Even setting aside the issue of abortion, perhaps you make the choice to have kids and then 5 years later your financial situation has changed and now your dependence on your spouse. That wasn't a choice you made, That was a choice that was made for you when your job downsized or your hours were cut or whatever. And you already have the kid, even if you were a heartless enough to decide to cut the kid from your life, you can't legally do that for another 13 years. I would say that being a stay-at-home parent isn't always a choice, no.?\\nAnd yet being dependent on your spouse in that way doesn't remove the right to vote.?\\n3) speaking of choices, staying in an abusive relationship when your partner controls your social and financial access absolutely isn't a choice either. And yet people experiencing that still have the right to vote.","title":"CMV: The voting age in the United States should be lowered to 16."},{"text":"I'm sure it's something satanicEdit: you are downvoting me but not refuting me shills...if it isn't satanic what is the symbol","title":"What pin is this?
