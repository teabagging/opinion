And the more they demonize them, the more people stay in the closet/never transition out of fear, which just makes those who do even more of an isolated minority.Trans kids are doubly vulnerable, because they can't vote and a lot of parents would prefer their kids not be trans, so if you go after trans kids the kids themselves can't vote against you and a decent chunk of their parents will be looking for \\"solutions\\" to make their kids not be trans.","title":"Trump pledged to roll back protections for transgender students.

Theres been a few negatives on tariffs 100 years ago, but global economies were different then and Im not sure the downsides apply anymore.

In an accelerating trend in American politics, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and their allies raised colossal sums of money from billionaires. A majority of these megadonors were Republicans, according to Open Secrets, the nonpartisan watchdog organization that tracks the influence of money on politics.  And with Trump's decisive victory, they hit the jackpot. So, who are these high rollers and what do they want in return for their generosity? Often, megadonors get lumped together in a single basket as plutocrats whose largesse is mostly about increasing their wealth with government contracts, tax breaks and regulatory relief, corrupting the democratic process along the way, according to critics of the U.S.' campaign finance system.

You saw a massive transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top under Trump which continues under Biden. Its basically why Harris did not get elected.  She refused to address the economic situation that Trump created, because Biden continued it.In Europe they calculate inflation through measuring price increases on a fixed basket of goods.  In the U.S. we havnt done that since the 90s, when Republicans took control and decided to ratfuck the inflation rate to benefit large corporate interests.  The U.S. inflation rate is worthless to anyone but large corporations seeking to fuck workers out of their wages and benefits.  They substitute lower priced goods in at random to artificially manipulate the inflation rate keeping it lower than it really is with zero oversight, and the data is all private, so there is zero way to verify anything.The CPI doesnt track price increases from temperature changes like climate change, doesnt factor in rural America at all, doesnt track rapidly increasing costs that affect cost of living like insurance services.  The PCE price index doesnt track food or energy costs at all.  If anyone is quoting U.S. inflation rates or CPI rates to form an argument, they are automatically full of shit.The U.S. will increasingly rely on imported goods with higher tariffs.  The same consolidation that is happening in the meat packaging industry and agriculture is happening in the shipping and port operating industry.  They are intentionally creating bottlenecks at ports, intentionally creating delays through the use of automation.

The ideology distorts biblical teachings by emphasizing material gain rather than spiritual development. Theologically, it is not rooted in authentic Christian doctrine and often exploits followers by demanding financial \\"seeds\\" in exchange for divine blessings.It is a \\"false teaching\\" used to get you to pay for their lifestyle because \\"God\\" told you to.[The extravagant lifestyle of Copeland has been widely criticized, including private jets, mansions, and a tax-exempt church empire](https://nypost.com/2021/12/17/kenneth-copeland-wealthiest-us-pastor-lives-on-7m-tax-free-estate/).?According to him, [commercial flights are full of demons, so he needed a private jet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LtF34MrsfI). His theatrical \\"[blowing away\\" of the COVID-19 virus during a sermon, claiming to eradicate the virus through his divine authority, sparked further controversy. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSIrQBGfUtw)**The move was widely skepticism and ridicule - As it should be!**These actions show the dangers of Prosperity Gospel leaders like Copeland, whose teachings often prioritize personal wealth and theatrics over authentic Christian values like humility, sacrifice, and justice. As a result, their approach undermines the true message of faith, which emphasizes love, service, and stewardship over self-enrichment.Makes sense that a grifter like Trump would align himself with someone like Copeland. Mainline and educated Christian leaders would identify Trump as against Christ's teachings. So, in order to give a false impression of piety and religiosity Trump chose this clown.**But then again, I guess when you're the complete opposite of what Jesus actually teaches you need all the help you can get.**This guy DOES NOT SPEAK for Christians, Jesus or \\"God\\" - He speaks for disinformation and scams...","title":"Donald Trump's spiritual advisor says there will be \\"no more rainbow flags\\" after re-election - LGBTQ Nation"},{"text":"Ive never considered that before, but youre right.

People are against homosexuality or gay marriage for irrational reasons, so I say no retreat on those.  But there are legitimate cases to be made to discourage illegal immigration or Trans in sports or transitioning for minors.  The first out of economic self interest (whether valid or not), the second out of perceived fairness (which, to be honest, is an arbitrary choice on either side of the argument which has no totally correct answer).  As for transitioning for minors, there are downsides.  I could enumerate a few, but likely I will be savaged for saying there are any.  I totally support people's right to choose to be Trans in their adult years, but no, I don't think Trans should be in sports, nor encourage minors to make this choice early in life.

Then they invited corporations and wealthy people to lobby Republicans for reduced regulations and tax breaks in 1971.  In 1976 they adopted The Two Santa Theory (this is where the worst of it started). The idea was to make Dems look bad by giving them a choice between cutting New Deal and social programs, or raising taxes. They then publicly convinced the nation that tax breaks were better and would trickle down.Basically, the Two Santa idea was to break the economy and force the Dems to fix it while selling the pubic on the idea that either option to fix it was the Dems fault, and that the inbalance created by the tax cuts were the fault of the Democrats because of their New Deal policies and social programs.Sadly the electorate has a whole seems to have the memory of a goldfish.","title":"Trump supporters when prices go up even more:"},{"text":"The jealousy I felt reading your comment really hit me, until I got to the end.

And they were not just talking about extremists. More to the point however, my friends would also talk about how hard it is to find/be an ally, and how even in the LGBTQ+ community there was a surprising amount of prejudice or lack of support. Outside of certain epicenter cities, the chances that most people even know a trans person is relatively small. (.3% of the population) and there hasnt been the same social evolution that happened relatively recently for the LGB community. All that is to say the republicans weaponized hate to one of the most marginalized group of people (again) in order to divide us, and it worked. The democrats continue to try to build a big tent, which leaves them vulnerable to these attacks. If it becomes a focus of the campaign, and the Dems dont keep to the broader message, it can move the needle and be another way to divide. Focus on housing, healthcare, childcare and groceries, and Dems can win on message.","title":"Christie says Trumps most effective campaign ad was on Harriss trans rights policy | One of the attack ads from the Trump campaign said: Kamala is for they/them.

Now, both red and blue are not what America needs. Red team only won because they shipped all the illegal immigrants to blue states to show the impact it has. I live on the Southern border and I have nothing but respect for the legal immigrants that followed the path to citizenship. They love this country.The open border policy really opened my eyes to the illegal immigration policy. There is no vetting of good or bad, they all get more help than me (got my felony in early 2000s) or American citizens who have a clean record. Not to mention the disrespect and entitlement to our country is infuriating. If youre brave enough to travel 3000 miles you are brave enough to make your home country a little better- they dont.The economic side of the Biden presidency was infuriating. The 2018 tax cuts that saw the middle class tax increase year after year and they saw it coming. 2 years with a fully blue house, senate and presidency and what was done to benefit the American people? Everyone but the middle class got help. His policies helped those with investments and stock holdings as that is where a majority of the recovery was seen- a lot of middle class did not feel that economic boom. I want help for veterans and mentally ill first. Reward the immigrants who did it properly. I and a lot of other Americans feel the same way- thats why Kamala got Hillaryd- here message was for everyone but the backbone of this country. Also- we did not get a choice for Kamala. We were told we had to vote her. Reminds me of how Bernie got fucked by the DNC in 2016.And I will be honest- I dont watch a lot of cable news- its all propaganda to divide.

You had 4 years of Trump from 2016 to 2020, and he never stayed quiet or tried to hide who he is and what his intentions are. By all measures, everything Trump does from this point forward is, in fact, the will of the majority of the voting population in the United States. Is it a massive majority? Maybe not, but a majority nonetheless. Simply put, the amount of people who oppose Trumps agenda, or simply didn't care enough to put in the effort to vote, are less than those who agree with Trump's agenda. Trump wants to crash and burn the economy with tarriffs and interfering with the Fed? Will of the people. Trump wants to ban contraception and end reproductive rights? Will of the people. Trump wants to fire all military generals who won't bend the knee? Will of the people. Trump wants to glass Gaza? Will of the people. Trump wants to leave NATO and destabilize Europe and the rest of the world? Will of the people. Trump wants to round up illegal immigrants and put them in camps? Will of the people. Everything Trump does from this point forward is the will of the majority of people, or at the very least those that cared enough to vote which is all that really matters in a democracy.

The moment you interject your own thoughts the person will get defensive. It has to come from within, it seems impossible but it really can work over time. I asked my super religious Dad a few years ago something simple that went about like this: \\"Hey Dad, if free will is the reason you believe there is so much suffering in the world and not having free will would make us all basically robots (these are things he had previously told me so it's just establishing context for the next part)   do you think we will have free will in Heaven?\\" And I left it at that. He has since told me that my one silly little question has done more to shake his faith than any debate he's ever had in his entire life and he doesn't know what to think anymore about the whole religion thing. He still believes in God but all the rest is in question for him. From a simple question that I made damn sure I didn't follow up on with my own input. Hope some of that helps, just thought I'd share a bit.

The potential for this to go wrong is infinite. The president has the power to fire generals but rarely does so for political reasons. President Harry Truman fired Army Gen.

People in the cult must feel incapable of living an individual life outside the norms of the group. These beliefs often go hand in hand with a worshipful attitude toward the groups authoritarian leader.\\n* **Extremist beliefs**: Cult members hold to very dogmatic and extreme beliefs. They also are unable to question these belief systems without fear of reprisal or punishment from the leader or other group members.\\n* **Isolation from society**: As soon as new members join a cult, other adherents work hard to isolate them from family members and friends. This helps fulfill the mind control aspirations of the leader. It also creates a hive mind of sorts between the new person and the other members.\\n* **Veneration of a single individual**: Charismatic leaders are often at the center of most cults. Consider the Manson family of the late 1960s. As their name suggests, they adopted the beliefs of their leader, Charles Manson, and fulfilled his requests.

Hes now positioned to make good on that promise during the next 10 weeks of his presidential transition.Though hes denied it, this promise reflects the goals of one of Trumps main supporters, the powerful, far-right Heritage Foundation. At the center of the Heritages Project 2025 playbook is a far-reaching, but meekly named, plan dubbed Schedule F. Loyalty to anyone other than the president, the organization claims, is a fireable offense.If this all sounds familiar, thats because Trump tried this all before without much success.In October 2020, he signed an executive order to create a new personnel classification for high-ranking bureaucrats with policymaking responsibilities. Anyone to get the new Schedule F label would be stripped of employment protections and be subject to easy dismissal. Despite the machinations of personnel officials, like John McEntee, the plan never really got off the ground, and the Biden administration withdrew it upon taking office in 2021.This past winter, Trump pledged that hed reissue the same policy immediately upon taking office, with estimates of up to 50,000 officials up for reclassification. All could be fired within weeks of Trump taking office.With unemployment in the Washington, D.C., area hovering around 3 percent, its a real head scratcher how the Trump administration would find 50,000 qualified applicants for these jobs. Nevertheless, loyalty will be the chief metric of how Trump will sift through all the resumes.Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, whos co-chairing the transition team along with Linda McMahon, who headed Trumps Small Business Administration, reiterated this a few weeks ago. Job seekers will be judged based on fidelity and loyalty to the policy, as well as to the man, Lutnick told the Financial Times.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-orderly-transition-not-purge-1235164362/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-orderly-transition-not-purge-1235164362/)","title":"Team Trump Should Focus on an Orderly Transition  Not a Purge"},{"text":"Theres literally NOTHING theyre doing that every single incoming president doesnt do.

The attack that day in Israel by Hamas and the ensuing conflict in Gaza became a turning point in the push against TikTok, Helberg said. People who historically hadnt taken a position on TikTok became concerned with how Israel was portrayed in the videos and what they saw as an increase in antisemitic content posted to the app. \\nAnthony Goldbloom, a San Francisco-based data scientist and tech executive, started analyzing data TikTok published in its dashboard for ad buyers showing the number of times users watched videos with certain hashtags. He found far more views for videos with pro-Palestinian hashtags than those with pro-Israel hashtags. While the ratio fluctuated, he found that at times it ran 69 to 1 in favor of videos with pro-Palestinian hashtags.\\nGallagher heads a House committee focused on China, and the concerns about Israel-Hamas videos on TikTok spurred him and other committee members to renew their attempts to force a sale or ban. \\nAnd Romney just straight-up admitted it cause he's retiring and he DGAF anymore.https://www.axios.com/local/salt-lake-city/2024/05/06/senator-romney-antony-blinken-tiktok-ban-israel-palestinian-contentYou also can't claim an app is such a massive national security threat as to pass a bill that has major 1st Amendment implications while both Biden and Kamala's campaigns were active on it, including having an aide follow him around with the app in the case of Biden.

The potential for this to go wrong is infinite. The president has the power to fire generals but rarely does so for political reasons. President Harry Truman fired Army Gen. Douglas MacArthur for publicly challenging the administrations Asia security strategy. President Barack Obama fired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal as his Afghanistan commander after the military leaders subordinates were quoted as criticizing the administration in a magazine article. U.S. troops take an oath of office to the Constitution and vow to not follow any illegal order, and Congress must approve the promotion of general officers. But establishing a board separate from the current process, which uses serving officers, could undermine the idea that generals refrain from sharing their political views within the Pentagon. It could also potentially prompt officers not to speak out against orders they believe are illegal, says Eric Carpenter, professor of military law at Florida International University College of Law. This looks like an administration getting ready to purge anyone who will not be a yes man, said Carpenter, a former Army lawyer.

We don't need an international agreement if we want to chase green energy, since the US has the ability to do that for itself (see Elon). No other country that signed has provided any significant funds for this project, especially China and Russia. It provides us no significant benefits outside of optics. It requires the US to submit a climate action plan and to participate in the climate summit every year to discuss further action plans and to push for green energy by hamstringing our energy through drilling. Why do we need to spend money on that? It's nothing but a fart smelling contest. There's 0 capital repercussions for us to leave the agreement. They have no way to enforce it since it's a voluntary agreement to begin with, and US can push climate bills on its own. There's no way to hold other countries accountable, outside a slap on the wrist, so why limit ourselves?Cons, possibly makes America look bad to climate activists? Really, we don't need to leave it since providing funds is clearly voluntary. It may strain relations with allied leaders and they could refuse to share tech and assistance to the US down the line, but I can't imagine what those would be that the US can't do for itself. Since this is a global initiative, having arguably the largest superpower step away from the agreement may incentivize other countries to do the same and not follow through with their plans to reduce carbon emission (not that they were doing it to begin with).","title":"I'd Google this, but I know Google is just going to feed me 50 pages of bullshit.

Neither party gets to fulfill the campaign promises people voted for. Neither have a chance to really prove whether their policies are good or bad.

I find it interesting that a pull your own bootstraps up party that wants you to take your own responsibility for your financial failures and mistakes, that does not believe in systemic poverty,  insists that you can blame your financial insecurity on immigrants and members of marginalized communities. The truth is much of the blame can be put on large corporations that have become monopolies and are hurting the end user and many small businesses.  Biden for the first time tried to break their power - perhaps he was making up for his time as a Delaware senator when he heinously protected big corp.  And with the filibuster you need 61 votes, so he did what he could and chipped away. But that doesn't happen overnight, there's no magic wand, and it's much more difficult to explain than yelling it's the illegal immigrants and they're eating your dogs. I hope Republicans take control, remove the filibuster , and give people what they asked for.  In 2016 I would never say that because I was worried about all the innocent people who would be hurt.  But I'm tired of  trying to explain - people need to feel what will happen. Do I feel bad? Absolutely.

Youve never seen such devastation as Ebola or small pox. People not getting their MMR or spreading the rumor that those proven vaccinations dont work is terrible. Scientifically there is a 1/100,000 chance that the Ebola strand will change but there is always the possibility that if it hits the U.S. we could all die.

Which is part of why my first paragraph did not make sense. They werent stopped during the first few days when they were being used to save lives, and while traffic was light. Once relief efforts were in full swing, there were a lot of incoming helicopters (most were private), and for some strange reason, air traffic control is a thing.  Private efforts werent turned away until so much traffic was incoming that it needed to be coordinated. At that point it became an issue of prioritizing what was coming in. And even then, they werent just being told no, but their efforts were being coordinated. Yes, that is good governance. Musk wanting to fly in unannounced to see the area and theoretically drop off satellite internet gear was turned away which meant that they just had to be scheduled to come in, which they did.

Tax payers will be asked to fund public schools. Right now, 51% of my property taxes go to public education and Im in a blue state. ?Religious curriculum will make its way into all classrooms. For the poorest children left within the new system.?When federal funding dries up, and it will quickly, and tax payers refuse to pony up, oligarchs will begin to buy up school buildings. Then children of color and disabilities will be bussed out. ?Homeschool coops will pop up everywhere and teachers will create mini schools in homes and other privately owned places, and only well off families will be able to afford it. So please read. Those of us in public education who did not vote for this are frightened beyond belief. Those teachers who voted for this, AND MAGA school board members all over the nation, and there are many, are some of the most unintelligent people Ive ever worked with. https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/how-project-2025-would-devastate-public-education","title":"Trump wants to shut down the Department of Education.

The video-sharing app faces a January deadline to find a new owner not based in China or lose access to U.S. users, under a law passed in April with bipartisan support. He appreciates the breadth and reach of TikTok, which he used masterfully along with podcasts and new media entrants to win, said Kellyanne Conway, who ran Trumps first presidential campaign, served in the White House and remains close to him and now also advocates for TikTok. There are many ways to hold China to account outside alienating 180 million U.S. users each month. Trump recognized early on that Democrats are the party of bans  gas-powered cars, menthol cigarettes, vapes, plastic straws and TikTok  and to let them own that draconian, anti-personal-choice space. The president-elect has not yet announced a decision on if, or how to proceed, but some advisers expect him to intervene on TikToks behalf if necessary  including Conway and three others, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Trump promised during the campaign to protect the app even though he also signed an executive order in his first term that would have effectively banned it: Im gonna save TikTok, he said in one of his first videos on the app this June. The deadline in the law for TikToks China-based owner ByteDance to divest is Jan. 19  the day before Trumps inauguration. But the firm has challenged the ban as unconstitutional, and even if TikTok doesnt win, the litigation could push the question into Trumps second term, giving him more latitude. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, grants the president the power to extend the divestment deadline by 90 days if the administration sees that significant progress has been made toward a sale. If the deadline comes after Trump takes office and he wanted to halt the ban outright, Trump could push Congress to repeal the law or encourage his attorney general to refrain from enforcing it, according to Alan Rozenshtein, a former national security adviser to the Justice Department. If Trump does try to halt the ban, it would amount to a significant policy shift for an incoming president who has spared almost no opportunity to attack China. Toward the end of his first term, Trump presided over a federal investigation into ByteDance that also sought to orchestrate TikToks sale. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok declined to comment. ByteDance recognized months ago that a Trump victory was its best chance to retain control of TikTok, said one person familiar with the firms internal discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. The outcome of the election puts him in an even better place than he was already trending. And thats what the company is hoping for, the person said. Halting the ban without formal action might be tricky, Rozenshtein said. The law is enforced against app stores offered by tech giants including Apple and Google  subjecting them to fines if they continue to offer TikTok  and those internet giants may be leery of disobeying a law based on the whims of an inconsistent president. If youre the general counsel of Apple and [chief executive] Tim Cook turns to you and says, Can we host TikTok on our app stores, youre in a very awkward position if the answer is Trump said we could in a random tweet, Rozenshtein said. How much do you trust Trump? If he changes his mind, are they retroactively liable? Do they really want to be in that position? Repealing the law outright would leave TikTok under ByteDances ownership and could reignite concerns in Washington, including among top Republicans, over Chinas potential influence on the app. But ByteDance in 2022 offered the Biden administration an extensive proposal, known as Project Texas, that would grant the U.S. government enormous sway over its workforce and technical underpinnings in exchange for continued operation in the United States, which the administration declined. ByteDance has previously said the proposal is still on the table, and the Trump administration could agree to it as part of a potential compromise. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties continue to argue that TikTok represents a national-security threat to Americans. They fear its popularity could open the door for the Chinese government to collect U.S. users data and manipulate the videos that Americans see in their feeds  a charge that TikTok strenuously denies. Trumps early picks for national security posts in his second term include China hawks who have supported the TikTok ban. His choice for secretary of state, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), wrote in The Washington Post in 2022 that TikTok gave the Chinese government a unique ability to monitor American teens and that we must ban this potential spyware before it is too late. Trumps pick for secretary of homeland security, South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R), was the first governor to order TikTok banned on state-owned devices. In a statement, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Michigan), who heads the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, defended the law as affording the Trump administration a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform. Trump shared some of the same concerns as the hawks have during his first term in office, even signing an executive order in 2020 that declared TikTok a national emergency  and warned it could enable China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage. His administration even tried to foster a last-minute sale of TikTok in a process led by then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, but it never came to fruition  and Mnuchin later declared his interest in acquiring pieces of the company. But Trump has tempered his views in recent months, breaking with his party as he emerges as one of the apps biggest defenders on the right. The incoming president has argued that a ban would only help TikToks social media rival, Facebook, which he has said cheated in the [2020] Election and is a true Enemy of the People. After debating whether Trump should join TikTok this spring, his campaign ultimately staffed a small TikTok team to help play him up as the biggest celebrity entertainer  on the planet. By the time he declared victory, the incoming president had amassed more than 14 million followers on the app. For all of those who want to save TikTok in America, vote for Trump. The other side is closing it up, but Im now a big star on TikTok, he said in a video monologue this September posted on his own social media site, Truth Social. Trump has told allies that he is impressed by his popularity on TikTok and recognized it to be a major political asset over the summer, according to two people familiar with his attitude toward the app. Others have told Trump that the national security establishment unfairly targeted TikTok with allegations of Chinese state influence, one person involved with those conversations said, adding that the message appeared to personally resonate with Trump because it mirrors Trumps own views about investigations into his personal and business activities. Support for a TikTok ban has crumbled in the United States, including among Republicans, falling from 50 percent last year to 32 percent this summer, the Pew Research Center said in September.!ping TECH","title":"Trump expected to try to halt TikTok ban, allies say"},{"text":"Yes!
