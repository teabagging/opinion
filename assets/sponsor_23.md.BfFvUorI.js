We are talking about AN HOUR every 4 years anyone can and should make that happen. The idea that 3rd party voters are letting others down because they aren't making up the numbers for non-voters is stupid.Democracy is intended to work with selfishness. If a certain issue agitates sections of the population, the voting population will become more informed on that issue and the candidates running will work to address those issues. If people can't find an hour every 4 years to advocate for themselves and the issues they are experiencing, maybe they aren't agitated enough. It is offensive to suggest that a 3rd party voter needs to sacrifice their vote to advocate for someone else's agitation.Secondly, this exact line of thinking is what produced Trump in the first place. Our leaders are so crappy because no one holds them accountable. If a politician does something crappy, the people who voted for the politician take NO responsibility, they just let it roll of their shoulders, and tell themselves that their vote for that person was to protect their pet issues and will continue voting for those politicians. We need people to feel responsible for the actions of their elected officials, not just say 'well, the other guy was worse'.Lastly, why not just do some basic research? You just sound uninformed on point #4. 5% of the vote leads to receiving a certain amount of government funding towards your party in the next election season, it is undeniably a milestone in building a legitimate party, so to say it is just an arbitrary number just sounds silly.For the record I voted for Biden and will for Kamala. I do think Trump is a valid threat to our democratic systems and as long as that threat is there I will support whichever party has the greatest chance of opposing it. Outside of the preservation of democracy, my principle is to vote for the best candidate on the ballot. If the system wants to throw my vote away it is a problem with the system. Voting for the best person on the ballot shouldn't be too much to ask for in a democracy. Maybe you should be advocating for rank choice voting rather than feeling entitled to the votes of 3rd parties, but Democrats would never do that because it is one of the mechanisms they use to hold on to power. Either vote for the Democrat or throw your vote away. What a cool democracy we have.","title":"cmv: If youre voting for Jill Stein youre a privileged person that has nothing to lose, and you dont care about Palestinians more than you care about your moral high ground"},{"text":"Trump lost PA in 2020, has less support now, no momentum, has declined mentally, and is going full Nazi at his rallies.

But also, addiction is a real thing part of the population is super fragile to, and protecting them makes sense.It's like the opioid epidemic; people should have the choice, but we should also have reasonnable laws and regulation in place to protect people, in particular the most vulnerable to it.I'm actually in favor of legalizing all drugs (in a similar way to how weed is in some places), so many advantages (medical, human, social, financial) to having the state involved instead of cartel drug dealers. And alcool is by far the most damaging of drugs, and also happens to be the only one that's fully allowed, go figure...But we should also do everything we can to protect people. Communicate/inform them, make help easily available, forbid stuff like advertising if it's something that's addictive/dangerous, etc, all common sense measures.People **are** going to use drugs, the war on drugs isn't working. If you want to actually help people, and improve outcomes, you need to allow people to do drugs in a context that doesn't make them criminals **and** to help them as best as you can.Same goes for gambling, people should probably be allowed to do it, in it's most basic form, it's just entertainment. But it also ruins lives. And that needs to be addressed.Predatory practices, some advertising tactics, etc, should be regulated.Stuff OP mentions about ads, credit cards, etc, is just good sense.I also think profits from these should be taxed (specifically/on top of normal taxes), and those taxes used for programs that educate and help addicts recover.It should be mandatory for betting platforms to investigate their largest betters, going from the top down (in a process similar to KYC), they have the money to do it. Some are just rich, others are ruining their lives and the lives of those around them. Figure out which is which, you have the means to.If somebody is giving playing on your site at a rate that would result in a 50-100k/year spending, **some** of those are ruining their lives, and you know it. It should be your responsibility to at least investigate which are which, ask for proof of income, ask where the funds come from (you are already in part required to know due to anti money laundering laws anyway right?). And if it becomes obvious somebody is addicted, spending all their money, going into debt, selling their assets, borrowing from family, etc, you should cut them off and send them towards psychological help. And there should be a national file that prevents people from just going to the next website over (it can be encoded in a way that lets it remain anonymous, but it should make sure once somebody is banned by one site, the others can check that).I also believe there **could** be something of value in the idea of making betting platforms legally liable (as in, able to be sued) in cases where the addiction and harm are obvious from their standpoint. I don't know how practical this is, and what the exact moral and legal ramifications would be, but I think it's at least worth exploring.","title":"CMV: Sports gambling has gotten out of hand and needs much more regulation, especially in advertising."},{"text":"I agree!","title":"HOT TAKES: Reactions to Trump's Garbage Truck Troll Are Terrific, As Dems Cope and Seethe"},{"text":"We got this !!!

I dont believe anyone is asking for people to actively champion their cause, but to be self-aware and not be a part of social problems that affect their group. You can be an ally to women just by calling out sexism when you see it and not being sexist yourself. If I can be obnoxious and use myself as an example, I think of myself as an ally to anyone who is oppressed or maligned by the natural social processes that seem to happen in societies. What that means in practice is I find sexism disgusting (even when I inadvertently perpetuate it), racism disgusting even when its not directed at my particular group, homophobia disgusting even though Im not gay/queer, and I feel that any country has to defend itself, but not by genociding another one. Theres also the aspect that this is not an either/or scenario. Im not putting anyones needs above my own when I do this because, as a man, protesting or voting for womens rights doesnt take anything away from men as a group. As a black person protesting for Gaza doesnt take away from any black causes.The effect of thinking that way is that I find myself allied with a lot of groups (maybe all depending on how you look at it).

Solidarity isn't a two way street, it's an agreement about something, there's no transactional act when we're talking about agreement. Either you find an issue founded and agree or you do not, suspending your agreement on an issue behind a reciprocal agreement isn't solidarity, it's adversarial. You can have solidarity on one thing and not another, what you're asking for is akin to total political alignement as in everyone should agree on everything before action, it's completely unrealistic and lead to political paralysis.Now I think you're having a real concern that you try to address with the wrong tool. You want the people you take action for to take action for you, basically it's a trust issue. You cannot force trust, it does not work. If your political goals are class-centered, then you'll have to deal with activist that are not class-centered but can ultimately serve your political goals even if they do not agree with them.I'll take the two example you have used, LGBT activism and racism. Both can be supported by liberal or conservative activist which you cannot trust to endorse your activism about class, you can even trust them to be your adversaries on that subject. However, I think that LGBT activism undermine class hierarchy by eliminating the basis upon which class society function, the patriarcal family. Typically by eliminating the patriarcal family, we can eliminate the institution that is central to capital accumulation because who will inherit capital? There's also the violence aspect, patriarcal family is a core component in teaching kids to enact violence upon others even loved one (this is something that has been successfully pushed back). Racism is easier, race is basically dividing the lower classes with some arbitrary line to make us fight each other, the faster it's gone, the better it is.Now for a factual rebuttal. You rarely see those type of groups advocating for leftists positions because they have been actively repressed in the US, the poster child of that is MLK which has progressively endorsed more socialist stances and has ultimately been assassinated.tl:dr; if you want to raise class conciousness, you won't do it by resenting people fighting against things enabling class based society.","title":"CMV: Anyone who demands allyship from others is incredibly naive or a  narcissist."},{"text":"Since 1776.

We cannot quantify the chance that something will go badly wrong: nobody can. But we believe voters who minimise it are deluding themselves. The case against Mr Trump begins with his policies. In 2016 the Republican platform was still caught between the Mitt Romney party and the Trump party. Todays version is more extreme. Mr Trump favours a 20% tariff on all imports and has talked of charging over 200% or even 500% on cars from Mexico. He proposes to deport millions of irregular immigrants, many with jobs and American children. He would extend tax cuts even though the budget deficit is at a level usually seen only during war or recession, suggesting a blithe indifference to sound fiscal management.

Then later tweeting that it's too close to call. There's zero real analysis.My view on why Harris will win with a healthy margin is that she has actually built the best campaign infrastructure of the 21st century. Professional senior staff, good data, 353 field offices, 2,500 field staff in swing States running millions of volunteers. Many placed well in advance (by the Biden Harris campaign) in early summer. These coordinate closely with local, House and Senate campaigns to maximize impact and reduce duplication. It's a very well run machine.Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is a giant grift. LaCivita has extracted $22 million (so far) and vast sums are being funneled to either related party LLCs or 'media companies' at highly inflated rates for advertising. The kickbacks are substantial, whether that's to the Trump crime family or individual senior staff is unknown.Very little of the donations to Trump's campaign committee or the RNC or related PACs is being used for the campaign. They fund some mailouts, hence all the junk mail. However they've shut down outreach offices and appear to have few field staff. It's why billionaire donors are limiting their donations to anything where Trump may get his tiny hands on it. Dipshit Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk are running the canvassing operations with their own donors. Musk's America PAC doing digital marketing and canvassing. That canvassing operation exposed yesterday in Wired Magazine as exploitative of staff and poorly run. Kirk's has limited reach but is slightly more professional.GOTV field operations and outreach can pump the final 2-3% of a candidate's vote. I think this will be Harris' winning margin in all swing States and result in a strong EC victory.","title":"CNN Polling Analyst's Warning to Kamala Harris: Signs 'Have Been Obvious'"},{"text":"I've been around a long time.

Candidates from the party that controls the White House have performed better when more Americans see the country heading on the right course. But that connection unravels when the incumbent presidents job approval is taken into account. The impact of presidential job approval is unsurprising, but it appears to outweigh any effect of wrong track sentiment during presidential election years. In presidential elections since 1980, a simple statistical analysis finds, the percentage of Americans saying the country is on the wrong track has not at all been predictive of the incumbent partys share of the vote. An analysis by the New York Times Nate Cohn that also included economic factors found a similar result, with pessimism exerting no negative impact on results. One of the best examples of pessimisms poor track record occurred just four years ago. A Post-ABC poll in August 2012 found 67 percent of registered voters saying the country was on the wrong track, yet Obama won reelection with 52 percent of all votes for a major-party candidate. President Bill Clinton won his 1996 reelection bid by a large margin over Bob Dole despite the fact that 67 percent saw the country as headed on the wrong track in June.","title":"CNN Polling Analyst's Warning to Kamala Harris: Signs 'Have Been Obvious'"},{"text":"RIP...I'll attend your funeral.","title":"Election night plans?

It's not unreasonable, to me, that a person could mean \\"work\\" to be synonymous with \\"occupation.\\"Specifically addressing negotiation, bonuses, and having kids: these aren't gender neutral. People tend to interpret some of the same actions (like self-advocacy) differently coming from women than from men, and the expectation that a woman might take time off to have children really has very little to do with what each individual person may choose for themselves.I was not rejecting outright the possibility that the pay gap is largely explained by women being paid less than men for the same work due to gender-based discriminationDid anybody in the conversation mention discrimination?Would you feel confident concluding this gap is mostly due to gender-based discrimination?Discrimination isn't really something you can definitively prove or disprove, in the absence of a confession. But a gap doesn't have to be based on discrimination to be worth changing.Take parental leave, for example. Women are expected to take more of it. It would likely help women's salaries generally if fathers shared more of the time burden of raising children. International comparisons bear that out pretty well, I think.But encouraging more paternal leave is *also* great for helping fathers be more connected with their children. And maybe, with time, the expectation that mothers are the ones handling all of the appointments and records to do with parenting will lessen, and that time and attention differential could also show up in the income statistics.Or even in the general case: people's salaries frequently depend on what other competing positions might offer.

To me, the phrase same occupation does not imply that any of these are being controlled for. example: some personal trainers make WAY more than others (though they have the same occupation) for various reasons; maybe they take in a ton of clients and work unbearable hours, maybe they are just good as hell at their job and can charge a ton, maybe they manage to get super wealthy clients, etc. etc. My only point here is that same occupation does not at all equate to same work and does not imply they that salary should automatically be the same across an occupation.","title":"CMV: Hostility toward men starts at the very top of the Democratic party"},{"text":" I havent seen a single reaction to this from anyone other than hardcore Trump supporters claiming offense.Precisely.

Your claim is that Democrats are hostile towards men, but you cite a couple quotes that discuss systemic problems in a not-particularly-hostile way. You say that they're hostile because they're false, but that's in itself not entirely true. The first source says that there aren't good apples-to-apples stats to show the claim Harris made; it is still true that men earn more than women, Harris just erred in saying \\"for the same jobs.\\" This does not take away from her core message that there is a pay gap. If you see discussion of that pay gap as hostility towards men, I'd suggest taking some time to consider what you see as being a man. The second source is even worse, as it very clearly has a political bent. Any source that spends a whole paragraph decrying the death of unborn children isn't going to have an unbiased take. Again, if you read Harris saying that there are problems with bodily autonomy for women in ways that are not present for men and your first thought is \\"Well, men have to sign up for the draft and have to partake in laws that apply to both men and women\\" you're probably not taking these things at face value. But, to address the point that you seem to be making, it is absolutely true that the Democrats put much more focus on their policies for women than for men. I'd dispute your point on them being hostile towards men on several points though. Firstly, they absolutely do also address problems that face men. Due to the nature of a patriarchal society though, these tend to just be phrased as \\"problems\\" instead of \\"men's problems\\" though. See [this press release](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-strategy-to-address-our-national-mental-health-crisis-as-part-of-unity-agenda-in-his-first-state-of-the-union/) on Biden's attempts to solve the mental health crisis, which disproportionately affects men, as an example. Dems also consistently talk about systemic problems like the patriarchy which affect men as well as other demographics. These problems are still addressed, just as a general problem instead of as a problem specific to men. It also makes sense that they campaign more on the problems faced by women because that is what the Republicans focus on too. Harris focuses so much on reaffirming that the pay gap exists and the bodily autonomy is a serious problem for women because Republicans insist that neither of those are actually a problem. If Republicans start insisting that men don't deal with a mental health crisis, we'd probably see similar rhetoric on the left for men. But it's not a talking point on the left so much because it isn't a problem the right is exacerbating or pretending doesn't exist. To close out, seeing the Democrats discuss problems exclusive to women is not the same as them being hostile towards men. They do still address problems faced by men, but more importantly you should ask yourself why your first knee-jerk reaction to seeing these problems discussed is \\"They're being hostile towards me.\\" That may be worth more investigation for you.","title":"CMV: Hostility toward men starts at the very top of the Democratic party"},{"text":"I don't think it's sabotage.

It wasnt intentional. But no, i do not interpret same work as synonymous with same occupation. For example, for hourly jobs, the first obvious variable that would have to be controlled for is hours worked (to me that is implied by same work but not implied by same occupation).  Assuming field of occupation is controlled (probably the most important) then there is still experience, time at the company, hiring salary (affected by previous job, education, negotiation, etc.),  performance bonuses, overtime, time off, commissions, having kids, etc. Im sure theres other, more important, variables Im not thinking of. To me, the phrase same occupation does not necessarily imply that any of these are being controlled for. I should clarify that my points were directed specifically at the content of the original post I responded to. I was pointing out that the links seemed to contradict the posters statements. I was not rejecting outright the possibility that the pay gap is largely explained by women being  paid less than men for the same work due to gender-based discrimination (although I am skeptical; Im sure this happens but Im skeptical it is the/a major cause of the pay gap). The new links you posted are pretty  interesting. We do indeed see the gap shrink considerably when company, occupation, and a third thing Im forgetting are controlled (the link worked the first time and now is giving me a server error). But there is still a gap. Would you feel confident concluding this gap is mostly due to gender-based discrimination? If so, that would be grounds for a pretty hefty lawsuit, wouldnt it? When the link works Ill see what the authors conclusions are.","title":"CMV: Hostility toward men starts at the very top of the Democratic party"},{"text":"How many times is this going to get posted ?? .

Might is only one of the axis of power. It is also the most obvious and enforcable axis of power. But it's not the only one. Violence is just politics by other means. There are other ways we can gain or lose things. Some examples:Morals. We might just believe in something and act on it without need for violence. The best example of course is India's independence. Might was still a factor there, but the real turn was that Gandhi appealed to the morals of the British to let them go. And it worked. Another one would be the abolition of slavery in Brittain. Maybe the most monumental one would be the investiture crisis, where the pope got declared war on by the Holy Roman Emperor... and lost! It also can be a huge modifier on might, for example the first crusade or the Afghan war.Wealth and trade. Sometimes you can just buy your way into or out of a conflict. Foes can become friends if you can scratch each others back. It's a fickle and expensive route, but it happens extremely often.Relationships and diplomacy. Politics also plays in the hearts of those who wield guns. Are the guns on your side? Do the guns want to switch side? Do they have something to win? It can intertwine with the above, but it can also come from purely personal reasons, like family values or honor. When a war has started, this often can become a decisive vector.The monopoly of violence is almost universally?**obtained through the use of violence, most commonly by conquest or revolution**, and 100% of the time it is maintained by the use of violence.This is just factually wrong. Violence is a last resort to maintain the monopoly of violence. It's much more often maintained by other means: jobs, trade, relationships, a common ethos. Just when the deal is not good enough for someone and their threat is big enough, violence is applied. You could see that for example during covid, when a small percentage of the people rebelled against a vaccin mandate. There was violence, but it was a very, very small percentage of how this was reigned in. Other factors were much more important. *Do it for grandma*, for example.I think your misconception is: *how* does one get all the guns? And how do you get people to use them? Why isn't that the decisive factor? You factor the sword, but not the heart, mind, and environment of the soldier or commander. And how often have we seen the potentially stronger force retreat or fall into chaos because of this? This is exactly what gets generals and kings into trouble.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"I dont see your point.

That being said, it still is not an established fact that class is the primary vector of oppression in todays society.

As a person of color with a non-white name, that does affect my chances of getting a job in the US. There are many recent sociological studies with high repeatability that show that Black sounding names are disproportionately disfavored in job application processes compared to white default names. You also dont have to look far to see how people in the last category of LGBT are treated as absolute abominations in the US. Its weird to tell these people that the main vector of their oppression is class. All that is to say is that, it is always iffy to claim that some social factor is the main or primary cause of social inequity. As much as I am skeptical of people claiming race and gender are main vectors of oppression, I am also skeptical of people claiming that class is the main mode of oppression.

So correct me if Im wrong.","title":"CMV: Hostility toward men starts at the very top of the Democratic party"},{"text":"Both of your own articles agree that discrimination exists, but the level at which its responsible for the income gap isnt clear.The linked study in the Pew Research article says Motherhood does have important effects on the potential earnings of women. Women who experience breaks in their careers after becoming mothers sacrifice at least some of their earnings. Some mothers may never work for pay after having children, passing on earnings altogether. But it is difficult to know what the earnings of mothers might have been and, as a result, it is hard to know for certain what the full effect of motherhood is on womens earnings. Estimates suggest that motherhood may account for much of the current shortfall in the earnings potential of women overall.[1]The study linked in that paragraph shows from 19802013 that the % of women whose career was impacted by the child penalty increased from 40% to 80%.  The gap is also smaller for younger demographics (pre-motherhood years). Its not just less hours worked, either the workplace keeps moving so when you return after time off, you might find your coworkers have advanced more/increased salaries. Im not OP, and of course we arent actually here to debate the gender gap itself. But I do agree that its murky for any politician to generalize the wage gap like that. It does demonize men, because it sounds like theyre 100% responsible for it due to discrimination alone.  But, as all three of yours and OPs articles show, its much more nuanced than that.  Leaders should do a better job, than sensationalizing things and pointing fingers.

The glass panels gleam in the sun, like an outsize version of the prismatic bluish-purple gem that glitters in the light. The trains C powered by electricity, a first for the region C carry passengers from the commercial hub to the capital, Dodoma, in less than four hours, half the time it takes by road. It marks the starting point of one of the countrys strategic projects C the building of a 2,560km (1,590-mile) Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) envisaged to connect key cities and link up with neighbours Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The 460km (285-mile) Dar es Salaam to Dodoma leg has been open since August, when President Samia Suluhu described the railway as a pathway to our future that would \\"enhance our standing in the region\\". In Dodoma, the station is another grand building, resembling the rocky hills around the city C an effort to blend the countrys natural heritage with modernity. It is a reluctant capital. In the middle of the country, it was first designated the centre of power 50 years ago, but it took the strong-willed late President John Magufuli to force government bodies to relocate. But as most commercial activity, and even some government work, continues in Dar es Salaam, a fast and efficient transport link between the cities has been seen as vital. The electric train has also made it smooth and convenient for the ordinary Tanzanian. A far cry from the experience on the road or the older slower, narrower train that this service replaces. Inside the train carriage, the seats are clean, comfortable and reclinable. There is a foldable tray table attached to each one. A member of the train crew is on hand to sell hot and cold drinks as well as snacks. In economy class there are five seats in each row, three on one side of the aisle and two on the other. In the business and luxury (royal) classes there are two seats on either side of the row, offering more comfort and legroom. \\"We are grateful, we are not tired,\\" Gloria Sebastian who lives in Dar es Salaam, tells the BBC during a trip to visit her family in Dodoma. She is happy about the convenience that the train provides. And she is not alone. The man who is overseeing the building and operation of the SGR service says at least 7,000 passengers travel on the eight daily services on the line, which is already approaching capacity. Machibya Masanja tells the BBC that the demand has been so high that \\"we cannot meet it with those trips we are making per day. We expect the number [of passengers] will double or triple.\\" There are plans afoot to add more journeys. The popularity means that advance planning is essential as services can be fully booked several days in advance. Payment must be made within an hour of booking in order to reserve a seat. An economy class trip to Dodoma costs a reasonable 40,000 Tanzanian shillings ($15; 11), while going business class will set you back 70,000 shillings ($26). The early morning service leaves Dar es Salaam at 06:00 but people are required to turn up two hours earlier for security checks. The inside of the tanzanite-shaped building resembles an airport terminal. Passengers queue up and go through thorough checks just like in an airport. The luggage is scanned and people are sometimes frisked before accessing the boarding lounge. One man later told the BBC that he felt the intense scrutiny seemed unnecessary, and there does not seem to have been any direct security threat, but the atmosphere is good-natured. Nevertheless, there is an edginess from officials evidenced by the fact that a police officer questioned the BBC team who were taking pictures at the terminal C but they were quickly cleared after some checks. The boarding was calm and orderly and the train pulled away on time. Gathering speed C the trains currently hit a maximum of 120km/h (75mph) but can go faster C it was soon whizzing through the outskirts of Dar es Salaam as the early morning sun began to illuminate the panoramic view. We cross a vast countryside - scrub and grassland plains interspersed with views of lush farms C and pass a meandering river, craggy terrain and undulating hills. There were also the tunnels, causing some discomfort in the eardrum. You are advised to be chewing something, yawn or keep your mouth open, the announcer said, to the amusement of some passengers. For first-timers, the excitement was evident. Bernice Augustine was with her daughter for a weekend vacation in Dodoma. \\"It is awesome,\\" she says. \\"You cannot compare it with the old train: it's convenient, it's clean, its easy.\\" Hilaly Mussa Maginga has bad memories of going on the old line. After the trip to Kigoma he vowed never to get on a train again as he was so tired and his lower back was in pain. But his curiosity was piqued when he heard about the SGR. \\"When you are used to travel for long distances, you sit until it hurts, so when you have this option to travel for a shorter time, there is a lot to enjoy. We've come from far, thank God,\\" he says. For Mr Maginga the journey on the SGR is a zen-like voyage, a calm, unperturbed travel experience. The projects journey to reach this point has not been entirely smooth. From the initial groundbreaking in 2017, the first section had been scheduled for completion in 2019. But it faced lengthy delays which the railway company attributes to Covid and construction costs as well as labour issues. There have also been questions about its huge cost, estimated at $10bn (8bn) upon completion. Turkish firm Yapi Merkezi is the main contractor for the routes first four sections, including the Dar es Salaam to Dodoma segment, while Chinese firms are building the other two.\\nThe train station in Dodoma made from beige coloured slabs in cubic sections Funding has come from the Tanzanian government and lenders, including from Denmark and Sweden, the Chinese Exim bank and the African Development Bank. But Mr Masanja says it is too soon to be worried about profitability, saying this will only be realisable once the entire network is complete. He adds that the service is generating enough passenger income to offset operation costs, and that from January the company plans to introduce freight trains. For now, he says, \\"its social contribution is much more profitable\\". The service has occasionally been disrupted by power failure but Mr Masanja says they are building a dedicated power transmission line, tapping into the countrys vast power generation capacity to eliminate the risk of unstable power. Using electricity has reduced the cost of operations to about a third of what would have been spent on diesel, which neighbouring Kenya uses to power its own SGR line, he tells the BBC. \\"We are the cheapest in the region, and in Africa, in terms of the cost,\\" he says. Not everyone is entirely happy, though. Adam Ally Mwanshinga, chairman of the Dodoma Bus Terminal Agents Union, says his members have lost a significant part of their business because of the railway. The modern bus station in the capital was not so long ago a bustling terminal, he says, adding there are now 4-500 fewer passengers each day. While it is cheaper to travel by bus, the convenience of the train has been more attractive for many. \\"Business is down and life is difficult,\\" Mr Mwanshinga says. \\"The buses cant fill up and the many businesses here that used to benefit from the many people coming here are suffering,\\" he says. However he seems resigned to the situation, saying that the SGR development \\"has done well for the majority of the people\\". \\"It is the nature of life - there are those who benefit and those who will suffer.\\"\\n!ping TRANSIT&amp;AFRICA","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I saw that but its not clear if that is controlling for anything besides field of occupation.

One of our findings is that while convergence between men and \\nwomen in traditional human capital factors (education and experience) played an important role in the \\nnarrowing of the gender wage gap, these factors taken together explain relatively little of the gap wage \\ngap in the aggregate now that, as noted above, women exceed men in educational attainment and have \\ngreatly reduced the gender experience gap. For a portion of the labor market, however, recent research \\nsuggests a continued and especially important role for work force interruptions and shorter hours in \\nexplaining gender wage gaps in high skilled occupations than for the workforce as a wholethis work is \\nparticularly relevant in that, as we have seen, the gender wage gap at the top of the wage distribution \\nappears to have decreased more slowly than at the middle and the bottom. While this might suggest a \\ncontinued relevance of human capital factors for these labor markets, the interpretation of these findings \\nin a human capital framework has been challenged. Goldin (2014), for example, argues that they more \\nlikely represent the impact of compensating differentials, in this case wage penalties for temporal \\nflexibility. Additional research pinpointing when and where labor force interruptions and hours \\ndifferences are important and testing the reasons for their impact would be useful.\\nAlthough decreases in gender differences in occupational distributions contributed significantly to \\nconvergence in mens and womens wages, gender differences in occupations and industries are \\nquantitatively the most important measurable factors explaining the gender wage gap (in an accounting \\nsense). Thus, in contrast to human capital factors, gender differences in location in the labor market, a \\nfactor long highlighted in research on the gender wage gap, remains exceedingly relevant. The continued \\nimportance of gender differences in employment by industry and occupation, as well as by firm, suggest \\nthe fruitfulness of research aimed at better understanding the underlying reasons for these gender \\ndifference as well as their consequences. The growing availability of matched firm-worker data should \\nfacilitate such research. \\nAnother factor emphasized in traditional analyses that remains important is differences in gender \\nroles and the gender division of labor. Current research continues to find evidence of a motherhood \\npenalty for women and of a marriage premium for men. Moreover, the greater tendency of men to \\ndetermine the geographic location of the family continues to be a factor even among highly educated \\ncouples. The importance of dual career issues in the location of families highlights another area of \\npotentially useful research in an era in which such couples have become increasingly important. Here, as \\nin other areas, greater understanding of feedback effects would be importantthe division of labor in the \\nfamily potentially responds to, as well as causes, gender differences in wages. The persistence of an unexplained gender wage gap suggests, though it does not prove, that labor \\nmarket discrimination continues to contribute to the gender wage gap, just as the decrease in the \\nunexplained gap we found in our analysis of the trends over time in the gender gap suggests, though it \\ndoes not prove, that decreases in discrimination help to explain the decrease in the gap. We cited some \\nrecent research based on experimental evidence that strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be \\ndiscounted as contributing to the persistent gender wage gap. Indeed, we noted some experimental \\nevidence that discrimination against mothers may help to account for the motherhood wage penalty as \\nwell. Future work could usefully focus on efforts to test for discrimination and understand its quantitative \\nimportance as well as better understand which model or models of discrimination are most consistent with \\nthe patterns we observe.\\" Weird how the discrimination part can't be proven but only \\"suggested\\".

From what I remember 90% of MI5 case load is for Islamic extremism and with PREVENT 75% is Islamic extremism (may be the either way round).I'm ex police and genuinely we can't keep ignoring that there is clearly a cultural divide which continues to grow as the migrant population grows in the UK (not a bad thing at all but it has security risks attached) as the far right feel unheard and ridiculed for having genuine concerns about imigration and muslims then feel attacked or have prior issues with the west. This is especially important now as it turns out that the Southport Stabber was an Islamic radical after months of the government arresting people for saying so (some were arrested quite rightly for other miss information) so I'd assume there's alot of angry people currently.

This is not how it works. Saying women face sexism at the workplace does mean men are evil. It means women are facing sexism at the workplace. The problem exists, and addressing the problem does not make a group of people evil.At the same time, I am not aware of any example of the Democratic Party addressing problems that affect men disproportionally while talking openly and positively about the male nature of the solution.It is difficult to create male-centric solutions at a government level since gender-specific issues are mainly social. Except for things like military, workplace discrimination, and Healthcare. 2 of which are where women are discriminated against in a broader sense than men.Pregnancy is a uniquely woman issue (requires at least a functioning womb). Workplace sexism is mainly an issue women face.Men who were drafted do receive vetetan benefits that practically only men benefit from. The Biden administration has pushed for veteran support.

If someone asked about the election earlier this year, Id say, I dont even want to talk about it. But when Harris was chosen as the nominee and gave her speech saying, I know Donald Trumps type, I felt this rush of hope and emotion. I criedit hit me just how critical this election is. As a new mom to a biracial son conceived through IVF, I cant believe where we are as a country. My husband worked in politics in Nevada, and its scary to see how many Trump supporters there are who you wouldnt expect.Now living on the East Coast, I had a tough talk with a friend Ive known for 24 years. Shes a Democrat but was planning not to vote because she felt Harris denounced the Lord at her rally. The conversation got intense, but we came full circle, and she agreed its too important not to vote. Its sad, though, how many are willing to stay on the sidelines over one issue.I voted early on Tuesday!","title":"Todays polls look more promising for Harris !!

It doesn't leave anybody out so it's easier to build a coalition to get it passed. I responded to some of this in your other post, but I don't think it's as simple as you make it out to be. marginalized people are often still targeted through other means. Finances are not the only issue facing those communities, the answer is not going to only be from class consciousness.The opposite is not true. In California they passed a minimum wage increase only for fast food workers because they are majority women of color. Tough luck for anybody else i guessWho is this hurting? Tough luck to who? The people who already enjoy among the highest minimum wage in the country? I think we should examine why targeted aid to a community upsets you when it's not hurting any other communities. If your argument is the opportunity cost i think that's pretty flimsy personally. Also, do you have a source on the fast food minimum wage being targeted for black women? Or is that a correlation that was just made elsewhere?

MLK talked about class consciousness a lot. These issues are all connected and complicated. The idea that fixing class struggles can even happen without addressing race and other intertwined issues isn't realistic and leaves a lot of people suffering as they are overlooked by a cause that only sees one side of the struggle. It's still framing political action and allies as an alternative to solidarity which is a problem. The irony is that people in these groups are telling you that by ignoring their issues, you are not in solidarity with them.

In fact, I [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/16nnkqo/discussion_thread_transportation_secretary/k1jk7br/) (and got downvoted for it) that President Biden should not run again at least as early as September 2023 and had been critical of his decision for a lot longer than that. I fully agree that RBG made the wrong call as well at the time. In both cases, it was the hubris of stubborn old people refusing to read the writing on the wall and the unwillingness of others to make them see the error of their ways that led to an objectively worse outcome. As for the Hillary vs. Bernie debate, I don't think it's worth rehashing that anymore. I don't think the DNC putting their thumb on the scales had as much of an influence on the eventual result of the primaries as people made it out to be. Having said all of that, though, your decision about who to vote for next week should not come down to whether or not you feel a bit iffy about the process that got us to the choice you have, but what your vote's outcome will be both domestically and geopolitically. I happen to believe that a vote for Donald Trump will lead to a radically worse future both for Americans as well the rest of the world. And whether or not we all wish that the Democrats had chosen a different route to arrive at their candidate is neither here nor there. You can only play with the team you've got and not with the one you wish you had. Having seen how Trump performed in his first term, but much more crucially what he has announced (some may say threatened) for a second term, would make this a very easy decision for me.","title":"Harris distances herself from Bidens garbage comment as Democrats are privately exasperated by the president"},{"text":"Not gay but a woman ally in a rural red area who practices at the range at least once a month.

They are more pro abortion than pro choice so I dont feel an ounce of empathy for them because of the Roe decision.  Im also not convinced that if Republicans took a progressive stance on abortion that it would unlock the votes of all these college educated urban and suburban women.

Keep in mind that they have taken tens of millions from angel investors for a reason.Each article or show is rated by at least three analysts C one left-leaning, one right-leaning and one center, politically. All of our media analysts complete a training period that includes a thorough introduction to our methodology, as well as practice rating articles and other news content. We purposefully assign each analyst a breadth of coverage over as many sources as possible to enhance each analysts familiarity with sources across the spectrum.Analysts generally score articles similarly following our analysis training, regardless of their political lean; however, when significant differences occur, the group engages in a conversation during which analysts present their rationale for their respective scores.We do not rate the merits of political positions. Rather, we place the content where it descriptively belongs relative to the current range of political thought within the United States. When scoring for reliability, our method focuses on classifying content along a continuum including fact, analysis, opinion, incomplete story, propaganda, and fabricated information.All of the above minimizes the impact of analyst bias on reliability and source bias scoring. It results in a rating of sources that many individuals, instructors, and other stakeholders find helpful in navigating todays news ecosystem.Lastly, I didn't ask you to justify your demonization to me.

Conduct so egregious that the legal doctrine of \\"Absolute Immunity\\" doesnt apply. It's a legal doctrine that was put in place to prevent a politician from getting sued by everyone directly impacted by their laws/rulings, but has been grossly abused to such an extent, that i wouldnt be surprised to see it nearly nullified in the resulting implosion of the Republican party that's effectively inevitable. You normally have to prove that the conduct was so egregious that they no longer qualify for any protection of their office.For part 1, good luck with that. Only a State AG can levy state charges like that, and in Texas, they definitely wont. For part 2, that depends on a jury. If I was on a jury, and i was presented with a scenario where a politician deliberately and willfully ignored what the majority of both domestic and foreign policy experts said to do, and knowing it would cause harm, for no appreciable gain, then yes, I would absolutely vote to convict.","title":"My heart breaks vs. no comment: Colin Allred, Ted Cruz react to Texas womans miscarriage death"},{"text":"Bummer","title":"Billboard Showing Kamala Harris Engaging in Sex Act Erected by Pro-Trump Company in Ohio"},{"text":"Yeah, Trump is publicly saying his supporters are garbage.
