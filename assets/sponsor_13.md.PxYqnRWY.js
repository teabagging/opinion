I do enjoy your rating system more than a lot of other fact check sites and articles.I still think there's room for improvement.  For instance you've only found 8 \\"true\\" things Harris has said?  Seems like you could find more than that from a single speech.  Even with Harris jumping in late we couldn't get more than 65 compared to over 1,000 for Trump.  Again the take away here for many is that Trump told the truth 36 times compared to only 8 for Harris.Also several of her half truths and lower ratings rely on taking Trump's word for on topics he's constantly lied about or flip flopped on.  For example, when Harris says Trump is going to repeal ACA, that doesn't seem like a half truth to me.  He already tried it once, he's flipped back and forth depending on the crowd about whether he wants to do it again and even when he says he won't, we'd be idiots to actually believe it.  Seems like a full truth to me.  Thanks again for your time!","title":"Were part of the PolitiFact team fact-checking the 2024 Election - Ask Us Anything!"},{"text":"Spoilers. They keep using that word. It does not mean what they think it means.They say the election is \\"being spoiled\\", when in fact they are simply *losing* it. Elections are an expression of the free market-place of ideas, and their ideas (and the candidate the supposedlly embodies them) are not selling to the electorate. As a direct result of the choices the dem party has made, many members of said electorate are choosing *someone else*, someone that they believe suits their own wishes and desires better than what the dems are offering.It is very simple. If your party runs an unelectable candidate, your party will lose. That is not because somebody \\"spoiled\\" it by running a better candidate- elections are *supposed* to select the better candidate, and **your candidate was not it**, in the opinion of the electorate as a whole. Period, full stop, end of statement.In the current instant, both facets of the Uniparty have decided, in their infinite wisdom, to run unelectable candidates. And because people have been trained to be frightened out of their wits of doing anything else (like vote for a third party), we will very likely end up saddled with one of them. This is not the fault of the third party or their candidate- it is because the Uniparty marketing departments have quite deliberately engendered a state of learned helplessness amongst the entire electorate; by very intentionally convincing people that they will all experience (something horrible) if the *other* Uniparty candidate wins.There is bullshit, and there is Bullshit, and there is **BULLSHIT**, and that conviction somehow manages to be all three. They are both Uniparty candidates. The \\"something horrible\\" will be essentially the same regardless of which one wins. No matter the outcome of the election, we run-of-the-mill citizens *will lose*.I do not consent to remaining in the Uniparty's carefully-groomed and preferred state of learned helplessness. I cannot abide *either* Uniparty candidate, and I therefore voted for Stein- and did so with a clear conscience. If more people did that, they might discover that they no longer need to be governed by the state of learned helplessness that has been foisted off upon us all. The current state of affairs will continue until enough people finally arrive upon the realization that the the blue shit sandwich and the red shit burrito *are not their only choices.* I've been participating this absurd process for 5+ decades, and it hasn't happened yet. This is the worst election of my lifetime by far, and it isn't happening now. I now know in my heart of hearts that it will not happen in my lifetime. And yet, I still bother voting, because that is all one can do. And when the quadrennial masturbationfest ends tomorrow, we'll start the ramp-up into an equally meaningless 2028- unless and until people finally awaken to the simple fact that voting against their own interests simply out of fear will always result in the same, sad outcome.We inevitably get the government that we, as a whole, deserve.

([These are also strategies that non-journalists can use in their search)](https://cor.inquirygroup.org/curriculum/). Well research a claim, the person/account who made it and see what pops up.?1. Who is behind the information?\\n2. What is the evidence?\\n3. What do other sources say??Very often, a simple search of a claim (Ex. [What did Trump do with the Affordable Care Act](https://www.google.com/search?q=What+did+Trump+do+with+the+Affordable+Care+Act&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=What+did+Trump+do+with+the+Affordable+Care+Act&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzMyOWowajGoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)) will pop up many news articles (or even fact-checks) that will give you the information you need. Very often, that information can point us fact-checkers toward the right sources and data to start writing a fact-check.?Something that an average person likely wouldnt do is then contact often 5+ experts from across the political spectrum to talk either over the phone or email and answer some specific questions about the information. Thats what we do at PolitiFact. That diversity of sources is key to getting a measured view of the issue.PolitiFact uses on-the-record interviews and publishes a list of sources with every fact-check. When possible, the list includes links to sources that are freely available, although some sources rely on paid subscriptions (Lexis Nexis, some subscriber-only news subscriptions).

United by shared values like ending genocide and war, a deep commitment to Black liberation, and the determination to build an alternative outside the corporate two-party system, the Vote Socialist campaign and the West/Abdullah campaign demonstrate unprecedented cooperation in the upcoming election.The Justice for All presidential campaign of Cornel West and Melina Abdullah, and the Party for Socialism and Liberations ticket of Claudia De la Cruz and Karina Garcia, have announced an agreement to cooperate in a number of states. The Claudia/Karina campaign is calling on its supporters to vote for West and Abdullah in Alaska. In turn, West/Abdullah are calling on supporters to vote for Claudia and Karina in Florida, Hawaii, New Mexico, Mississippi, and Tennessee.In Alaska the West/Abdullah campaign has ballot status but De la Cruz and Garcia do not, while De la Cruz and Garcia have status in Florida, Hawaii, New Mexico, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Because of undemocratic obstacles that third party candidates are subjected to that Democrats and Republicans are not, both campaigns have had to carry out massive petition-gathering efforts and then defend their ballot status in extensive and massively expensive court battles amid challenges brought by Democratic Party-affiliated lawyers. This agreement aims to maximize the ability of voters to send a clear message that they reject the twin parties of war, racism, and Wall Street. About the Party for Socialism and Liberation: Every injustice working people experience in society, boils down to the question of who has power. Under the current capitalist system, a tiny clique of rich bankers and CEOs have the power and will do anything to maintain it. We stand for socialism  a system where poor and working people hold political and economic power and use it to meet the needs of all people and to preserve the planet. A system that guarantees healthcare, education, childcare, housing and a living wage with union representation for all.Join us in the ongoing fight. This is about more than one election or one campaign. It takes building an independent political organization. We are in over 90 cities across the United States and count with  multinational and multigenerational leaders of key social movements engaged in the daily fight against exploitation and oppression and for the socialist reorganization of society.To learn more about the Vote Socialist campaign and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, visit votesocialist2024.com and pslweb.org.About the Justice for All Party:In an effort to directly confront the suppression of voter choice and participation by legacy political parties, Independent candidate for President of the United States, Dr. Cornel West, announced the establishment of the Justice For All Party (JFA). The party will primarily be utilized as a grassroots, people-powered vehicle to secure ballot access in specific states. Additionally, JFA will grow into a larger formation that galvanizes people-powered initiatives to promote transformational change beyond the 2024 election cycle. JFA provides a mechanism for our grassroots campaign to travel a path of least resistance that will require the fewest number of signatures to attain ballot access in states like California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina, Washington and the District of Columbia.To learn more about the West/Abdullah campaign and the Justice for All Party, visit cornelwest2024.com and justiceforallparty.org.","title":"Democracy Now surprisingly speaks to Socialist candidate Claudia de la Cruz.

But that should be the goal.Im in a purplish blue municipality and my daughter is in kindergarten. The school is quite well funded, our taxes are high. I have paid attention to her curriculum and I have so far not seen any signs of inappropriate topics.","title":"ELI5: Why are the New England States so reliably 'Blue' or 'Democratic'?"},{"text":"I have never written off Arizona.

As much as the two party system sucks, I think this might be one of the few times where it works to our advantage.If we were to split into multiple parties, I think Donald Trump would probably be prime minister until he dies. The Democrats would probably splinter into 3-5 different groups. The Republicans might do the same, but I have to imagine the lion's share would stay with Trump and he would have the largest party.It seems to me that the multi party system works best when you have a culture where the parties are expected to work together. Everyone understands it is unlikely they will get a majority, so they have to figure out how to build a coalition and compromise.We don't have that. If we were to split, I think the two likely scenarios are we end up like Israel, where Netanyahu has been PM for 17 years despite never even getting 30% of the vote, or we end up like Bulgaria where there is a real possibility they're about to have their eighth election in four years because no one wins a majority and no one can manage to form a coalition.I would think Trump would get 30-35%. He may never get 50% but what he has is very, very solid.","title":"I am an Arab American voting for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Better let all those dudes in prison know.Especially the proud boys, since they're in prison for seditious conspiracy, I'll bet they'll love to find this \\"evidence\\" to free them of their actions.","title":"Evidence January 6th was orchestrated by the Democratic Party."},{"text":"Meanwhile we got Epstein talking about Trump fucking his friends' wives.","title":"Teary-Eyed John Oliver Begs Reluctant Voters to Back Kamala Harris"},{"text":"The DNC absolutely did NOT want Bernie to be prez, he's not nearly enough a loyal business/wealthy sycophant for them.

Trump, a former president, has no place in American politics and certainly no place leading the United States of America as its 47th president. We would make this assertion no matter whom he is running against.\\" The newspaper's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, whom it described as \\"the only choice in 2024,\\" offered an enthusiastic show of support for the vice president but largely served as a strong reprimand of the former president. It described Trump as a divisive figure promoting an \\"out-of-control, disgusting, hate-filled rhetoric\\" and a \\"man who belittles women,\\" among other things. The article made a direct appeal to Staten Island voters, a majority of whom support Trump in his bid for the White House. While New York City, the former president's hometown, remains solidly blue and is expected to vote for Harris on November 5, Staten Island is an exception, as it favored Trump in the past two election cycles. In 2020, SILive.com reported, Trump received 110,094 votes on Staten Island against Joe Biden's 67,223. In 2016, ABC7 NY reported, Trump received 57 percent of the vote on Staten Island against Hillary Clinton's 40 percent. Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx overwhelmingly voted for Biden four years ago and for Clinton in 2016. At the state level, Biden won New York with 61 percent of the vote against Trump's 38 percent in 2020, while Clinton won it with 59 percent of the vote against Trump's 37 percent in 2016. Newsweek contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment by email outside normal working hours. Staten Island's feelings toward Trump have hardly changed during the Biden administration. SILive.com reported that hundreds of people turned out for the Staten Island GOP's Triumph rally on Saturday to show support for Trump's candidacy. \\"We understand a significant portion of conservative-leaning Staten Island will disagree, some vehemently, in support of her opponent,\\" the Staten Island Advance/SILive.com's editorial said, before listing reasons that Harris should be the next U.S. president. \\"Kamala Harris sees America's future as bright and optimistic, full of promise of what an America pulling together can be. Donald Trump sees America as a dark place, a place beset with soul-crushing, mind-bending issuesissues he claims only he can fix,\\" the article said. \\"In this election, Kamala Harris is the only hope to save America from a continuation of the chaos we saw in Trump's first four years, and indeed, in the four years that followed as Trump continued to sow hatred and divisiveness,\\" the editorial continued, adding, \\"If our goal is a better, kinder America, an America where we are not afraid to be ourselves, Kamala Harris is that alternative.\\"","title":"Donald Trump's Hometown Stronghold Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Not people who arent already voting for Kamala","title":"NBC accused of plot against Donald Trump as Kamala Harris' SNL appearance 'violates Equal Time rule'"},{"text":"I think you are missing the point.

They also were clear that they hoped that Republicans who vowed to respect the outcome of the election were telling the truth, and that was a far preferable outcome to a constitutional crisis.

Universities figured out that if they flunked those students out, the sweet, sweet government money stopped.  So they first created remedial courses, and when the students proved they were incapable of passing even those, they dumbed down the curriculum overall and made attendance optional, so even Jimmy, who can't read, can't do basic math, and can barely spell his own name, can graduate - with $50k in debt, and no useful skills on which to get a job.In rides government to the rescue!

Evidence - the 1% pulled Biden from last place in the 2016 primaries and anointed him the next president a week later. In 2024, they were able to anoint Harris in less than 24 hours.Evidence - During the COVID pandemic, BOTH political parties had to give trillions of taxpayer dollars to the 1% (money they did not need!) just to get subsistence level monies into the hands of the 99% of Americans (who were going to die otherwise). No other civilized nation had this problem, which was why they were able to come out of Covid with far less national debt than the USA did. The same goes for tax breaks (lion's share goes to the billionaires who don't need it while what's left of the American middle class gets scraps that conveniently expire after the current administration's term is over, ahem).I could go on and on. The bottom line is that the only thing that has changed is your level of utter denial. You think it's a bad thing for establishment Republicans to support a candidate If they had changed their positions to match liberal values, great! But they didn't.

Not with the red herring about CU. But the fact that congress can address this anytime they want...already SCOTUS approved...Has she addressed single payer/universal health care? No. In fact, she's moved *away* from Medicare for All since she became VP. \\nThat's unsurprising since she couldn't have those positions anymore and get tapped by the 1% for the White House.Do any of her stances differ from what the majority of the American people want (like Abortion, etc.)? Or is she just being a good politician during an election, telling people what they want to hear to get elected? That just means they are compromising with the left.That just means they are compromising with the left.They are not.

Do you?!The climate bill alone proves that. Ignoring that it's meaningless and ineffective at this point, this is also something the majority of Americans support...and something the Republicans (pre-MAGA or now) have NEVER voted in favor of. I wonder if they will change their mind if the keep control of the Senate... pro-union people in the NLRBWho have accomplished nothing. This is yet another free toss away to people like you who fall for meaningless statements instead of concrete action.antitrust enforcers in the FTCSee above. Have they accomplished anything?

Then why did you spend all of this time pretending I haven't been 100% correct about all of this?he's not doing that anymoreOh, I see. Now, ask yourself, why did the 1% get rid of Joe again?And the new version of Biden will be replaced by someone better.Slightly better than Biden is still a corporatist stooge. Watch what actually happens over the next four years and see if ANY of the key LIBERAL agenda items (not commonly agreed upon centrist stuff) are addressed with anything but words.I predict, since Kamala had to make a deal with the 1% to get the presidency handed to her without any of our input AND she will want an 8 year term instead of just a 4 year term, nothing that Bernie Sanders or AOC or any progressive has been running on for over 40 years will get accomplished...EVEN if the Dems clean sweep the House, Senate, and White House.Let's see which of us is proven right, shall we?PS No matter what, a sane Harris is better than an insane Trump, so make sure you VOTE or have voted anyone and everyone.","title":"Harris Represents the New Democratic Party and the Future"},{"text":"Just in case there's anyone still undecided . . .","title":"How Kamala Harris Economic Plan Would Protect Children From Harm"},{"text":"So she is threatening him?","title":"Kremlin warns Trump 'may face JFK-style assassination' if he tries to end war."},{"text":"I considered this, but ended up doing the opposite lol","title":"How we feeling, neolibs?"},{"text":"As long as Fox News/OAN and Social media can create a fake version of the Democratic party for people to be very afraid of it is going to be difficult to recover.

That's why it confounds me when people like OP seem to think that going to school will turn everyone into socially capable, well-educated adults. Sure, some kids turn out that way, but others are so miserable they end up killing themselves (or others). Some homeschooling families are repressive and abusive, and others are happy and loving and do a great job of encouraging their kids to grow and learn. I know for sure that school was not the right environment for my older son. My younger son seems to be doing fine with it, after some initial bumps in the road.

She will never be held accountable for her actions, and she's not in any position to win where if it costs her votes it doesn't really matter because her goal isn't to win it's to play spoiler. For Donald Trump, it's easy for him to support Israel blindly. But for Kamala Harris, supporting a Ceasefire comes with real political risk. And doing so has had her attacked on all sides. From the right who think she's too harsh on Israel, from the Left who thinks she's not doing enough. Agreeing to stop sending weapons to Israel is not an immediate victory for Harris. She has to carefully consider all sides, and in doing so despite coming to the conclusion that we need a ceasefire (which is the correct conclusion) she gets punished for it for not agreeing with the method by which to reach said ceasefire (and as the author of the piece said, one that does NOT guarantee a ceasefire, and one that her opponent will never support anyway and her opponent doesn't see Palestinians as people)","title":"I am an Arab American voting for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"No, thanks.","title":"Meet the conservative women who are keeping their votes for Kamala Harris a secret"},{"text":"was in forest city iowa 2 months ago for work. 0 trump signs.","title":"Iowa Poll: Democrats are preferred over Republicans in 2 of 4 congressional districts"},{"text":"99% bots","title":"Has anyone else noticed that almost every Twitter/X post from someone voting for Harris is filled with MAGA comments?"},{"text":"complete and utter failure of the media this cycle. the right is constantly pointing fingers at left leaning celebrities and politicians because of diddy and epstein (trump is pictured 10s of times with each of them). but again, trump could stand in the middle of 5th avenue and shoot somebody and he wouldnt lose supporters, so does it really even matter?","title":"If this happened to a democrat it would destroy their career (rightfully so)"},{"text":"It was an invite only rally and Hillary Clinton was supposed to also be there, with Kamala","title":"??

I'm pretty sure powerfully wealthy predators don't want peasant kids being well-informed fighters against this worldwide corrupt system. China is exploiting black child slaves that mine cobalt for making technologies that enrich powerfully wealthy white men in wealthier countries. The global economy is based on white supremacy, patriarchy, colonialism, weaponized inequality, and grooming lower-class kids into becoming complicit workers for this morally bankrupt profit system. It's much harder to find ethically sourced products. So, I don't think most kids are getting the best social environment anywhere.

Obviously no one liked inflation, but the average small to medium size business owner that has voted R since the Reagan administration has enough brain power to understand that the economic sky isn't falling *and* what a universal tariff would do to their business. Even if the Biden administration was more progressive than a lot of traditional Republican voters and some of the members of this sub would have liked, you can't argue that the economy is in a pretty good spot.

Yet the decision this year is quite simple, the choice quite clear. Donald J. Trump, a former president, has no place in American politics and certainly no place leading the United States of America as its 47th president. Vice President Kamala Harris is the only choice in 2024, and the Advance/SILive.com endorses her enthusiastically and without hesitation. It is essential to elect a candidate who we can respect, a candidate who respects the people they will lead, a candidate who respects our global allies. Donald Trump is none of that. He has been called crude, vulgar, unhinged, and delusional. All of which Donald Trump is. John F. Kennedy, when elected, told America the torch was being passed to a new generation. It is time to pass that torch again, keeping it from a man who peddles hatred, who threatens his fellow citizens, who disparages anyone who has the temerity to disagree with him, who is so mercurial in his thought process C if there is a thought process C that no one knows what he might do next.Election Day is tomorrow everyone, it's time to turn the page on Donald Trump.","title":"Donald Trump's Hometown Stronghold Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"....sirDo you think abusers give a shit that their spouse is afraid of them?They're already not going to respect her autonomy and decision.

A woman who wanted to stay home and care for her family, and thought when younger she was marrying a great man for herself, may as she grows older and has children start to have serious concerns and find she is very different from her husband in ways that matter a lot to her.Now, if the husband is a decent man, they can have a discussion about both of their concerns, either reach a compromise or disagree but support each other, or decide to part ways with irreconcilable differences but mutual respect, agreeing to share time with the children if there are any.But there is the issue of her lack of income.  Maybe theres some money set aside and she can go back to school.  Maybe her family is supportive and will help out.But usually not.  The divorce is a shame on her family, they try to convince her to stay in the marriage, they do not offer to help her start anew.If the marriage is abusive, and the wife has no secondary education to fall back on, and no one to help her get away safely, she could flee on her own, but if there are young children involved she wont want to put them in peril.Shes stuck.  Its hard to remain and its terrifying to leave.  *just get along, at least til the kids are grown and can fend for themselves*.Ive seen it many times.My mom was raised very religious.  She married a man from a good family, but that man was an abusive psychopath.  Hed beat her up, the cops would haul him away for the night, then hed be back with promises to her and me that he would change.  A week or so later, hed be back to smashing windows and her face.Her parents told her to stay and pray, it was her fault the marriage wasnt working.  She stayed, she prayed.  Then one night after he beat her up again, she saw me hiding behind a chair (he never hit me), in that moment it struck her how I was being affected, and she was done with it.Her cousin said lets move several states away, tomorrow.

The whole point of the rule is so you can't promote one candidate over another more often - how would that make sense if it was okay to not have the other candidates on because they were on 4 or 8 years ago?Lorne did say in the beginning of October that he didn't want any candidates on because he'd have to worry about inviting 3rd party candidates, etc, and presumably just didn't want to bother.

I mean you can just not care if they're not following an equal time rule, I don't care if you care or not, but defending it with someone being on forever ago doesn't make sense.

They're not the extremists the deployed Lenin Bros claim they are, but I've found that what they always actually call for are high-density apartment buildings in important population, government, and business hubs, which is actually efficient and logical.My research on the subject has led to me to a few cases which prove that there's a conspiracy against residential high-rise apartments, as they are so successful at providing housing for everybody that they cause rents to plummet. The landlords hate this so rigged every city government across America to have the construction approval departments come up with excuses to ban residential high-rise apartments.So this is what's actually happening. All landlords across America, and probably throughout the western world, are actively conspiring to prevent the large-scale, economy-of-scale, clusters of high-rise apartments, which lead to very low cost housing units for Americans.The real-estate industry, including both developers and sellers, are also in on this because prices for houses are higher when apartments cost more.It's a major conspiracy and nobody is brave enough to expose it. This \\"NIMBY\\" stuff is all just a distraction run by the real-estate tycoons to scapegoat the general public, keep us divided against each other, and only build a minimal number of housing units and in a very sloppy way. These real-estate tycoons who do the building and selling don't live anywhere near these victim neighborhoods, but in very expensive gated communities with strict government regulations about what's permitted in the area, and cops who are paid to harass anybody who doesn't belong in the area.All of you who fell for this NIMBY stuff are suckers who are being puppeteered by America's wealthiest and powerful real estate tycoons and property owners, who are artifically inflating housing prices and only offering to slightly lower prices, though that doesn't actually happen as they then laugh at you suckers, do a whole lot of advertising in Europe and the Middle East to buy and hold American housing property, thus pushing all the prices back up again.You just keep getting suckered, again and again.","title":"Masterclass in trolling NIMBY Democrats - Massachusetts residents claim theyre being trolled with fake Harris postcards saying migrant family moving in"},{"text":"  I originally readHow about some real proof","title":"I'm not from the US but I was wanting to know exactly how much Kamala helped reduce black incarceration and noticed something strange; irregardless of the reduction in the past decade Black people, at 6% of the state population, have consistently stayed at 27-28% of incarcerated."},{"text":"Why does it look like this was before the meeting started..","title":"??

Centrism is why nothing ever gets doneThe \\"centrist\\" (really just \\"liberal rather than progressive\\") Democratic establishment regulated the financial industry, passed a major stimulus to prevent economic collapse, regulated against hate crimes and for women's equal pay, expanded low income subsidies for college students, enacted a major nuclear deal with Iran, and massively expanded healthcare with a huge liberal healthcare reform under Obama, and then passed a massive stimulus that led a bottom up recovery, a major infrastructure investment, the largest climate spending in US history, expanded healthcare support, reformed prescription drugs, and enacted a corporate minimum tax under Biden. **The idea that \\"nothing ever gets done\\" is just completely and miserably ignorant of reality**The progressive insistence that our many wins actually are \\"nothing\\" is a big reason why so many of us in the democratic voter base dislike the progressive wing so much and will continue to vote against them. We value these actual policy wins more than we value pie in the sky rhetoric and the attitude of \\"it's never good enough and we cannot ever be satisfied\\"Just look at Biden with Garland and his \\"good friend\\" Mitch and refusal to be aggressive toward magaBiden had no power to do anything more aggressive other than rhetoric. The president isn't a dictator and can't just force Congress to do what it doesn't want to do. And Biden's moderation is what allowed various bipartisan wins like infrastructure, the chips act, the act defending gay marriage, the electoral vote count reform act, the post office reform, the act sanctioning Chinese slave labor in occupied East Turkestan, the act banning forced arbitration for sexual misconduct, gun control, veterans healthcare expansion, and more. Would you really rather have impotent rhetoric yelling more at the GOP, than get those material wins?Centrists could work out deals or something with progressives or somethingWhy on earth would that ever happen?Power lies in the center. The reality is, the party establishment is way more liberal than the far left gives it credit for - but voters aren't electing majorities that allow liberals to govern without needing support from people well to the right of them. That's why it's so silly to think that campaigning on progressive stuff could win - Dems can't even get majorities where the decisive 50th senator is a relatively liberal guy like Angus King, Mark Warner, Tom Carper or such, let alone a Bernie Sanders. Dems **have no choice** but to rely on support from folks like Joe Lieberman or Joe Manchin even in the few times they get trifectas at all, and there's literally no way to force those guys to do anything more than what they want. You can't force someone like that to do more than what they want, and you can't get progressive majorities elected to just ignore them. So all you'll ever get are the scraps the Manchins wi allow, or perhaps the much bigger \\"scraps\\" that Tester will allow (if he wins and the Dems get a trifecta this year), there is simply no pathway for progressives to ever get more than what the 50th democrat wantsbut they would rather buddy up with Liz and do a little waltz bring the democratic party to the same values as the pre-maga Republicans.God this is just nonsense. The Cheneys endorsed Harris without the Dems needing to make concessions. Harris, despite the progressive smears and lies, is still running in a very liberal platform. It's like the left cares more about aesthetics than policy I hate this damn two-party system we have. There is no representation for me here.The problem isn't the two party system. America is just a center right country. If we had proportional representation, progressives would get a somewhat larger of folks elected into Congress, but they wouldn't be any more powerful, because power would still lie in the middle, and the Democrats wouldn't be any more likely to compromise a single inch with a progressive movement that would no longer even have the simple binds of being in the same party and sharing that reluctant camaraderie. The progressive movement would just be left to either fall in line and vote for the democratic policy's more moderate policies without getting any concessions, or it would be left to rot in its own radical corner and be ostracized People here call progressives \\"the radical left Democrat version of maga'. Yes, wanting better social safety nets and affordable college and healthcare is exactly the same as fascists that are literally trying to overthrow the government and end our democracy.The democratic establishment wants **better social safety nets** and **affordable college and healthcare**The progressive movement insists that **the progressive purist proposals** for safety nets, affordable college and healthcare are the **only acceptable outcomes**. The progressive movement believes it has a monopoly on good ideas Maybe I will just write somebody in on my ballot - that tan suit guy, he was pretty cool. Make Dijon Great AgainIf you want to force the democrats to move to the right even more, then go for it.

When the rapper GloRilla bounded onstage on Friday night, for one ear-splitting moment, it might have been easy to forget the thousands of screaming fans singing her lyrics and recording her performance were actually assembled for a political rally.But the stage  festooned with flags and Vice President Kamala Harriss campaign mantra of freedom  erased any ambiguity. So did GloRillas sign-off when she finished her three-song set.Make sure yall go out and vooooote, the Memphis rapper shouted to the crowd.For Harris campaign, this scene in a Milwaukee-area event hall was far from an outlier. In the closing stretch of this campaign, a typical rally for the vice president features not just local officials and down ballot Democrats but an array of musicians and performers, from global A-listers and established favorites to buzzy up-and-coming artists.The biggest names have been called in not to play the hits but to make the case for Harris. In Wisconsin on Friday, for instance, Cardi B took the stage to her breakout Bodak Yellow, but took the mic to explain why she was supporting Harris.I wasnt gonna vote, the New York hip-hop star told supporters, who held hundreds of phones in the air, recording her speech. But Kamala Harris joining the race, she changed my mind completely.Democrats have long called in celebrities to juice the energy and appeal of their campaigns. But perhaps no candidate has done it as extensively  or, more importantly, as intentionally as Harris has against Donald Trump.Theyve been very strategic, said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who served as Hillary Clintons 2016 spokesperson and who is helping to craft the pro-Harris camps strategy for cultivating social media influencers.Drawing on a long list of notables who are both alarmed by a Trump return and excited by the prospect of a Black female president, the Harris team has deployed figures with specific appeal to components of the wide-ranging Democratic political coalition.The rally in the Milwaukee area  a hub of Black votes in the key swing state  had emerging hip-hop artists on hand. Two days before, Harris rallied to the west, in the college town of Madison, where students packed an arena and heard folk rock band Mumford and Sons as well as singer Gracie Abrams, a Gen-Z favorite who recently opened for Taylor Swift on tour.Other recent Harris rallies have seemed like mini-festivals, from an Atlanta event on Saturday featuring rap legend 2 Chainz to a Houston event where Willie Nelson performed and Beyonce spoke.The overall strategy is less to pack arenas and more to generate moments and messages that reach the right voters  one tailored to the atomized environment of social media, where influencers and famous figures are increasingly viewed as legitimate news sources.Snippets of star-studded rallies can spread organically through attendees or media sharing their own video. The more powerful weapon is when Harriss special guests post about their campaign activity to platforms where they have massive followings.Cardi B, for instance, posted a photo of her all-white outfit for the Wisconsin rally, and a message, to her 165 million Instagram followers. We have to make a change on Tuesday and I know shes the one to take us there, she wrote.In the closing weeks of a fiercely contested race, gaining even a small edge is imperative for each campaign. If a celebrity speech or performance can generate buzz that leads to just a few thousand extra votes, the impact on the outcome of the race could be disproportionately high.Given Hollywood and the entertainment industrys liberal bent, Trump was always going to have a hard time matching Harriss star wattage. A familiar and small roster of conservative entertainers, like Jon Voight and Kid Rock, remain the most prominent names routinely broadcasting their support for Trump.In 2024, Trumps team has sought to expand the tent, elevating rappers, like Waka Flocka Flame, and athletes, like former Pittsburgh Steelers player LeVeon Bell, to underscore what they hope is the former presidents increased appeal to Black voters. But cracks have emerged in that effort: rapper Sexyy Red, who endorsed Trump last year, revealed this week she voted for Harris because of reproductive rights  though she framed the issue more coarsely in a social media post.For Harris, the star-studded rallies are just one way stars are being used. On Saturday, the pop singer Olivia Rodrigo posted an Instagram video of her conversation with Hadley Duvall, a childhood rape survivor from Kentucky who has become a powerful advocate for abortion rights.Stories like Hadleys are exactly why this election is so important, Rodrigo wrote in the post?to her over 38 million followers, urging followers to vote for Harris and directing them to a website where they can make a plan to vote.","title":"Democrats have long attracted celebrity support, but no one has deployed them quite like this"},{"text":"Nobody knows anything, and I'll be glad when nobody is trying to manipulate my emotions by claiming they do.

My wife went to public school for all of elementary, middle, and high school. So we've been able to compare notes on how our educations differed.The only subjects where she received a better education than me were foreign languages and sex ed. My education in the subjects of mathematics, science, history, music, and religion was far more extensive and rigorous than what the local public school offered. In college every science class I took was just review of what I'd already learned in high school. I can remember my public schooled peers struggling in General Physics I while I only ever thought about the class outside of lectures and labs for the 15 minutes per week it took me to do the homework and ended up with a final grade of 100% in the class (because it was far easier than the physics classes I took in high school). I minored in math and so I did end up taking some math classes that covered content my homeschooling did not, but many of the math classes I took in my first couple semester were review. I will admit that I was not socialized as much as my public schooled peers were. But I was still socialized a sufficient amount. There were 3 other kids that were homeschooled with me (my brother + two of our friends) and so we would all meet together every day to do some of our learning together. I also convinced the local high school to allow me to take band and choir without taking any other classes and to only come in 3 times per week (the band director was in support of anything that got my brother and I in his band since we were the only high schoolers in the county who could play low brass instruments). So I socialized with  students at the public school during those classes. I was also heavily involved with our local church and so hung out with other kids from church several times each week. TL;DR Homeschooling provided a far more rigorous education for me than public school would have and made college a breeze. The only lasting damage I have from being homeschooled is that I still can't speak Spanish.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Hunters Biden laptop and the CIA hiding the info from public media would like to speak to you","title":"CMV: Kamala will win the electoral college vote, Trump will win the popular vote."},{"text":"Top of my head I want to say 9 points.

Even if Trump had had the worst FP ever, this does not make Biden garbage FP worth defending with the amount of partisanship that has been seen here. It especially does not warrant lying about the article by claiming that they're advocating for appeasement with Russia, when they are in fact complaining about the weakness and lack of direction with which Biden has conducted his FP and the terrible consequences it has had for Ukrainians (among others).Yet both outright lies about the content of the article and bad faith argument to defend Biden's inaction are at the top of the page, because this sub has turned insanely partisan and would rather upvote lies than pop their own bubble.Now if I were to strongman the article, their entire point was that Trump willingness to strike is what avoided greater escalation. His measured and tactical use of US military might to intimidate and bully countries into submission, as well as his otherwise completely unhinged and very thin-skinned character, made the usual suspects wary of stirring shit with the US that Trump could take personally.  \\n \\\\- Had the US struck Iran's allies or top generals in retaliation for their sending weapons to Russia, they might have thought twice.   \\n \\\\- Had Biden deployed troops in Ukraine before the war, or authorized the sending of additional military equipment this could have deterred Russia.   \\n \\\\- Had Biden authorized Ukraine to strike into Russia with allied weapons, this would have made Putin reconsider his position.   \\n \\\\- Had he allowed the sending of F16 and AAM, Ukrainian troops might have been able to hold against the recent attacks against a Russian army devoid of their FAB's  \\n \\\\- Had he authorized NATO allies to shoot Russian airplanes violating their airspace, or allowed neighbouring countries to ensure air-defence over the Ukrainian border, we would also have seen a shift in Moscow attitude towards negotiations.  \\n \\\\- Had he unlocked the range of the provided Ballistic missiles when N.Korea provided ICBM in violations of international treaties, Russia might have reconsidered trading garbage N.Korean ICBM against full-range HIMARS.Biden's attitude has shown the Kremlin that the White House did not intend to get involved in Ukraine, this in turn emboldened Russians to continue the war because they knew that no big move from the US would change their prospects of victory. If Biden had used his considerable powers to either directly respond, or allow NATO or allies to respond to Russia's repeated escalations, Putin would already be trying to negotiate. Instead he let Russia get ahead, every transgression or escalation from Russia was tolerated, allowing Russia to slowly strengthen their positions as Ukrainian were begging for the US to allow them to respond in kind.  \\nThe article argues that this unwillingness to set out clear geopolitical objectives and use the considerable powers at his disposal to ensure world peace, is what allowed war to foster.Speak softly and carry a big stick, only works if one is willing to use it, and Biden showed the world that he wouldn't, as a result the world simply stopped listening.","title":"The biggest winner from the Biden administrations foreign policy has been China, say Michael Waltz and Matthew Kroenig"},{"text":"Im not ?? youre ?? \\n??","title":"I Need to Say a Big Thank You Before This is All Over"},{"text":"if a politician chooses to continue funding a genocide, and people vote for them,  they are voting for a genocide. there is nothing that Harris can do after the elections that she cant do now. to continue to believe it isnt so is living in fantasy land.","title":"Ann Selzer predicts a shock win for Kamala Harris in Iowa C heres why its a big deal"},{"text":"This isnt a Conspiracy.

If you don't drink, are trying to recover from alcoholism, or have bad experiences with alcohol you're pretty shit outa luck. If there's something fun to do in des moines, it's also attached to a bar or brewery. Bands and other traveling entertainment almost never go to iowa when the twin cities and Chicago are nearby to go to instead.\\nDoctors are aweful in iowa. Especially for mental health, which is important for a lot of young folks (and should be for everyone.) The amount of medical malpractice I've dealt with before the age of 20 is actually insane. I would be terrified to be reliant on doctors in iowa (or anywhere for that matter, but especially iowa)\\nAnd like you said, education is bad. My college course was practically on life support by the time I left. All the teachers were about to retire. They offered ME a job teaching when I was just graduating and had no work experience in the field at all. And thats not even mentioning my highschool experience. I would never raise a kid in iowa cause of the education problem alone.\\nThe only real upside i see in iowa as someone who's part of its brain drain problem, is that it's cheap. But it's cheap for a reason.","title":"Iowa Poll: Democrats are preferred over Republicans in 2 of 4 congressional districts"},{"text":"Now j lo warns us about Trump but don't warn anyone about pditty.

Those teachers are being replaced with desperate people without degrees making less than 40k a year and with untenably large classroom sizes. The system is already breaking in real time. Any parents with means are pulling out because academically the outcomes are objectively better.  Socially, thats yet to be seen.

Somethings changed throughout the years and how human relations evolved like how you described the loyalship in love relationships but still it's the same and it evolved to a better condition: stick to what you promised.Every bit of your relationship works with loyalship, or lack of it. And it is a double way. It is not that employees are less loyal and this is good, it is that employers became less loyal before, the outcome is the rest of us losing trust as well. It is never good to lose trust. One of the best metrics to know if a country is doing good is the trust in the government/country.

Courting their approval at the expense of securing large numbers in the centre ground and swing voters is  a calculated risk she isnt taking. The presumption is that with these activists she doesnt win, but if she gets enough middle ground swing voters she might win. She could do what Trump and other popularist autocrats do, say she for something and say she is against it. Then weave some bollocks narrative to justify the contradiction. But the press would rip her apart, they dont rip him apart because its insanity they are caught up in.

I was homeschooled through most of middle school. The public school in my district was terrible, and the local private schools were just as bad AND cost prohibitive. My mom registered with a national homeschooling group that provided curriculum, testing, and (most importantly in the grand old argument about socialization), networking. We were connected to other homeschoolers to do field trips, take parks and rec classes together, offer tutoring for subjects where parents were weaker. My mom did math tutoring for several homeschool kids in our area because their parents didn't feel as confident with that subject. I was in girl scouts, went to the library for kids book readings and activities, and on and on. I was a kid that got in trouble for talking in school. I was advanced and was not given the option of harder materials or grade skipping (which can cause a lot of social peer issues). I was isolated from my peers because I was a \\"distraction\\" for trying to help the kids around me with schoolwork. My socialization was being stunted BY the school by making me a pariah for being a little ahead of everyone. Homeschooling let me learn at my pace, offered plenty of socialization where I wasn't punished, and had me over prepared for high school. I was a straight A students in high school and fit into many different peer groups. I wasn't the queen bee, but I had a lot of different types of friends instead of just being in a clique.*Edited to add this was in the late 80's/early 90's. We didn't have the internet for joining groups. Or email for planning things. We had phone trees, snail mail, and calendar planning to set schedules well in advance. It is even easier now to connect and share resources.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"I've seen Russia experts say that the Nordstream was not for economic reasonsChatham House\\"And finally, Nord Stream 2. My views on Nord Stream 2 are completely uncontroversial. I think it is a project which is entirely political, has no basis in economic reality whatsoever, and is just one of the many ways in which Russia seeks to increase its leverage, over its neighbouring states, by collaborating with whatever interests it can find in Europe to further its aims.\\".Talk about strange ways to argue!uh people want natural gas, and, uh, they want it cheap.let's see what others say\\"Construction on the pipeline began in 2018 but it has been delayed due to protracted legal battles and the imposition of US sanctions against companies working on the project in 2019. After nearly five years, and at a reported cost of $11 billion, the pipeline was eventually finished in September 2021. \\"\\"Opposition to the pipeline has been fierce. Russia and Germanys longstanding view has been that the pipeline is a purely economic project. However, the US, UK and the EU have all expressed concerns over its geopolitical implications\\"\\"Critics view the pipeline as a political project of the Kremlin and part of a broader geopolitical strategy to undermine the West by increasing European reliance on Russian gas supplies and potentially giving Russia leverage over security of supply.\\"\\"Nord Stream 2 has implications for Ukraine. Although not a huge importer of Russian gas, Ukraine is a major transit country of current Russian gas pipelines into Europe. Transit fees are thought to account for almost 3% of Ukraines GDP, which will bring an expected revenue of $2-3 billion annually over the next five years.\\"Congressional ReportsNord Stream 2 lies alongside the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, in operation since 2011. Nord Stream 2 (consisting of two lines) would double the total capacity of the Nord Stream system from 55 billion cubic meters (BCM) to 110 BCM per year. The pipeline is owned by the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom. About half the cost was reportedly financed by five European companies: Engie,OMV, Shell, Uniper, and Wintershall.Although the European Union (EU) has articulated an ambitious energy diversification strategy, some European governments have not reduced dependence on Russian gas, which accounted for about 40% of EU natural gas imports in 2021. Factors behind reliance on Russian supply include diminishing European gas supplies, commitments to reduce coal use, Russian investments in European infrastructure, and prior perceptions of Russia as a reliable supplierNot Economic?  \\nWelcome to to weirdsville","title":"It's pretty gross to think about what the democratic establishment is going to take away from this election if Kamala wins"},{"text":"Endless wars!

Loyalty gives us stability and a deeper sense of trust, which is valuable in a society where everything often feels temporary. For example, in relationships, loyalty isnt just about dont cheat; its about building real trust and sticking together through tough times. Even in jobs, loyaltywhen its mutualcan create a healthier work environment and foster teamwork, which benefits everyone.Loyalty also brings a sense of identity and belonging. Family loyalty isnt about tolerating toxic situations; its about honoring shared history and staying connected in meaningful ways. The same goes for patriotism. Sure, people are more critical of their countries, but that doesnt mean they dont careit just means loyalty is expressed through constructive criticism rather than blind allegiance.And honestly, loyalty helps build trust in a world thats becoming more transactional. When people choose to stick with a brand or a political party, its often because they believe in a bigger cause or want consistency, not because theyre being pandered to. Loyalty allows us to invest in something beyond ourselves, like supporting ethical brands or giving back to communities. Without it, we risk living in a society thats all about individual gain, with fewer people willing to work toward a common good.So yeah, loyalty might be less about blind loyalty these days, but the commitment, trust, and mutual support it fosters are still key. Otherwise, were left with shallow connections, more division, and less resilience in both personal relationships and society as a whole.","title":"CMV: Loyalty is not very important in the modern world, and thats a good thing"},{"text":"I dont think its about these men trying to control or decide who the women vote for.

Where I lived the closest town with a school was an hour away, dirt roads all the way. I lived rural, and so did everyone else at my school. That just wasn't feasible for us, and everyone else at my school was the same. But it was different to the kind of stories I hear from other countries. I still had a teacher for my year level, and she would teach one lesson per subject a week through either radio or Web lessons, back before zoom teaching was cool. And we had set content to learn and set assessments to take. And we would do all our work, and then mail it back to the school, where it would get marked and returned. They even mailed books from the library. On top of this, we would have about three events a year where we had the opertunity to come into the school, where we had normal day long lessons and play opertunites etc. I think that our version of home schooling, while not ideal, is vitally necessary for a) rural kids who can't get to a mainstream school or b) are not suited to mainstream for other reasons such as disability.I would not have been able to have an eduction without it, and as someone who has multiple diagnoses that make academic life harder for me, this format allowed me to go at my own pace and actually learn the foundational knowledge primary school was supposed to provide.Now I won't say it wS perfect I agree that socially I lagged behind because of it (but I am also autistic so), and there were some areas I struggled to learn or unsmderstand due to the format. The transition to highschool where I went to boarding school was fucking rough, and I had to adapt to an enterly different style of learning.

Less regulations, less red tape, more choice, more freedom is the way to go. The bigger the government, the more money they need to run it. Look where we are right now! Where do they get that money?

In recent years of anti-feminist anti-woke sentiment spreading across the internet we've seen a revival of Limbaugh-like rhetoric, reinforced by man-splainer-in-chief Jordan Peterson and his incel followers. We've seen backlash from the #meToo movement \\"going too far\\", while putting our second alleged rapist on the Supreme Court. Half of America is seriously considering putting a man who is an adjudicated sexual assault perpetrator back in The White House.Vice President Harris has somewhere between a 15 and a 20 point lead on Donald Trump among women voters. Conversely he has almost the same margin among male voters. This election, more than anything else, is divided along gender lines. The majority of male voters in America are literally stripping the women in their lives of basic human rights and basic freedoms, and as this article makes clear they won't stop at reproductive rights. Women are out there hiding their votes from their husbands and employers for fear of reprisals. This *is* Gilead folks, this *is* already a dystopian nightmare for American women.If you're a man and you have any woman in your life that you care about, take a moment to consider your position. Is your wife really betraying you by voting for the person she most believes should be president? Or are you betraying her and the entire American way of life if you pressure her into voting for someone she doesn't want to lead the country?","title":"Meet the conservative women who are keeping their votes for Kamala Harris a secret"},{"text":"Its twitter.

They are likely correct in their assessment.\\n * Democratic policy is likely to involve a slow, careful, carrot-and-stick approach to Israel, threatening them with sanctions while offering the carrot of US-backed normalisation of relations with Israel's neighbours (that is to say, offering incentives for said neighbours to normalise relations). It won't be fast or radical, but it may work.\\n * By contrast, a Republican victory is likely to see the US *de facto* outright encourage further ethnic cleansing and cultural erasure of the Palestinian people.\\n * The Israeli right are desperately hoping for a Republican victory, which will let them act with relative impunity.\\n * A Democratic victory in the US means a greater likelihood of Israeli atrocities winding down, whereas a Trump victory will likely see escalation.\\n * There are no other realistic scenarios but a Democratic or Republican victory.\\nIt follows from these points that anyone who is actually serious about using their vote to aid the Palestinian people should vote for the Democrats. To not do so is functionally indistinguishable from showing approval of Israeli actions.\\nI am not American. None of this will directly affect me, but the correct course of action is frankly obvious. It is not a game, and there are no prizes for not voting for the Democrats on principle. Such principles are as useful as a chocolate teapot to the Palestinians who will suffer and die if Trump gets in.","title":"Ann Selzer predicts a shock win for Kamala Harris in Iowa C heres why its a big deal"},{"text":"Because of the trends.

If Trump had lost in 2016, maybe theres a chance the far right would have returned to their less visible place in the background. But after a decade of Trump the far right *is* the Republican Party. Theyre so close to their authoritarian dreams that they can taste it. The Internet has let them perfect their disinformation campaigns and the Russians are assisting. This is not going away. If Trump loses tomorrow, it will be because of who he is. It will not be because of his policies. If the Republican Party manages to run MAGA in a more boring package they might lose a small bit of the base, but theyll gain the median voter thats put off by Trump. This is what terrifies me the most. Weve seen that even the *perception* of high gas prices seems to be enough for some Americans to consider giving up on democracy.

You can lose there, but you cant lose by a crazy margin.  Ossoff in Georgia. One example of what happens when instead of spending money on advertisements you spend it on people.  \\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/30/raphael-warnock-jon-ossoff-georgia-00064109  \\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yhgdkx/the_ground_game_that_flipped_the_senate_is/  \\nWeve demonstrated since 2017 that continually investing in organizing, especially young voters, is so important, and so Im using the organization that Ive built and putting it back to work, Ossoff said in an interview with POLITICO, after launching a canvass effort in a strip mall parking lot alongside Warnock, Democratic House candidate Wade Herring and Savannah Mayor Van R. Johnson.I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, No, I already voted for these people, he said. Then, we have to explain to people, Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now youve got to go again.And youll probably have to go in December and do it one more time, he added.A post-election analysis of Ossoffs field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoffs paid relational organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become community mobilizers  a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off, Ossoff continued.Ossoffs efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor. A number of get-out-the-vote nonprofits are also involved, as Democrats look for a way to close strong after several weeks of public polling gains by GOP Senate candidates, including Walker.Opinion | John Fetterman is Running a Test that Democrats Need to Watch  \\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/08/09/john-fetterman-tries-to-lure-rural-voters-00050352 Ive noticed one Democratic candidate who defies this trend. While consultants and organizers talk about the need for rural talking points and investments in rural newspaper and radio buys, this politician has deployed the most obvious strategy for making inroads with rural voters: He showed up in every county in his state.Then, he did something really remarkable: He showed up again.The attention a high-profile candidate like Fetterman has paid to rural areas of his state may begin to ease the rural inferiority complex thats been festering for decades, as rural economies have stagnated, small towns have lost population and country folks have become the butt of jokes. One 27-year-old woman in Westmoreland County, part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area that struggles against the Pennsyltucky stereotype, praised Fetterman for showing up and speaking bluntly.in conservative Westmoreland County took on the air of a party. Attendees sipped Bud Light and margaritas on an outdoor patio. Gisele Barreto Fetterman  the Second Lady of Pennsylvania who has embraced the acronym S.L.O.P.  interrupted her husband in the middle of his speech, handing him her drink while she regaled the crowd with a story about the geographic breadth of their support. And as Mr. Fetterman made the rounds, people told him they were delighted he had visited their county.Were not just silly hillbillies, said Gabrielle Keung, 27, who praised Mr. Fetterman for showing up and speaking bluntly.

It does however mean that anyone might be loyal or disloyal, which I think is equally destructive for a society. You kind of lost me when you say that humans should all help each other, and how the choice between helping a neighbour and someone on the other side of the world is arbitrary, except that it's not. As you say, helping your neighbour is more convenient and almost always you have some shared interest as well, so it's in fact not arbitrary at all. And that's society for you, really. It's a group of people close enough to each other that it makes sense to help (or not help) those around you, and you probably have some shared interest (at the very least from the fact that what what you do or don't do within your society will at least indirectly affect your own life). This is dictated by a lot of written rules, but also by a lot of unwritten rules that basically rely on some form of loyalty.You say that we should always be sceptical of the ways we determine who is and isn't worthy of help. I can sort of agree with this, but when you actually start analyzing who we should *not* help, I think things often get kind of tricky. Should we help the elderly people who aren't really contributing to the society anymore? Or should we help young people who are just about to step into the workforce? It's pretty clear what the contribution of the young people would be, but if we live in a society where the standard is that the elderly should not expect any help (no disloyalty there, just the absence of loyalty), it would likely have a lot of indirect effects as well. I know I would live my life very differently than I do now if I'd think that in 20 years I might break my leg and the doctor would tell me that they've stopped treating old people cause they're useless. And when that would happen, I think my children might be kinda outraged by it as well, and they'd start living their life in a different way as well. But that's just based on the idea that I think my children would have some loyalty towards me.And the above scenario isn't even the \\"worst case\\" of the implications. How would it affect the way people live their life in your society, if they stopped helping the useless old people, and directed all their help to the youth somewhere in Europe for example? Cause that would make more sense if there's no reason to be loyal to your elders or your neighbors. And what's old anyway? Right now I'm thinking like 70 but if we stop helping 70-year-olds, we might as well drag it down to 40 or 50 cause that's when people start getting increasingly useless so you might as well direct all that effort to the young people who are literally the future. But it might be that the rapidly growing number of people personally experiencing the effects of the lack of loyalty might once again spark quite a change in the society.","title":"CMV: Loyalty is not very important in the modern world, and thats a good thing"},{"text":"I'll say a little prayer [for you](https://youtu.be/dERmrf48qe4?si=f29PB8H9LPAF3oXp)Thank you ?","title":"I Need to Say a Big Thank You Before This is All Over"},{"text":"Hit my second ever 7-day gold streak on the NYT crossword ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"[/r/neoliberal/new](/r/neoliberal/new): [Is means tested welfare compatible with equality before law ,equal protection of laws and no taxation without representation ?](/r/neoliberal/comments/1gjb2ck/is_means_tested_welfare_compatible_with_equality/)*Replies to this comment will be removed, please participate in the linked thread*","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Only in carefully planned and orchestrated rhetoric.

Nazis want to see Israel destroyed and the Jews put to the sword. The Palestinians want to see Israel destroyed and the Jews put the sword. Therefore, the Palestinians, by and large, are Nazis. Just look at the curriculum that's given to students in UNRWA schools. And the people who say, Well, theyve been oppressed by Israel for decades! and think its some kind of justification for mass murder are need to recalibrate their moral compass.Yes, those are the Nazis I'm talking about. The Nazis that want to see Israel destroyed, because they see Israel *winning* and think that automatically makes them the bad guy. The largest concentration of them in the country is in Dearborn, MI, the district represented by Hamas auxiliary Rashida Tlaib, **who has not denounced Hamas**. there is no punishment severe enough for the people who committed that atrocitySo we agree that Israel is justified in its prosecution of the war against Hamas. But the solution is not to turn around and slaughter 35x as many innocent Palestinians. Thats fucked.Blame Hamas for embedding their military infrastructure within civilian areas. Should Israel just sit on its hands and let Hamas attack with impunity because of the fact that hitting back will incur civilian casualties? What is the goal here? To wipe Palestine off the map?To remove Hamas from power in Gaza. Already, with Sinwar dead, Israel has made a statement that any Hamas fighter that returns hostages will be given amnesty. The Israelis are looking to draw down the fighting in Gaza so that they can pivot to beating the shit out of Iran, who is the real instigator behind everything. Which they are already doing to a decent extent; Israel's recent airstrikes have basically obliterated Iran's capacity to launch ballistic missiles for *at least* two years, and have stripped away all of the country's air defenses. Should Israel so please, they could airstrike the Ayatollah himself the next time he sets foot in public without having to worry about planes being shot down. We need two completely independent states that can just leave each other the fuck alone.If the Palestinians are allowed to have a military, they will use it, perpetually, to try and destroy Israel. They believe that land consecrated to Islam being ruled by non-Muslims is a grave insult. To that end, the reason for the settlements in Judea and Samaria is because it puts pressure on the Palestinians to accept a deal rather than try to hold out and wait for a favorable US administration that will stab Israel in the back, or for Iran to get the bomb and destroy Israel.Let me reiterate. There is no two state solution that does not place the military power completely and entirely in the hands of Israel that does not result in the Palestinians going to war with Israel. The best solution is a one state solution, where the Palestinian areas of Gaza and the West Bank are autonomous republics (basically), and have equal representation in a supranational government, though they will have no say in military actions taken by Israel, who will be beholden to protect them. Since the Palestinians in their republic will not have any say in what goes on in the Jewish parts of the Israel-Palestine federation (and vice versa) then the right of return is not an issue, so long as refugees go to the Palestinian republic rather than Israel.","title":"CMV: The election is as likely to be decided by the Jewish vote in swing states as it is the Arab vote in swing states."},{"text":"I think that argument is making a bit of a category mistake.

Homeschool families often form collectives to provide their kids with better opportunities for socialization and group learning, and community organizations like 4-H or scouts or whatever is available where you are can further serve to provide outlets for socialization outside of the context of a public school.Im the project leader for 4-H robotics in my county in Montana, and I can say that at least from my experience, the homeschool kids tend to be more academically advanced for their age, better at learning independently, and generally better behaved overall, while still maintaining at least the level of social skills and awareness one can reasonably expect from 12 year olds.Ill grant that this absolutely isnt universal, and the stereotypes about homeschooled kids come from somewhere, but its not universal and very much depends on circumstance.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"He's not paying that after all.

Across two tax cuts, Reagan successfully lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 28/33%. Meanwhile Biden wants to increase it from 37% to 40%. As for unions, hes not completely anti union like Reagan was. By crushed union strikes, I assume you mean the train strike? The democrats preferred option was to force the companies to agree to the updated deal, but the republicans blocked that, leaving two options. Force the original deal the unions had negotiated, or risk economic collapse. You dont need to be a great mathematician or economist to know which option harms *way* more people, hence the action that the government collectively took. Skewing it to make it seem like Biden is overall anti union is very much a right wing talking point.The reality is it was most of the government doing it, not just Biden, because the economy is more important than the unions of a specific industry, not because he hates unions.  He literally went back afterwards to get changes enacted.  And ya, the economy shouldnt be so reliant on one industry, but its not like Biden chose for it to be that way.","title":"Bernie Sanders: 'When you hurt, when your children hurt, I hurt.'

Anyway, here is a story that Im sure you will enjoy.I was deployed with Ashli MAGA Babbitt before. We were once in the same career in the USAF. So when we were headed to our deployment location my team was there to relieve her team so they could go back home. So one day after we got there her and I were just Bsn about how the unnamed deployment location was and what to expect. It was just a quick little conversation, so while I cant say that I knew her, we did speak to one another if that makes any sense. But the most crazy thing about that is that when she was shot and killed on Jan. 6th I had no idea who she was except an ignorant MAGA. So hours later a close friend of mine who was on that same deployment with me texted me and asked me did I remember her I said I dont think so, and she reminded me that we had relieved her team on our deployment!I almost jumped through the damn roof on m my house no lie! I told my\\nfriend that she seemed like a really cool person in the short period of time that we were chatting. And it was unbelievable how vile and angry she looked on January 6th. That goes to show you how Trump has really corrupted these peoples minds to the core and its still happening.

The exception is, well, exceptional children. Those who are special needs are often neglected by the school system when it comes to education, and schools generally serve more as care centers than actual teaching institutions in these cases. As a SPED para, Ive seen how let down these kids are.It isnt that someone with an IDD or other disability cannot write essays, or form complex thought, but often it is that they lack the communication and concepts to do so. Ive met many a smart kid who simply cant communicate unless they have their talker (an ipad with pictures, tap and it says the word). Ive also met some who were simply not that good at reading or speaking, but would kill it at complex strategy games.Homeschooling at its ideal is not literally schooling at home. Homeschooling is adapting school to fit the kid. Ive seen other friends and students do this, like taking solely online classes to avoid issues with being at school, or medical cases where it would be dangerous for them to attend long-term. In one case, a student was wrapped up and masked like a leprosy case because they were immunocompromised, and couldnt risk coming near other kids. However, because homeschooling was not an option for the parents, she was forced in.Traditional school is meant for 99% of students, but 1% do not fit in, and thats where alternative and homeschooling comes in. I will say, I do understand the risks; my partner was abused and was hidden from the world through a religious homeschool program. However, I dont think that we should ban it.

I regret being in the school system and wish my mother had a teaching background to homeschool me. My first 10 years of school taught me nothing, they sent us outside every single day for hours to play kickball and silly games rather than teaching us. We were all very unprepared for high school. Yet this is what many homeschooling parents are doing to their children, letting them play outside as their only form of learning its very sad. My peers outside of school I had much closer relationships with due to traveling with them to competitions, being in group dances and carpooling to practices. Around my classmates I was definitely an outsider. This is also why I despise split classes, I went to school with a large amount of students with multiple classes of a split grade (the one year we had four grade 5/6 classes) youd learn the exact same thing you learned the year before. Us students even used a tally to see if the kids in our year would go over the class size limit and it did not.

All children should be given the opportunity to attend school, especially during the exploratory age to foster different scopes and understandings of real world paradigms. It is then up to the childs innate propensity towards self-learning and academic prowess that determines their path in scholarly pursuit. Parental guidance in a childs academic journey should maintain congruous and consistent in nature, especially for homeschooling children. The child in question should exhibit some academic or vocational vigor, excelling in independent studies and self regulation alongside the support of their parents. I particularly advocate for the opportunity of homeschooling children upon the premise that they were exposed to conventional educational methods as some youths have esoteric interests that require a heuristic way of learning and cannot optimize their educational attainment through simply learning by rote.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"The Federalist published and article exposing the fact that the Harris Campaign was practically running the r-pics sub.That's why.","title":"What in the world is going on with the influx of Obama photos in r/pics?
