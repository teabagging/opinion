But what about Trump?"},{"text":"First: It's central figure (Muhammad) was a desert warlord who allowed slavery, committed sexual acts with minors, etc. This is a strong contrast to e.g. Jesus that newer waged any wars or had slaves or Buddha who also was non violent.?Plenty of prophets engaged in politics (ex. Moses, Joshua, David). Hell, in the Old Testament, God himself helps the Israelites war against their enemies. Defensive wars in particular are not uncommon in religion. Islam allowing slavery is also not uncommon in religion. Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism in particular all don't denounce slavery. While Jesus didn't own slaves himself, he also didn't denounce slavery.It's debated whether or not Aisha was either 6-7 or 18-19. But either way, the majority of Muslims don't support child marriage (in general, the trend is that it occurs in developing countries, not Islamic-particular). Second: The Koran was written entirely by Muhammad who is the central figure of that religion. This is in contrast to other works like the Bible that is a compendium of partially redundant works of many authors from a comparatively large range of cultural and moral backgrounds.?The Koran largely consists of already existing Arabic parables at the time and many of the stories from the Old Testament/New Testament. The reason why Islam was so accepted at the time was because it was following a growing religious/cultural trend. But even if this criticism were entirely true, what exactly does it prove? That the prophet wrote the book rather than his disciples? Plus, a lot of Islamic teachings come from the Hadiths, which were from his companions rather than himself. Third: All the \\"nice stuff\\" in the Koran is mentioned in the earlier parts that Muhammad wrote whilst he actually was still peaceful and his religion was in a weak position. The later parts are to stuff that is very much not in agreement with today's modern moral values.?The later parts also include generally non-warlike teachings: Koran 2:190 &amp; 8:61And fight in the way of God with those who fight with you, but aggress not: God loves not the aggressors.\\"?And if they incline to peace, then you should incline to it; and put your trust in God; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.In general, Islam supports non-aggression and there's many quotes, both in the later and former parts that support this.So unlike other religions that are fundamentally more ambiguous in the terms of which parts of it are \\"more important\\" and which stuff could be neglected since it is antiquated, Islam is very straightforward in terms of what it is about. This is because it already was designed as an instrument to rule during the life time of its prophet.The only reason why Islam seems more straightforward was because it was written sooner. Wait 500 to 1000 years, it'll seem just as ambiguous as Judaism and Christianity. There are clear directions in Judaism and Christianity that most just seem to disregard nowadays (even the most devote follower) and the same thing has happened to Islam to a lesser extent already as well. Plus, it's odd that you say it was designed as an instrument to rule. Although Muhammad was a secular leader, he was a merchant for most of his adult life and nothing in the book lends itself to conquest. In general, Islam as a religion is more aligned with politics, but that has nothing to do with its ability to reform.In general, I see Islam in its current stage (particularly in the Middle East) compared with the Protestant revolution. I think people forget how violent it was, especially the Huguenots and Anabaptists. It also followed similar trends to what's happening in the Middle East: including very literal interpretations of the Bible/Koran and use of the book to justify violence. Islam has lasted for a very long time and although secularization will probably take its toll, I doubt it's very far behind other religions in adaption and ability to change.","title":"Donald Trump speaks against getting involved in the situation in Syria"},{"text":"When you want to get removed from the conversion","title":"People of reddit, what's the right time to make a joke during a conversation?"},{"text":"He knew where he would be at that particular time. how? - I bet that's how they're narrowing down the suspect.","title":"CMV: The UnitedHealthCare CEO murderer/assassin had an accomplice."},{"text":"The right time to make a joke is when the mood feels light and people are open to laughter, not when the conversation is serious or someone is feeling vulnerable.","title":"People of reddit, what's the right time to make a joke during a conversation?"},{"text":"During when the other person is talking","title":"People of reddit, what's the right time to make a joke during a conversation?"},{"text":"he won cuz of bigotry","title":"Harris raised and spent twice as much as Trump in final days of 2024 election"},{"text":"Are you talking about the eastern part of LA or incorporated area East LA?Highly doubt Trump increased his margins by 20 points in the eastern part of LA.

You look at Harriss numbers and its the people the economy is working for more or less who support her minus the super rich. Middle and upper middle class professionals broke hard for Harris along with certain key minorits like black women.This country is still more like me than it is like those people though. I cant tell you the last time I talked to a high school educated white guy who was planning to vote democrat. Why is that? Ive worked factory lines, service jobs, Ive fought wars, Ive been broke and Ive been addicted, but Im always reminded about my privilege any time I go to a left leaning space. Part of it is, of course, racism, but were so fixated on quantifying the amount of suffering each individual is going through that weve destroyed any natural class affiliation. I ha e more in common with a black, 25 year old McDonalds worker than I do with a white 50 year old doctor. Why is it Im. Constantly reminded that he isnt like me. Its race war to prevent class war/ Look, I support LGBTQ rights, but if I dont see my concerns being addressed in government, Im less inclined to vote for that party. The democrats have become so obsessed with being right that they no longer care about winning. I have no use, for example, for a justice department who wont convict a president who does coups why do I care about that institution if it cant protect the government. LGBTQ right dont matter already because the government is incapable of protecting any right for anyone! Billionaires can buy politics and CEOs can decide you die. Cops can kill whomever they want, and the courts do nothing. Ive got my own problems. Government needs to address those problem before I give a fuck about anyone elses. I dont have as many problems as some people, but *shrug* Im not running for office and its on the DNC to convince me.For the record, I vote for Clinton, Biden, and Harris but come on. The DNC is garbage.","title":"New progressive chair: Democrats must refocus on workers and wages to combat Trump's culture wars | Rep.

We need to acknowledge that people are deeply frustrated towards both the market and the government, and show urgency towards hitting the problems. Instead we got watered down business-friendly messaging like opportunity economy and a shift to the right from Biden as part of a bigger rightward shift since Harris positions in the Senate. Economists said the price gouging proposal would have little to no effect and it was similar to what already exists in 37 states. Harris herself said most companies are trying to do good and she was going after bad actors. She told a weak narrative.","title":"Donald Trump and Jill Biden Share Rare Chat While Attending Notre Dame Reopening in Paris"},{"text":"MIA implies there is some important action state action Joe is missing.

Trump has spent his entire life and career taking advantage of his power and privilege to enrich himself. And now more than ever, there is an even greater incentive for him to continue doing so.But first:Trump is a notorious financial fraud who has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has often profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:- Trump Casinos and Hotels \\n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\\n- Trump Magazine\\n- Trump Airlines\\n- Trump Beverages\\n- Trump \\"The Game\\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\\n- Trump Mortgages\\n- Trump Steaks\\n- Trump Travel Site\\n- Trumpnet\\n- Trump Tower Tampa\\n- Trump Vodka\\n- Trump Fragrances\\n- Trump Mattress\\n- Trump Network\\n- Tour de Trump\\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\\n- Truth Social (why not call it \\"Trump Social\\" at this point?)He has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes, multi million dollar real estate and tax disputes, corrupt business practices, state law violations, disputes with patrons, small businesses, employees, etc...Trump has profited off of screwing over these small businesses, financial partners, former staff and patrons who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties, he even lied to get on the Forbes list, and he almost always threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his real net worth.He is a symbol of American greed, born into privilege and wealth and too big to fail.He will exploit anyone for a quick buck.Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money, particularly from his father and from banks, avoiding paying income tax for many years, amassing unsustainable debts, then dumping them onto others.Then his lucky break, The Apprentice, just another example of his luck and privilege. By the show's premiere, Trump had squandered his riches, but the show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image. In fact, if it weren't for his reality TV show break, he may be known today as the infamous fraudster and financial failure he was always destined to be.This isn't even the tip of the iceberg, but it's clear so far that Donald Trump is not the economic genius he's touted as by both him and his supporters, and he's spent his entire life exploiting others to enrich himself, cashing in on his circumstances at the expense of others, while he has also made a career out of leveraging his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system and avoid being held accountable for his crimes, his misconduct, and his thousands of legal disputes.Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.During his presidency, Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposesAs part of the settlement, Trump was required to acknowledge his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation, and it was forced to shutter its doors and dissolve under court supervision.Then there's Trump University...In 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University. New York regulators forced Trump to stop using the term \\"university\\" to describe his grifting scheme, calling Trump's use of the word, \\"misleading and even illegal.\\"Former students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.There was also a separate class action lawsuit against Trump University, Trump's counterclaims were dismissed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against one of the students who made her experiences at the \\"university\\" public. Trump University was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and extra costs. Trump was eventually found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.Trump is also known infamously for not paying what he owes. This includes hundreds of millions in loan forgiveness and legal penalties, and unpaid bills for rally costs at cities around the country.As president, Donald Trump directed taxpayer money towards his businesses. The secret service and other government parties were forced to overspend at Trump properties and on accommodations.Trump often made foreign and domestic business deals while president. Booking events for foreign governments at Trump owned locations in order to curry favor with his admin.Trump promoted his properties while President, and hosted taxpayer funded events.Trump is a notorious grifter. Everything from your typical hats, T-shirts, clothing and accessories, to watches and jewelry, NFTs and digital collectibles, commemorative medallions and coins, Trump currency and trading cards, tacky sneakers, overpriced Bibles, cologne and perfume, among other merchandise and MAGA memorabilia that he continuously suckers his followers into purchasing. Easy money that typically gets allocated towards his legal fees. Make no mistake here, Donald Trump is not America first, he is Trump first, always. He is always thinking of ways to exploit his power and privilege to enrich himself. He has no reason to stop, in fact, he has an even greater incentive this time around to continue taking advantage of his power to deepen his own pockets. He's not only been granted broad immunities by his kowtowing loyalists, but he's now under the impression that he's practically exempt from the law and any consequences he might otherwise face for whatever crimes, misconduct or corruption he carries on with while president.Come January 21st, he will also have a conservative SCOTUS, a Republican majority in both houses, the richest administration in U.S. history, and he is surrounding himself with a fierce coalition of MAGA extremists who have already made it clear that they plan to restructure the government to fit the needs of their party, while granting Trump unitary executive privileges and control over an administrative state that they intend cleanse of all civil servants whose positions will now depend on their level of loyalty to the president and the MAGA agenda.","title":"Dr. Oz &amp; RFK plan to divest from their businesses.

A lot of work goes into producing proof that health care is necessary for insurers, and then insurers spend a lot of work to deny those claims. Hospital/doctors and Pharma come up with complicated payment systems that insurers and then users have to end up navigating (there is a sticker price, which gets charged to uninsured, and then each insurer negotiates a different discount - and none of it is available before treatment, you just have to see what the bill is afterwards). With single payer there would just be a one negotiated price.

But before they leave, some of them have been asked a final set of questions that seemed designed to assess their loyalty to President-elect Donald J. Trump.The questions went further than just affirming allegiance to the incoming administration. The interviewers asked which candidate the applicants had supported in the three most recent elections, what they thought about the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and whether they believed the 2020 election was stolen. The sense they got was that there was only one right answer to each question.So god damn disturbing.

Its normalised, its continious, so there isn't much question. An outsider who never had to do that especially from a young age would bring up all these questions and wonder why moreso than someone born doing it.I mean really you could see the whole movie as an exaggerated tale of what happens in lots of small towns and communities. Loads of children grow up not experiencing the wider world, they don't even know what to question and wonder about because its been so so hidden from them. And maybe they get small glimpses that theres something further out there and something different than their small community. Truman expereinces the same in a more exaggerated way. He is experiencing and going on an enlightenment. The idea of \\"fighting agaisnt the system\\", isn't literally blowing up a place. Its the idea of questioning and exploring for yourself, not always accepting peoples answers.But it isn't just the errors. Truman is growing slightly depressed, he is experiencing the equvilant of what most teenagers/young adults experience except its been delayed: questioning the world. Hes been kept naive and forced to not question, that when he does begin to think so he sees these things as they are.

However, I don't think this policy supports your point for two reasons. Firstly, it wasn't something that was particularly focussed on in the campaign. Secondly, [most Americans support a wealth tax](https://www.excessivewealth.org/tax-polling-report), which is just another term for the unrealised gains tax. So here, we see that not only do 63% of Americans support this tax, but even 51% of Republicans support this tax. So I don't see how a policy that even Republicans support would cause them to lose the campaign.Now, you talk about bipartisanship on the BBB bill, but again this was very popular, with [above 60% of Americans consistently supporting the bill](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/12/15/majority-of-voters-support-the-build-back-better-act-and-reject-republican-talking-points). Again, on the filibuster change, [over 70% of Americans say that getting rid of the filibuster rule would help fix the current political system](https://navigatorresearch.org/three-in-four-americans-feel-getting-rid-of-the-filibuster-would-have-a-positive-impact/), including 64% of Republicans.Here's the gist. Left-wing economic policies are popular.

Some just dont seem to believe him. I dont see that theres going to be a push to go chase anyone whos willing to work on a farm, says Tom Barcellos, who milks 1,600 Holstein cows on his farm in Tulare county. As the Biden era comes to a close, farmers such as Barcellos say they are drowning in expenses and red tape resulting from strict environmental and emissions regulations introduced by Democratic leaders at the federal and state levels, at a time when American agriculture is in free fall. He says the same model of hauling truck he bought five years ago is $100,000 more expensive to buy today. Some reports suggest that running electric big rigs costs as much as twice that of diesel equivalents. Last year the California Air Resources Board voted to ban sales of new diesel trucks by 2036. I cant afford an electric truck. Period, says Barcellos. Although his previous tariffs war cost American agriculture around $27bn in 2018 and 2019, Trump then reportedly gave farmers record handouts worth $32bn in direct farming aid to counter the effects. Should Trump reignite his trade war next year, some observers believe similar efforts may again be in the offing.So in short:\\n- they benefitted last time from compensation for tariff losses \\n- they believe Trump will selectively enforce immigration law and skip over their farms, similar to the norm of selectively ignoring offenses involving marijuana \\n- theyre worried about the additional expenses from environmental regulations as the number of farms continues to fallIts a lot easier to convince people when you make an effort to see their perspective first, even if you completely disagree.","title":"Trumps policies should be turning off farmers C why did so many vote for him?"},{"text":"Side note: these people are getting in already in larger numbers and theyre technically not illegal aliens, theyre fraudulent asylum seekers.

That takes five seconds for him to do. the issue is that once he does, Canada will slap the US with a 25% tariff. Canada pretty much has to do this, because if they don't then their market will get fucked.As a result, both sides will have tariffs and it will require bilateral talks to reduce them. When Trump left office he had just started the \\"Phase One\\" commitments with China to bring the tariffs down. Unfortunately, China has not kept up its part of the pledge, in part because Covid 19 threw a wrench in everything.Biden can't pull the tariffs down unilaterally without fucking our economy.There is also the economic reality that the main reason to cut tariffs is to lower the cost of goods, this takes a while to factor in, while the tax revenue loss is immediate. The latter looks bad on the budget sheet and there is a real concern that while it *should* put downward prices on goods, companies might not really budge in terms of prices making it a lose lose, especially if inflation is already a thing.tl;dr - Putting tariffs in place is easy, bringing them down is hard and companies are less inclined to lower prices than they are to raise them.Also, I'm not really sure you *get* how 'center' works. Center isn't its own position, it is as it says, the midpoint between positions. People on the left think tariffs are stupid, people on the right think they're great (because they are stupid).The 'centrist' position is essentially the opposite of your party. If you're a democrat and you want to be 'centrist' you probably want some tariffs. If you're a republican and you want to be center, you oppose them. It isn't a mythical third option, it is a lean toward the belief of the other party and the supposed 'center' between them.","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"I imagine it was some combination of \\"I like Trump because he tells it like it is, but on this issue he's not actually telling it like it is\\" and \\"I'm only expected him to hurt the trans kids who needed to be hurt.\\"","title":"An Alabama couple were ardent Trump supporters.

If you don't like that I can point you to republicans passing laws to make it legal to run over BLM Passing laws is not 'vigilante' justice. It is the exact opposite.No, because you've argued that a majority of people are having this problemThe majority have a problem does not mean it isn't still an *individual* problem.We live in a society, that society exists to share resources and work toward a common good.This is an opinion.Another common opinion is people who live in a society have an obligation to provide for their own needs.Yet another is that people aren't entitled to the fruits of other people labors. The fact is, this is an individual problem. It could be solved by forcing these people to buy zero deductible insurance but of course then they would complain *even more* about the cost. What you're describing is a system in which more than half the people who go to use their healthcare can't fucking use it because of cost issues. You absolutely can **if you manage your money**. That is the problem here. You are defending people who aren't proactively preparing for their own needs. Its not like it is something people aren't told. They just don't prioritize it and choose to take the risk instead. People will say things like 'I shouldn't have to sacrifice my quality of life' or such things. People can save, they just don't want to. They want to spend the money on other things instead.It may happen to 1/100,000 people and they gamble it won't be them. The problem is - it is 1 person still in that 100,000If I had a machine that electrocuted you to death half the time you used it, you wouldn't try to blame that on user error, you'd recognize it was fucking broken.Which has absolutely ZERO bearing to this conversation. It is frankly *not applicable*. People know you could need medical care and they know they have a deductible they have to pay. Dude, a majority of americans live paycheck to paycheck. That isn't an issue of personal responsibility, it is a problem with arithmetic. If they have no money where do you think the savings come from?Ask yourself *why* they are living paycheck to paycheck and what they have done to manage expenses. The answer is they aren't prioritizing this. I know people who make $100k/year with no savings because all they do is spend it. They could change lifestyles but they don't. *It is a lifestyle choice*. The paycheck to paycheck is self-inflicted. And yes, I call that out.If you truly believe people cannot be individually responsible, how you think they would do when their insurance premiums went up 3-5k a year to cover that 'zero deductible'. Shit costs money and isn't free.","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"From another OIF and OEF vet, I can't over-emphasize what this guy said.This post made me consider breaking my rule to never give money to reddit to give you an award.","title":"Trump Meets With Zelensky - He is going to get a good trade deal"},{"text":"I can verify this much after making a Bluesky account.","title":"Imagine leaving X just to still go talk about Trump"},{"text":"Yes.

This includes paying some lip service and lies about moderation and tolerance. Theyre in a constant state of war against the enemies of Islam, even in peace.\\nFor all the Talibganda thats out there just because they didnt continue on as a suicidal band of raving lunatics on national level after turning Afghanistan back into the stone age, doesnt mean they are in any way a proper political force, its a dysfunctional shithole where after a few weeks of were totally different now, look at how we dont behead random western tourists, people are permanently stuck in the stone age, women practically dont get to exist and every non-Pashtun and non-Sunni lives in constant state of subservience with the possibility that their next day might be their last. Even tourists, which on youtube rave about how its much safer now, are on constant eggshells not to trigger some maniac with Talib credentials. Mind you, Im saying this as someone who isnt even against the current state of affairs in Afghanistan. I dont see an alternative to Taliban so Im fine with it.What makes Syria different are numerous things1. The fact its in the Levant, bordered by key strategic players, and is right across the Mediterranean2. That there is no end conclusion to the war or unity whatsoever. Assad may fall, but that war is going to enter a new phase, continuing flow of migrants to Europe3. More power and money in the hands of these people will continually flow towards instigating Islamic conflicts globally. The amount of foreign jihadist mercenaries that have poured into Syria are endless, these same people were utilised by the Azeris against Armenians, likewise theyre involved in Lebanon, and so on. One of the reasons Egypt and other Arab states for example refuse to take in any Palestinians are because groups like Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, etc. Embed themselves into their societies to instigate terror and regime changes. Likewise countries like Qatar have funded extremism in European mosques for decades, thats exactly what these people will do as well.\\nAgain, Afghanistan is relatively locked off from the world, we dont feel its consequences. Iran that has millions of Afghan refugees now does.Lastly Ill moralize a bit here but its just beyond disgusting to me that this is the fate wed leave to Christians and other minorities, as well as centuries of our own history in the Holy Land.","title":"Donald Trump speaks against getting involved in the situation in Syria"},{"text":"It's sad/hilarious but I read this as \\"bad\\" GOP again proposed restricting marijuana...

It's a winning position for either party that tries it, and the results back that up. Democrats lost this year, which means they need to employ it more. Trump is an unhinged lunatic and he won the election, so broadly 'being a centrist' isn't a winning position Correct, Trump is not a centrist, but neither is Harris (and as I said the more centrist Democrats outperformed her). One of the two of them was bound to win, it ended up being Trump, and now the GOP has a major hold over the Senate. If the Dems want to get the Senate back, they need to employ the down ballot strategy that has been continuously proven to succeed: nominating centrist candidates, especially in red states. Kamala running as an Ur-Centrist probably wouldn't have broken 40% in MontanaTester got 45% this year, so yea if Harris were more centrist she could've matched that at least. Montana and the other states and congressional districts I've mentioned prove decisively that if national Democrats acted like Tester and Manchin, they'd achieve those same results and win more states (both at the presidential and down ballot levels)","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"Here comes my downvotes but I agree.

They cant read policy papers or government reports or legislation thats hundreds of pages long and filled with policy-specific terminology. They dont know which of the many experts contradicting each other to trust.

This is a multi-faceted approach- It needs to be a message that can win the presidency in the required pathway of states. It cannot be too extreme less you lose your pathway- It needs to be flexible for down ballot races. Democrats in Indiana need a viable platform they can point to and distance themselves from just as Democrats in California need the platform to inspire their voters.- Remember your history. Consider something like the gun issue. Nobody is really going to believe a Democrat has abandoned or changed course on this policy. It will take many cycles to truly change course on policy. That means things like abortion, guns, and identity politics are going to be baggage for every Democrat candidate. It would take extraordinary effort to change this perception for a candidate.Its a major balancing act and it is not easy. From my perspective, I am reminded of the comments about the GOP in 2020 being torn apart by Trump. Right now, there is a huge divide in the DNC with the real leftists trying to drag the party leftward while maintaining the centrist/establishment liberals.

[Patrick Bet David doing a must-see interview with Anneke Lucas](https://youtu.be/nuui0zfMzpU?si=UayaznRu-V21DY2e) 14 minutes video (the last 3 minutes is PBD promoting his novel). To me Anneke is completely credible and authentic. I initially wanted to uphold some reservation, since of course making stuff like this up, apart from being disadvisable and dangerous, can be projected to be quite profitable, but 1) there is targeted bad mouthing of her being spread on the interwebs, which actually serves as a knighting, and 2) and even more importantly I got fully smitten. Anneke credibly testifies that she was raised as a sex slave and as a property to pedophile and eugenicist and allegedly back in his days second most powerful man in the world David Rockefeller (alleged by those who should know to boot), which (sex slave) roles final form and specifics had to be sniffed, scrutinized, authorized and given a final blessing by (surprisingly in turn *his* overlord) Evelyn de Rothschild. David Rockefeller was apparently experiencing JOY! with capital letters off the prospect of her earning him some extra millions (never mind that still must have meant only petty cash to him), both directly and by her collecting kompromat that would expose Davids targets to efforts of his at blackmail and extortion. She also describes receiving mind control training as a 9-year old, consisting mainly of being subjected to sadistic torture, from former Nazi Hans Harmsen, who under or rather among the Nazis had gained and possibly single-handedly created the responsibility for approving eugenic sterilizations performed on the disabled (Ill never hear the mockery Hans! the same). Harmsen in turn had been extorted and subjugated by David Rockefeller, and through him by berboss Evelyn de Rothschild, to work for the both of them and help build their network of slaves. Another demonstration of Zionists embracing and adopting every horrific practice and perverse technique and tactic that they possibly could extract, extort, rip off, duplicate, and take from the Nazis. Also: Lets not forget that Bill Gates is a Rothschild. I would not be surprised if he is the current *capo dei capi*. As a footnote here is https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vanden_Boeynants, who was also named by Anneke. And here is a text based on the interview:https://cairnsnews.org/2024/12/03/rockefeller-rothschild-sex-slave-taught-mind-control-by-nazi-doctor/Here is https://annekelucas.com/ (Im new to this and so far have only seen this one interview that I opened this comment with.

Pretty much every position my brother advocated was progressive and I tried telling him that he should be voting for Bernie etc but he wouldn't hear it, the propaganda runs too hard against progressives. People don't want to hear that progressives are actually fairly anti establishment. Not anti government, I think people mix those up. I feel like anti corruption is anti establishment.

Because its really, really fucking bad and thats just being reinforced every day, ever more emphatically.(* Yes, I know thats why they call it Balkanisation, Poindexter, fuck off)I mean, forget about the Republican Party, that goes without saying, but surely the Supreme Court is also already guilty of treason, of conspiring against its own country?  and will be over and over again throughout the next four years  I mean, dont they see that theyre killing themselves too? (I sound like a fourteen year old for fucks sake)And yet, nothing, NOTHING can be done, apparently.And even MORE yet, uh, you DO still have the Democrats in power, dont you (like when was that last an actual, reliable, workable thing 1964?)  Im sorry, where the fuck is your president? All the time people are saying Biden could still do this, he could secure that  but all hes done is pardon his son and apparently thats as much as hes gonna do from here to eternity, folks. just saying. Maybe I dont know what Im talking about, and being pretty damn patronising but this affects everyone, not just you guys. And from what, now, in high relief, surprisingly seems a relatively calm and rational part of the world (Australia), it just seems like you guys have cornered yourselves. (And I know when I say, you guys, its not you guys. Its a blind and mindless laissez-faire system that given the right payment will open its arms to anyone  which unfortunately included Rupert Murdoch. And thats all you needed. He did the rest.The shame of him being an Australian, jfc  )But yeah - anyone honestly see light at the end of the tunnel?

Specifically because you're using flawed logic.You're arguing 'centrists win in tough races' and thus the solution is to be more centrist. But that isn't true! Trump is an unhinged lunatic and he won the election, so broadly 'being a centrist' isn't a winning position in and of itself.If your argument is 'being a centrist is a winning position for democrats' that might counter things somewhat, but you're bringing up **a republican** as an example, so that can't be it either. The reality is that people in hard districts tend to run away toward the winning position. Democrats run right in red states, republicans run left in blue states. But while this is true on an individual district or state level, it doesn't necessarily translate to national politics.Kamala running as an Ur-Centrist probably wouldn't have broken 40% in Montana, because it is a solidly red state. But if she'd run that far to the right, she's going to start bleeding voters from the left in other states and districts.You can't just go 'Well Joe Manchin is a centrist and he wins\\" because Joe Manchin isn't necessarily reflective of the general population.","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"No. After Romania's elections were [targeted by aggressive hybrid russian action including cyberattacks](https://www.rferl.org/a/romania-russia-election-interference-tiktok/33227010.html) according to declassified intelligence documents, [Romania's Constitutional Court annulled the entire presidential election](https://www.rferl.org/a/lasconi-georgescu-runoff-romania/33228897.html) and may end up disqualifying the russia-funded candidate in the redo of the compromised election.","title":"Trumps Comments on Future Elections Should Terrify You - Donald Trump made the chilling remark while accepting an award for supposed patriotism."},{"text":"Voter suppression is always lead by conservative parties.","title":"NC Democratic Party sues over GOP efforts to toss 60,000 votes.

It's pretty sad that deeply honest and introspective communication between people has been commercialized to this extent. For thousands of years, this sort of communication was free at your local church, temple, etc. It's a relatively recent phenomena for this experience to be culturally accepted as requiring a monetary fee. I feel a lot of these phenomena like \\"therapy speak\\" result from this commercialization, where it's almost as if psychotherapists have to justify their hourly rate. There is an interesting finding in psychotherapy called the \\"dodo bird verdict\\", which has compelling evidence to suggest that the particular mechanisms by which you perform psychotherapy (CBT, etc) are essentially completely irrelevant to its actual efficacy; while common factors between all interventions (namely things like: consensus on the goal, empathy, respect, working alliance, and honesty) entirely explain why psychotherapy works at all. That's not to say that psychiatry and psychology don't have their place, but that is to say that the academic/commercial approach to understanding the Self is certainly not the only one, and I would say, should not be the default approach for the vast majority of people. It shares similar themes with the wastefulness of making every teenager, regardless of particular inclination, go to college and get a bachelor's.

This was most easily seen in the contradictory messages sent to Muslims and Jews about Biden's policies in Gaza. They were both lies, but very different lies depending on the religion of the recipient.I think this was done using massive and illegal collusion between Twitter, America PAC (Elon Musk's private PAC), The GOP/RNC databases of almost every voter in the country, and possibly Fox News and other media outlets. DATA from the GOP/RNC was processed by America PAC, and used to alter the algorithm at Twitter to target almost every individual voter.The recent story about Vance seeking Supreme Court rejection of the laws concerning data sharing between campaigns and PACs is my main evidence for this illegal collusion, and the use of Twitter to provide free, illegal advertising to the Trump campaign, disguised as content from members.","title":"Tim Walz Says He Was a Little Surprised Trump Won"},{"text":"He's not wrong.\\nLiberals and the Working class are not synonymous.??","title":"New progressive chair: Democrats must refocus on workers and wages to combat Trump's culture wars | Rep.

People who, like conservatives, believe that the government works for the wealthy.Since Neoliberals and radical conservatives have gotten back into leadership positions the infrastructure of the United States is falling apart, the middle class has been hollowed out, wages and worker protections have eroded, teachers can't afford to work in the profession anymore, Social Security has been raided to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy and instead of a prosperous, healthy, upwardly mobile working class we have 700 billionaires whose net worth grew by 88% since the pandemic, by directly exploiting the pandemic for profit, while the rest of us are struggling. A billionaire was murdered in the streets this week and many of us, on both the Right and the Left, seem to be cheering. All of this is to say that the exact opposite of your thesis is true. The Democrats need to move back to the left, back to policies that worked, back to making the wealthy pay their share of taxes, back to a rule of law that applies to the wealthy just as much as to the rest of us, back to protecting and preserving democracy.","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"Democrats are now more liberal on social issues and social welfare spending, where is the data that shows they have become more conservative?","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"Is Trump still a CEO?","title":"Trumps Comments on Future Elections Should Terrify You - Donald Trump made the chilling remark while accepting an award for supposed patriotism."},{"text":"First the democrats went as centrist as possible without losing their base.

Since Biden/Harris were unpopular, down-ballot candidates (like Tester) who had distanced themselves from the unpopular incumbent did relatively better. As for why a push for progressive policies might help:1. Many progressive policies are incredibly popular (e.g., [Medicare for All](https://pnhp.org/news/reuters-ipsos-poll-70-percent-support-medicare-for-all/)). I *don't* think this means Democrats will win by pushing for unpopular progressive policies like \\"defunding the police\\".2.

I have moved around a lot since then and seen legalization happen in other places since, and in all of them, the cycle was about the same. It takes years for legal prices to come down, and over the course of those years, more and more of the market moves from black to gray to white. I have had more conversations than I can count over the last dozen years about how legalization brings with it the death of culture, a culture I am quite fond of. Those minorities and blue collar people you think I wanted to put out of business are my friends, and they will continue to be my friends even as their side hustles dwindle over the next decade (and based on Colorado, it will take most of the decade for the majority of the market to come in out of the cold). It's not a matter of it being a better solution for distribution and sales. It's a matter of it no longer being a reason for the cops to harass people, so yes, I am still in favor of legalization. You can say that I got played, but I knew exactly what I was voting for. Yes, recreational dispensaries are currently overpriced mediocre product. That's the way it always starts. Yes, tenths of an ounce rather than eighths of an ounce feel silly, and a sure sign that the law was written by politicians who were never part of the counterculture. The slice was always an arbitrary measurement though, just one that we grew accustomed to, so a tenth/ an eighth/ whatever. Yes, my eyes rolled almost out of my head when I learned I couldn't actually see or smell the flowers to determine what I wanted. Which strain is which is one thing, but I tend to base my choices on how something is grown as much as what has been grown. Ohio recreational dispensaries are still brand new (hell, the med system here is still shiny and new), nowhere near optimal, and based on the legislators in the article above, probably going to get worse before they get better, which is why the thca gray market is currently blooming as wildly as it is.

Theres a few examples I will list in a bit. But first, its noteworthy to state that almost every country that held elections saw incumbent parties lose vote share, from places like Britain, Austria, India, etc. Worldwide, voters were sick of high inflation and punished the parties in power. As for some examples, I remember in 2004 when pundits said that Democrats needed to win over values voters or those who supported Democrats economic ideas but did not support abortion rights or same sex marriage. Obama won them over in 2008 as the economy took a crap. In 2012, the Republicans famously published an autopsy report that said they needed to reach out to minorities and rid themselves of racial biases, and they won in 2016 with Trump, who absolutely played to racial prejudice. Point is, its hard to predict the future. If trumps tariffs lead to massive inflation, democrats will clean up the next couple of cycles. Possible birth control/nationwide abortion bans would also probably cause a backlash. Nobody knows.

The entire point of the \\"thearapy speak\\" is to try and allow both sides of a conflict to openly and fully express themselves so that there can be shared understanding and thus proper resolution of the issues.  That might not always be fully effective, but you've not actually specified any specific issue that we can discuss in detail.Because now the abusive partner is NOT just saying \\"I don't care, leave me alone,\\" which is much easier to call out as shitty.

In short: I think it is basically impossible. Islam is fundamentally different from other world religions in three ways\\nFirst: It's central figure (Muhammad) was a desert warlord who allowed slavery, committed sexual acts with minors, etc. This is a strong contrast to e.g. Jesus that newer waged any wars or had slaves or Buddha who also was non violent.?\\nSecond: The Koran was written entirely by Muhammad who is the central figure of that religion. This is in contrast to other works like the Bible that is a compendium of partially redundant works of many authors from a comparatively large range of cultural and moral backgrounds.?\\nThird: All the \\"nice stuff\\" in the Koran is mentioned in the earlier parts that Muhammad wrote whilst he actually was still peaceful and his religion was in a weak position. The later parts are to stuff that is very much not in agreement with today's modern moral values.?\\nSo unlike other religions that are fundamentally more ambiguous in the terms of which parts of it are \\"more important\\" and which stuff could be neglected since it is antiquated, Islam is very straightforward in terms of what it is about. This is because it already was designed as an instrument to rule during the life time of its prophet. And what story would you even want to tell for justifying to get rid of the violent parts? That the prophet was once well intentioned but then went insane with power so \\"please ignore all that stuff he wrote later\\"? How convincing would a religion like that sound like?

They can say they support me, but do they really? Usually, its a no on that front. I look to history as my comfort. The trans people who came before me have gone through so much.

Vibes.Yes a lot of the GOP vibes are- to a normie voter- weird if not obviously bigoted. What I'm saying is that, if identity becomes more of the core determiner or voting patterns rather than more constructive cost-benefits analyses, then we as Dems should put in a lot of work in the coming years to reverse the perception that a lot of young men may be having.Not saying it's right, but a lot of young men *do* fall for manosphere grifters. Beyond that a lot of young men, even the most well-meaning, may feel like they're disadvantages in dating or employment opportunities compared to women or to other minorities. Side topic away from gender, but by growing up in a diverse area I've seen the shifts in how different minority communities (Black, Latino, Asian) perceive each other- and sometimes with prejudice. And if the perception is that one group is getting more conservative, is that in part due to factors like wanting to be \\"in\\" with the top demographics of a region/city/state? IDK.Anyway this is a tangent, but all I'm saying is that we can't (1) generalize demographics (gender, race, urban/suburban) as they shift and (2) we can't assume that people will attribute their issues to Trump, we need to assert that to them.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 7, 2024"},{"text":"What a bunch a morons ??","title":"Anti Harris Palestinians regret vote for Trump: Those who said, were going teach Democrats a lesson, or maybe Trumps better in a second term, well, theyre already getting their reckoning, and hes not even started this term."},{"text":"Why not.

(Uganda is even worse)Political judges: Like Russia and other dictatorships Not better in the US than in other dictatorship countries and where courts are religion based.Hypocrisy: No contest. USA is the greatest by far.Self esteem: The US is able to beat even France in this disciplin.Level of brain washing: The US is the only country where a deciding part of the population voluntarily have let itself be completely brain washed to the extent that facts don't matter any more.Women's rights: No other population has ever knowingly elected a convicted rapist as their leader.Corruption: Can be found in many countries. But in the US it is built into the system as the official way to finance politicians. Treating their leader as a God: Probably most in North Korea (necessary to survive). But when done voluntarily there is parity between the US and Nazi Germany and Italy during the Mussolini years.Racism: US is on par with South Africa, so about the worst in the world.School shootings: The US is on a totally insane level compared to the rest of the world. Including other countries where people have easy access to guns.Yes Men in places of power: Totally normal in any dictatorship. But the US is probably the only country where any level of stupidity is accepted (or even required/praised by voters)Election cheating: Not really a problem in democracies. Except in the US where Republicans are trying to suppress all sorts of voting which might go against them.Stupidity: Hard to measure, of course. But since no population in it's right mind would re-elect (or elect) Don Trump the US population is in a leaque of it's own here.Climate change: The whole world knows this is real. Except US republicans. They think it is a hoax created by Democrats. A belief which is not possible to maintain for those who knows that there is a world outside the US.Conspiracy theories: A US disciplin not found in other countries (apart from local groups of village idiots, of course.)

In western nations, however, it isnt growing nearly as fast since Islamic birth rates are the same as the national averages. The video also included citations to passages from the Quran and Hadith, which essentially state that Muslims are supposed to follow the book entirely and shouldnt ask questions.

My problem is that too many people have a knee jerk reaction to inequality, thinking that somehow the rich gain wealth by taking it away from the poor. As the rich get richer, the economic pie should grow larger, making us all better off. It is not a zero-sum game.

Healthcare systems already accept Medicare, a reasonably sound plan for older adults but the reimbursement rates to hospitals are really at a break even amount.  Healthcare systems operating costs (labor, new technology, staying open) are not fixed, so they need more than the Medicare amount to operate. Plus, services for people with no money (indigent care) have to be paid for. United Healthcare (or any insurance company) pay claims based on what their employer clients want to pay for.  Denying claims, although heartbreaking, has to be a part of that  fraud in healthcare is rampant.  United HC uses medical guidelines (from the AMA and subspecialty boards, the FDA, etc.) to determine what is appropriate, in most cases.  Any Universal Health Care programs would, if only for financial reasons, have to have guidelines not unlike what ANY insurance company does.

The problem is that just like here they get a very skewed opinion of the news, so many of their opinions are based on what they think are facts, but in reality are lies. With that said though, most European countries are seeing a surge in populist right wing rhetoric and as such many right wing politicians are getting elected. As an example, last year the Netherlands elected Geert Wilders party the PVV into power on a platform of anti immigration and pro Dutch/populist policies. France, Germany, Belgium, Poland, Sweden, Italy, etc are all ran by right leaning governments or the next largest party is right leaning and potentially can be voted into power at the next election.Much of Trumps rhetoric echoes similar sentiments in Europe because many people are angry that they cant afford to live anymore while immigrants can seemingly just show up and are given housing and a living stipend without contributing a single cent to society. So what were seeing in response is more people standing up against the status quo because they feel their government and country has failed them. To add to it, many Europeans are heavily reliant on government subsidies to cover basic needs, so when they apply for these subsidies and when the wait list is 10+ years long (as is the case for subsidized housing in Amsterdam) it's natural for them to get angry.The idea in Europe is you agree to a social contract where you pay more in taxes and make less overall in return for better social safety nets.  At face value there's nothing wrong with that, the problem is that when those nets are stressed to the point of failure the average citizen is left with higher taxes and less income for more or less nothing in return. To add insult to injury, immigrants and minorities are often given priority based solely on race, gender, immigration status, etc. simply to fill quotas and maintain good optics rather than prioritizing need.So in reality a lot of Europeans support Trump or his policies without even knowing it because they're dealing with similar issues to the ones we have in the US, and subsequently have drawn similar conclusions/opinions to Trump's. The problem is that they've been trained to hate Trump and reject the very notion that anything he does can potentially be positive. However, because of the aforementioned problems above, people are starting to reason that Trump understands a lot of the problems they're dealing with and in turn, are supporting politicians with similar positions. They've see how Trump shook up the system in the US and deep down want that for their country, because theyve become so disillusioned with their respective governments that they think someone like Trump would be the solution.TL:DR - Europeans have been trained to hate Trump, but because they're dealing with similar issues over there their opinions of him are changing. Many Europeans feel that their respective governments have failed them and they're starting to realize that Trump's ideas and rhetoric would solve many of the problems they're dealing with. Subsequently we've seen a rise in right wing politicians/parties, with many of them winning elections and seats in their respective Parliaments. The tide *is* turning, it's just happening slowly.","title":"President-elect Trump greets Macron at the Notre Dame Cathedral"},{"text":"Racism","title":"Missouri Republican proposes $1,000 bounty program to turn in undocumented immigrants"},{"text":"He better bring crayons so Trump will have something to eat while he talks.","title":"Prince of Wales to discuss Britains special relationship with US in meeting with Trump"},{"text":"Daddy's home","title":"President-elect Trump greets Macron at the Notre Dame Cathedral"},{"text":"Who? me?

Like I said, one is sent out automatically to registered voters even if they weren't specifically requested in the election in question, while another has to be specifically requested each election in question.Also, I know of no state that mails ballots to people who did not request them.[https://www.lgbtmap.org/democracy-maps/absentee\\\\_requirements](https://www.lgbtmap.org/democracy-maps/absentee_requirements)This map says that \\"States that conduct all-mail elections, **where every eligible voter is mailed a ballot**, are categorized here as no-excuse absentee states.\\" It then lists at least 36 such states, where eligible voters are automatically mailed a mail-in ballot.Kindly explain how same day voting differs from a single election day.\\"Same-day voting\\" doesn't mean \\"no early voting\\". Same day voting means you can register to vote, and then vote, both on the same day, instead of having to register weeks ahead of time.Early voting means you can vote a certain number of days early, before November 5th which is the standard \\"election day\\". The exact number of days early you can vote depends on the state. In New York, we received up to 9 days, before election day, to cast an early vote in this 2024 election, while other states received either more time or less.For this 2024 election, New York's government said: \\"You may register at your local board of elections or any state agency participating in the National Voter Registration Act, on any business day throughout the year but, to be eligible to vote in the General Election, your application must **be received no later than October 26, 2024**.\\" [https://elections.ny.gov/registration-and-voting-deadlines](https://elections.ny.gov/registration-and-voting-deadlines)In other words, New York did not allow, in this election, anyone to register to vote on election day and then vote that same day. Instead they required registration applications to have arrived before October 26. This means we didn't have same-day voting in this state but still had early voting.I said the measures would not stop election fraud. I did not say that the measures would not reduce fraud.Reducing fraud and making it immensely harder is still better than nothing, and even if the measures don't stop every form of election fraud, it will at least stop basic cheating such as me casting multiple votes at my polling site while claiming each time that I'm someone else.And I said nothing at all specifically about voter ID.This thread is about Donald Trump's plan to adjust voting rules  a plan that includes mandating voter ID.

Casar said Democrats should change course by redirecting such attacks and accusing the GOP of fueling culture wars to distract voters from their agenda of helping the rich get richer.The progressive movement needs to change. We need to re-emphasize core economic issues every time some of these cultural war issues are brought up, Casar said. So when we hear Republicans attacking queer Americans again, I think the progressive response needs to be that a trans person didnt deny your health insurance claim, a big corporation did  with Republican help. We need to connect the dots for people that the Republican Party obsession with these culture war issues is driven by Republicans desire to distract voters and have them look away while Republicans pick their pocket.That means the Democratic Party needs to shed off some of its more corporate elements, to sharpen the economic-populist contrast with Republicans and not let voters equate the two parties, he said. He predicted Trump and the Republican-led Congress will offer plenty of opportunities to drive that distinction, including when it pursues an extension of tax cuts for upper earners.[interview with Greg Casar continues]\\nAdditional commentary on Bluesky:AOC ([link to AOC's account on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social)) reposted [a post](https://bsky.app/profile/susanrinkunas.com/post/3lcop334y5223) that reads:Newly elected Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Greg Casar is already cooking[to add](https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social/post/3lcq5kipmws2g)Im excited for [@gregcasar.bsky.socials](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qmrd2hmucin2ucnfb36hry3y) leadership at the Progressive Caucus.
