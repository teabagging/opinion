He was doing it for political points and it was popular with conservatives but not with centrists or democrats.  \\n   - This shifted when he changed strategy to bussing Migrants to democratic cities like NYC and Chicago.  This had a dramatic impact on democratic voters who started to come out much more heavily against immigration.  At this point Biden pushed congress to pass a bill about immigration and Democrats supported it.  \\n   - That bill was blocked by Trump and his allies who, correctly, predicted that people would still blame Biden as he and democrats have been very supportive of migrants in the past.  \\n  \\nIn addition some major international events caused a wave of migrants  \\n  \\n- Maduro's Venezuela began cracking down hard on the population who felt they would never be able to push him out.

Walking through his campaign promise to launch mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, Trump said: We will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of president Dwight D Eisenhower.    The Eisenhower reference alluded to cold war-era mass deportations conducted by that presidents administration. Carrying the racist name operation wetback, that program resulted in the mass expulsion of nearly 2 million Mexican-Americans without due process in an event that has been widely characterized as a form of ethnic cleansing.\\n.  Tom Homan, who Trump has appointed to strategize his promised mass deportation, warmed up for the president-elect, mocking critics of his anti-immigrant rhetoric. Tom Homans a racist, Tom Homans an asshole, Homan said. Say whatever you want, I dont give a shit.   He promised the president-elect would be a badass and warned the liberal mayors of certain US cities that have promised to resist the mass deportation plan.

In the 15th century?gender?expanded from its use as a term for a grammatical subclass to join?sex?in referring to either of the two primary biological forms of a species, a meaning?sex?has had since the 14th century; phrases like \\"the male sex\\" and \\"the female gender\\" are both grounded in uses established for more than five centuries. In the 20th century?sex?and?gender?each acquired new uses.?Sex?developed its \\"sexual intercourse\\" meaning in the early part of the century (now its more common meaning), and a few decades later?gender?gained a meaning referring to the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex, as in \\"gender roles.\\" Later in the century,?gender?also came to have application in two closely related compound terms:?gender identity?refers to a person's internal sense of being male, female, some combination of male and female, or neither male nor female;?gender expression?refers to the physical and behavioral manifestations of one's gender identity. By the end of the century?gender?by itself was being used as a synonym of?gender identity.\\nAmong those who study gender and sexuality, a clear delineation between?sex?and?gender?is typically prescribed, with?sex?as the preferred term for biological forms, and?gender?limited to its meanings involving behavioral, cultural, and psychological traits. In this dichotomy, the terms?male?and?female?relate only to biological forms (sex), while the terms?masculine/masculinity,?feminine/femininity,?woman/girl, and?man/boy?relate only to psychological and sociocultural traits (gender). This delineation also tends to be observed in technical and medical contexts, with the term?sex?referring to biological forms in such phrases as?sex hormones,?sex organs, and?biological sex. But in nonmedical and nontechnical contexts, there is no clear delineation, and the status of the words remains complicated. Often when comparisons explicitly between male and female people are made, we see the term?gender?employed, with that term dominating in such collocations as?gender differences,?gender gap,?gender equality,?gender bias, and?gender relations. It is likely that?gender?is applied in such contexts because of its psychological and sociocultural meanings, the word's duality making it dually useful. The fact remains that it is often applied in such cases against the prescribed use.\\nUsage of?sex?and?gender?is by no means settled. For example, while?discrimination?was far more often paired with?sex?from the 1960s through the 20th century and into the 21st, the phrase?gender discrimination?has been steadily increasing in use since the 1980s and is on track to become the dominant collocation. Currently both terms are sometimes employed with their intended synonymy made explicit:?sex/gender discrimination,?gender (sex) discrimination.","title":"Trump: 'Woke Is BS'; 'There Are Only 2 Genders'"},{"text":"Hes just always an asshole.

Then when it was Biden's turn to be selected and elevated by the DNC, all of a sudden, he was the steady moderate voice we needed, and everyone else was a far left communist socialist progressive who was going to destroy America with wokeness. Until we get these disgusting neoliberals like Wasserman Schultz and James carville the fuck out of politics, this is how it's going to be for us.","title":"Chris Christie Predicts What Will Cause Demise of Musk-Trump Bromance"},{"text":"Anything \\"right\\" is toxic right now.

Now, the number who care about it as a secondary issue is definitely much higher, but the truth is that what happens in Ukraine or Gaza doesn't really affect most Americans much. That's not to say that people don't care at all, people can and do care deeply about things that don't affect them personally, it's called empathy. And there is some effect on global supply chains from the war in Ukraine specifically, as Ukraine is a major grain exporter and Russia a major petroleum exporter, but let's be honest, most people don't know that. But the average voter cares more about the well-being of themselves, their family, and their community than they do about people living on the other side of the world. This is also why messaging about social issues, democratic backsliding, etc often falls flat, someone struggling to feed their family and pay rent might have strong opinions about those things but many of them will vote for someone who doesn't share those opinions if they think that politician will bring down the cost of living or make it easier to find a high-paying job. There are plenty of people who voted for Obama despite being against abortion and LGBT rights because he campaigned on cutting healthcare costs, and plenty of people who voted for Trump despite supporting those things because they believed him when he said he'd bring costs down.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"The con lives on....Trump will never deport anyone.?","title":"Trump reiterates anti-immigration promise at rightwing convention rally"},{"text":"I agree, the white knighting of Liz Cheney is ridiculous.

And while I agree that it's another reason why a Trump supporter would vote for him, I don't agree that the reason people come here illegally is because the president (whoever that president may be) leaves the border wide open. They come here because there are jobs here that will hire them and look the other way. Period. There are plenty of companies and industries that will give them jobs, underpay them, put them in unsafe conditions, and will continue to do it because they know an illegal immigrant won't complain to the Department of Labor lest they be deported. Over twenty years ago, immigrants were coming here illegally under W, so this issue was all over the news. I worked for a chain restaurant and the kitchen manager literally said he hired Mexicans because they were good workers. He didn't bother to check if they were here legally. He just knew they'd do the work and not complain. They come here because they will find work. Trust and believe, even if a 5,000 foot border wall went up and 10,000 guards were there day and night, the industries that depend on them will find a way to get them here. They'll pay off guards and hire American citizens to transport them if they aren't already. Because otherwise, these industries would have to either automate or hire US citizens who will not work in unsafe conditions for bad pay and no benefits.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"Harriss platform had concrete steps to boost the economy of middle class families.Lowering housing prices through federal intervention, drug cost caps, child care tax credit, and much more.I do agree that Harris didnt get her message out, but the media is all to blame.

They were indoctrinated with the idea that academia, the arts, and political involvement were uncool. The only thing that has value is that which generates capital. They were told education was pointless and creates more problems than it solves. They were told healthcare was a privilege that anyone who works hard enough can afford.So when they are tired working 12 hour shifts and their bad knee is aching and they can't afford to take it day off in the last 16 months, they are angry. Blaming the Republicans is hard, because that would mean admitting they were duped. More importantly, the current administration of the GOP has already considered this.The GOP has created an elusive bogeyman. It is the Devil; if something is bad, they did it. They are also the masters of lying, so you can't trust anything they tell you, even if you agree, even if there is evidence. There is no nuance, you are either with them or against them.Then Trump comes along and tells you he will take you back to the dream you had. It doesn't matter if it exists, because you felt like it did back then. He tells you it isn't your fault. The devil? They are backed by an army of others. All you have to do is give a little power and a bit of humanity and he'll set it right. You don't have to get an education, or get politically involved. You don't need to feel bad that other people seem smarter than you, because you've got folksy wisdom and street smarts and academia is a lie, anyway, they just think they are better than you. All you need to do is sit on your couch, watch your TV, and await further instructions.Then it is just a game of degrees. Sure, you think every human has rights, but you can't let radicals take away the dream. Oh, you have no problem with the LGBTQ folks, but you gotta watch out that they don't use their freedoms to spread the devil's message. Maybe we need to sacrifice a few groups freedoms just until things are set right. Well maybe you can't be loyal to this country if you weren't born here. Maybe social cohesion is more important than bodily autonomy. Ok, we need workers and LGBTQ folks and abortions limit that, so maybe we should curb that a bit. It doesn't take long when everyone is focused on the fantastical utopian dream.And really, the ones running this scam who aren't ideologues just line their pockets and centralize power so they are more entrenched.So, yeah, another possibility is that he coddled the disenfranchised, frustrated, poor, antisocial masses grown by his own party by offering them an imaginary paradise in exchange for just a little bit of inhumanity.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"No it's not.

What they really want is a return to the 1950s when women and people of color knew their damned places and gay people were invisible.Trump is the current chapter in a story that begins (arbitrarily, yes) in the 1960s and 70s. Great social progress was made then. Black people could go anywhere white people went, including your kids schools. Women could get their own credit cards, have jobs, and control their own fertility with the pill. A lot of people were upset about this. They felt the government had betrayed them and their preferred social order.That is when American conservatives turned against government and every policy that might benefit average Americans, because now it included *them*. I refer you to Heather McGhee's book The Sum Of Us and the story about how integrating public pools led to them being drained and permanently filled in.It was around this same time that the NRA went from a gun safety outfit to a gun rights lobbying group. It's around this same time that evangelicals suddenly developed strong feelings about abortion that they had never had before.The modern Republican Party has been one big backlash against the progress made back then. And it still is.Meanwhile, the rest of us become a little more progressive with each passing decade. Next thing you know there's a black family in the white house for eight years. Democrats were certain to put a woman in next. Plus gay people can get married now and you have to treat them like regular people! It was too much.Along comes Trump. His open racism and misogyny indicate for many that finally we have a leader who is willing to stand up to these changes. Finally! Someone who can defend our preferred social order (white supremacy and patriarchy).98% of the vote is baked in and purely tribal. But Trump's brand of politics isn't quite popular enough to win reliably. Not without help. He got that help in 2016 from Comey and Putin. He didn't get it in 2020 and he lost. But he got helped again in 2024 because of post-pandemic inflation.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"would you view the economy as better november 1980 or 1992?I think the economy wasn't great in 1980 when Reagan got elected to his first term.I think the economy was on a good trajectory (albeit with high unemployment from the previous year's recession) in 1992.Lubos Pastor and Pietro Verones have looked at this more than me and probably know more than me on this.

Overall, the US has weathered the storm better than most countries, but its citizens have also seen inflation rise which has impacted real purchasing power.  \\n   - While this could be dismissed as, the US is doing better than other countries, it doesn't change that the country is suffering and people blame the party in charge.  This is true around the world which is why incumbent parties are getting thrashed worldwide.  \\n   - Canada's Trudeau will be voted out when he holds an election as he's one of the least popular world leaders at this time and his ministers are abandoning him.  Germany's Scholz just suffered a vote of no confidence kicking off a new election.  France's government collapsed after Macron's decline has seen his ruling coalition fall apart.  The UK's Tory collapsed in it's worst election in decades as Labour have finally gotten a majority.  Basically, if you were the party in power, you likely saw your support plummet with the public.  \\n  \\n- Concern for a greater war  \\n   - Ukraine had massive support from most Americans after Russia invaded.  However, over the course of 3 years, the support has slowly waned as Americans feel they are spending billions on a war with Russia that is slowly becoming a losing war.  In addition, there is concern that it will lead to greater conflict with Russia.  While I personally don't feel this, the polling data doesn't lie and Americans are tired of supporting the war.  \\n  \\n- Migration  \\n   - The migration crisis hit an all time high after Venezuelan government cracked down hard on its people.  At this point, given the lack of opportunity there, migrants reached a record pace and illegal immigrants began pouring into the US at higher numbers than before.  This was met with deep criticism by Republicans but was not objected by Democrats.  However, Greg Abbott began bussing migrants to Democratic cities to bring the migrant problem to the cities.  This was a morally dubious thing to do and was pure politics.  However, it worked.  As migrants began being moved from Texas to Democratic cities, support for illegal immigrants began dropping in those cities and it became a key issue in the election.  Democrats pivoted and brought about a bill to address this but it was killed by Trump who bet that people would still blame Democrats given their level of support over the past 3 years.  This proved to be true.  \\n   - It's worth noting that migrant crisis' have also had a major impact in European politics as well and seems to push people rightward.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"Yep.

Stop it. I had to click on this one because is such a bold statement, and very clearly from somebody who has just no clue at all how this whole system works with the change of power. The radical right media is already attributing everything that could possibly be construed as good to Donald Trump. Do not be like OP; do not let this confuse you. Trump is NOT president, he is not ACTING president, and he has no powers as president. Trump has the political powers of ONLY the office he CURRENTLY holds. Which is nothing. Fact: trump is GOING TO BE a good president, just like he was last time. But dont let the left make a fool of you because you vocalize your misunderstandings of how the turnover of power works in the executive branch. a few good things, like international negotiations, have happened since Trump was reelected. Trump had nothing to do with any of that, because he cant negotiate or mediate on behalf of our country. That is because he does not legally represent our country, because he is not our president. He will be, but not until next month. Some things that are good might sometimes happen because of a president, before that president actually takes office. This is things like house prices rising, or rent decreasing, or more businesses opening. These things might happen because people have just so much faith in the incoming president. But dont be confused: these things happen because of the incoming president. That is not the same as saying that the incoming president did these things. He did not have any direct action to cause these things, because he has no direct power until he is actually the acting president.","title":"Trump is already President"},{"text":"rhe thing is, is that he still mad money off of it. it was money laundering and getting paid but not taking responsibility for it","title":"Trump vows to rename Denali as Mount McKinley"},{"text":"Egotistical knows no bounds for this moron.

(Currently in Japan) Just read about Trumps team planning to pull out of WHO and honestly, I need to vent about how this could affect our research community. Long Post Warning (Speaking from my experience in one of the marine labs here)First off, this is a pretty big deal for those of us working on marine pharmaceuticals and disease research. My lab collaborates with several US institutions, and WHO funding has been crucial for our joint projects studying bioactive compounds from deep-sea organisms. Weve got some promising leads on anti-inflammatory compounds from sea cucumbers that could help with autoimmune diseases.The thing that really keeps me up at night is how this might affect our emergency response network. Remember that massive harmful algal bloom we had last year? WHOs coordination was essential in getting international experts here quickly. If the US pulls out, thats a HUGE chunk of funding and expertise just... gone.Some Real Talk About What This Means:- Our annual symposium on marine-derived pharmaceuticals (which WHO partially funds) might struggle to continue\\n- Data sharing could become a nightmare - were already seeing hints of this with some US partners getting hesitant about new collaborations\\n- Those fancy new mass spectrometers we were supposed to get through the WHO-coordinated grant? Yeah, that might not happen nowSilver Linings? (trying to stay positive here)Were already talking with other research institutions in S. Korea and Australia about forming a Pacific Rim marine research alliance. Not ideal, but weve got to adapt. Plus, Japanese funding agencies are discussing increasing their international research budgets.Personal Take:\\nHaving worked with both WHO and US DoD funded projects, I can say this move feels like a huge step backward for international scientific cooperation. Science shouldnt be political, yet here we are. ?\\nTL;DR: US potentially leaving WHO could mess up international marine biology research. Were worried but trying to find alternative ways to keep the science going.

They did so while sustaining no losses themselves. At the very least it shows they can violate Irans air space with impunity which, if you think about it, means that Irans air defenses arent worth much, doesnt it?

You keep asking how Musk can support Ukraine but also be a Russian asset. Its easy. There is no better side for Putin to be on than many sides. The same goes for people like Elon.Its the same way that Biden is frail and also a mastermind. Or how Republicans are for the people in their words but in their actions are for the wealthy. Or how its a uni party but also theres two sides and one is evil. Or how democrats are socialists but also in the pocket of billionaires. Or how Elon is a brilliant self made genius capitalist but also the recipient of BILLIONS in kick backs and tax payer funds. Or how Soros is evil but Elon is good. Or how Elon is a great thinker but often disseminates obviously and sometimes hilariously wrong disinformation from a wide range of topics from known bad actors. Is he typically ignorant of these things or simply playing dumb?Its a common political tool of authoritarianism and in this case definitive fascism. It really isnt that mysterious. The 20th century was filled with this type of strong but weak, hero but villain, rich but poor, smart but dumb type rhetoric and propaganda. You can find it in most mid century political speeches. Its honestly more prevalent today than it ever was before. The point isnt to see two delineated sides. The point is to manufacture any side that can divide.From this perspective, someone like Elon can say whatever he wants and mostly do whatever he wants and fall back on the last thing that supports whatever the current action or quote turns out to be. Thats what post-truth means. Its what a firehose of falsehood is and its what were experiencing now in, literally, hundreds of manufactured hot button issues. Theres a spectrum of disinformation to choose from.So is this singular instance about Starlink and Crimea incorrect? Seems it is embellished for both the gain and detriment of certain parties. Does that answer mean he isnt or wasnt either ignorant or playing dumb as an opportunist on so many other topics/moments since? No. Most likely he is at least partially playing dumb as part of a toolset we all know drives the public discourse. Controversy and anger. Can he support both sides? Absolutely! Whatever is in HIS best interest.Thats the thing that weve been spiraling towards for a long time. Its what the last SEVERAL decades have shown to be the destination. Complete oligarchical control over OUR interests. Much of this current theater is designed to wrest what little is left for the remainder. Upheaval for the sake of selling off what can be sold and placing it into private hands. Crash the system to buy it on the cheap. Its what happened in Russia and it should come as no surprise that the super rich would look to that example as a goal.Those that are actually playing this game arent here to make things better for the rest of us.

Evangelical conservative Christianity needs to get out of politics due to its bigoted and controlling nature that it often exhibits, but we must keep in mind that not every religion or church that exerts influence on American politics is as regressive and conservative as groups like the Southern Baptists or the LDS/Mormon Church.For example, many southern African American communities are deeply religious and they use their religious beliefs as their basis for political activism like ending racial discrimination or fighting poverty. Are they more socially conservative than your average secular liberal? Usually by a decent amount, but nowhere near the open vitriol spewed by conservative Christians.There are also more progressive churches like the ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America), which Tim Walz is a member of, and the United Methodist Church (post-schism anyway now that the homophobes are gone). These churches are in free fall membership wise because mainline Protestant Christianity has been declining for years in favor of unaffiliated stances or evangelical Christianity, but they have historically advocated for social justice and been at the forefront of the social causes of their time. I actually think that if these churches had more influence on politics the country might be in a better place.The main takeaway here is that American Christian traditions are diverse and shouldnt be lumped in with conservative evangelicals.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 22, 2024"},{"text":"Will you require that GMC change the name of their Denali product line to McKinley, as well?","title":"Trump vows to rename Denali as Mount McKinley"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|3o6ZsZdSYO2P4rvUOc)","title":"Deranged Musk crashing Bezos dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lardo"},{"text":"Yes mam and push pelosi and anyone who isnt on board out of the picture","title":"Rep.

When he said a new law in Maine, and similar laws elsewhere, provide legal immunity for people who mutilate children, she replied, Absolutely, and said the laws allow states to refuse to extradite their physicians to another state for prosecution, which, by the way, violates the Constitution. [...] And when asked by Fox News host Laura Ingraham in 2022 whether teachers were using Californias law as a recruitment tool for transgender children, Dhillon replied, A hundred percent.Has Dhillon seen any grade school classroom lately? Teachers can't even get the kids already there to pay attention.","title":"A states' rights legal war is brewing.

The legislation that was stripped out was just gender-affirming care for trans minors in military families. That's pretty much a subset within a subset with [estimates ranging from 4,000 to 10,000 affected kids](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/defense-trans-minors-care-ban-bill-military-families-rcna184156). A small and temporary price to pay for not shutting down the government. No rights were affected, just funding. Sorry but not sorry. It's a numbers game, and Democrats did not have the upper hand on this.And before you know it, in 4 years, all of the advances and wins we've made for LGBT folks have been repealed or gutted because Democrats found themselves unwilling to stand for them.That's the kind of wild speculation that Republicans engage in with gun control and abortion. Don't be an extremist Republican.At the minimum, Democrats shouldn't have voted along with Republicans to strip Trans kids of their healthcare, if Republicans want to do that they can own it themselves.Again, it's trans minors within military families, and it only affects gender-affirming care, not general healthcare. It's a divided Congress with slim margins in both chambers. Both sides needed to compromise and were not going to get everything on their wish list. As expected, the fringe members from Democrats and Republicans voted against the House bill, which means that it was good for the majority of Americans. Like it or not, America is pretty center-right and shutting down the government so 4k-10k trans minors in military families to government-paid gender-affirming care would have been bad for Democrats.","title":"Rep.

The president can influence legislation through veto power (rejecting bills passed by Congress), proposing budgets, and recommending legislation, but cannot directly instruct or control Congress.**The president can encourage or lobby Congress to pass specific laws, but ultimately, it is Congress that decides whether or not to enact those proposals. The president can also issue executive orders, but these apply to the executive branch and cannot compel legislative action by Congress.\\"*","title":"House Republicans just exposed the limits of Trumps power: That bodes poorly for his agenda next year."},{"text":"That's the one question the median voter can be trusted to never, ever ask.","title":"Mike Johnson asked Elon Musk if he wants to be Speaker of the House"},{"text":"is his Mom Cass Elliott?

It isn't a punishment, but sharing in the growth you have created.When you earn an income from your labor and services you are increasing the wealth of the country and the government is taking part of that production to help pay for services.  A tax on nonproductive income is a burden or punishment in some way.Inheritance, like gifts, are not producing any value, just transferring from one person to another.  If you give a \\"gift\\" in response to someone doing work for you then it isn't a gift, but an income.  If it is purely a gift, like a toy for your child, then nothing of value was created (except the smiles and joy).  Smiles and joy are not counted in the GDP.If the gift is not in exchange for services and is truly a gift then there should be no tax.Imagine the extreme case where you and I gift each other $20 back and forth every week.  Should there be a tax on that $20?  No, because we didn't add any value to the economy.

Granted, having first-termers run things isn't a great idea either, but say a priority order like 2nd term, 1st, 3rd, 4th, etc and you'd immediately have a system where states would be no worse off selecting a new candidate after 12 years, and better off after 18 - so there'd be little reason to keep a senator after that unless they were very good and popular.But mandated term limits are dumb and undemocratic.

The US is tyranny of the minority.Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats do so badly among men that the fact that we dont do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant. And thats more or less where it lies.The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to mens has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism. **Republicans cant win women; when they win, they win without them, by winning with men.**https://srpubliclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/JillLepore.pdf","title":"DNC fundraiser says Democrats have 'stench of loser' hanging over party following defeat to Trump"},{"text":"He's got brain damage.","title":"Fetterman: Kash Patel Told Me He Wont Go After Trumps Enemies List"},{"text":"Yup, explains everything in one simple post there.","title":"Why is Trump mad at Panama?

It was not given for the benefit of others, but merely as a token of cooperation with us and Panama.If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question.**Read more here:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/12/22/donald-trump-threatens-to-seize-control-of-panama-canal/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/12/22/donald-trump-threatens-to-seize-control-of-panama-canal/)","title":"Donald Trump threatens to seize control of Panama Canal unless it lowers prices for US"},{"text":"You never address the core part of my previous comment, and with that I bid you adieu.","title":"It Will Be a More Robust Check on Trump Than the G.O.P.

Im far left, and Ill be the first to tell you the Democrats are a neoliberal dumpster fire. But blaming uber far-left policies for election losses is fucking ridiculous when the party barely does anything remotely leftist. Show me the national rent control, the universal healthcare, or the massive redistribution of wealth that supposedly scared off voters, oh wait, that doesnt exist. What youre really mad at is performative progressivism with no teeth, and guess what? So are we. Lets talk about NY. The shift to the right wasnt because of some magical leftist overreach, it was Democrats completely fuckinging up their messaging on crime and ignoring local issues. Republicans rolled in with their fearmongering playbook, and Dems just stood there like, But Trump! Voters werent buying it, and honestly, I cant blame them. If the Democrats had balls (or spines), theyd actually pass policies that materially improve peoples lives instead of leaning on culture wars and hoping well all vote blue out of fear. \\nNow, about the economy. Youre right, people are pissed, and they should be. Inflation is eating everyone alive, wages still suck for most folks, and housing is a nightmare. But acting like Republicans would fix any of that is hilarious. GOP economic policy is just tax cuts for billionaires and vibes. At least Dems occasionally pretend to care about working people. The real solution? Burn the whole damn system down and build something that actually works for regular people. \\nAs for Trump and Musk being \\"boogeymen\\"? Come on. Trump literally tried to overturn an election and Musk is turning X into a fascist playground. Criticizing them isnt some Dem fundraising strategy, its acknowledging that these dudes are actively dangerous.

IMO one of the main issues is employer sponsored health insurance. They dont really care about the *quality* of what theyre buying for their employees, they just want to be able to *say* that they offer health insurance in order to attract worker talent. When the health insurance companies deny a bunch of claims, thats keeping the costs down for the employers who then dont catch flack for cheaping out (bc its the insurance company who is technically the bad guy) but employers arent going to up and leave the insurers who provide bad services bc it doesnt matter to them, what matters is that they can offer a competitive compensation package for the lowest cost possible","title":"Trump says he might demand Panama hand over canal"},{"text":"Yeah, I know.

Here's how it all went down in plain terms:The French started the project in the 1880s under Ferdinand de Lesseps, who had successfully built the Suez Canal. They thought it would be a similar job, but they underestimated how tough the terrain and climate were. Workers were dying by the thousands from diseases like yellow fever and malaria, and their funds ran out. By the 1890s, the French effort had collapsed.The United States picked up where the French left off in 1904. They poured in money, workers, and engineering know-how to make it happen. To solve the disease problem, they sent Dr. William C. Gorgas to get rid of mosquitoes, which spread deadly diseases. They also brought in engineers like George Washington Goethals, who figured out how to build locks to lift ships over the tricky terrain.\\nThe U.S. paid for the construction, which cost about $375 million (over $10 billion in today's dollars). This made it the most expensive construction project of its time, but it was worth it because the canal transformed global trade. It officially opened in 1914 and was under U.S. control until Panama took over in 1999.","title":"Trump Bizarrely Threatens to Take Back Panama Canal"},{"text":"Thats funny because no one asked her to do it in the first place!

And did Democrats in power did this weird thing, where they didn't say a word. They took this attitude like \\" we don't need to say anything, we are going to let the Republicans hypocrisy speak for itself. Just keep our heads down, say nothing, The voters are smart and will understand what's going on.\\"So when Mitch McConnell filibustered his own bill, And they refuse to seat a Supreme Court judge, and things like that, the Democrats refused to use those things in their messaging. They refused to speak ill of their Republican friends. They insisted on bipartisan unity. They used friendly language and talked about reaching across the aisle. So, the American public really didn't know what was going on and thought that Republicans were doing a great job and everything was wonderful and if things didn't get done it's because Obama couldn't do it. Meanwhile, if Obama wore a tan suit, Republicans would blast it in the media for days. An abomination to America, the most disrespectful thing that's ever happened on American soil, and an affront To the dignity of our troops. Republicans bring a gun to a knife fight, and Democrats show up to the knife fight with a scroll of praise for their dear Republican opponents. And then, when the Republican destroys the Democrat in front of everyone, the Democrat. Thanks the Republican for their friendship and unity, and the Republican goes off to the media to scream about how the Democrat wasted taxpayer dollars. Back in the '90s, Democrats really thought that voters would see Republican hypocrisy on full display, and would never stand for that lack of morality. They just never pushed back, they allowed it.","title":"The great capitulation: why key US figures are seeking Trumps favor"},{"text":"I don't know if you've noticed, but Washington is all about super old dinosaurs running cover for super old dinosaurs, in both parties.","title":"Texas Rep.

Altman also donated $1 million to Trumps inaugural fund, with Zuckerberg announcing similar plans to strengthen his ties with the president-elect.Im speaking as a Democrat myself, this brings me no joy to say it. I feel like the Democrats are going to be consigned to the wilderness for at least the next four to eight years and Jeff Bezos is probably thanking his lucky stars that he withheld that endorsement, Li said. Theyre doing everything they can now to continue the dtente.?Bezos ended presidential endorsements by the Washington Post, which he bought in 2013, shortly before Election Day this year. The decision angered some liberal staffers and reporters who were eager to throw the papers official position behind Vice President Kamala Harris.When asked about the reaction of the tech industry as a whole to Trumps victory, Li said that they are excited about his incoming administrationI think the tech world is loving the fact that Donald Trump is going to be the next president, Li said. Hes really embraced crypto. Hes saying that he wants the United States to be the crypto capital of the world.?Li also spoke on the rising unpopularity of key Democratic Party policies, including addressing illegal immigration, saying that voters are fed up with Democrats.?Im speaking as an immigrant, Li said.

Members of Trumps team told the experts of their intention to announce a withdrawal from the global health body on the president-elects January 20 inauguration. The departure would remove the WHOs biggest source of funds, damaging its ability to respond to public health crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. America is going to leave a huge vacuum in global health financing and leadership. I see no one that is going to fill the breach, said Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health at Georgetown Law, adding that the plan to withdraw on day one would be catastrophic for global health.? The battle over US relations with the WHO comes after Trump nominated several allies, such as vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy, for top health jobs in the next administration. However, Gostin said he was not sure that Trump would place as high a priority on an immediate withdrawal as some in his team. The US is the WHOs largest single donor, providing about 16 per cent of its funding in 2022-23.? In 2020, Trump initiated the process to leave the WHO as Covid-19 spread, accusing the agency of being under Chinas control. But the process was never finished and his successor Joe Biden restarted relations with the agency on his first day of office in 2021.? Experts have been told that some in Trumps team want to move much faster this time around after initiating the process immediately. Ashish Jha, Bidens former White House Covid response co-ordinator and dean of Brown Universitys school of public health, said the transition team wanted Trump to withdraw on the first day because of the symbolism of reversing Bidens own inauguration-day move.? There are lots of people who are going to be part of the inner circle of the administration who do not trust the WHO and want to symbolically show on day one that they are out, he said.? He added that some in the team wanted to stay in the organisation and push to reform it, but another group who believed in cutting ties was winning the argument.? Bodies such as the WHO are key to global co-operation on vaccine development and distribution as well as other treatments during health emergencies, said Jha.? If youre not engaged in these institutions, you do not have ears to the ground when the next outbreak happens, he warned.? Gostin said there would be very lean years for the WHO where it will struggle to respond to health emergencies and will have to reduce its scientific staff considerably.? He warned that if the US left the WHO, European countries were unlikely to step up funding and China might try to wield more influence. It would not be a smart move as withdrawal would cede leadership to China, he said.? The Trump transition team did not comment directly on the potential withdrawal. One person familiar with the plans told the Financial Times: The same WHO that we left in the first administration? It seems like we wouldnt much care what they have to say. The WHO did not comment. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the bodys director-general, said this month that it was a unique organisation that hoped to partner with US policymakers.? From our side, were ready to work together, he said. I believe US leaders understand that the US cannot be safe unless the rest of the world is safe.?","title":"Donald Trumps transition team seeks to pull US out of WHO on day one"},{"text":"Oh dang.

Study after study shows that 10% of people at most consistently and robustly opposed this, while the rest oppose it only when they think they won't be the ones on top. The purpose of government, therefore is to be structured to resist this trend. Government must resist that tendency within itself but also be powerful enough to prevent a more coercive force from taking over (which includes local criminal elements).\\nThe policing and court functions you identify are such necessary government.

After leaving his role in the Administration Jared began managing $3 Billion in funds for the Saudis. His Father in law got to have a Championship with LIV golf.

Progressive Democrats hate him, but the reality is that he was just the cartoonish stereotype of what folks think of as a politician. Want your bill passed?  Then it better do something to enrich him, his family, or his district.  So long as Manchin got his treat, he almost always voted with the party.  Couldnt find or justify a special bit of fat just for him?  Well, as a Senator from a red district he all of a sudden found it very hard to support the bill. With that narrow of a majority in the House, and with he inability of the Republican Party to whip 100% of votes, any member that has a personal issue they want addressed in a particular bill *has* to be taken seriously or they can almost single handedly wreck a bill. Tariffs are a simple example of how it will likely all fall apart. Every Republican member of the House will be able to agree on a number of big ticket, stick it to China categories of products that are a good idea to impose massive tariffs on. The problem is, each member will also have a specific set of products that theyll want excluded, whether thats because its super important to their district or because its important to their familys or their big donors businesses.  Itll be impossible to get all of them to agree on what deserves an exception, and so *at least 3* members wont vote for it. Congrats, bill doesnt pass now.","title":"House Republicans just exposed the limits of Trumps power: That bodes poorly for his agenda next year."},{"text":"Your comment exemplifies a lot of current issues with liberals.
