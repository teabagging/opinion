You can give all the stats and rationale you want, but the fact is that people know their grocery bill is 25-30% higher than it was under Trump.

You can say whatever you want about them and their privilege, and regardless of how ridiculous it may sound- the truth is they feel marginalized.Third, the Democrat read on minorities was way off. Many of them are conservative. Theres also an inherent racism that Trump saying something bad about illegal immigrants means that anyone of Hispanic descent will automatically go blue. Also it seemed like it was assumed that black men were an automatic vote for Harris, and that wasnt the case. Minority groups arent a monolith.Fourth, Harris was already at a disadvantage with the short campaign. And she was caught between trying to tie herself to the administration to get some credit for what Biden has done and appear like she has experience, but at the same time trying to distance herself from a president with an abysmal approval rating.Thats why she lost.

Who ends up holding the bag when that happens. The majority of Americans. Foreign policy. We are expecting a war within 5 years. When has a democratic president ever shown courage to make tough decisions? Ukraine, Gaza/Israel, china/Taiwan, not a peep. And these regions are escalating. Instead of trying to say democracy is under fire, or Trump is a terrible human being, or OMG he is a convicted felon, try speaking to how you are going to fix real world issues.

Even though Trump torpedoed the Border Bill, the rhetoric for years from Democrats was to allow illegal immigrants to have an easier time coming in and a path to censorship.  The recent change helped but it was too late to change people's views on Democrats.  \\n* Harris did awful during the Fox News interview.  Yes, it was a hostile interview but she should have known that going into it and had strong answers prepped.  Most of her answers were non-answers.  Given more undecided voters watch Fox than other news channels her waffling looked bad.  I understand Trump also doesn't give answers but if the goal is to show that you have good answers, while he doesn't, you need to actually have answers.  \\n* Democrats have made race, gender, and trans movements a big part of their messaging and it alienates a large part of the population.  The Trans movement does not have that much public support other than lip service and is heavily pushed back by conservatives and even moderates who have largely rejected gender neutral language terms such as they/them or Latinx.  If you need a clear example of the level of actual support the Trans movement gets, Hogwarts Legacy saw one of the largest reactions from the Trans community who attempted to get people to boycott the game and ostracize streamers who played it.  The game ended up the top selling game that year.  I'm not saying Democrats can't support those causes but they need to stop making them a central point in their messaging as it doesn't connect with the majority of Americans.  \\n* Harris is a lot like Hillary in that she isn't a politician who has held a strong stance on anything.  Her track record has shown her go back and forth a lot.  So, her campaign doesn't really have a strong platform to invigorate people.  It was mostly about not being Trump and being a rational person (which should be enough but that doesn't convince people to vote).","title":"Early election takeaways: Trump weakens Democrats coalition"},{"text":"This is why we call the liberal media \\"fake news\\".I\`m concinved all the polls showing a tight race or kamala leading were made up in order to make it look like Kamala actually had a chance at winning.","title":"Donald Trump Defeats Kamala Harris, Wins Back The White House"},{"text":"For what.

Many people Ive spoken withboth Republicans and Democratsfeel that the strongest female candidate would be someone with a background in governance, such as a governor or a military leader.Currently, the only two Democratic female politicians who would resonate as authentic leaders, rather than appearing fake or power grabbing, would be Gretchen Whitmer and Tulsi Gabbard. Unfortunately, Gabbard left the Democratic Party because of the extreme shift, but she likely would have been the strongest female contender for the presidency and I believe may have beat Trump. *I am neither a Dem nor Rep and did not vote this election cycle.","title":"Unpopular opinion, dont hang me for this."},{"text":"You sound like you've never even set foot on a campus, so how tf would you know?","title":"Jill Biden wore all red to vote"},{"text":"I was wondering why theyre just stayin gray.

The michigan arabs are voting for Trump because they think Trump was the friend of Palestine and would have stopped Netanyahu for going at Gaza after Hamas terror. For any objective person thats not real - his wives are from Eastern Europe and he still doesnt give two hoots about Ukraine. He definitely doesnt care more about Gaza. Black men voted against Harris because they believed Trumps claims that she will jail them more than the guy who wanted to unleash military on BLM protesters. She was the one bailing out those protesters. Sometimes people can vote against their best interests because someone convinces them to do so.","title":"It's not merely a loss for the Democrats.

Namely, we were ranting about immigration and how we need more of it. They approached it from a perspective that the US was falling behind technologically compared to the rest of the world, I approached it from the sense that immigration is just a net benefit in all aspects. But we agreed on the fundamentals - immigrants provide strong entrepreneurialship, are more invested in the success of the country they immigrate to, and generally aren't such lazy gits as nativists. I don't think he was sucking up to me either, I think we genuinely agree on this. I was honestly a bit surprised to hear this coming from this particular coworker's mouth, but in retrospect, I've been having some moments where coworkers have been telling me, \\"oh, this coworker said such and such to me, lol\\" and my response has been, \\"honestly, half of what they're saying is totally true.\\" It's just the funniest thing to me that we present very differently from each other - this coworker is, as I mentioned, basically a hippie with a rather rebellious streak, and I'm the pro-capitalist in our company making defenses for a lot of business practices. Hell, I basically play the villain half the time internally, this is the Bay Area, I'm an outsider. But we still agree on so many things, it's honestly incredible. The rest of my coworkers generally look up to him as a font of knowledge and, while I've had much less experience at the company, they also appreciate what I bring to the table as well, especially since it's a different approach from what they're used to. But that just makes the fact that we agree on a surprising number of things all the more convincing for everyone that those are good lessons.

I think this is a hard hard pill to swallow for many people in this sub. How do Dems get away/de-emphasize from those polarizing cultural issues when they originate in the primary voters? One related advantage of the Repub electorate that I'm not sure how to instill in the Dems is they're willing to let Trump say whatever he needs to say even if it's critical or in opposition to their interests or flat out insane - something about a widely held coalition mindset that they/he needs to 'fight dirty.'Will have to wait for data but some of the demographic loses in some areas were pretty unexpected.

A list of Trump's actions that attacked public lands:  \\n    https://www.npca.org/articles/2171-the-undoing-of-our-public-lands-and-national-parks    President Trump and the officials he appointed systematically undermined, degraded and outright attacked the laws that protect our public lands, the agencies that manage them and the irreplaceable resources these places safeguard for the American people. 2. https://www.americanprogress.org/article/anti-nature-president-u-s-history/      President Trump has removed protections from more U.S. lands than President Teddy Roosevelt protected as parks and monuments.      President Donald Trump has thrown in reverse the United States proud, bipartisan record of nature conservation. Unlike every modern-day U.S. president before him who helped build up Americas awe-inspiring system of public lands and waters, President Trump has pursued an agenda aimed at removing protections from vast swaths of public lands and waters. In fact, President Trump is the only president in U.S. history to have removed more public lands than he protected.3. https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-2-0-would-bring-whiplash-to-interior-department/      Former President Donald Trump has promised on the campaign trail to take a sledgehammer to the Biden administrations energy and environmental policies.  That means the Interior Department  a vast agency that oversees public lands, the national parks, Western water conservation and endangered species protections  is sure to witness drastic policy shifts if Trump reclaims the White House in January.4. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/28/trump-oil-national-parks-wildlife-election      Indeed, early plans suggest that Trump aims to radically remake the Department of the Interior, which oversees more than 500m acres (200m hectares) of public lands, manages the countrys national parks and wildlife refuges, and is responsible for protecting endangered species. Whereas Joe Biden made safeguarding public lands and the transition to green energy a centerpiece of his time in office, Trump and his allies would reverse many of Bidens policies, remake the civil service and implement a new agenda focused on slashing regulations, weakening environmental protections, and expanding oil and gas development across the American west.5. https://suwa.org/trumps-assault-utah-monuments-leaves-millions-acres-limbo/      President Trumps repeal of Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments on December 4, 2017 represents the single greatest attack a president has ever launched against Americas federal public lands. With the stroke of a pen, Grand Staircase was slashed by 47 percent, with about 1 million acres remaining, and Bears Ears was decimated, its 1.35 million acres reduced by 83 percent to just 229,000 acres.6. https://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article294668454.html    When Donald Trump was president in 2019, he attempted to open up 1 million acres of federal land near Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks to fracking.\\nThe list goes on and on ...","title":"Kamala Harris wins Colorado"},{"text":"NC had no problem getting rid of Robinson.

Blind Freddie could see that the mass migration is what has been pushing the USA, hell the Western world to the far right. If Biden did that one major concession to the Liberal moderates and the right, Trump would not have the same incentive to be voted in again. But no, they just opened up the border again and even the most fervent Democrat can see it was their weakest talking point against him. The fact they risked so much and didn't realise what they needed to do to win this election (and didn't even try to resolve it) until this year is just pitiful. The next election the Democrats have to find a candidate that appeals to the New American left that is forming and also its Liberal base. Liberal on social issues, Left leaning on economic issues to do with SoL and to have a closed border to migration. It needs to do something along these lines or we are going to be in an extremely, potentially fatal place by the end of this decade.","title":"Early election takeaways: Trump weakens Democrats' coalition"},{"text":"The Tory strategy.

Well I am.\\nLet's make some things clear. Once upon a time in the 90s Palestinians could easily go from the west bank and gaza even to the Tel Aviv beach - everywhere they want in Israel. Then the peace talks stalled and they started the intifada and started blowing themselves up everyday in buses and restaurants. This is why the checkposts exist. It's not for \\"occupation\\", it's not for \\"fun\\", the army is there because when it's not there a Palestinian will come and he will stab to death every Jewish man, woman and child he can put his hands on. It is still a daily accurance,  but with the army there the numbers are down significally. I've seen quite a few Palestinian protests.  They are not peaceful, not even close. Like their whole thing is violent resistance dude why would their protests be peaceful? Haven't you noticed the David slings? The tire burning? The rock throwing? The absolute vile hate filled rhetorics they scream into their megaphones? Well perhaps you just didn't understood the language...Look at the map, every tiny(And most of them are tiny) Israeli settlement is surrounded with huge arab villages. Literally just open Google maps and just look. There are 500k Israelis and 2M Palestinians in the west bank, explain to me how does the math work out when every arab village is surrounded by huge israeli cities as you claim?\\"Israel took more than the UN allowed it to\\"? Only Israel agreed to the UN partition plan, if you reject a plan and attack a country you are not the victim when you lose land. You cannot come later and cry \\"but the plan!\\".I'm sorry the ratio of dead Israelis and Palestinian isn't 1:1, this is what happens when one side builds the iron dome and bomb shelters at every house, and the other uses human shields. Absolutely no way you had \\"guns drawn on you\\" because you move too slow. You are full of shit buddy. As to the soldiers - Israel has mandatory serving, some idiots who do stupid and shameful things will get through with mandatory inscription. The IDF is cracking down on stuff like that and the soldiers who film this shit are jailed. I think that's fair.

A rapid and unanticipated rise in rhetoric and threats stemming from disinformation about the purpose of the event and its proximity to Election Day contributed to the decision to postpone.Out of an abundance of caution and because a number of government agencies are unable to participate, we made this difficult decision so that we can deliver a high-quality and meaningful event, with deep and rich engagement across industry, government and academia, and full participation by all stakeholders. We apologize for the inconvenience and are exploring options to reschedule the event. We will reach out directly to all participants with details, including information about transferring existing exhibits, registrations and sponsorships.

I Dont have the energy to get into details because its exhausting to hear accounts from people who barely spent time there and have 1 sided opinion. Read the Islamic manifestos and youll get an idea of why the west is so anti Israel. Its literally all in the plan because radical Islam believes the West is a parasite living in sin and needs to be radicalized to Islam and Jews need to be exterminated. Islam colonized the Levant (area known as Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iran, etc. look up the history of Iran - it was not originally Muslim. The actual genocide is anyone who is not Muslim or gay or feminist in Islam is thought to deserve jail, murder, rape or death. Thats why Israel is often called the only democracy. Why do you think these countries dont take in Palestinians or claim Gaza back?  its because they Dont want radical Islamic terrorists in their countries. Thats why the refugees are going to Europe. And guess what, Sweden now has terrorism and gang violence as bad as Mexicos cartel violence and is now offering $34k per person for migrants to go back where they arrived from. Its that bad! The west is so gullible and I feel sorry for anyone who doesnt do the research and supports terrorist regimes.Israel took out most of the people on the US terrorist lists for the past 20 yrs. And they did it in 2 weeks.Foreign policy experts say Israel is doing the dirty work for every one else, just so those same people can say they are terrorizing people. Its a joke. Oh but the joke isnt so funny when you realize the orgs established for peace like the UN are actually literally funding, and funded by these same terrorist orgs. All this is Google-able. So of course the west thinks free Palestine is the answer. The media and marketing says so because peace keeping orgs actually have a vested interest ($$$$$) in keeping Israel the enemy to line their pockets.
