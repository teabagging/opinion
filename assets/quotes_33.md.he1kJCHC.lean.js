The Mongol Empire and its parts (after the original empire's division) existed for 3 centuries (beg. 13th-beg. 16th) and exerted immense influence on conquered territories. You can find their cultural influences in Eastern European languages and cultures even today. In China, Mongols destroyed the Song Dynasty (one of the most successful, advanced, and enlightened Chinese dynasties of the medieval period) and established the Yuan Dynasty, which successfully unified China and even managed to conquer Tibet (these were important historical goals for various native Chinese dynasties). The Yuan dynasty instituted numerous discriminatory policies against non-Mongols. Only by the end of the Mongol reign, native Chinese were able to achieve high government posts.Mesopotamia, one of the most important civilisation centres, lost almost all its population and civilisation due to the Mongols. The region has not been able to recover up to this day.The Islamic world also experienced massive changes. The Iranian plateau was depopulated and suffered from cultural and technological decline. Modern Iran can be traced to the Ilkhanate, a Mongol khanate, formerly part of the Mongol Empire.Mongols were also heavily involved in the international slave trade. They expanded already existing slave trade networks from Northern Africa to the Far East. Only the Yuan dynasty attempted to limit the slave trade in China, but not significantly.It is also speculated that the destruction caused by Mongols contributed to the Little Ice Age. This hypothesis states that Mongol invasions eliminated agricultural activity on such a vast scale that once the land was reclaimed by nature temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere dropped by 0.6C.I do not agree with the OP, but your view that the Mongol Empire was short-lived and did not have lasting effects on conquered peoples and territories is wrong.","title":"Cmv: the Mongol invasions are the worst thing to ever happen"},{"text":"Broken clock rightWorst person you know has a point?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Redditors would have been pro Chinese exclusion act if those goobers had been alive back then.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"??the dizziest bitch in this thread","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I think it's just a symptom of \\"doesn't eat enough food and frequently forgets to eat\\".","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Yeah no thats a common white nationalist racist trope.","title":"Cmv: the Mongol invasions are the worst thing to ever happen"},{"text":"You will always have abuse.

It's phrased as such because the majority of historical accounts are from Muslim historians at the time who were A) unsurprisingly biased since they were on the side being conquered and B) influenced by the Mongol's own propaganda as the mongols used a lot of scorched earth tactics, especially when it came to agriculture, in order to convince cities to capitulate without much or no bloodshed. Mongols didn't record events from their perspective as the majority weren't even literate, so the majority of accounts are from the other side. The only solid yet potentially also biased account from the Mongols is the Secret History. Many historians from the time cite ridiculous casualty figures in the millions to tens of millions over 2-3 years conquests or even shorter spans, when the largest mongol army during any given conquest is estimated at no more than 240,000. The average number of people a single mongol would have to kill during a conquest is exceptionally high in addition to the fact that some estimates are higher than the population density of the areas of conquest. The  Nazis industrialized mass genocide and even they could only murder 11 million over 4 years. Now it's possible that the numbers could've been indirectly higher due to famine because the mongols destroyed wide scale areas of farm land as they conquered to ensure that the land on the treks back to the mongol interior reverted to pasture to feed their horses, but I've yet to read an account that mentions any such numbers.","title":"Cmv: the Mongol invasions are the worst thing to ever happen"},{"text":"It seems OP doesn't have a solid understanding of the totality of the destruction caused by the Transatlantic slave trade.

And race is sadly one of those marking characteristics for power, for those who are similar to you can more readily become your ally, and outward appearance is the first gate to social interaction.\\nThis is part of the reason why some activists from underprivileged racial group give up the word. They need allies, but cannot draw enough power from their own, more specified racial group.\\nAnd this is more of a side note but the boundaries of racial groups are rather blurry to be honest. Racial groups like black asians exist. Where would they stand? With blacks, or Asians? And to be more nitpicking, what is being Asian anyways? Thai, Singapore, Japan, Korea, China, they are all different yet they are more readily golrouoed together. Same deal for blacks too. If you feel bad because people of color unjustly groups people together then you should also feel the same for names like black and Asian and then this rabbit hole leads to the point where racial groupings cease to be useful. But these groupings do give us some insight into the social structures of our time. For example there are plenty of research documenting difficulties of living in the states as a black person.

Youve got many interesting points about general history, and Im happy to provide a regionally focused perspective. While I agree that the Mongol Empire caused immense damage to many regions, from a Chinese perspective, its also worth acknowledging some of the ways it influenced the development of modern China.After the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, China was fragmented into multiple regional powers. Under the [Yuan Dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty) (the Mongol Empires rule in China), the Mongols brought these regions together, laying the foundation for later dynasties to conceptualize the entire territory as a unified entity. This idea of a cohesive China has had a lasting impact, shaping subsequent dynasties and even the governance of the current CCP, particularly in terms of the economic and political advantages of managing such a vast and unified territory. While I wouldnt argue that CCP China is positive overall, the economic benefits of this unity are undeniable.Moreover, the Mongol rulers in China allowed for greater freedom of cultural expression compared to many other Chinese dynasties, possibly due to their less interventionist approach to local affairs. This environment fostered a flourishing of the arts, particularly in forms like [Yuan qu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_(poetry)) (Yuan Dynasty songs and drama), which remain celebrated as significant cultural achievements in modern times.","title":"Cmv: the Mongol invasions are the worst thing to ever happen"},{"text":"You could have a true free market where infrastructure would be developed and maintained by individuals and businesses motivated by mutual benefit, not by a faceless, coercive institution.What is a business if not faceless and coercive?","title":"CMV: Government is an illusion"},{"text":"AFAIK there's an ongoing debate as to whether, and if so which, dinosaurs were warm blooded.

The reason the mongol invasions are looked at more favorably than the holocaust is because *the invasions happened over 700 years ago*.

Their campaigns were catastrophic, and the suffering they inflicted was immense and inexcusable by any moral standard.What the Mongols did was undeniably horrific. But we have to remember that in their time, extreme violence was a common strategy for empire-building. The Assyrians, Romans, and even the Crusaders committed similarly brutal acts. What makes the Mongols stand out is the scale, not the intention. Understanding this doesnt justify their actionsit just helps us place them in the context of history.You mentioned that if the Mongols had done this to Western Europe, people wouldn't consider them to have had any positive impact. But thats exactly what happens when we examine the Roman Empire. Romans enslaved millions, crucified dissenters, and wiped out entire culturesyet we often glorify them because they left a legacy that shaped the Western world. It's a double standard, isn't it?Acknowledging the Mongols' contributionslike the revitalization of trade, the spread of technology, or their meritocratic governancedoesnt erase their crimes. Its about seeing the whole picture. Even in our own lives, we recognize that people and events are rarely all good or all bad. If we dont apply this nuance to history, we risk oversimplifying it.  \\nThink about the Industrial Revolution. It created unprecedented prosperity but also caused immense sufferingchild labor, environmental destruction, and exploitation on a massive scale. Do we reject its positive impact because of its dark side? Of course not. We study it holistically to learn from it.I get why you bring up the Holocaustits one of history's greatest atrocities. But it was driven by ideology, aiming for the systematic extermination of a people. The Mongols, brutal as they were, acted out of political strategy, not ideological hatred. That doesnt make their actions moral, but it does make their motives fundamentally different. Comparing them directly oversimplifies the unique horror of each event.If we only look at the Mongols through the lens of their atrocities, we miss an opportunity to learn from the full scope of their impactboth the horrors and the unintended legacies. Isnt it better to confront historys complexities than to reduce it to good versus evil?

Now, it varies significantly based on a number of factors, but VA disability compensation scales primarily based on your % disability rating, which is calculated by how much the disability affects the veteran's ability to perform daily activities. If one is 100% service-connected disabled - that is, they went into the service as a healthy young person and left unable to hold down a job or otherwise function due to a medical condition that popped up while they're in the service - they will qualify for almost $4k/mo in benefits. That's from the VA alone - they'll also potentially qualify for social security disability benefits (which are calculated entirely separately from VA disability benefits) and various other programs at the state/federal level if they're disabled.Interestingly, many mental health conditions - like new onset schizophrenia - that may pop up in someone entirely \\"naturally\\" in their early 20s will practically automatically get you that 100% service connection.

Urbanization requires the public to feel safe and not choose an hour commute over getting harassed everyday. Compassionate social policy support requires the electorate feel safe that they do not prioritize regressive policy because they feel a substantial difference between the lowest in society and themselves.If you hold any liberal or reasonable evidence based policy convictions, it is hard to overstate that visible, vibes based, and overt action must be taken to solve the homelessness problem in America. Americans are not satisfied by wishy-washy rehabilitation centers located near them or in neighborhoods, that serve to make the problem even more visible and concentrated. In a reference to the tolerance paradox, the homeless population in America is at odds (regardless of the circumstances which they arrived in their unfortunate state) with a tolerant society. Mentally ill, smelly, annoying, violent, or those who use public utilities such as subways and libraries in a manner that dissuades the rest of the population cannot be allowed to continue at levels that currently exist. They are intolerant of public decency, which a high trust society requires..The state, city, or federal government must step in large scale action, be it removal and relocation to forced long term institutionalization. If rural Iowa must have a large national guard run facility that cleans, reclothes, retrains, resocializes, and rehabilitates then so be it. (With the obvious concerns for abuse, and historical awareness of institutionalization). The American public wants and needs a public display of action that isnt leftists shouting about the politically correct terminology of people experiencing unhousedness or some bullshit. Additionally, some here may claim we just need to increase housing supply, which I agree would help prevent the net increase in homelessness and alleviate temporarily misfortuned folks, but the career side walk campers and vagrants are in no way capable of maintaining a 1 bed 1 ba studio without a significant reintroduction to society. A compassionate and liberal future must include a full reintroduction to society for good portion of the homeless population. I dont mean to convey that I lack empathy for those facing homelessness in any way, but the sheer fear and some common mutual sympathy I have of the American median voter. I additionally hope that readers dont assume that the American homeless population is a homogenous group all facing the same issues and are all violent and unsocial, but rather the current visible population impeding normal societal function are the concern. Nor do I think arresting anyone without a proof of a lease or deed is necessarily the answer. Nor that intermediate and more early intervention to prevent homelessness and help those in positions to be helped isnt 100% neededWithout a liberal spear in this domain, Im incredibly afraid of a republican / conservative future where Americans demand a solution.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"All four should be banned","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"His Alzheimers is kicking in.

Wikipedia, for all its flaws, [defines \\"secular state\\" as follows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state#:~:text=A%20secular%20state%20is%20an,over%20those%20with%20other%20profiles.)A secular state is an idea pertaining to secularity, whereby a state is or purports to be officially neutral in matters of religion, supporting neither religion nor irreligion.[1] A secular state claims to treat all its citizens equally regardless of religion, and claims to avoid preferential treatment for a citizen based on their religious beliefs, affiliation or lack of either over those with other profiles.[2]That's not the same thing as \\"a state free of religious influences.\\" In fact, a secular state must definitionally be facially neutral towards the religious or irreligious motives of its citizenry.The National Secular Society of the UK defines secularism in this way:Secularism is a political idea concerned with the best way to govern religiously pluralist societies. The model of secularism we advocate for defends the civil liberties of all, whatever your personal beliefs. The principles of secularism which protect and underpin liberal democracy and many of the freedoms we enjoy are: * Equality so that our religious beliefs or lack of them doesn't put any of us at an advantage or a disadvantage. * Freedom to practise one's religion or belief without harming others, or to change it or not have one, according to one's own conscience. * Separation of religious institutions from state institutions and a public sphere where religion may participate, but not dominate.Note that last bullet, \\"a public sphere where religion may participate, but not dominate.\\" That's not a state \\"free from religious influences.\\" It's one where the religious citizens of a state may fully participate in public life, without receiving unjust benefits or suffering discrimination due to their religious beliefs. The only way to have a state fully \\"free from religious influences\\" as you describe is to actively discriminate against religious citizens. What you are describing is an *explicitly irreligious or anti-religious state*. That would be a violation of secular principles just as much as an explicitly religious or even theocratic state would be.","title":"CMV: A truly secular state is nigh impossible to achieve while retaining the same efficiency of state, mode of governance and same freedoms that many Western governments still provide."},{"text":"The ones who need it the most are the most tricked because theyre dumb af and dont know any better","title":"Vast Majority of Obamacare Applications From Trump-Voting States"},{"text":"R's have a two vote majority in the House and the ACA has grown more popular.

It doesn't make them better or worse than non-Jews.Unless by spiritual fate, you just mean that their birth has some impact on their spiritual journey, rather than rewards/punishes them. But isn't that true of nonspiritual things too? Your place of birth is going to impact your physical life. It doesn't make you a better or worse person, but a person born in a village in the Congo will have a different life than someone born in NYC. And anyway, Eastern religions also believe that one's place of birth affects their spiritual life.

Men are honestly some of the most emotional people because of anger. But for some reason they don't consider getting angry to be getting emotional. Like it's a trope in society that women are the emotional ones, meanwhile men commit the vast majority of violent crimes, especially \\"crimes of passion\\" due to their own insatiable anger. And growing up, the men in my family were extremely angry and abusive all the time while the women were level-headed and could actually control their emotions. I just think it's complete bullshit when men try to say \\"women are so emotional\\". However, I disagree with where you said \\"anger has limited utility in the modern world\\". Anger is the only emotion that allows us to stand up for ourselves, self-advocate, be assertive, enact justice, be confrontational, protect others, fight when we need to, etc. Anger is how you stop people from walking all over you because \\"I'm just non-confrontational\\" or \\"I'm a people-pleaser\\". Anger is how you stand up for yourself when your landlord tries to increase your rent suddenly, without notice, because they want to save up for a new yacht. Anger is how you confront someone about mistreating you and demand respect. I know of way too many people who just don't get angry when they need to, and it shows. They're always in miserable situations that they've allowed to happen to themselves because they won't be confrontational and they just let other people use them, exploit them, walk all over them, treat them unfairly, forget about them, etc. They're like meek little ghosts that just get pushed around and never stand up for themselves, and it's led to some pretty miserable circumstances for them.

Over the past 10 years, I have been a target of gang stalking, and Ive noticed patterns in how the stalking is organized. One recurring tactic involves members of the civic association staging what appear to be impromptu street meetings as I drive past. Further down the road, I often encounter a stalker associated with a private patrol firm, suggesting coordination between the association and outsourced security personnel.Through meticulous research into the civic associations meeting minutes and newsletters, Ive noticed a concerning trend: individuals who question the association's security committee are often voted off. At the same time, the association receives substantial private donations, raising questions about their funding and activities. Residents often complain that the off-duty officers employed by the association seem uninterested in addressing visible issues like speeders or squatters, which makes me wonder about their actual priorities.Moreover, Ive observed a growing relationship between modern community policing programs, local off-duty police officers, and fusion centers. By researching publicly available resources like DHS and DHSS apps, it becomes clear how these entities intersect with community policing initiatives. This research reveals a broader framework that connects local associations, private security, and federal surveillance systems, all of which play a role in organized harassment.For those willing to dig deep and analyze the evidence, the connections are undeniable.","title":"Why Your Neighborhood Security Might Be Watching You"},{"text":"Germany is a good example.

For example, our bias towards the status quo might lead us to misapprehend that government is the only way to organize society simply because functioning governments are so pervasive. Or, we may legitimize forms of coercive authority that benefit us while rejecting it in other contexts - basically, the argument is that the only difference between vigilantism and law enforcement is that cops wear a badge. Per Huemer, the obverse of this posits that the one is only obligated to follow laws that are actually correct, because implicitly there are moral requirements that are independent of the state. THis is a way of saying that moral and political authority - right and might - are not one and the same. Fair enough. I personally think it is taking it too far to say that political authority is therefore illusory, but that's what we're discussing so let's just get into that.  Assume that there is no general duty to obey the law. This sounds like an extremely hot take it is a pretty sound philosophical position to take (very briefly, a. it is nearly impossible to define the scope of any such duty without abstracting it into meaninglessness; b. there are clearly instances where one's moral duties subsume the duty to obey the law; c. it is inconsistent with other moral values like personal autonomy; and d. there's no real foundation for any such duty anyways). If the state derives legitimacy from its claim to, and ability to, impose a duty upon you to obey its laws, and if there is no duty to obey the law, then it is not possible for the state to have legitimacy. This, correct me if I'm wrong, is your position. This is called philosphical anarchism. The problem with this is that it assumes that the criteria for state legitimacy is correlative with one's duty to obey. William Edmundson calls this the \\"anarchical fallacy:\\" If legitimacy necessitates a general duty to obey the law, legitimacy is called into question every time there is a question about the extent of your duty. Given that we have not, over several thousand years, ceased debating the extent of our duties, philosophical anarchists must conclude that either every state is illegitimate, or at least, that political authority is only legitimate in instances not conditioned on one's duty to the state. This is a problem because it doesn't resolve the question of authority, only of legitimacy - if no state is legitimate (the state is not owed your obedience), then we need not address the issue of authority (what the state claims it is owed). Obviously, the state irritatingly persists in claiming authority, so it makes no sense to pretend that it has no authority merely because you have no duty to obey the law. Consider, then, that there is a meaningful difference between one's *duty to obey the law* and one's *duty not to interfere with the administration of the law.* This allows one to reconcile the questions of legitimacy and authority without making them interdependent. Imagine you're driving through the desert and you come to a four-way intersection with a stop sign. There's no one there. Do you obey the sign just because it's there? I find that hard to justify. Now, say you come to the same sign, you see nobody around, but this time there's a cop behind a big shrub and he catches you, pulls you over, and gives you a ticket that you have to pay. You could try and run away, but would you? Doubtful. So, if you can't justify stopping at a stop sign for no obvious reason, why do you let the cop pull you over and give you a ticket? In other words, how can you have no duty to obey the law in the former scenario, but still have a duty to permit the state to enforce that law in the second scenario? This question is important because it highlights the difference between the state's *authority* - the state's claims to impose upon you a duty to obey the law, and the separate, independent duty not to interfere with the state's authority to enforce the law - and the state's *legitimacy* - that is, the extent of your duty to obey the law, or at least, your duty not to interfere with the state's administration of the law. This further implicates separate perogatives between the ends that the law pursues - traffic safety, for example, as a reason for putting a stop sign at an intersection - and the greater goals implicated by administration. If there is no traffic, traffic safety is not implicated and so obedience to the law is not necessarily required as a moral matter. But that can still be true and it would be harmful to try and escape the cop, or to refuse to pay the ticket, or to fail to appear in court, because then you're harming the integrity of the adminsitrative structure and its ability to enforce rules that benefit everyone, to say nothing of perpetuating public order and continuity of government. *You* may feel that the traffic rules do not apply to you, and you may even be right, or at least justified. But the state claims the authority to administer those rules regardless of your duty to obey them, for the benefit of the rest of us. What I'm saying here is that there is a conception of political authority that does *not* require you to obey the law, but rather to not interfere with its administration. In this way, legitimacy and authority are not correlative because it allows for the possibility that you can ignore and refuse to obey laws in some circumstances without implicating the state's perogatives in *enforcing* those laws and vindicating the purposes that those laws serve. \\nAt this point you might be asking what the practical difference is if the state can still punish you without your consent. This goes to your initial question, and my assumption that your position implies that you feel that the state has no legitimacy because you haven't consented to its authority. It might seem a little abstract, but basically the question of legitimacy and the question of authority are independent, and authority is not dependent on legitimacy defined here as the state's claims of and ability to oblige you to obey its laws. Because you have no duty to obey, and because authority nevertheless persists, legitimacy instead should be thought of as depending on the state's claim to impose a duty to obey its laws and an enforceable duty not to interfere with enforcement, and the existence of a duty not to interfere with adminsitration of the law regardless of the lack of duty to obey. This is the only way to reconcile the very real fact of state authority with the lack of any duty to obey its laws. As to the question of coerciive authority, that can be somewhat more easily dispensed with because coercion implies a special need for the state to justify its actions. If you doubt this, compare the case of a robber demandign your wallet at gunpoint with the case of the state passing a law punishing robbery with a ten-year jail sentence. In the first instance, the gunman has demanded your money and threatened you with violence; presumably, there exist justifications which make his actions not coercion. If the gunman was taking *his* money back which *you* had just stolen out of his cash register, his actiosn may be morally justified. In contrast, the state's punishment of *non-justified* robbery with a jail sentence can not be coercive, notwithstanding that it is backed by threat of punishment, beause all they're asking you to do is abide by the law. So, to presume that the state coerces its citizens in its actions seems to be another fallacy because it is not merely the threat of force that creates coercion, but rather the presence or absence of moral justifiability. So, suffice it to say that \\"coercion\\" is action that demands special justification. A fair and just law that punishes wrongful conduct requires no special justification from the state and so it cannot be coercive. Now that we're thoroughly in the weeds, a TLDR:Your position implies that the state is illegitimate because legitimacy necessitates that there is a duty to obey the law. Because, for a variety of reasons, there is no real enforceable duty to obey the law, your position requires the conclusion that all states are therefore illegitimate. This fails because it misidentifies what it means for a state's authority to be legitimate. A state's authority is what it claims - that you have a duty to obey the law *and* a duty not to interfere with enforcement of the law. Because, as discussed, you have no duty to obey the law, a state's legitimacy is the extent to which it can compel you to not interfere with administration of its laws (this is to say, a state's claims of authority will always exceed its actual legitimate authority but this is a different discussion - the state can claim the power to do a lot of things but, again, we will never and can never be obligated to actually obey the full extent of its claimed authority). So, contrary to your position, the state does not lack legitimacy merely because there is no duty to obey. There is a separate independent duty not to interfere with administration of the law that is not mutually exclusive from your non-duty to obey. As to coercion, the threat of punishment is not consituent of coercion; coercion is action that demands justification and assuming a law is just (YMMV) the state cannot be said to coerce you when it demands that you not break the law.

IMO, Biden won in 2020 because the absolute disaster of our federal governments response to COVID demanded a sense of normalcy and control. Folks saw that in Biden over the rest of the field, imo, especially Trump. I think you can acknowledge the role Biden played in 2020 and still respect it. But were beyond that now. You can only beat the drum of the government for so long before people get annoyed when they believe inflation is crushing them and turned to Trump again. IMO, the reasons people clung onto Biden in 2020 were simply not there anymore in 2024. Im not sure where this takes Democrats. I think it really depends on how the next four years of Trump goes because I still think Trump wins reelection in 2020 if COVID never happened. The level of disaster (if it goes that way) will dictate the kind of Democrat that runs against Trump. 2028 could literally be a repeat of us falling back on an established Democrat if Trump shits the bed in an enormous way. But if things are shaky but relatively ok in America by the end of this Trump term, I do think well see a newer Democrat that is more populous and starts calling back to health care, student loans, cost of living, etc.","title":"Biden reportedly regrets ending re-election campaign and says hed have defeated Trump"},{"text":"He didnt have the mental clarity to compete.

Because no matter how much of a more virtuous life a non-christian leads over a Christian, the Christian is ultimately destined for a better afterlife.This lack of inherent fairness and logic here is ultimately what leads to cynicism towards religion in general and makes atheists/agnostics wonder whether people just want you to convert to the Christianity so that the church gets more donations to feed their priests .","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"People really misunderstood that.

Fields like AI, biotech, and engineering arent things the average American is just walking intothey take years of specialized training. The problem is that were not producing enough graduates in those areas fast enough to keep up with demand.On wages, youre absolutely rightcompanies do like having a bigger labor pool to keep wages down. But the bigger issue isnt immigration itself; its the lack of investment in education and training in the U.S. If we were pumping out more high skilled workers, companies wouldnt need to bring in immigrants as often. Blaming immigration alone is letting corporations off the hook for not investing in the domestic workforce.And for fields like agriculture, raising wages isnt as simple as you make it sound. If farms had to pay a lot more, food prices would go up, and its regular people whod feel that hit. Im not saying we shouldnt aim for fairer wages, but pretending that just raising pay would magically fix everything isnt realistic.At the end of the day, immigration can definitely impact wages in some industries, but its not the whole story. The bigger problem is how corporations prioritize profits over long-term investment in workers in the countries they operate.

If instead we cut it up into as many pieces as there are positive whole numbers we still end up with infinitely many pieces, but these pieces are infinitely larger and contain infinitely many of the smaller pieces.Imagine a series of boxes with the numbers written on them:1  ,  2  , 3 , ... , n  If we had a fancy tape measure we could measure the size of each box and we know the size must be greater than 0 because if we put all the boxes together we end up with what we started with, a length of one.So if we define the size or measure of all the whole numbers to be a length of one, then two divide by two is to cut it into two pieces, and to divide it by itself gives those infinitely small pieces we were talking about that are represented by the boxes with the positive whole number written on them.But we need a way of taking about the numbers we are describing in a more rigorous way. So let's introduce some way of talking about these things:1\\\\_1 is a length of one.  The one of the left is the size and the smaller one (given as \\\\_1 indicating a subscript) indicates the spatial dimension. It is read one-sub-one, short for subscript, or simply a length of one.2\\\\_1 indicates a length of two. 1\\\\_2 an area of one.Then an example for addition would be to add a length of one to a length of one:1\\\\_1 + 1\\\\_1 = (1+1)\\\\_1=2\\\\_1  and equals a length of two.If we think about the formula for the area of a rectangle it is length times width. But width and length are both one-dimensional. And for a one-by-two rectangle we have:1\\\\_12\\\\_1 and we know that area is two dimensional so we have 1\\\\_12\\\\_1=(12)\\\\_2=2\\\\_2Shall I go on?","title":"CMV: The current system of mathematics is outdated"},{"text":"TBF: Center Left and RIght Europe has made it clear you getting less in a growing pie is the goal as they implement austiery programsWhat countries are you even talking about?","title":"How the Democrats wandered away from Americas workers"},{"text":"Keep trolling for the oligarchs.

This law could be revoked by the Reichstag. The Reichspresident could also dissolve the Reichstag, and that dissolvement order had priority - meaning, if the Reichstag meets, the first order of business had to be that order.However, Hitler was not Reichspresident - Paul Hindenburg was. Although Hindenburg went along with most of Hitlers demands (in dissolving the Reichstag when he wanted to and in writing decrees), Hitler did not wield those \\"dictatorial powers\\" until Hindenburg died - Hitler assumed the office of Reichspresident without an election and against the provisions in the Constitution that should have prevented combining both offices in one person.Additionally, the Reichstag had a majority supporting Hitler, so it did not move against any Article 48 decrees.\\nUltimately, Hitler rose to power because the German people elected a majority that supported him. The Nazis did everything by the book until there was no one left in power to complain about them going off the book.The mechanism for Hitler to claim dictatorial powers was an Act of the German Reichstag to amend the Constitution, allowing the Office of the Reichskanzler to pass legislation into law without any involvement of the Reichstag. That Act had nothing to do with Article 48.So, again, the Weimar Constitution was not weak, as it actually fended off several attempted coups. The German State was weak.

If anything, Ive only ever gotten the impression that they are apathetic about our entire community and tolerate our existence in as far as they wont threaten to genocide us all, but never actually put their necks out for us when it comes to actively pushing any kind of agenda that secures us a right to live peacefully.Obama did this when he didnt want to advocate for gay marriage until the political climate was correct for him to do so, Biden never really did this past his inauguration speech and then reversing the trans military ban, and Kamala definitely wasnt pushing for our rights if her response to Will you protect trans people? was I will follow the law, which is problematic if youre someone like me in Florida who can be arrested for using a public bathroom, which means she wouldve just left me to the prison system to rot.I think theres an important distinction to be made between a political party that practices active allyship, and the whatever the fuck the Democratic Party is that does this white moderate bullshit.EDIT: also just going to say, I dont need them to be on their knees for the community, but hearing all queer people deserve a life of peace every once in a while, even if its just fucking platitudes, and some kind of policy platform that tackles broader systemic economic issues we all face to keep people happy while advocating for some kind of civil rights policy on the side would be a significant improvement over whatever the fuck this is.","title":"Democrats are stuck in our old ways: Rep.

Fewer people will sign up, and more will cancel their coverage.Remember all of the griping during the 2019 tax season when people got a lot smaller refunds or even owed taxes for 2018 after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect and withholding was revised to make people more or less break even? Having to repay half a year or more of subsidies, somewhere between $375 and $3150, would force most people who owed that much into a short-term (180 days or less)  repayment plan with the IRS if they didn't want to charge the extra tax on a credit card.

Currently Loudoun County is reporting 2,873 mail ballots received, which is just 66 more than yesterday, so I suspect there's another update coming at some point.  In total, 11,913 mail ballots were sent out, and the deadline to get one was yesterday.  These will probably be the bluest votes.* With the most current numbers, we've had **5,457 voters in total, for 3.49% turnout.** That's a significant bump over yesterday, and I think we'll see more mail votes added soon.

Also, H-1B visa holders often arrive in the U.S. with high-paying jobs and no credit history, which can give them an unintended advantage in the housing market.

We believe we were a people before our God came to us, and people are inherently complex. Good things are good things, regardless of a godly design or thought. There's an extremely strong emphasis in Judaism on individual and collective responsibilities, not to achieve brownie points with a deity, but rather for the benefit of all humanity and all life. It's irrelevant whether the person you show respect to is Jewish or not. Moreover, the teachings of Judaism (and this is not proselytizing, because we don't do that, either) heavily emphasize that the highest forms of good deeds are ones you do not benefit at all from, other than perhaps benefitting from the general betterment of the world. We are not meant to do good things for the benefit of a god or our relationship to a god, we are meant to do good things *simply because they are good.*Moreover, as your claim of Jewish afterlife putting non-Jews into contrast: it might interest you to know that Jews do not have a general concept about the afterlife, save for that all are welcome. No strings attached. The concept of the \\"chosen people\\" as it is represented in media is a Christian invention. Jews believe we were 'chosen' (and, by the way, after God went to literally every other group of people and they said no) to follow a set of rules designed to better ourselves and better the world. We have specific commandments that we only expect other Jews to follow, and there is no judgment that non-Jews do not do these things. Why would they? They are not Jews, and that is fine. Everyone is meant to be who they are meant to be. Why would someone not being a Jew make them inferior to me? That makes no sense! I think your perception of Jews and Judaism comes from an intensely Christian and intensely warped perspective. The simplified version of our holy book: *Do unto others as you wish other would do unto you. The rest is commentary. Now, go and study.* That's it. There's no great plot, no great conspiracy to convert people, no idea of someone being more or less because of people being *different* to us. I really do wish you would spend the time to actually know us before lumping us in with others, because we're very different than what you claim. I imagine this is just a karma farming endeavor, but it still hurts to be responsible to correct the prejudiced misinterpretations of Jews. Do better.

Two of the biggest offenders of this- the Catholic Church and Islam- have a very specific caveat. \\n \\nWhich is that who gets punished is very much affected by what they know. There's a name for it that I can't remember in Catholicism, but the basic idea is that  not everyone has the same knowledge. if you grew up your whole life being taught that Islam or Catholicism is the worst, or not hearing about them at *all*, they can't expect you to be living with their exact teachings. but God is supposed to be just. He wouldn't judge someone by their circumstances. So what does happen? the Catholic doctrine is that the only sin that bars you from eternal life is a mortal sin- a sin of a grave matter that is committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent. i'm gonna explain then in order of least to most important. 1) grave matter- basically, a sin that's just REALLY bad. Usually the stuff in the ten commandments.  best example is \\"thou shalt not murder\\". and note that it IS *murder* specifically, not kill. murder  killing. murder is basically the same as it's current legal definition- deliberately killing someone and not having any sort of justification. 2) deliberate consent- basically, agency. you had to have not been pressured into doing it. you had to have had equal opportunity to commit the sin or not to, and chose willingly to sin. 3) full knowledge- by far the most important, and informs the deliberate constant. you had to have been fully aware that what you were doing was wrong and chose to do it anyway. now, to be clear, even if you do ALL this, you can still go to heaven. you just have to repent- and this can happen after death. this is what purgatory actually is. it's not a place, it's a process- purification, cleansing. now, i remembered the term- invincible ignorance. \\n you can't be judged for what you didn't know.this isn't just information, either. the Pharisees and the Romans knew Jesus existed and rejected him, but still JC says they're ignorant:  Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do (Luke 23:34). rather, it's *understanding.* two people can be given the same information (such as the doctrine of Catholicism) and not understand it the same way due to personal circumstances, such as mental illnesses or prior experiences coloring their world view.\\nThe only people who go to hell are people who, if given full knowledge of god and His plan, in His goodness, and stripped of all the complications of the body and material reality, would still choose to reject Him. and since the official position of the RCC is that hell is \\"the] state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed\\"-not fire and brimstone but just the absence of god- those truly wicked souls likely wouldn't even see heaven as a reward or hell as punishment. As for why you would become Christian if you're probably gonna get saved no matter what- it's an insurance policy and celebration. it's being grateful to Jesus for saving everyone. and even if you're pretty likely to get into heaven, the truth is we don't know what God's judgment will actually be like. so the idea is that sincerely adhering to the belief system of the Catholic Church (not just using them to exploit and manipulate, but actually act in accordance with them) is living in accordance with God and thus gives you a much higher chance.- I'm not as versed in Islam, but I believe it's something similar. On the day of the Last Judgment you'll be shown the truth of God pure and uncorrupted, and then be given free will to decide to worship or reject him. I want to note that while the Catholic Church and a decent amount of Protestants believe in invincible ignorance, some denominations don't. they believe that who is going to heaven and hell has been decided, that if God wanted you to go to heaven you'd choose to be a christian, and that anyone who commits a mortal sin was never really a *True* Christian. i don't understand the adherents of this belief, as believing you don't have free will means there's no point in trying to convince people to praise god since their choice has already been determined.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"I see Trump supporters have moved on to the pommel horse portion of their desperate mental gymnastics.","title":"You will love immigration now!"},{"text":"It's funny to me that you think a new government organization named after a memecoin and headed by one of the biggest oligarchs and internet trolls on the planet is going to clean up government funding.

It's more pervasive than it sounds too, even among people who support the idea of some social safety nets there's a notion of the \\"deserving poor\\" vs the \\"undeserving poor.\\" Moral Economy is big here and has bipartisan support.The classic example is the Reaganite \\"welfare queen\\" caricature, but a thing you can see come up these days is poor conservatives who will be really shitty about fat people, and that gets used as an excuse to cut food stamps across the board. You're seeing it more lately with conservative memes mocking fat people, *Rich Men north of Richmond* taking a sudden swipe at other poor people on foodstamps in a song ostensibly about the rich, etc. A more liberal example of this are school lunch programs that are means-tested when it works best if they're just freely available. Appealing to a sense of fairness, \\"the rich families can afford it, it'd be unfair to let them get it free too. Now do all this paperwork and give us records you might not have to prove you can't afford it.\\" Means testing and restrictions, if not used carefully and sparingly, can serve to undermine the agency of people using those social services. This ultimately results in an attitude where people across the political spectrum would rather see some people slip through the cracks, possibly themselves even, than to see anyone get something they \\"don't deserve.\\" You don't necessarily have to have earned it through hard work to deserve it, but you do have to contain certain virtues to deserve it. I bring up both sides not to say \\"they're both the same\\" but to suggest that it's an attitude many of us have without realizing, and as such it's something we can challenge in ourselves to make immediate headway.","title":"Sen.

Furthermore, studies have shown us that Trump voters *only* turn out for His Nibs. If hes not on the ticket, they dont really care. Once Fat Don is out of the picture, the GOP is going to have to face the same issues of voter engagement that the Dems are currently struggling against. In a way, this gives the Left a head-start in addressing the issue. But that wont mean anything if they dont make a real effort to address these issues. So I guess well see, huh? Were heading into uncharted waters one way or another in America, and nobody seems terribly happy about it.","title":"Biden reportedly regrets ending re-election campaign and says hed have defeated Trump"},{"text":"Why does it matter to your position whether or not Southern states improve the lives of gay people voluntarily or not?

The whole text is a single unit that must be taken into account. If you look at the context of the verses from Deuteronomy, you'd see that /u/oremfrien is correct. **Jews are not made to out to be superior to non-Jews.** We are instructed by God to follow certain Commandments and, if we fail to do so, are punished; these Commandments are not obligatory on non-Jews, as they have a different but equally critical mission in the world. Deuteronomy 7:6 (Tanakh): \\"For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.\\"Let's look at [the context of this verse, Deut. 7:6-11](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.10?lang=bi&amp;aliyot=0):?? ? ?? ?  ?   ?? ?  ?   ? ?? ? ?? ?? For you are a people consecrated to your God ?: of all the peoples on earth your God ? chose you to be Gods treasured people.?   ? ?? ? ?? ? ? ??  It is not because you are the most numerous of peoples that ? grew attached to you and chose youindeed, you are the smallest of peoples;?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ?? ?? ??  ?  ? but it was because ? favored you and kept the oath made to your fathers that ? freed you with a mighty hand and rescued you from the house of bondage, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.? ?? ? ??    ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? Know, therefore, that only your God ? is God, the steadfast God who keeps the divine covenant faithfully to the thousandth generation of those who love [God] and keep the divine commandments,   ? ? ??    but who instantly requites with destruction those who reject [God]never slow with those who reject, but requiting them instantly.?  ?? ? ? ?? ? ?? ??{?}Therefore, observe faithfully the Instructionthe laws and the ruleswith which I charge you today.In other words: the purpose and meaning of \\"chosen\\" in Deut. 7:6 is that the Jewish people were \\"chosen\\" to follow the Torah's laws and will be severely punished if we fail to do so.  Deuteronomy 14:2 (Tanakh): \\"For you are a people holy to the Lord your God, and the Lord has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.\\"Likewise, [if you look at the whole chapter](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.14?lang=bi&amp;aliyot=0), it lists a variety of things that Jews are forbidden from doing. Specifically, 14:1 contains a prohibition against scarification and shaving one's head totally bald and 14:3-21 lists the animals that a Jew may and may not eat. Phrases like 14:2 are found in 14:1, 14:21, and elsewhere in Deuteronomy to carry forward the theme of Deut. 7:6-11. These are the Commandments that a Jew must follow to keep the Covenant, and if a Jew fails to do them they will be punished by God. ____________Judaism: on the TalmudYou are misunderstanding the text involved. First off, the Talmud does not record a singular opinion on Jewish law. It's kind of a mess and extremely crazy.The Talmud is kind of like what you would get if you compiled every SCOTUS decision and ever Harvard and Yale Law Review article about those SCOTUS decisions, rewrote the arguments in the most concise shorthand possible, excluded any actual final rulings on the laws discussed, and rearranged these shorthand arguments nonchronologically (so that it reads as if every Justice and Law Review editorial team was in a single room debating each question) - and then interspersed this whole text with tangents about the Justice's personal lives and their opinions about medicine, history, demons, talking animals, the shape of the earth, and dozens of other subjects.Your presentation of a single line supposedly extracted from the Talmud tells us virtually nothing about Jews, Judaism, or halakha. Not only that, but your quotations are not even in the text you're pointing to!!** Talmud, Bava Kamma 113a: \\"If a Jew finds an object lost by a gentile ('heathen') it does not have to be returned.\\"If we look at [Bava Kamma 113a](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.113a?lang=bi), *it does not actually say that!*  Talmud, Abodah Zarah 26b: \\"Even the best of the Gentiles should all be killed.\\"If we look at [Avodah Zarah 26b](https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.26b?lang=bi), *it also does not actually say that!*Whichever internet \\"source\\" you found those fake Talmud citations on lied to you.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Would you agree that for point 1 it may help to be more specific.

Current ones, too.  It's those atrocities that brought me to this subreddit, because being aware of them is just step 1.  Once you're aware, the next step is making them better.  And with structural issues, it takes an extremely long time to change things.  But it does happen, bit by bit.  And unchecked, stupid pride is one of the GOP's best weapons to make people not think or care about the bad things in America, so even people who love their country need to keep educating themselves about why it's not working for everyone.At the same time, though, I don't think Americans necessarily have to feel shame for their country's atrocities.  We are all part of the larger structure that keeps inequity going, yes.  But if you're aware of it, and doing your part to change it...I'm not sure shame is the appropriate response.  If you've been part of a problem but are now making it better, you can be free from that shame.  What's more, in my experience, shame has a pretty short shelf life in terms of being a motivator. Left unchecked, it drags you down into doing nothing (which I know isn't true of you, I've seen you around here lots getting involved, but for me shame has more often than not stopped me from helping).There's lots of people who should feel ashamed of how they voted and what they do, but I wouldn't include myself in that, and I don't think you have to either.  We're not responsible for every bad thing our country does, especially if we're actively working to stop it.And you're right that no working plan is going to ignore any of the problems.  In fact, any plan involves being honest about those problems and deciding to make them better.  An honest plan will include the good in America, though - because the good often contains parts of the solutions we need.

If everyone forgot what a government was tomorrow, those things wouldnt vanish. Roads would still need fixing, courts would still resolve disputes, and public services wouldnt stop existing just because people forgot the word for it.The idea that government is only real because we believe in it oversimplifies how society works.

In August, Lott wrote to U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, saying that \\"U.S. naval ships will be at the mercy of Chinese-controlled pilots and could even be denied passage through the canal by Hutchison, an arm of the People's Liberation Army\\". Li said he appreciated \\"the American government, the White House, the military department, they have many times made it very clear ... we have no right to control the canal.\\" Hutchison had rejected Lott's allegations in August, saying that it had no influence over the canal's operation or shipping traffic. Lott had complained in the letter to Cohen sent on August 1 that Hutchison's operation of container ports at each end of the canal was a security threat and a sign of China's growing influence over the waterway. \\"This administration is allowing a scenario to develop where U.S. national security interests could not be protected without confronting the Chinese communists in the Americas,\\" wrote Lott. Li rose from rags to riches in Hong Kong's property market. He has close ties with the communist government in Beijing but Hutchison has denied any connection to the PLA. https://1997-2001.state.gov/regions/wha/panama/991206_faqs.htmlQ: What about stories that China is taking over the Panama Canal?A: The Government of Panama granted a concession to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, on the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the Canal, respectively, to the Hong Kong company Hutcheson-Whampoa in 1996. Under the terms of the contract, Hutcheson-Whampoa does not own the ports, but rather operates them on behalf of the Government of Panama. The U.S. does not believe that the concession granted to Hutcheson-Whampoa represents a threat to the Canal. Several entities of the U.S. Government, including the Federal Maritime Commission and the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have researched this issue extensively and have not uncovered any evidence to support a conclusion that the People's Republic of China will be in a position to control Canal operations. The neutrality of the Canal and its operations are guaranteed by the \\"Neutrality Treaty&amp; signed and ratified by the governments of the U.S. and Panama, and also by that Treaty's protocol, to which 36 other countries are states party. You need to pretend this is about the change in Hong Kong government, because then it excuses Trump not saying anything about this during his first term.This is pretty clear cut and should easily understandable for almost anybody of any intellectual level.Laughable.  You can't even demonstrate how it's a treaty violation.  The companies operating these ports was approved by the US before the Canal was handed by the US, and do not constitute a breach of neutrality.The answer to your questions above:How does virtually nobody on Reddit know these things? For that matter how does a United States Congresswoman not know these things?!?!is that you believe things that aren't true because you are essentially in a cult, and you also suffering from [dunning kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect#).

Interestingly, the article ignores the elephant in the room, which is that people no longer watch CNN because people no longer trust CNN's \\"reporting\\" or its talk show hosts for anything political - and it's been politics and the politics of war that have been driving almost every news cycle for the last year. From the Econotimes article:CNN executives are reportedly planning an urgent strategy overhaul to address the ongoing decline. Potential solutions include increased investment in digital content, partnerships with streaming services, and revamped on-air programming aimed at younger demographics. The network is also rumored to be exploring new leadership, hoping to reinvigorate its brand.Critics, however, remain skeptical. Some argue that CNNs perceived lack of identitycaught between impartial journalism and opinion-driven contenthas alienated its core audience. Others believe that without a dramatic pivot to digital-first strategies, the network risks becoming obsolete in the long term.But it seems to me that such a \\"dramatic pivot to digital-first strategies\\" will just take CNN down the same path as the online remnants of Time and Newsweek. Nobody will seek out CNN behind a paywall, probably not even behind a soft paywall. People will occasionally link to CNN in social media, as they do now, mostly to debunk it or to discuss something someone said on one of their shows. And because CNN is reliably establishment mainstream media, the search algorithms will continue to favor their visibility. But people won't go to them for fresh content anymore, just as nobody is watching their programming now. Furthermore, their propaganda model of \\"reporting\\" and talk show dialogue will open them to evisceration of their transparently one-sided, misleading, and untruthful advocacy right in their own comments sections in a way they don't have to put up with on cable TV.  The downvoting on cable TV comes by way of dropping cable entirely or just ignoring CNN entirely, as reflected in their ratings. CNN had its day. Their 24-hour news cycle was right for the technology of the time. Probably, what they'd really like to do now is to spin it off to remove its woes from the parent company's balance sheet, then sell what's left of it off to the highest bidder.","title":"CNN is losing viewers fast after the Trump election.

One thing Ill push you on for anarchism is the idea of individualism vs non state communities. There are certainly better and worse ways for people to organize other then states but the idea that you could produce everything you need independently for a decent quality of life doesnt tend to bare out. Those communities that were organized differently than states historically were real places with real alternative problems, with their own social constructs that were hard to opt out of. \\nWhat you see in failed states are people who are set up and conditioned for one type of system and have to cope with that lack. Eventually something steps up to fill in the gap but its not always great. The church stepped in after the fall of Rome, organized crime tends to step in after the fall of modern states. Systems without a ton of violence backing them tend to be backed by something else, strong social ties (ostracism as punishment) or large amounts of religious coercion. \\nIm not saying people are inherently violent and will act insane without the arm of the law, because I genuinely dont believe that.

Even if everybody was atheist religious morals and thought would still permeate culture. In China a lot of very popular philosophies are very much not atheistic in origin- which is why they were targeted during the cultural revolution that the current Chinese government is actively reversing. However, I feel its important that this isnt really how people use the word. If this isnt an argument about actual secularist ideology- I dont really see the point. I dont think any secularist would argue that a government isnt secular purely because it reflects the religious values of a population. Theres a series of policies and government structures its opposed to- and usually leans into a more formal direction. I think youre ignoring that the thing secularism is opposing is religious institutions, like actually the pope himself, having a formalized influence within the government and the government very formally recognizing one religion and favoring it. I think the key here is that the concept of rule of law is often opposed to popular sovereignty in many cases. A religious population can vote in a religious government in a state that is primarily composed of independent secular institutions. This pluralism is a building block of the modern state Its true that *full* secularism can never truly be achieved, but I think that nothing like this can ever truly be pure. Theres never gonna be a full democracy or a full autocracy. No institution can ever be fully independent of all outside influence. Theres no such thing as a true vacuum.

Transportation, communication, garbage, IT, food services, entertainment.Pick a few of these and they make a nice combo punch.The key thing is to be extremely disruptive and call out billionaires and corporations bullshit, while inviting all workers to the tailgater party. Messaging has to start now, to cut off the bullshit, \\"if strikes just weren't so disruptive\\" memes.Things like, \\"Do you want single payer healthcare, a livable wage, help with childcare, and a working justice system, or do you want to be at your desk working the grind and worried sick?\\" We want to give everyone an excuse to join in, even if it's passive, like, \\"Sorry boss, I'm stuck in traffic, darn truckers union!

These religious texts are accurate and have not been tampered with.Clause 3: These religious texts, or at least the organized institution that my faith is headed by's interpretation, express that homosexuality is a sin.Clause 4: These religious texts, or at least the organized institution that my faith is headed by's interpretation, states that it is imperative to spread the good word and save others from sin, or in other words, to prosletyze.Conclusion: Homosexuality is a sin, as per my all good and all-knowing God, and there should be some kind of attempt on my end to save sinners from their sin and ignorance regarding their potential damnation.If none of these are clauses are untrue and there are no leaps in logic, how can there not be a massive amount of dissonance between what you ardently believe to be true and then what somebody that's tolerant would then turn to accept.

Additionally (and I know many people don't have a problem with this, but I do) he's dated two satanists, and his mother is apparently also involved with the occult.Vivek is allegedly Vance's wife's cousin.

Vance was a NeverTrumper - and Om1dyar is the original and biggest funder of that movement.  One of O's pets was Evan McMullin - and O bankrolled McMullin's StandUp Republic.  Vance supported McMullin's 2016 presidential run and said terrible things about Trump - even comparing him to Hitler.  He wants us to forget that now.  He's reformed.  He's had a change of heart.  Perhaps... but I need more proof than his word on that - and no one should be shamed for questioning that.

Sure there might possibly be some outliers in modern times, but its kinda weird to assume the opposite of what has been taught in rabbinical teachings for thousands of years.Also, Jews believe that everyone, with the exception of a few very bad people who are also unrepentant (Hitler types), go to heaven.

Jews believe all nations have a place in the world to come.

I hate this lazy 'trickle down racism' crap like it's a 'trick' being pulled on poor conservatives when it's not. This is a vastly na?ve take. You want to beat conservatism then you best understand what it is and what you're up against. Conservatism is fundamentally about preserving social hierarchies and conservatives view the world through their desired hierarchies. Conservatives just have a 'social order' they think should be followed. So while all this culture wars bullshit may also come with fucking over poor conservatives, poor conservatives will gladly take that. 'Poor' conservatives still want to conserve a social order where gay people are lower than poor straights, where black people are lower than poor whites, where non-christians are lower than poor christians, where trans people are lower' than everyone else, where women are lower than men and immigrants shouldn't;t be allowed at all.So sure the culture war 'noise' drowns out the ways they are screwing the lower classes in favor of the rich, but it's not all just some made up distraction where poor conservatives are being 'tricked into hate', they very much care about putting those they think are 'lower' than them into their 'place'.","title":"Sen.

In a less controversial example, many Calvinists dont believe that faith without works is dead (James 2:14-26) instead holding that its enough to proclaim that Jesus is God and God is real.Anyway, there are a number of Xtian denominations as well that believe that atheists, agnostics, non-Xtians, and so on are welcome in heaven/purgatory/the Kingdom of God. The only catch is that those people still have to meet specific criteria (altruistic, generous, forgiving, etc.) in their mortal lives. We know this to be explicitly declared by the leadership of denominations like the Roman Catholic Church, the Society of Friends, the Greek Orthodox Church, Old Order Amish, and the Universalist Unitarian Church. We also know it _not_ to be true of denominations like classical Pentecostalism, the Southern Baptist Convention, the Church of Latter Day Saints, and the Methodist Church. So I wouldnt judge these huge religions by a few dozen words. Id rather say that you should judge people for who they are and what they do. Thoughts certainly lead to action, but youd be surprised by how diverse the thoughts of different believers even within a single temple (of a few dozen or hundred people) is.

In this way, a person does not become one of the elect by being Calvinist; being Calvinist is just one of the pieces of evidence of being one of the elect, which God already chose, but it is both an insufficient piece of evidence (being Calvinist alone does not make a person one of the elect -- they must also do good works) and an unnecessary piece of evidence (since Non-Calvinists can also have been predestined by God).With respect to the unbaptized infants in Catholicism, the teaching was never as grounded as many others (with it being largely -- if not completely -- absent from the Catechism, depending on the year of publishing) and, unlike the person who has no exposure to the Sacrifice Upon the Cross, such an infant is in the presence of other believing Catholics who could baptize the infant.With respect to \\"separate but equal\\", the problem with \\"separate but equal\\" is not a problem in logic but a problem in application because human beings struggle to create a political system that allocates the same degree of respect and behavior to those who are separated in order to keep them equal. In many cases, like that of the Jim Crow racism in the US South, \\"separate but equal\\" was never conceptually implemented because \\"separate to keep unequal\\" was the actual intent from day 1. However, as humans, many of us respect many conceptual \\"separate but equal\\" systems because they are actually seen as separate and equal and designed that way: (1) we see other people as entities with distinct concerns from us and yet equal in their right to advocate for their concerns and equal in their right to receive the same treatment as us -- human rights, and (2) we see governmental entities as existing as distinct entities with different goals and orientations but equal in their right to advocate for their citizens on the world stage -- Westphalian nation-to-nation politics.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"So how do you choose which framework to use?The one you were born into?Aren't you just doing what you are mad at these religions for?

And essentially what you're talking about isn't eastern vs western religions, but monotheistic vs. polytheistic religions.First, within the monotheistic religions, your original premise is that \\"religions that bar non believers from salvation are morally inferior.  Then you invoke Jews, who have no such belief, but include them inaccurately because they're the \\"chosen people.\\"  I say inaccurately because Jews don't believe only Jews go to heaven. The Jewish religion place no emphasis on the afterlife, some religious Jews believe in one, other Jews don't.  But even those who do don't believe it's limited to Jews, it's for anyone with a \\"righteous soul,\\" though that's not clearly defined.  So one third of your argument about monotheistic (or Abrahamic) religions, is incorrect.  Considering themselves as the \\"chosen people\\" doesn't equal \\"non believers are barred from salvation.\\"Second, people have a tendency to see Eastern religions as more peaceful, more morally pure.  But name me a religion that hasn't been involved in war in the name of religion.  In the Indian subcontinent, Hindus vs. Muslims, Hindus vs. Sikhs, Hindus vs. Jains.  In South and SE Asia, Buddhists vs. Muslims.  Which I understand isn't your point, but you seem to be saying that Eastern religions are morally superior, and I don't think that's true.  Just look at the caste system within Hinduism as an example.Back to your original point. Aside from the monotheistic religions, while other religions believe in reincarnation, that's very different than salvation.  They're not comparable.  So all you're really saying is the Christianity and Islam are morally inferior (in the most reductive sense of your argument).

It also can be translated as \\"And whoever seeks judgement other than submission to God, it will not be accepted from him...\\" The Quran explicitly does consider the God of Christians and Jews the same God as Allah. And even calls Jesus' followers\\"Muslims\\".Surah 2:62 (Quran): \\"Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans C those who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteous work C will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.\\" (people of the book is still arbitrary exclusion)This phrase is repeated multiple times in the Quran in different ways, other similar verses emphasize *anyone* that believes in God and does good deeds of compassion to help others.Surah 4:56 (Quran): \\"Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses C We will burn them in a Fire. Every time their skin is cooked through, We will replace it with new skin so they may taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.\\"The word \\"disbelieve\\" is not really an accurate translation. It says \\"kuffar\\" in Arabic, which literally means \\"ones who cover\\". It doesn't literally have anything to do with belief.A fairer translation in English might be something like \\"rejector\\" or \\"ingrate\\". It is never used in the Quran as a general term for Christians, Jews, etc. It the Quran, it essentially refers to a miserly ungrateful person who takes the good fortune that Allah gives them and uses it to oppress others, or at least has total indifference to the suffering of others. The Quran usually uses the word \\"kafir\\" to refer to people who attack or oppress Muslims. It never states that all non-muslims are kuffar.\\n  \\nWhat am I misinterpreting?Well for one that the standard medieval interpretation said that non-muslims can go to heaven too, especially if they didn't understand Islam. This is a quote from Imam al-Ghazali, one of the most influential theologians of the medieval era, about non-muslims who heard about Islam but rejected it because they thought Muhammad was a bad person:The name of Muhammad has indeed reached their ears, but they do not know his true description and his character. Instead, they heard from the time they were young that a deceitful liar named Muhammad claimed to be a prophet. As far as I am concerned, such people are excused like those who the call of Islam has not reached, for while they have heard of the Prophets name, they heard the opposite of his true qualities. And hearing such things would never arouse ones desire to find out who he was.\\"Other extremely influential medieval theologians such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya believed all non-muslims would go to heaven, and affirmed universal salvation for all people Muslim or not.This is a more common understanding than you might think. For example, here's a video from a modern Saudi cleric arguing that people from any religion, even atheists can go to heaven:Do only Muslims go to Heaven?

The Sacrifice Upon the Cross is God providing an avenue for an individual to achieve salvation through the grace of God himself. Accordingly, it is the virtue of understanding human limitation and divine agape (selfless love) that leads to the Christian achieving salvation, not dint of birth. A person could be born into Christianity but not understand what the Sacrifice Upon the Cross is or how humans are limited. This person will not be saved. Further, as others have stated, a person who is not aware of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross with sufficient understanding to grasp this point would not be punished by God. So, Christianity does not argue that morality or virtue are contingent to belonging to the correct group or having the correct creed, if such creed was logistically impossible to have.This is all meaningless given how many different sects of Christianity there are, all with their different beliefs regarding how salvation is achieved and, indeed, what happens to people who don't believe or who are incapable of comprehension. Calvinists believe in predestination. The Catholic Church, for the better part of 2000 years, had the doctrine that the unbaptized go to Limbo. I guess you could call that salvation because it isn't Hell, but it's also a denial of heaven.Also, while I care less about Judaism apologetics than Christian apologetics, I do have to point out how 'separate but equal'-y your logic there sounds.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Capitalism trumps democracy.","title":"Sanders pens Fox News op-ed slamming political power of billionaires: That is not democracy"},{"text":"Everything about your first section applies equally to other manufacturer's EV divisions, as well as Boeing's entire existence.

For example, no verse in any religious text should be taken as single statement. Each verse in a bigger part of the whole. Romans 10:12-1512 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentilethe same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13 for, Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. 14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?15 And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!In Christianity a life full of morals is meaningless in the afterlife if you haven't accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior.

Republicans oppose DC statehood purely because it would benefit Democrats. But we can't deny American citizens basic rights just because of how they might vote. That's fundamentally undemocratic.DC has more residents than Vermont or Wyoming, pays more federal taxes than 21 states, and has a larger GDP than 17 states. Its residents serve in the military but have no say in whether we go to war. They're affected by federal laws but can't vote on them. This is exactly the kind of taxation without representation that the American Revolution was fought over.Also, your comparisons to Jefferson or eastern Oregon aren't equivalent. Those regions already have representation through their current states. DC residents have none at all. They're literally second-class citizens in their own country.Bottom line: This isn't about partisan advantage. It's about basic democratic rights.

I disagree with almost every sentence about how you describe the left. I absolutly disagree with you using the terms woke, left and social justice interchangably. This makes it hard for me to communicate with you, as i have to first build a bridge. And i need you to build a bridge too, if you really want to change your view. I don't want to convince you of leftist ideals, rather i want you to at least have a realistic picture of it. So here is my view from inside the movement.* *First i will answer the CMV question:*The question is wrong. The ones that critize the structure are NOT the ones that have this \\"ruthlessly\\" individualistic response.  So yes you are right that its incompatible. No you are wrong in the sense that you describe different people. From my perspective the left has long learned from its individualistic mistake. Instead we critize individualism and call for collective organization (worker unions) and collective actions. As individuals however we also acknowledge that the private is political.So if we want feminism, we call for collective action (abortion rights, body autonomity, shaping awareness about domestic violence) but are also practicing it in individual action (critizing misogynic behavior instead of ingoring it, trying to talk to women about how safe they feel and what they need, trying to not objectify women). Those individual actions i take ARE compatible with my analysis that this is a cultural problem.You can easily verify this by talking to women. Ask them where they feel safer going alone: In a conservative bar/club or in a progressive bar/club with an awareness concept. The latter one is far from perfect and they might feel unsafe in both. To add an anecdotal evidence: I was talking to a close friend of mine and she told me how nice it felt that in this one club in this other country, the men weren't annyoing her. She told me how they just asked once and then instantly moved on after a no. IT baffled me that this was not normal. She normaly experiences that men will try 2-4 times to talk to her in one night even after receiving a clear no. And this, my fellow human, is the structural problem. THis experience does shape her reaction. ANd it also shapes the behavior of men. Its a structural problem but no policy in the world will make them understand that no means no and yes means yes. Men have to elarn to accept a no and women need to be empowered to clearly state a no.I hope you understand this example. Feel free to ask. The example is not perfect so it really depends on how willing you are to try to understand.* *Now about this \\"analysis, which i find is a strawman.*Nah sry. I can do this. ITs too much. Literally every sentence i disagree with. They speak about this Whiteragility thing by some unknown person. Whtf is this shit about Souls? This is not representative for the left.How can Deboer say that the only political struggle is the self? Like wtf? There are so many other struggles that demand collective actions. Its really stupid to say its the only thing. Its one thing besides others.we combat homophobia by not accepting homophobic behavior! THose pride parades are also important but they are made by LGBT ppl for LGBT ppl to empower them. Empowerment is important. We need people to speak about the things we need to change. And we need to listen. They jsut want to feel safe. At least from what ive heard they don't want to worry about being attacked for wearing a skirt as a men. And yes the person i heard it from was attacked for wearing a skirt (which is not even inherently gay).Yes Identitfy politics has a position in the left bubble. But its not the only one.

When people criticize him, they're not just attacking him personally - they're highlighting how billionaires exploit tax loopholes, manipulate markets, and wield disproportionate political influence. These individual cases become powerful examples that help average people understand complex structural issues.I am not convinced that Andrew Tate has created a single misogynist - he probably just tapped into something that was already thereThis is exactly backwards. Of course underlying conditions exist, but influential figures actively shape and amplify these problems. Tate didn't just \\"tap into\\" existing misogyny - he created a profitable business model around radicalizing young men and selling them a toxic worldview. That's a structural issue playing out through individual action.The left isn't being shallow - they're recognizing that structural change requires both policy reform AND confronting the specific people and institutions that maintain those structures. It's not either/or.Look at how Trump's presidency reshaped political norms and institutions. Individual leaders absolutely can strengthen or weaken structural problems. Pretending they're just interchangeable figureheads ignores how power actually works in the real world.The most effective movements in history combined structural analysis with strategic pressure on key individual actors.

That is a tunnel. A military base would be inappropriate to situate at a hospital and would allow Israel a rationale to notify the hospital that they were no longer going to consider it protected and give it a timeframe for this withdrawal of protection to come into effect as per article 19 of the Geneva Convention (IV). Israel did not give notice so this qualifies as an Israeli war crime regardless.However all we have here is a tunnel. A tunnel to a hospital is not only not intrinsically illegal, but I would say makes perfect sense when taking into account it being a legal right for wounded combatants to receive medical care and Israel's history of targeting ambulances and other protected vehicles/personnel (Another Israeli war crime)I mean, there is a giant tunnel system under Gaza city that Israel has been working to clear for over a year. Are you doubting that exists? Or are you under the impression it is located in some sort of military district, as opposed to under the city's civilian population?Please feel free to cite the alleged laws you think these tunnels violate.Call it whatever you want, as long as you acknowledge it is a war crime. But, the result is the same.The result of committing one war crime is not that they commit a totally different war crime that they have never committed, that makes absolutely no sense.Hamas commits war crimes but as I have stated multiple times and you have now conceded; using human shields is not one of them and that is something only Israel has been proven to do. As you said, Hamas claiming war crimes does not make them so.Who mentioned Hamas? Israeli war crimes have been documented by the Palestinian victims, the UN, journalists, human rights organisations, IDF soldiers who have spoken out about the crimes they have committed and more. Hell, some of them have been admitted by Israel and Israel merely tries to excuse why they think their war crimes are necessary.Bullshit. Arab armies literally invaded the day after independence was declared and you want to pretend it was because of supposed ethnic cleansing?!Please dial back your attitude when you are incorrect. Israel declared independence on 14 May 1948 but had already had leaders state their goals of grabbing as much Palestinian land as possible and enacted Operation Dalet to begin doing so by 10 March 1948, over two months earlier.\\"Illegal occupation\\"? You mean the territory Egypt and Syria lost when they lost their attempted invasion of Israel?It's impossible to legally lose territory in war, it's not the 15th century. The acquisition of land by force is specifically outlawed, so what I mean is what I saw - which also happens to be what is factually correct. That was still Egyptian and Syrian land, but land that Israel was illegally occupying.International law is clear that you can't take land in a war of conquest, but you can in a defensive war. Invade another country, and you only have yourself to blame for your losses. There was nothing illegal about it. There are consequences for invading a neighbour.Wrong on every level. Israel was the one that attack its neighbours, starting by launching an air attack on Egypt in the early hours. Israel lied about the rationale for this and stated Egypt attacked first, but in years since the record has been cleared up and that has been exposed as a lie with no armed Egyptian planes having been in the air at the time.The acquisition of land by force is also illegal regardless of the war being defensive or offensive regardless, as per article 2 paragraph 4 of the Un charter.I wouldn't call them simple minded robots, but yes. It isn't a secret that propaganda works. And is propaganda literally the only factor and all people will single mindedly follow it? That's ridiculous, and.every Palestinian negotiator has known the right of return is not a realistic ask.That Israel is so willing to disregard the human rights of others and commit war crimes is an indictment of Israel. Also the Right of Return is one of many compromises that Palestinian negotiators were willing to make during peace talks, but the talks still failed due to incessant Israeli demands.It is not a concession to ask for the sun the moon and then say \\"ok, just the sun then.\\"Palestinians refugees, like all refugees, already have a right to return. That's not something Israel has any say in. The issue is, one again, Israeli war crimes and their opposition to Palestinian rights. It's also worth noting that Palestinians have been willing to give up this right for peace but still never got acceptance from Israel.If they are then they truly suck at it,  since Gaza has more than tripled in population since 1990 from 650k people to 2.2M.Google ethnic cleansing and come back.So, what is the \\"proportional response\\" to a group of religious zealots willing to give their lives for the cause of wiping out your race?Firstly lol at talking about out a group of religious zealots willing to give their lives for the cause of wiping out your race and not realising that this applies to Israel as the religious zealots willing to give their lives for the cause of wiping out Palestinians.Secondly, not committing war crimes (including ending their occupation which is the central cause of the conflict), only targeting civilians, if civilians will be hurt as a side effect of a military action then then it being proportional to the military benefit. The same standards I expect of everyone in every conflict.Is this another of those one-sided rules that Israel has to comply with when Hamas will blatantly disregard it at every turn?No.What was October 7th the proportionate response to? Was the slaughter of unarmed civilians at a music festival a proportionate response to Israel engaging in peace talks with Saudi Arabia?No, hence why they were war crimes and wrong. However just like Israel's decades of war crimes leading up to October 7th don't justify October 7th because war crimes are never justifiable, October 7th doesn't justify Israel's war crimes since then because war crimes are never justifiable.","title":"CMV: What the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinians is the same thing as the Nazis did to the Jews"},{"text":"[/r/neoliberal/new](/r/neoliberal/new): [It Will Change You: Dean Phillips on the Twisted Culture of Congress](/r/neoliberal/comments/1ho4fxl/it_will_change_you_dean_phillips_on_the_twisted/)*Replies to this comment will be removed, please participate in the linked thread*","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Define the left for us?

I have a degree in Religious Studies and one of my foci was domestic cults, though you certainly dont need a degree in religion to smell what MAGA is cooking. Lets look at the big six identifiers: 1. A charismatic, narcissistic or sociopathic leader practicing absolute authoritarianism without any meaningful accountability.  The leader is considered to be a genius or a religious figure. The leader often claims to have been given special insight directly from a divinity. The membership gives the leader extreme latitude for any unethical and abusive behavior. 2. Isolating members and penalizing them for leaving. A majority of cults believe there is no legitimate reason to ever leave the group, and all former members are morally and intellectually wrong for choosing to leave. A majority of cults work to isolate their membership from any social ties (including family) that might oppose their dogmatic beliefs and behaviors. 3. No tolerance for critical inquiry or questioning the leader or the doctrine of the leader or of the cult as a whole. Period.4. Extreme and dogmatic beliefs and unreasonable fears about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe or evil conspiracies.5. Endorsing illegal, abusive, and dangerous behavior to achieve the ends of the leader. 5. New members are love-bombed and welcomed heartily when joining the cult. Though as a new initiates membership  or devotion level progresses, the leader often abuses the initiate to greater degrees as a test of their loyalty. We can clearly see this tendency in Scientology as well as the Nuwaubian Nation led by Dwight York. Abuses of members (physically, sexually, emotionally, and socially) were/are rife. MAGA checks every one of these boxes.

Romans 2:12-16:All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in Gods sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.  (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) This will take place on the day when God judges peoples secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.This is basically straight up saying that non-Christians CAN be saved. That those who follow the law God put in their hearts may still be saved.Now Christianity does also state that whoever believes in Christ will be saved (though it later expands on that, in specifying even demons believe but the faith that leads to salvation must be accompanied by acts of devotion) and that non come to the Father except through Christ.I personally believe something very similar to Saint Augustine. Now this is my opinion here but its based on a fair bit of knowledge and largely rooted in the beliefs of one of the best studied Christians of all time.My thought is that on the day of judgment we will stand before God and be given full knowledge of who he is. And then we will have the choice to humble ourselves and accept his authority and be saved or to reject his authority and be cut off from him in hell.If this is true, living a Christian life where we continuously seek to know him better, surrender authority to him, and live in accordance with his will is the best possible way to prepare for the day of judgment. But it also means that people who are not Christians in life might still be able to make the right choice on the day of judgment.I dont think this is going to be an easy yes or no answer. I think for instance, if you have an addiction to porn there is going to be this painful moment where you choose between giving it up forever and living in Gods kingdom where it does not exist or clinging to it and dwelling in hell where sins of the flesh still exists. If you believe in a racist God who loves your race more than others youre going to have this painful moment where you must give up that false belief and submit to the true God who loves us all equally. I think judgment will be painful for everyone. Even Christians. But the closer you are to God when it happens the less painful it will be.Every statement in scripture Ive heard about faith and salvation seems to be consistent with this view.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Im not dismissing anyones system of ethics lol.

Loser mindset, unironically. Because that dominates everything these days it dominates because, as I said before, democratic politicians lack spines. They are participants in the spread of right wing propaganda. Immediately after Biden took office the democrats stopped presenting themselves as a pro-migrant party and started adopting the same anti-immigrant strong border rhetoric that Trump had been using instead of providing a counter narrative. If you keep supporting spineless neoliberal stooges then you are complicit in the continuation of the spread of far-right ideology.  As such, simply putting progressive candidates in general elections wont work and will just result in more elections lost.That is literally the only way to tackle right wing populism. People are very clearly losing faith in Neoliberalism and have been since 2008, they want change and the Republican Party is offering change. The change they offer is for the worse, but its at least coated fake populist rhetoric to win votes. A progressive candidate, like Sanders, could run a populist campaign as well and their policies would actually improve peoples lives if they were implemented. And even if they arent implemented, stagnant neoliberalism is better than fascism.  The solution involves a bottom up approach of getting voters to understand the appeal of progressive policies and then you can begin to run progressive candidates with a hope of winning elections. Its just rhetoric. Just use populist rhetoric, thats it, thats all you need, people like populist rhetoric. You dont even need to actually be progressive or implement progressive policies, just say things people like hearing. The average American isnt a policy wonk, theyre morons who just want to vote for someone that feels good.  My issue is with leftists who think were already at that stage and that the only thing missing is to put people like Bernie on the ticket. Bernie would have lost too because the same attacks that were used on Hillary, Biden and Kamala would have been used on him as well. Then literally any democrat would lose, and they will continue to lose for the rest of time if you think that any democrat whos called a socialist cant win an election.  The only difference is the attacks actually would have had more merit when leveled at Bernie than they did at the other three.The problem isnt the attacks, its how theyre responded to. We saw this with Trump, we had a video tape of him confessing to sexually assaulting women and the electorate didnt give a shit because he just brushed it off and kept moving forward without going in the defense. Bernie couldve done that with the socialism angle, neoliberals like Biden and Kamala cant.  I agree with Bernies policies, but I actually think there is a case to be made that his high profile has damaged the electability of Democratic candidates, as the electorate still views socialism as a bad thing. We need to change that before claiming to be something that most of the population has been convinced is a bad thing.It isnt socialism that keeps losing the election though, its neoliberalism. Youre not going to be able to convince people that socialism is good if youre also going to be doing this defense of neoliberal politicians as the only ones who can win elections, you cant present it as a viable alternative while saying its impossible. To win politics you need to have a spine, and part of having a spine in politics is the ability to remain fully on the offense, doing that from the left requires that progressive candidates continue to run and be ran and presented as serious contenders.","title":"Sanders pens Fox News op-ed slamming political power of billionaires: That is not democracy"},{"text":"Give up reddit ??","title":"What is something reasonable you should do, but you won't, since it demands too many sacrifices?"},{"text":"As much as conservative pundits can f-off, Biden is a failure.Everything he did as president will be overturned by Trump.
