I think he genuinely believed that the unconstitutional actions he took over the course of the war (shutting down newspapers, suspending habeas corpus, instituting the first income tax and the first military draft in U.S. history, to name a few) were necessary to preserve the Union. He did those things not to solidify or increase his own power (as tyrants do), but because he felt it was his personal responsibility as President to hold the country together. Whether that could have been accomplished without such extreme measures is a debate for another subreddit, but Lincoln certainly didnt believe it was possible. While the war did result in the abolition of slavery (a system which is completely indefensible from a libertarian perspective), it is important to note that this was not Lincolns primary aim: If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it.Ultimately, I think the right to secession is strongly implied in the Constitution (certainly when paired with the precedent set by the Declaration of Independence), however vile the Confederate States motivations for secession may have been. From a political and constitutional perspective, avoiding conflict by peacefully ceding federal control over the military installations (like Fort Sumter) within the South (while simultaneously negotiating for a reunion of the states) would have been the right move.Now from a moral and religious standpoint, I believe that Lincolns actions were entirely appropriate as they led to the destruction of the great evil of slavery. I feel that God raised him up as a leader specifically for this purpose, even though it was not Lincolns original intent. I would argue that he spoke in the spirit of prophecy when, in his Second Inaugural Address, he proclaimed:[I]f God wills that [the Civil War] continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsmans two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.Furthermore, I think that God left it to the later generations to prevent the precedents set by Lincolns actions from becoming entrenched in the government of our nation. They failed in this task, and we their descendants have thus far also failed to arrest the growth of tyranny which those precedents sparked. However, the arguments of my last three paragraphs probably belong in a different forum as well.","title":"Thoughts on Abraham Lincoln"},{"text":"Stare deep..into....The Nozzle.","title":"Secret Service Probing Musks Post About Threats to Biden and Harris"},{"text":"Yes but the margin of error is based on 3 standard deviations.

This is not surprising as it was an attack targeted at the pockets of Hezbollah members while they were at home, and pocket height for a member of Hezbollah is head height for their kid. So while civilians might not have been directly targeted the collateral damage was predictable. Whether or not it constitutes a war crime therefore comes down to the question of proportionality: was the reasonably expected collateral damage in proportion to the military advantage gained?That's not an easy question to answer, but it does need answering because there was collateral damage, and so the burden of proof is on the IDF to show they gained enough of a military advantage to make it proportional. And frankly I'm sceptical, because this feels a lot like a stunt to me. Given the size of Hezbollah and their sophistication I don't really buy that taking out their pagers and walkie talkies really cripples their comms all that much. And even if it does, that's presumably temporary and Hezbollah and Israel are not currently in an active ground war so all it is really going to do is delay any plans they might have for a few weeks.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Asheville is the sanest and most liberal city in NC.

However, it is staying in Lebanon and has not entered Israeli territory, conducted a mass murder, or kidnapped civilians. Israel wants to avoid a wider war with Lebanon to disarm and destroy Hezbollah, as such a war would be costly in terms of capital, equipment, and lives. Israel wants to disrupt and disable Hezbollah operations as much as possible while invading a direct war.The war in Gaza is fundamentally different. Hamas must be totally uprooted and destroyed as a fighting entity and, ultimately, as a political entity. This is made very clear by Hamass actions on October 7th, its utter rejection of any peaceful resolution, and its insistence that it will repeat the 10/7 attacks as many times as possible. This takes MUCH more intensive action and direct warfare. An action like the pager operation would do very little to change the outcome of the war or uproot Hamas, plus it would be very difficult to interdict and effect smuggled goods as was done with Hezbollah. The need to find and destroy Hamass ammunition and leadership is a much greater task than just disrupting communications.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Did I?

Even Volkswagen makes most of their cars in Mexico.Edit: this also brings to question how many of these companies like dodging employment laws too. Same reasons why we dont want Nike making their shoes in China. No tariffs means a company can much more easily operate out of a sweatshop in China.

(Many intelligence agencies are constantly looking for operations like this because they have a potentially high return on investment.) Based on the reporting weve seen so far, Israel was planning to wait to set them off for a particularly strategic moment, but the cover was blown and they had to act before the effort became completely worthless. It could be targeted like that because Hezbollah used a single vendor to supply the pagers and distributed them internally. No such cheap, precise targeting effort is possible when trying to rid Gaza of Hamas. If there were, they would have done it a long time ago. Members of Hamas in Gaza look like other Gazans. The level of collaboration, diligence, and sympathy with Hamas varies from person to person and over time, whereas who has a Hezbollah-issued pager at a given moment is pretty cut-and-dried. Gaza is also a different place than Syria and Lebanon, where most members of Hezbollah could be expected to be. Israel can act with relative impunity in Gaza.

The example cited was political organizations lying telling people they can vote after the election.\\nThe Question: And I want to just, before I ask you another question, I want to talk about what you just mentioned about misinformation  because oftentimes before, in previous political chapters, disinformation  telling people where to vote the wrong way  these were called shenanigans, but its becoming more ominous. Can you talk a little bit about that and what you do to ensure that there are penalties for that? Kumar asked.Walz's Answer: Yeah. Years ago it was the little things, telling people to vote the day after the election. And, you know, we kind of brushed them off, Walz replied. Now we know its intimidation at the ballot box. Its undermining the idea that mail-in ballots arent legal. I think we need to push back on this, Walz added. Theres no guarantee of free speech on misinformation or or hate speech, and especially around our democracy. Tell the truth where the voting places are, who can vote, whos able to be there? And I, you know, watching some states continue to weaken the protections around the ballot, I think, is whats inspiring us to to lean into this.idk what the fuck Walz meant by \\"hate speech\\" in this context, I guess you can call that a Freudian slip if you want.

Its pretty subjective whether a statement is intolerant or not, and anyway sometimes intolerance is justified (some behaviors should not be tolerated).

You seem to pretend like because some countries designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization that literally anyone associated with them is a \\"legitimate Target\\". But that's just not true. Hezbollah is a political organization and acts as the government in parts of Lebanon. Killing someone simply for being a member of Hezbollah is just terrorism. In my opinion this is just more proof that Israel is a deeply evil country. Any project to create a ethnic majority state by force is going to result in this sort of fascist tendency and disregard for human life. vaguely a Zionist in the loosest sense of the term (the state of Israel exists and should continue to exist)If you think that Israel must be a Jewish majority state then the violence will never end. The displaced and abused Palestinians will never give up trying to assert their rights and zionists Jewish supremacists will never stop trying to expand. I don't believe that Israel ever should have been created given that it was done explicitly against the will of the population living on the land wanted where they wanted to create the state. But regardless there's no future Israel if they continue down the path that they have taken. Their fascism has made everyone hate them. Not because they're Jewish but because they won't stop ethnically cleansing and abusing the Palestinians.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"lol, i think the 'black nazi' self description is apt.  at least the man knows himself.","title":"This may have sealed the deal for a Kamala Harris presidency! ?"},{"text":"They are all weird","title":"This may have sealed the deal for a Kamala Harris presidency! ?"},{"text":"Does that apply to alt-right as well?","title":"Notice conservative subs taken over by leftists?"},{"text":"more evidence i think Harris is being underestimated in the polls.","title":"Video Of Tim Walz Winning Over A Bunch Of Undecided Frat Bros Has Democrats Cheering"},{"text":"#VOTE BLUE","title":"Please, not again!"},{"text":"Damn, I don't pay attention to the news for a few hours, and all hell breaks loose.That said, the Governor of NC is one messed up dude, and this scandal might have just handed that state to Harris, a state Trump must win.","title":"This may have sealed the deal for a Kamala Harris presidency! ?"},{"text":"Maine should counter this so the second district vote has to match the first district.","title":"The late GOP push to deny Kamala Harris a Nebraska electoral vote"},{"text":"Brother they are not going to lump their corruption in with misinformation.

This is done by design as a self-defense tactic by them, and a large part of the reason theyre able to do that, is their disregard for (their own) civilian lives, and more importantly, their financiers complete disregard for civilian lives (on either side of the conflict). Hezbollah, due to varying circumstances, is unable to operate with that level of impunity on a diplomatic level (within their own power structure) and therefore cant operate amongst the shadows the way Hamas can.Think of it this way; Hezbollah defense strategy is to be off the grid as much as possible, but they still require contact with the grid to operate. Hamas on the other hand employs a strategy of we ARE the grid, making it impossible to isolate the tip of the spear nor the head of the snake.But going back to the Israel side of it and their inability to execute mass small-scale attacks on Hamas targets like they were able to do against Hezbollah - a good parallel that will connect with anyone thats a sports fan, would be comparing it to targeting the NY Yankees versus Targeting NY Yankee fans. One is an easily identifiable and well run organization with a clear cut structure and base of operations. The other is a large group of people defined solely by their belief in something but generally only identifiable when they chose to be. The person next to you might be a yankee fan and you wouldnt know it if they werent wearing their hat or shirt. Furthermore, the person next to them may be wearing a yankee hat, but not necessarily even be a yankee fan (it could be a style choice, or something they inherited, or they may just be going to a yankee game becuase they like baseball). The point being, its extremely hard to determine whether or not someone is a Yankee fan without talking to them, especially compared to identifying someone who plays for or works for the Yankees.Which is all to say that, Israels ability to execute small targeted attacks against Hezbollah and their inability to due the same in Gaza is primarily due to the differences in the operating structure of the two organizations. This doesnt by any means excuse indiscriminate bombing or civilian casualties or any of that stuff. It just explains why theyre unable to do similar small-scale targeted campaigns against Hamas.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"I don't think you do know.

It argued that given thousands of devices exploded simultaneously, meant the attacker failed to verify that each target and distinguish between those who can be targeted and those who cannot.[113] Alonso Gurmendi-Dunkelberg, of the London School of Economics, also argued in order to meet the principle of distinction, Israel would have had to verify if each individual device was in the possession of a military target and not a civilian one. He opines, it is unlikely Israel did that given that thousands of devices were detonated simultaneously.[114]\\n Professor William Boothby wrote in Lieber Institute for Law &amp; Warfare that the targets appeared to be persons to whom the pagers were issued and it was probably reasonable to assume pagers would be in possession of their users. He did caution that the attack would be illegal if it was known that the pagers were also issued to non-combatant members of Hezbollah, for example its diplomatic, political, or administrative staff.[38] Boothby wrote that additional concern was whether the incidental injury from these larger number of explosions was proportional to the military advantage expected.[38]\\n Brian Finucane of the Reiss Center on Law and Security questioned whether the explosions constituted an indiscriminate attack, which are either not directed at a specific military objective, or employ a method which cannot be directed at a military objective.[39] Professor Toby Walsh argued the attack was indiscriminate in nature, given that the pagers cant be tracked.[115] Booby traps are mostly outlawed under the Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Amended Protocol II) of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons,[37] to which Israel is a party.[38] Article 7, paragraph 2 of Amended Protocol II prohibits the use of booby-traps or other devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material.[37][38][116] The rules of engagement of some countries, such as the United Kingdom, also ban explosive devices disguised as harmless items.[37][117] The United States Department of Defense Law of War Manual gives watches, cameras, tobacco pipes, and headphones as examples of such items,[38] which are prohibited to prevent the production of large quantities of dangerous objects that can be scattered around and are likely to be attractive to civilians, especially children.[37][118]","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"So who decides if it's misinformation or hate speech.

They're getting confirmation bias from all overThey're seeing online comments like the OP one (and there are many in this post alone), then hearing all [their friends are voting for Harris](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/close-friends-share-political-views-table/), and most people they know [in their community](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/important-community-qualities-one/) are voting for Harris, then finally they're seeing media saying things like [\\"This Was the Beginning of Donald Trumps Final Unraveling\\"](https://newrepublic.com/article/185850/debate-donald-trump-final-unraveling) (which had 24.4k upvotes when posted to Reddit). Or how about, [\\"Trump aides alarmed he's 'just golfing all day and stewing' as election slips away: WaPo\\"](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-campaign-faltering/) (with 50.8k upvotes). Both those articles were top posts on Reddit, garnering millions of clicks from Reddit aloneThe media isn't directly calling it a landslide, but they're sure giving that impression. Now you and I know those are some pretty dubious sources, but clearly many people don't, since they're getting more clicks than more legitimate sources running balanced storiesThis is all to say: Segments of the population are being repeatedly exposed to the idea that Harris is a heavy favorite in the election. We have decades of evidence from the advertising industry about the [effectiveness of repeated exposure](https://www.brax.io/blog/repetition-in-advertising-the-impact-of-frequency-on-your-marketing-strategy) ([here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2015.1018460) is an actual meta-analysis, but it requires access to scientific articles, which not everyone has). No one is going out and becoming a lifelong Coke drinker because of a single ad, but Coke ads are absolutely creating lifelong Coke drinkersMany people, like you, base their opinions on their feelings rather than cold hard data. If they've been repeatedly exposed to the incorrect idea the election is one-sided, they are far more likely to believe it regardless of what the data says","title":"Kamala Harris isnt done picking up support from Republicans | \\nWith fewer than 50 days remaining before Election Day, the number of prominent Republicans endorsing Kamala Harris is becoming an avalanche."},{"text":"Only voting seals the deal.

Im American. And I dont support the Gaza campaign by Israel.Do we want a world where attacks such as the pager attack become regularized and possible? Israel has the benefit of the support of Americas money and military resources to protect itself in a hostile region. Hezbollah is a known terrorist organization - in terms of its attacks on those countries.Israel v Hezbollah happens to be a very easy clear cut battle of good guys v bad guys. If it wouldnt result in all out war and mass casualties many would support all out war between the factions here.The problem comes from the fact that if the roles were reversed wed be condemning Hezbollah. Wed call it a cowardly criminal act. If theyd hit only military members of the IDF wed be talking about how they couldve absolutely done harm to Israeli civilians.And we wouldnt be surprised.Part of the reason we detest the Gaza conflict is that it is a clear superpower of the region bullying destroying and indiscriminately responding to violence with insane forever damaging destruction to an entire region and an entire people. It IS terroristic in nature. There are no arguments that it isnt a genocidal campaign against Palestinians, on purpose, since it began.I believe it is morally imperative for superpowers to not only remain headstrong and level headed in their responses to violent attacks from enemies, but also that it REFUSES to engage in genocide, terrorism, and to always minimize any possibility of escalation, civilian death, and to use every tool of negotiation, world politics, and more to attack governments and organizations instead of people.In both the Gaza campaign, and the pager attack, the standard of warfare has been on the level of any organization or government wed declare Terroristic. The only justification is if you are someone living in the government involved. It is not at all justified on a global, human rights level, and the pager attack particularly makes the everyday technology people all around the world have free and fair game to attack.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"I'm not concerned with how cops negotiate salaries with their employers.

But we aren't. What we've witnessed over the past many decades is a prolonged regional (and at times cross-regional) war. We're dealing with fundamentally opposed ideologies, divided along geographic and philosophic lines who simply cannot live in harmony with one another unless the unimaginable were to happen: a generations-long peace and forgiveness or a unanimously-accepted reconciliation that wiped the record clean.I believe that simply hasn't been proven to be within human nature. And that isn't to say we shouldn't try - but between nations of relatively similar size and capabilities the singularly-most-common end to hostilities is when one side demolishes and subjugates the other. We saw it in both world wars. We've seen it in most regional wars as well. I don't think any human being alive would say it would be appropriate to take attack after attack after attack after attack, and return with no hostilities whatsoever. It's just not in us to be attacked in such a way and be forgiving for it - and those who can are an extreme rarity. There simply isn't any means of devised warfare - aside from lining both sides up on a battlefield and having them shoot at each other - where \\"innocent\\" casualties are guaranteed to be zero.

If the Hezbollah had decided that they'd rather not use these pagers for whatever reason, handed them off, etc., this attack would have caused significantly more civilian casualties (although I frankly don't know the number).

Even if the pagers had been distributed to one child each and they exploded in their class at school, the death toll in children alone would have been a couple orders of magnitude lower. You're right, we have no way of knowing if Hamas officials have a security gap like these pagers.

The Ukrainian leader will hold a separate meeting with Harris, the White House said.

Im more with you than against you on that.My argument is more so that Hamas and Hezbollah are completely different actors in **how** they operate against Israel, and thus the methods that work on one dont work on the other. Hamas is much more deeply entrenched in Gazan society than Hezbollah is in Lebanon. Hezbollah is part of the Lebanese ruling power but acts in contrast to broader Lebanese society that does not support it. Hezbollah acts more like a militia out in the open. Hamas on the other hand directly rules Gaza through essentially mafia-style extortion. They use tunnels and a network of underground (literal and figurative) control mechanisms to hide their military activities. They operate in a much smaller and controlled space and they cannot easily be separated from civilians.Had Israel tried to pull the pager stunt on Hamas, wed be seeing a lot of the same criticisms as with any other military action. Pagers would blow up in UN schools and refugee camps. Pager explosions would set off bigger explosions when targeted Hamas militants were in civilian homes full of rockets. Hamas would have given pagers to its teenage recruits and then claimed them to be civilian child deaths. None of this targeting would have fixed the problems people care about.So while I definitely agree with most of your main points, you must not be naive to the bad faith attempts to criticize ANY military action by Israel, no matter how targeted. Doing this to Hezbollah in a smart way does not mean doing so to Hamas would have either worked or invited a more sympathetic international response.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"And, Ill still vote for him would be the simplest answer.

Despite Arab countries being generally poor, cell phones and smart phones are ubiquitous among the Arab populations. There is no reason for anyone not associated with Hezbollah to have had those pagers. That doesn't mean someone standing next to an exploding pager wouldn't get hurt, but this was about as perfect a surgical strike as can be imagined. There is no good reason to keep searching for made-up risks, as even Hezbollah admitted to having been hit hard. You are, however, correct that Hamas was perceived as a more traditional terror threat, rather than as an army and a possible instigator of war. This was short sighted, as Israel knew they were building an extensive tunnel network, which is a defensive tactic, something that would be useless without a full scale war. This network proved to be formidable as all tunnel networks proved to be going back at least 100 years. I am sure at some point Israel will have a full review of what went wrong with Gaza before Oct 7th, and someone will have to take responsibility for the Oct 7th disaster, but another important difference that should never be ignored: Hezbollah has a base and an interest in Lebanon, they are not Palestinians, and even though they are nominally aiding Gaza, they have not fully committed themselves. Hamas, the leadership of Gaza, have promised that Oct 7th wasn't just a show of force; they said they will want to do 100s and 1000s of Oct 7th repeats until there is no Israel. That is the kind of statement that made it impossible for Israel to not wage an all out war to eliminate Hamas as an organized and capable force.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"It ends today, as long as the shares stay above $12.

What about a recognition of piss poor strategy?Hezbollah's attack on October 8th was not at Israel. It was at a territory on the Lebanese-Syrian border which Israel has been illegally occupying for many years.While the timing of it makes the motivation obvious, countries *do* have the right to assert legitimate territorial claims. The original subject of Hezbollah's attack has never been considered a part of Israel under a single international treaty, and indeed is excluded from Israel's own definitions of its borders if we refer to '67.Israel has the right to exist. It even had Palestine's agreement on that, so when all else fails, we still have a historically amenable division of land between them.Hezbollah's gamble on October 8th was that Israel would not react strongly to largely inconsequential and performative missile barrages on Syrian territory, because it would be a huge escalation and a strategic error to overreact and divide the IDF's focus.What they underestimated was just how badly Netanyahu *needs* this war.Yes, Hezbollah is recognised as a terrorist group. But it is undeniable that the tensions between them had been relatively cooled. Israel responded to attacks which didn't violate its legitimate territory by responding to Hezbollah within Lebanon's own borders. And since the current state of the war on that front was avoidable, every single civilian casualty comes under the umbrella of a heated conflict which shouldn't be occurring at all.There's also the fact that one is a terrorist group and the other is ostensibly a legitimate country. It is not antisemitic to hold Israel to higher standards than the ideological cousins of ISIS. It would be antisemitic to hold Israel to *lower* standards than my own country.I also generally resent the idea of matters concerning Israel being inherently antisemitic.

You can be opposed to the parameters of warfare expanding into blowing up electronic devices sitting in the pockets or on the desks of employees of an enemy government for reasons that having nothing to do with anti-Zionism being trendy.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"The market (since S&amp;P inception) has never cared what party is in the white househttps://preview.redd.it/qe7qm0an1tpd1.png?width=1117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b5973878376514b64da6829954854c270005d26","title":"Trump said that the stock market would crash if Biden were elected president.

Each attack by definition is indiscriminate.Therefore, they have no way of detonating the device in a way that complies with obligations.Which is why Israel will not accept responsibility for this attack. Unlike with a missile, there is no possible way to say that your intel was bad or the device malfunctioned.\\\\As an aside, as you've stated this does demonstrate that there are ways that Israel could operate within Gaza without shelling refugee camps, targeting humanitarian aids workers and sniping children.

You cannot rely on random assortment of quotes from different founders at different times to get a coherent understanding of their views on democracy.Here's my counterexample -- Federalist #10 by James Madison, architect of the Constitution: \\"From this view of the subject, it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society, consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction.\\"Here, Madison is warning very specifically that pure democracy has a shortcoming -- that it tends to lead to factions (interest groups). He is not saying that democracyin general is rotten, but that there is a tendency within *pure democracies* (direct vote with no representation).  \\"A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure, and the efficacy which it must derive from the union.\\"Madison is specific here, saying that the point of the republic is to cure the problem of factions. He is precise in this prescription. He makes no sweeping claim to a deeper understanding of human nature. He is simple saying that having representation reduces the chances of factions running amok. These are advantages over *pure democracy* but he does not call for the abolition of democracy. In fact, he keeps emphasizing *republic* and *democracy* in the same breath precisely because he wants to clarifies how the both would work together. \\"The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic, are first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.\\"That last point is made most clearly here. Madison points out, very clearly, that representatives *must* be elected. This is a principle of democracy, no two ways about it. Any other way of choosing that \\"delegation of the government\\" would not be republican. If that small group was chosen by another small group of citizens, the system would be an aristocracy. If they were chosen out of hereditary right tied to land, that would be feudalism and monarchy. The only way to secure the republic, in Madison's own words, is through democratic procedures of election by the people. The only caveat he notes about democracy is that we cannot adopt *direct* or *pure democracy* -- not because it is wrong in principle but because it leads to practical problems of factions. But even that concern is rooted in support for democracy. His concern is that factions and interest groups will be prioritized at the expense of the voice of the people -- the demos of our democracy. The point of the republic is to preserve our democratic ways, not replace it. It is the most efficient form of democracy, not its counter. The Founders were indeed well-studied and intelligent people. But that means that we cannot reduce their thinking into simple soundbites. We need to read their writings deeply and within context. Otherwise, we draw inaccurate conclusions, such as saying that they hated democracy in the way that we know it today. They did not. They strove for, and achieved, a form of democracy. What they disliked were historical examples of democracy that failed because the system got in its own way. And so they forged a system that would preserve democracy over time, which is of course our present republic.","title":"Don't be fooled by the Left's favorite buzzword: \\"Democracy\\""},{"text":"Cool!

This only worked because Hezbollah's pagers are a self-contained system where an entire shipment went to targets.

That is using these pager attacks, along with the sonic booms over civilian areas(something they have been doing for months now) to instill terror, provoke reactions, and cause chaos and escalation(but without escalating too far). In the context of the above this attack makes sense. In the context of seeking to disable Hezbollah's communication abilities it makes no sense and fails by any conceivable metric to achieve that end while actually having the effect in the long run of being a stress test that identified a weak point in their supply and inspection chain.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"I'm beginning to think there might be a problem with big fat rich old white men.","title":"Trump Shocked That a Woman Is Somehow Doing Better Than Biden in 2024 Race"},{"text":"The honest answer to this is thatShe has, and they don't care.

Musk later deleted the post after it was widely condemned and said it was intended as a joke. But it was already seen by tens of millions, including the Secret Service.The Secret Service investigates when theyre trying to determine whether a person poses an imminent threat to one of their protectees. Threatening the US president or vice president is a?felony?that can carry a hefty fine or up to five years in prison.FOIA Files sent Freedom of Information Act requests to the Secret Services Protective Intelligence and Assessment Division, Office of Protective Operations and Office of Investigations for documents and emails referencing Musks post.On Wednesday, the agency responded to the requests by saying records it has about Musks post were compiled for law enforcement purposes and are being withheld because disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.We followed up with the Secret Services FOIA division and were told that the Protective Intelligence Division advised that it cannot release any records because of enforcement proceedings.**Plus, Trump judge swatting documents**Given all the chaotic news this year, you may have forgotten about this, but in January the federal judge presiding over former President Donald Trumps election interference case was the victim of a?swatting?incident.

News coverage was based almost entirely on police reports. But there wasnt any input from the US Marshals Service, which is tasked with protecting federal judges.

In relation to automobiles, the reason why manual windows, and even manual transmissions have largely been phased out in North America is because most people don't want them, and maintaining the supply and manufacturing infrastructure for a tiny market segment just doesn't make sense. It's also the case for features like air conditioning, which comes standard in all but the lowest models. As for plastic, it's what's enabled people to afford most products. In it's absence, the material costs would place a lot of consumer goods out of reach for many, and people have largely been willing to trade durability/quality/safety for affordability.Industry is fine with this, because plastic is really cheap, and the overall margins can still be significant, even with a reduced cost.","title":"The true conspiracy"},{"text":"Yep.

Additional assault charges against Kinew involving his common-law wife were stayed in 2004.The association also took aim at some of the wording on the original NDP caucus news release, which has enraged lawyers in Manitoba and elsewhere.The statement, released on Monday by NDP caucus chairman Mike Moyes, stated the decision to oust Wasyliw from caucus was after it learned that MLA Wasyliws business partner is acting as Peter Nygards criminal defence lawyer.MLA Wasyliws failure to demonstrate good judgment does not align with our caucus principles of mutual respect and trust.The Criminal Defence Advocacy Society said it encourages the Manitoba NDP to reconsider its decision and offer an unequivocal apology to Mr. Wasyliw and to its constituents.[...]Asked for comment, Justice Minister Matt Wiebe instead sent a statement saying as Attorney General, I am privileged to work on behalf of Manitobans to ensure a fair and just legal system, including respecting and upholding the role of defence lawyers.Every person in Manitoba has the right to a rigorous defence, but we expect caucus members to be focused on their MLA duties rather than their legal practice.The lawyer representing Nygard called the governments statements disappointing.Instead of demonstrating that courage, they just doubled down on a bad position and I am just utterly disappointed, said Gerri Wiebe, noting she voted for the NDP.Had I known that within a year they would make association with me a cause for dismissal, I would rethink that vote. Also, I would like my donations back.Chris Gamby, of the Criminal Defence Lawyers Association of Manitoba, said the government still has to understand the role defence lawyers play in the criminal justice system.Some more clarification and an apology for how they approached this is what we are hoping for, said Gamby.We take heart that other organizations across the country have come out and backed us up on this.Further readings:[https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/practice-areas/criminal/rule-of-law-is-a-cornerstone-of-democracy-marie-henein/365650](https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/practice-areas/criminal/rule-of-law-is-a-cornerstone-of-democracy-marie-henein/365650)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-tdsb-students-wont-be-attending-marie-henein-book-club-event-amid/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-tdsb-students-wont-be-attending-marie-henein-book-club-event-amid/)[https://www.cbc.ca/news/jian-ghomeshi-marie-henein-lawyer-interview-1.3510762](https://www.cbc.ca/news/jian-ghomeshi-marie-henein-lawyer-interview-1.3510762)!ping Can&amp;Law","title":"Lawyers from Manitoba, across Canada demand apology from premier Kinew"},{"text":"It also states that the Harris campaign claimed Pool was advocating the execution of political enemies.

Purdum criticised Ms Harris for answering questions by recycling her rally speeches on the occasions that she agreed to an interview.The vice president cant afford to stick only to rehearsed answers and stump speeches that might not persuade voters or shape what America is talking about, he said.Mr Purdum added: The best evidence suggests that millions of Americans still have questions for her and want to see her fighting for the job, continuing to define herself and her priorities.  \\n**Article Link:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/09/19/kamala-harris-and-tim-walz-giving-fewer-interviews/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/09/19/kamala-harris-and-tim-walz-giving-fewer-interviews/)","title":"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz giving fewer interviews than any candidates in modern history"},{"text":"Sorry Donald, I guess that people really do like women who doesn't have children??","title":"Kamala Harris Opens Major Lead Among Pennsylvania Independents: Poll"},{"text":"*\\"The vast majority of people coming to the U.S are coming to work\\"* ... so he's admitting the vast majority are coming here because of economics - which is not grounds for asylum and would mean a good portion of the 'asylum seekers' we've taken in (if not all), who taxpayers have been footing the bill to care for - are gaming our system.","title":"Democratic witness for hearing says racism is behind calls to secure the southern border"},{"text":"The attack confirms, in my view, that Israel has the capability to target members of Hamas without demolishing city blocks in Gaza. It further condemns the IDFs actions in Gaza as disproportionate and vindictive.Your fallacy is false equivalence.[https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/False-Equivalence](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/False-Equivalence)Attacks like this have a tremendously short shelf life; as soon as any one of the pagers is discovered to be tampered with, all of them will be immediately discarded in a very short period, and the attacker faces all of the international condemnation with none of the benefits of the planned attack. This means that you need to manufacture all of the devices in advance and develop a complicated but near-foolproof distribution system to get them to your targets all at once. The worse a target's normal logistics channels, the lower the chance you have of pulling this off successfully.This sort of thing is vastly harder to do with modern devices, which have almost no internal space to put anything. This attack only succeeded because Hezbollah was willing to continue using pagers.Finally, Hamas has shunned electronic communications and devices, since Israel has been using them to listen in on their communications and disrupt their plots for years now. That's no small part of how they achieved surprise in the October 7 attack.In combination, this means that a similar attack would only be able to target far fewer terrorists in Hamas than Hezbollah, would have a substantially larger chance of getting discovered before detonation, and would result in many fewer dead terrorists for exactly the same international blowback. Are you starting to see the problem?On a sidenote, no, even if I accepted your premise, I don't see how this makes Israel's actions any more or less disproportionate, and I don't see why proportionality even matters. When Japan killed several thousand US sailors in a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, we engaged in a massive war that sank nearly their entire navy, launched a massive firebombing campaign that devastated dozens of cities, and killed about 4% of their entire population. The October 7th attack was far, far worse as an instigating factor: they killed a greater percentage of Israel's population than Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, were deliberately targeted against civilians, and included massive, widespread atrocities. As far as I'm concerned, any group of people who deliberately provided aid, comfort, and concealment to Hamas afterwards in full knowledge of the likely consequences of retaliation have absolutely no ability to claim mistreatment.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"no problem bro this is the trenches and we are fighting the good fight!","title":"Why?"},{"text":"Dude I know what flushed cheeks look like, he smeared blood on his face get over it.let me give you an example of why Im doing this, the user wrote, posting a photo of a family holding signs showing support for their trans daughter.

It was clearly a serendipitous opportunity for Israel to take advantage of superior intelligence and logistical might. From here on out, Hezbollah might distribute the majority of any imported electronics to innocent people so that such an attack could no longer be cleanly executed. The lack of regard for the Geneva convention that is displayed by organizations such as Hezbollah or Hamas is a direct result of desperation due to weakness.The fact that Israel, with the support of the West, is exponentially stronger than their enemies necessarily undermines the legitimacy of offensive tactics and sets a higher bar for observance of human rights and a greater effort toward diplomacy. People who support the excessive aggression of Israel claim that Israel is at risk of being wiped out by their Islamic enemies.A much different reality is on display in a clear demonstration of how pathetic Israel's enemies actually are. They hide behind women and children, they cannot secure their supply chain and obtain weapons/defenses that can compete with the ordinance employed by Israel. Iran's attack on Israel was almost completely harmless due to the Iron Dome.If anything, the pager attacks will give China rhetorical ammunition to justify their desire to annex Taiwan and will support Putin's claim that the West is a global tyrant.The axis powers were nearly successful in WW2 due to military industrial supremacy if the United States had not been drawn into the conflict due to the axis power's willingness to attack non-combatants far beyond the front. It really was not their lack of justification but rather their escalating aggression that led to awakening the giant.We really are at risk for setting off a global conflict if we continue to expand our offensives against forces that could just as soon be defused and defended against if we were willing to humble ourselves enough to concede on issues such as the Nakba rather than use their attempts of revenge as justification to continue our domination of them. Both 9/11 and 10/7 attacks were massive failures of the American and Israeli intelligence/security institutions, and the pager attacks belie any claim that they could not have been avoided.We are running a real risk of being cast as a schoolyard bully who picks fights with adversaries that are far smaller and weaker by *allowing* them to swing first after relentlessly instigating.It is not only a question of whether the ideology of the West is more defensible than the ideology of its adversaries, but also whether our aggression will escalate the conflict and lead to unacceptable destruction that could have been avoided through earnest negotiation rather than dictation from a position of power. War is the destruction of life and property for all parties involved, whereas diplomacy is a net win for humanity and the pursuit of justice.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"hahaha I thought the same: \\"Harris Tanking with Indies in PA\\" coming in 30 minutes.","title":"Kamala Harris Opens Major Lead Among Pennsylvania Independents: Poll"},{"text":"Well all three have the same origin story, and there will always be those who wish to use their faith as a weapon.","title":"Muslim Americans moving to Jill Stein in potential blow to Kamala Harris"},{"text":"It was targeted by its very nature -- the pagers were distributed by Hezbollah.And cheap electronics absolutely never change hands...You can weigh the collateral damage and decide it's worth it, but it's pathetic to pretend there isn't collateral damage with something this wide reaching and semi-targeted","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Because he's a spoiled, egotistical, corrupt manchild.

He's a transactional person who will scratch anyone's back who scratches his, and he's breaking status quo US foreign policy/ national interest strategy. One act he did in the beginning of his 2016 presidency was reverse Obama's aid pause to Egypt that was intended to protest El-SiSi. Trump had high praise for El-SiSi. Why ? Turns out there is a scandal.  Egypt gave Trumps campaign $8M at a moment in Trumps campaign, where they needed cash for a late big push, and Trump didn't have any or wasn't willing to put more in. Sounds like a quid pro quo. Quid pro quo sounds familiar, fast forward to 2019 where Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine for a personal favor to be served.  I think the corrupt see that Trump is super corrupt and possibly detrimental &amp; destabilizing to the country &amp; US foreign policy. They prefer the status quo.","title":"Why?"},{"text":"It seems no one is going along with you.

Hezbollah is expansive and enmeshed into the societal fabric of Lebanon. They offer broad policitical and social services to the people of Lebanon and it's unclear how many aid workers, teachers, doctors, office staff, etc. were injured in these attacks. Many people who support Hezbollah should not be considered lawful combatants.Second, we also don't know who was actually injured in these attacks. Israel initiated hundreds of potentially deadly explosive devices in a community without *any* attempt to ensure that civilians weren't near the blasts. You seem to be assuming that they are all Hezbollah operatives but for all we know, the injuries/deaths are mostly innocent civilians.[In a widely publicized video of the pager attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cevy90jzr9xo), you can see about nine people (and two young children) standing within 5 feet of blast. Three of those passersby were within 2 feet and could have been severely injured. The children and the other 12+ people in the store immediately covered their ears, possibly indicating damage to their ear drums. So in this instance Israel *possibly* injured one member of Hezbollah, but also injured at least a couple innocent civilians. To me, these high civilian casualty ratios are not indicative of an attack that is \\"targeted, small-scale, effective, and with minimal collateral damage.\\"","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Yeah, I think the only takeaway is we cant really predict anything.

The virtue signaling anti-Israel people are saying that Israel is not targeting Hamas but just killing lots of Palestinians, including Hamas.

Israel set up a fake Hungarian company to produce the pagers and the first shipments happened in the summer of 2022. The answer to why Israel didn't do the same to Hamas is that at that time Hamas was not viewed as a threat. The intelligence assessment was that Hamas was trying to maintain the status quo and that their military capability was limited. This is part of why Bibi was making sure that they were able to receive funds from Qatar. Meanwhile Hezbollah is much bigger, more organized, and has weapons that can strike throughout Israel. Israeli intelligence was also busy with Iran.

Just because they used a 'clever' tactic doesn't make it any more against international law nor inflammatory and likely to provoke an escalation in the conflict.Then if you don't set aside the actual potential human cost of this attack also, it's hard to justify on almost any measure other than as a strategy to catalyse a regional conflict.A comparable situation is Russia poisoning political targets in Germany or the UK?

This is a crucial differenceThe repercussions of this means that any electronic device you buy may be used as an assassination device at any time by a foreign government with no repercussions if it deems that it wants you dead. You nay trust israel (many people dont) but it also means russia or china can do the same thing any time they want to. Can a chinese car drive americans into a tree in california and the chinese govt claim those people were plotting terrorism against china?Governments do not usually set new precedents for the good of the citizenry. They find a palatable good reason for the first usage and then once its established as a precedent, they invariably use this new measure for bad reasons. And protection from terrorists is the easiest establishing reason that has ushered in untold surveillance, military funding and law changes that were not the case beforeSo my first point would be, we do not want to set the precedent that foreign governments can use consumer devices to assassinate people who dont agree with themAlso, several children are confirmed killed in the attack. I have seen at least two who were passing pagers to their families and had their heads blown off. And we dont know how watertight the exclusively hezbollah leaders had these pagers was and it wouldnt be surprising if israel eventually says we knew 10% of them were hezbollah but not which 10% so we detonated them all and shifts the goalposts. So it is not definite that only hezbollah members were targetedAnd, this is expressly forbidden in the CCW that are adhered to and signed by the US and israel. The wordage was it is prohibited to use booby traps in the form of apparently harmless portable objects and later says it is prohibited to use [any booby traps] in any [place containing civilians] in which combat between ground forces is not taking place or appears to be imminent. So it is also a war crime on two countsSo for these reasons i dont think the people against these assassinations are just performative. They are step beyond what has happened before (or at least what we know of) and they set a new precedent that could potentially affect any citizen in future. Because everybody has an electronic device they use frequently. Making what was formally a war crime acceptable for the right reasons that can be easily used against their interests of the people is the subject of a great many dystopian stories so it goes without saying that it is not what we should be wantingAirlines would also have a concern if at any time, remote explosive devices can be used without anybodys knowledge and without any way to detect in advanceIt is not the case that the only people concerned about this will just be people who are outraged over what they are told to be","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Misogynistic much....geez.

I belief that most of them are interacting with this issue because it is trendy.I just want to call out this fallacious but unfortunately common argument tactic. It doesn't matter if someone wasn't engaged in an issue previous to whatever arbitrary date you designate. They care about that issue now. Period. That's what matters. A lot of people simply did not know about Issue X before whatever recent incident occurred, or perhaps they weren't previously engaged in activism or advocacy for whatever slew of possible reasons. Some people with actual lives and hardships were far too busy to have mental space for beating the political drums. At some point, for whatever irrelevant reason, that person has now become interested in and engaged in Issue X. That is enough.Rather than baselessly criticizing the longevity of a person's engagement (a criticism which has no meaningfully defensible reason), instead either accept that person's current position or else focus on the flaws in their position itself. It is foolish to focus on a supposedly \\"inadequate\\" path that lead them to that position rather than focusing on the position itself.Now, if someone repeatedly and mercurially flips wildly back and forth between standpoints, then that is different, sure. But, that's a far cry from the complaint that \\"*Person A never seemed to talk about Issue X before Date Y, and somehow I'm unhappy about that!*\\"Edit: I want to add the definition of \\"ad hominem\\": ad hominem(of an argument or reaction) directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"If anyone else had initiated an attack like this, we would have called these \\"pager bombs\\" what they are, IEDs. An IED is an improvised explosive device. There are tons of things you just can't know when you use a device like this. Like, who currently has one of the devices (Which is why two little children were killed in this attack. The pager was taken off somewhere and they heard the beeping sound and immediately ran to check it, because children are curious). You can't know where the person with the device is, which is why many of the attacks happened in groceries and marketplaces. You can't know how deadly the attack is going to be, because its an improvised device. You can't know what the person with the device is doing (They could be getting ready to stop at a busy intersection when the device goes off, for instance). You can't know how close they are to another person who isn't a target. You just can't know a ton when you've set yourself up to push a button and explode a metric ton of IEDs. And that is why it is terrorism rather than a \\"normal\\" military action. Israel generally maximizes civilian casualties in their normal military actions anyways, which can kind of make people appreciate how \\"careful\\" (Or rather, how they at least did the bare minimum due diligence needed to be considered a civilized nation) the American military was when it was occupying so much of the east, so they've set the bar so low that I don't really think most people care.But at the end of the day, what Israel was doing, its a terrorist attack. The purpose of an IED isn't to be an effective killing tool, its to demonstrate to people that \\"anywhere, anytime, anything\\" can be a bomb. And that kind of terror isn't magically confined to members of Hezbollah, many of whom are likely prepared to die anyways, its going to be something experienced acutely from the various civilians who saw the IEDs randomly go off and maim and kill people and may have been maimed because of circumstances anyways.I guess the question is, would you be okay with an operation like this from any government if you knew there was a chance that someone with one of the IEDs could be on a plane with you, or driving next to you, or standing in line with you.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Probably our Hilarious comedians for one","title":"Why?"},{"text":"This is an absurdly reductive platitude.","title":"Bernie Sanders preparing resolutions to block $20B in US arms sales to Israel"},{"text":"Oh so you also dont know anything about out them.

The amendment doesn't really do much, it just clarifies that only citizens can vote in NC. This is already the case in NC (and it even says this in the constitution already...) and this amendment is very obviously a ploy by Republicans to rile up their base.\\nNow of course, the state party didn't take the bait and essentially released their reps and senators to vote how they needed to vote. Swing district Dems voted for the amendment, and partisan district Dems voted against, charging that it was a dumb, xenophobic ploy by Republicans. A position I don't necessarily disagree with.\\nBut last night my county Party's Executive Committee voted to endorse a No vote on the referendum, and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, the intention of the amendment is clear: to rile up the xenophobic R base. But I think we may have taken the bait on this one? Because now Rs can go to swing voters and say \\"well those radical liberals told their radical liberal voters to vote *no* on ensuring only citizens can vote!!\\" Whereas Democrats have to go \\"well actually in context of the Constitution, this amendment wouldn't change anything functionally, it's just a cynical blah blah blah blah.\\"\\nObviously it's a pointless amendment, but I can very well see it getting 55%+ of the vote here.

Hispanics who are voters probably aren't going to be offended by this.

From the range of about 11% to up to about 16% in a lot of midwestern states (OH, IA, PA, MI, WI). For comparison, the highest percent of undecided and/or third party responses polled in any of these states in 2020 would be around 6% (IA) and the lowest was around 4% (PA). So were looking at 2016 having about a solid 2.5 times more people polled who responded either undecided or third party. For additional context, this is why Hillarys loss was a surprise. Forecasters basically evenly divided up the undecided vote between Hillary and Trump, and Hillary was leading in most polls, so she was projected to win. But in reality, people (in the Midwest) who were undecided and/or third party in the polling only voted third party about 40% of the time, with Trump winning about *50%* of the entire group himself. Hillary only got about 10% of the people who were polled as undecided and/or third party (again, looking at Midwestern swing states, since those are what decided the election). All of that to say, your observation was a good one. Its important that not only are we leading in the polls, like Hillary was, but we also need to be *high* in the polls like Biden was. We need the undecided and/or third party polling to be low, to prevent another 2016.","title":"For the first time this election cycle, 538s forecast projects Kamala Harris winning 270 electoral votes"},{"text":"They were supposed to release it this morning but the embargo was lifted.

They are obviously not endowed with free will, but that does not mean that they cannot act in other ways. I refer here to the power of the written word: there are at least two different views on this. One could go back to the myth told by Plato in the Phaedrus, according to which Theuth, the Egyptian god responsible for the invention of writing (which can be considered part of the second paradigm, since it has the function of delegating the mnemonic task), was told by the Pharaoh Thamus that writing would have the effect of reducing memory, since people would no longer exercise it, preferring to rely not on themselves but on external signs. The second, on the other hand, is expressed in the Areopagitica by John Milton, according to whom books are not dead things, but preserve, as in a vial, the efficacy and the purer extraction of the living intellect that produced them (therefore, whoever kills a man kills a rational creature, the image of God; but whoever destroys a good book, kills reason itself, the image of God). In this sense, I am led to believe that it is precisely because of this that ideas can survive their creators, slip out of their hands and merge with others through the work of other authors, shaping the worldview (and motivations) of those who come after them.\\nThere is a beautiful image by Giuseppe Mazzini, according to which humanity is like a man who lives indefinitely and is always learning, because individuals die, but as much of what was true that they thought, as much of what was good that they did, is not lost with them: Humanity collects it and the people who walk over their graves make it their own. In this sense, each one of us is born today into an atmosphere of ideas and beliefs that have been worked out by all of humanity before us, and - in the same way - each one of us carries within himself a more or less important element for the life of humanity to come. Mazzini compares this process to those oriental pyramids to which each traveller adds a stone.\\nThis can be compared, with due differences and only after stripping it of its messianic aspect, to Yuval Noah Harari's notion of an 'imagined constituted order'. In this view, we humans believe in an imagined constituted order (be it the Code of Hammurabi or human rights) not because it is objectively true, but because the belief that it is objectively true enables us to cooperate effectively. Just as the stability of such an order requires the instruments of coercion to secure it, so we need widespread belief in it to maintain it. First, an imagined constituted order is constantly intertwined with material reality: in this sense, it is interesting to note how the modern myth of individualism and privacy has shaped contemporary architecture, especially when we compare the latter with medieval architecture, a period in which a person's worth was determined not so much by his inwardness as by his reputation. Second, the desires of each of us are shaped from birth by the myths that characterise this order.?\\nThird, the imagined constituted order is intersubjective, that is, it is rooted in the shared imagination of thousands or even millions of people: it exists within a network of communication that links the consciousness of many individuals. It follows that if only the individual changes his or her mind, nothing in this order can change, but this intersubjective phenomenon can change or disappear if the majority of individuals in the network change their beliefs: if I want to change the imagined constituted order, I have to convince millions of strangers (or more) to cooperate with me. In this sense, I believe that the English Revolution acted in two different ways: first, through its modernity, it created a paradigm (later updated) of what a modern revolution is; second, because it was the first to make a clean break with the old imagined constituted order (and its head), I think we can believe that it also initiated the process of building the imagined constituted order in which we live today.","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/bvh36vmhjrpd1.jpeg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=389e7ebe55ab7ba19e85626671c49906d48d9cdcIt wouldnt have been TOO out of place in tenochtitlan tbh","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"No, this is some Andrew Tate level rhetoric","title":"CMV: Ghosting is not immature"},{"text":"Believe whatever makes you feel good boss.

First, I did not intend to create a useful model to explain how individual revolutions work, but rather a genealogical model of the history of ideas. Second, I do not think that the starting point is arbitrary. It is true that even the English Revolution had ancestors (not that this falsifies my position: any dynasty is descended not only from its official founder, but also from all the founder's ancestors). If we look back far enough, we may find that the Hussite Wars were also unintentionally triggered by the preaching of the Englishman John Wycliffe, of whom Jan Hus was a great admirer. Some time later, the ideas of Jan Hus inspired Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. Returning to England, we must not forget that it was also the contrast between Catholicism and Protestantism (in this case Calvinism) that led to the English Revolution and the first beheading of a king by the people.?\\nEven more interesting in this context is Wat Tyler's rebellion, which was triggered by the intervention of a royal official. His attempts to collect unpaid per capita taxes led to a violent confrontation that quickly spread throughout the south-east of the country. A broad spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rebelled in protest, burning court records and opening local prisons. But the causes were not only economic: a few decades earlier, a law had been passed preventing peasants and townspeople from receiving an increase in wages, caused by the decline in the labour force following the Black Death of 1348-1349, and from moving away from their places of residence in search of more favourable working conditions.\\nNot to mention the religious aspect: the raging plague (which had occurred 35 years earlier) had, if I remember rightly, led the peasants to believe that the 'second coming of Christ' was imminent (after the suffering of the plague), which would remove all social distinctions and bring greater equality. Religion was known to have an inherent revolutionary potential: the preacher John Ball (who had also adopted some aspects of Wycliffe's theology, if I am not mistaken) insisted on social equality in his sermons at the time, and was drawn and quartered for his revolutionary sermons after the rebellion failed. Although economic in nature, the rebellion soon made political and social demands, including an end to serfdom and the removal of high officials and royal courts. Going back even further, we should remember that the early Christians were also persecuted for political reasons: in a relatively tolerant world like the Roman one, it was the cult of the emperor that held the empire together. The fact that Christians steadfastly refused to do so and paid with their lives was a revolutionary act (after all, our political idea of equality derives from the Christian idea of the equality of all souls before God).\\nIn this article, however, I am referring only to modern revolutions, not only in terms of the chronology of events, but also in terms of the way in which they took place: for example, it would be difficult to imagine any of these revolutions if we excluded the contribution of the press and propaganda (which gradually became more and more important), just as it would be unthinkable for us today to try to make the revolution in a way that is too different from this. It is no coincidence that it was during the English Revolution that one of the most passionate and famous defences of the freedom of the press, the Areopagitica, came to light. It was also the time when the first newspapers appeared and when the modern idea of public opinion, described by sociologists as the product of social interaction and communication, began to take hold: in such a view, there can be no public opinion on an issue unless members of the public communicate with each other (even if their individual beliefs are similar enough, they will not constitute public opinion unless they are communicated to others in some way). The English Civil War increased the demand for news: pamphlets or news books reported on the war, often supporting one side or the other (so there were inevitably also the beginnings of propaganda: just think of the fact that Milton was commissioned to write a work, Eikonoklastes, in which he was to dismantle piece by piece the portrait of Charles Stuart made in the realist propaganda work Eikon Basilike).\\nAnother innovation was the public beheading of the king. The doctrine of the two bodies of the king, according to Kantorowicz, stated that the sovereign had a natural and a political body. This concept was derived from the idea of the mystical body of the Church, which referred to the community of the faithful, and was further developed by Thomas Aquinas, leading to the separation of the 'corpus Ecclesiae mysticum' (the Church) and the 'corpus reipublicae' (the State). In the 13th century, the mystical body of the state guaranteed continuity even after the death of the king, since the king was only part of the political body. The sacredness of kingship was linked to the anointing of the king with holy oil, which transformed him by grace into a Christ-like person. This rite gave the kings miraculous power, but it ceased with the religious and political changes. Michael Walzer, in his essay \\"Regicide and Revolution\\", suggests that the English and French revolutions aimed not only to kill the king's mortal body, but also to destroy his political body. A public regicide is therefore radically different from a conspiratorial regicide (but also from an anarchist attack or the mortal body of a king killed in war). In the post I analyse this question in more detail\\n--","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"The Teamsters aren't fooling anyone. Their leader was at the RNC.
