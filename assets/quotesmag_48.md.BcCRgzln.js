I did ballot curing phone banking to help voters in PA understand how to cast provisional ballots. Some counties in PA mailed out ballots on the Friday before Election Day. Yes, you read that correctly.* Ballots in PA **must be received by 8pm on Election Day**\\n* Many voters (tens of thousands at least) did not have their ballots **mailed to them** (no, not received, **not even mailed**) until Friday, Nov 1. Now, with that said, there's no evidence yet that this altered the outcome of any race. But it is critical to understand why provisional ballots were necessary and why they absolutely must be allowed to be counted.As far as Erie, the data to date shows that Erie shifted less to Trump than most other counties in PA. So far, it shows a 0.5% shift from 2020, far less than many counties - even very blue ones. So while the situation in Erie is a problem, it's not necessarily one that indicates Democrats suffered greater disenfranchisement.That's why it's just such a show of bad faith on McCormick's part to demand Casey concede. Voters of all party affiliation were screwed over by these mishaps. Just count the damn ballots. Concession is not legally binding regardless. The result will be whatever it is when all ballots are done being counted. Just let that process happen. And stop trying to disenfranchise voters, many of who might be members of your own party. The hypocrisy here is what really gets me, as always.  If they actually cared about election integrity, this would be the place to actually show that. But, of course, they do not. They only care about winning. When fraud is a useful narrative to contest a loss, they use it. When actually counting votes might imperil their victory, they do not want it.","title":"Democrats hold out hope in Pennsylvania Senate race as Republicans declare victory"},{"text":"Wait, you believe Trump is an innocent man?

I know for my area, our economy will go back to shit without going back to our energy independence . My fiance works in the oil field industry. Harris lost a lot of my area simply over her original stance on fracking before she attempted to backpedal on it. Before the well drilling started in my area many years ago, a lot of businesses had been closed, buildings empty on the main road through the town of our county seat. It was dying because decent paying jobs were drying up with the coal mines closing and no new businesses coming in. With the rigs popping up and drilling, more companies moved in providing a lot of good jobs. Our rural towns stopped dying.Slow downs have been beginning to show as rigs shut down and new ones weren't being drilled thanks to Biden being in office. My fiance's OT hours the past cpl years have dramatically dropped from the previous years. People like to say we drilled more under Biden, but they don't understand why. With Trump in office, companies were investing in drilling more rigs. It takes time for them to begin producing though. So of course we were drilling and producing more by the time he took office than when Trump did. When Biden took office, those investments stopped due to unknown fear of any ability to be profitable. We're going to continue to see a drop in production with that decrease in new wells. However, that will change slowly as more companies are no longer afraid of losing money by drilling new rigs. We probably won't see the fruits of our votes until towards the end of his administration, but at least for my family we have hope again.If any liberal tries to argue with you about drilling more under Biden, that is how you shut them down about it. Under Trump, investments to drill new rigs went up and it takes time to actually be running and producing, which brought us into Biden's term. However uncertainty under Biden greatly reduced the amount of new sites, which is going to ultimately decrease our production going into Trump's term. Don't let them gaslight blaming Trump for the reduction and giving undue credit to Biden for the initial increase.","title":"What do you think is the biggest reasons that the Democrats lost the election?"},{"text":"Ya i was kinda bummed to see how low Jill Stein got.

Trump won Bucks County, the largest swing county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and filled with wealthy suburbanites, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to win the county in over 35 years. This was also true for the Amish community in Lancaster County. He also won rural Anson County, North Carolina, which is approximately 48% black. This was the second time a Republican won the county since Reconstruction (1876). In addition, Trump won 55% of Latino voters in the state of Texas (14 of the 18 counties along the Mexican border), including Starr County with about 57.7% of the vote after voting Democratic in past presidential elections for 132 years straight. Almost 50 percent of Muslim American voters in Dearborn, Michigan cast their votes for Trump.

It suggests that her alignment with President Biden's positions alienated significant voter segments, particularly young people and first-time voters, potentially leading to a lower turnout and her loss to Donald Trump. The piece highlights inconsistencies in Harris's messaging towards different demographics and emphasizes the implications of her campaign's failure to adequately address Palestinian rights.   **Key Points:**  * Kamala Harris's alignment with Biden on Gaza likely alienated voters, especially young people.  \\n* Harris received 68 million votes compared to Trump's 72 million, contrasting with Biden's 81 million in 2020.  \\n* Voter turnout among young people was low, with significant drops in support for Harris in areas with large Arab American populations.  \\n* Inconsistent messaging in campaign ads targeted different demographics, causing confusion and dissatisfaction.\\nThe failure to address Gaza effectively is seen as a critical mistake that may have contributed to a lack of voter enthusiasm and turnout.","title":"Not changing course on Gaza was a colossal mistake by Kamala Harris"},{"text":"well, i'm sure it wouldn't have hurt.","title":"She ran a flawless campaign.

The gap between these two contains a much stronger signal of the class-partisan cleavage than that revealed by the covariates of vote change, which is the standard approach. The reason is that 2,557 or 83% of all counties are either deep red of deep blue....Basically, the characteristics of McCain-Harris counties are much more certain to reflect the sorts of people who really bought the Democrat line of Trump being a threat to American democracy.

Usually they are utilized as side puffery statements that flank bigger issues that are more central and actually achievable.OP seemed to indicate this concept would be a central platform that would be successful, but a central platform usually has to have at least a possibility of being successful on a level in some wayEdit to add: Trump spoke greatly about energy independence as a central platform. This topic has been central in the news for a long time and resonated with voters, and also logically impacts costs of goods and household finances, so its not exactly true to say he gave his base nothing. You may not agree with his plans or want to see this change, but he did frequently talk about this.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"Having one hardware manufacturer is the weak pointYou need 2-3 independent manufacturers that ballots are scanned by, same for any tabulation processes/hardware","title":"We need to ensure that the results of every election are verifiable by the public instead of trusting the tallies of private, corporate electronic voting machines."},{"text":"Maybe, but it's not as slim as to give up your senate seat lol","title":"Democrats hold out hope in Pennsylvania Senate race as Republicans declare victory"},{"text":"Im not making judgement one way or the other simply saying if you ignore the largest voting block's problems by focusing loudly on minorities then dont be surprised when they turn against you.

Here is why:*  Some of those people may vote republican, but also be in favor of same-sex marriage.  People vote certain ways for all different reasons.  Someone might honestly believe that republicans will be better on foreign policy, economy, or something else, and struggle with the decision because they don't support some of the republican party platform. \\n* Same-sex marriage is currently legal, and has been for nearly 10 years now.  Some people may simply not think that right is at risk of being taken away, and therefore prioritize other issues with their vote.\\n* Some of the people voting republican could be very low information voters.  Especially those who are younger and disengaged - they may just vote a certain way because of their parents or community pressure.  This is especially true if you live in a very right-leaning community. \\n* On a more technical level, there may be some republican candidates who ran unopposed, or who personally are in favor of same-sex marriage remaining legal. If someone voted for some democrats, but some republicans because of these issues, would they also be excluded? Honestly I think your approach with this seems a bit politically charged for a wedding invitation.  If you have relatives that have openly stated in the past that they don't support same-sex marriage, I would just not invite them.  If asked, just say that their prior statements on the issue meant that you thought they would not want to attend for moral reasons.  But putting something on the invitation will be a very divisive move, and even those who support your marriage will probably view it somewhat negatively.  Its not worth the drama that would ensue. Also many people who do not support same-sex marriage probably would not attend.  And for those that do attend, well if they ever bring it up in the future you can call them out for being hypocritical.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"Does it really though?

Only a handful of them seem to genuinely care about their constituencies and/or possess the awareness and capacity to speak effectively to the relevant issues.  Further, all these races and fundraising efforts should be meticulously coordinated at the national level. It should feel like you are supporting a team, not just the occasional diamond in the rough who shares our values. FFS I ran a Discord server more coordinated than the DNC.  They could have taken a small risk on Bernie and embraced the youth. Now they have likely lost that entire generation of voters, assuming the Democratic party continues to exist. Say what you will about Trump, but he's told us who he was from the beginning. The United States voters either chose him on purpose or didn't feel there was a better option and abstained.  I voted for Biden reluctantly. Not with enthusiasm, not excitement. Just dread that the alternative would be worse, and you know - very few democrats gave me any reason to feel otherwise.  The party of \\"substance\\" chose fear-mongering as their only real strategy. They tried to fight a flamethrower with a sparkler and got burned down to ash nationwide. Would Bernie have won in 2020? I don't know. But he would have evolved the political landscape and potentially changed how younger people view their engagement in the electoral process. The conversation would center around new ideas VS angry ideas instead of the same old tired and scared mediocrity VS angrier  mediocrity.  The party of \\"cooperation\\" can't cooperate or build an effective coalition - yet somehow they managed to stick together for the last three months before total disaster struck. Weird how they can magically get along when it's their asses on the line.  The Republicans treat us like morons to be grifted and - surprise! So do the Democrats. One of the parties was going to get wrecked in this election. I'm surprised at which one it was, but regardless the core issue remains: there's currently no party in the US that can effectively and legitimately address the needs of its constituencies.

They take things Trump says out of context and call him hitler, but act like Kamalas shit didnt stink when she couldnt do simple interviews. Also they ran the whole weird ads thing, but JD and Trump going on podcasts really humanized them and made then relatable. Also the polls being completely skewed left and then being completely wrong hasnt helped their case. People just dont want to be fed the lies anymore.Party Itself- People are sick of identity politics and the amount of gaslighting. Kamala lost because were all sexist and racist dont you know? Also the Democrat elites are terrible people and completely out of touch with working class Americans. Pelosi insider trading, etc. Also them trying to lecture people about how to vote even though they installed a candidate that was picked by them, not voted in. Kamala Herself - Not doing interviews and claiming Trump was tired when he was doing laps around her. Sometimes Trump was doing 3 events a day. Not doing interviews, the word salad answers when she did do interviews, not having ideas of her own or things she would change. No clear definition of policy. Literally ran on not orange man and that was it.\\nThe Democratic party in my opinion is completely shattered and they need to take a look at themselves.

DNC is forcing their unpopular candidates in the primaries. Hillary, Biden, Kamala were all \\"anointed\\" by party elders in inorganic fashion. THIS IS THE GREATEST DEATH KNELL BY FAR.\\n2. There needs to be a nominee who actually understands the base (Trump understands his). This can be done from grass-roots, dark horse, organic candidates emerging. NOT the \\"elders\\" or profoundly stupid crap like \\"**electability**.\\" Anyone who whispers the word electability (as if they know who would win) should be shot. The person who wins the primary fairly is most electable, period (yes I know partisans vote in the primary).\\n3. DNC is too corporatist, see above. Healthcare and immigration have remained broken for decades.\\n4. DNC messaging is God awful. **Woke is now confirmed dead.** 10% of America is woke is the others are tired of humoring them. If you're not sure what I mean, do your own research. Latinx and 'hey colonizer' are examples.

It's really that simple.Free trade works like a magic wand, it turns what you make best into what you want.The *idea* is to encourage domestic manufacturing, but that leads to inefficiencies. It also takes a decade or more to actually spin up a full production line and logistics. Trumps tariffs, if implemented, will hurt in the short term. Whether they produce long term benefits, well, if I could predict the future I wouldn't be on reddit, I'd be at the horse track.The fact is other nations can make *certain* products better than we can. Whether that's because they have expertise in that field, specialized equipment, or better access to the resources needed to make it.Sometimes it's also because our resources are better spent on other things. For example in America we *could* spend money building climate controlled greenhouses to grow tropical fruits. Or we could just grow what our actual climate allows, and trade with tropical nations.Let's take 2 nations Amestris and Zeon.With their own domestic resources Amestris can make 1 ton of electronics at a cost of $10,000. And 1 ton of machinery at $20,000 because they have the knowledge to make electronics, but lack the raw materials for machinery.Zeon is a developing nation so making electronics is harder, but has easy access to raw materials for manufacturing. They can make electronics at $20,000 per ton, and machinery at $10,000 per ton.Now if both nations want to make 1 ton of Food and 1 on of machinery, it costs them $30,000. *OR* they can both engage in free trade. Zeon produces machinery, Amestris produces electronics, and for the same $30,000 they now get 1.5 tons of each. A higher yield, everybody wins. Because capitalism, like a tide, lifts all boats.Some things you *NEED* to produce domestically. Food and weapons being the 2 biggest. But even then free trade is still better. Because free trade allows you to sell your Barley, which needs large fields, for someone else's Bananas which you can't grow because you have a poor climate for it. And now everyone wins because consumers have more choice.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"His legacy of re-invigorating racial division in America?","title":"Obama Is Nervous About His Legacy After Trump Victory, Biographer Says"},{"text":"My guess:![gif](giphy|eJLvKAHS1PtDSiyRCY)","title":"What do you think is the biggest reasons that the Democrats lost the election?"},{"text":"Election authorities are already doing random precincts for that purpose.","title":"Kamala Harris fundraising going towards \\"recount\\""},{"text":"I'm not sure what metrics are being used to determine a \\"good economy\\"Wages, unemployment, household net worthAnd I can't help but feel that telling people who are struggling \\"well actually, it's the economy is really good right now, so it's just all in your head\\"This is not what anyone is saying.

Does anyone even remember his 2020 campaign? There were barely any people in his rallies. If you take 2020 as legitimate, then Trump would have more votes than what Obama received in 2008 and 2012. In fact, Trump has the most popular votes for a two-term President if you combine his 2016 and 2024. And its higher if its 2020 and 2024 as his 2020 count is the 3rd highest of all-time only surpassed by this year.Its hard to believe Kamala even got 71M votes. Less political credentials than Hillary but 71M is the fourth highest of all-time only behind Bidens 2020, and Trumps 2024 and 2020. Ofc, our population is higher than it was from 2008-2016. More illegals have also come in. Id laugh if those illegals the Democrats relied voting for them ended up voting for Trump this year.

Of that 0.5%, the majority is just living their lives not bothering anyone or participating in anything you listed. People can use identity and cultural protective measures as much as they want, and in some cases they might really earnestly believe that, but it is way too easy to abuse that to just cover up \\"anything that makes me feel uncomfortable\\" which is just bigotry.","title":"Trans Moralism Is Killing the Democrats"},{"text":"Can you show me where you're getting that data?

Calling everyone who voted for Trump racist/sexist/stupid. General despair.Putting this caveat in makes it *really* difficult to change your view.  Because your view relies upon a logical electorate that values truth.As others have pointed out, and you've agreed, it is easy for a politician to *say* they're going to raise wages, but it is incredibly difficult to actually do that within the constraints of our laws and economic system.For Trump, things like this aren't a problem.  Because Trump can tell his followers that he's going to do something (like make Mexico pay for the wall), not do that thing (only a few miles of the wall were even built, and Mexico didn't pay for it), but then tell his followers that he did it, and they believe it happened.  If that's not his followers being stupid, I'm not sure what it is.But if your supports aren't stupid, that methodology doesn't work.  Like if Kamala had said that she was going to raise the minimum wage, left the federal minimum wage at $7.25/hr, and then 4 years from now bragged about how she had raised the minimum wage, she's not going to gain support.  She's going to lose support because the people supporting her are going to tell her she's lying and didn't do anything.  Because the people who support her aren't members of a cult.  They are rational, thoughtful, intelligent human beings.So, yeah, your plan is fine.  Whatever.  It won't actually make any difference because making promises to intelligent voters who know it is impossible for you to keep those promises causes those intelligent voters to avoid voting for you (possibly by not voting at all).  So even if this strategy *would* pick up some of the idiot voters who might believe her lies, it would lose the voters that are already supporting her.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"Explain","title":"How bad would it be for DNC if Jill Stein joined Trump/RFK to act as a voice for Palestine &amp; Human Rights from INSIDE their administration?!"},{"text":"I like to tell them that this was probably the most secure election ever.","title":"What is everyone thinking now that democrats are calling for a recount, and election fraud?"},{"text":"Respectfully, if the policy plan can't fit on a bumpersticker, it will not resonate.That being said, the basic policies being laid out were 'preserve the status quo and maybe make these little bits of it better for more Americans' in a time when the status quo is simply not working well for the vast majority of the country.","title":"How did Democrats -- the party of FDR, Social Security, Medicare and labor unions -- become a party of high-income voters?

AND NOW HE HAS DONE THAT!! and unlike the imaginary billions of migrants coming to eat your pets or the kids being given surgeries in school IT WAS A VERY REAL AND VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM...which the Democratic leadership harped on constantly. THEY RAN ON IT IN 2020 and we elected Joe Biden to deal with it in 2020, and that was BEFORE J6, BEFORE the stolen documents, BEFORE the one thousand other things that have been nonstop reported all day every day for four years now.I do not blame Harris but the Biden administration sat back and allowed an extremely dangerous seditious movement to grow like a cancer in our society and they put some LITTLE folks in prison sure. But did they arrest ANYONE with money and power and influence?? No.And acting like oh well the courts just can't take care of it was like THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE THE MILITARY COURTS FOR. Exactly what.

It's that WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN LEFT TO FIGHT BILLIONAIRE AUTHORITARIANS AND RUSSIAN PSYOPS alone.

And he verifiably earned more minority votes in this election than the last while getting similar totals in both elections. Clearly a candidate with more support from every demographic in the country who  received nearly identical total votes in both elections is guilty of cheating. Yeah, its TRUMP who cheated this time.  Leftist logic escapes me.  A better question?  Why did a female minority leftist presidential candidate who actually appeared in public get fewer votes than her old white male predecessor who campaigned from his basement! She was obviously more qualified than Joe. Afterall, she had a To-Do list for her first day and everything.  There are two possibilities: The leftists that are on video counting boxes of ballots after removing election observers were cheating and bragged about the success of their schemes to rid themselves of bad orange man in Time magazine.  These same leftists did cheat in 2020 OR it's actually the leftists who are the racists. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. They can both be proven true. Come to think of it, Biden got more votes than Obama too, didn't he?  The available evidence clearly indicates that the leftists that cheated in 2020 are the real racists.I'm not a Biden crime family fan, but it makes me smile when I consider how much pleasure comes to old Joe (a failing old white guy who fought the civil rights movement with everything he had and openly PROVED his racist inclinations by declaring that he would select the best BLACK female candidate for the supreme court) when he remembers that the leftists he hates most in life both got fewer votes than he did. The pain Biden endures at the memory of the undemocratic back-stabbing political manuveres that forced him out this year's election must be soothed with the knowledge that he will forever be remembered as more popular than both of his bitter enemies. His fond recollection that those enemies can never correct that historical \\"fact\\" - his knowing that those hated rivals can never utter a word in their defense without admitting to falsifying vote totals in 2020 must be satisfying. At least he has the knowledge that he will forever be considered more popular to comfort him in his final days.  Good for that theiving evil old racist white pediphile!

After all government does have power to 'bring back jobs' by 'protecting our own manufacturing and extending tarrifs'. Yes, realistically it is a bad idea, but reason why it is a bad idea aren't sexy and are easy to be dismissed.IDK why you are ignoring that point when it is the main issue with America deserves a raise campaign. You leave yourself open to questions of 'How would you give US a raise' and 'Who will pay for it' that don't have good answers. Raising minimum wage can be easily reflected by stories of small businesses who are struggling with payroll and question of payment opens you to being labeled as government that wants to raise taxes.In reality with large parts of voters at the same time fearing gov't overreach and suffering from bad economy, promise of better pay is not going to win you elections if you don't have a sound plan. And any sound plan would be scary for a large part of population.Only way to break that cycle would be to not aim at the economic issues from the side of pay, but from the side of labor protections. After all while 'government giving you money' is sus, government enacting labor protections that already work somewhere else is a different story. That is why Bernie were projected to demolish Trump if he ran against him back in 2016.But that would mean the easy way to get campaign money would be gone as current Dem backers would not finance campaign like that.

They already campaigned on this stuff. Here's the first three chapters of the [Democratic Party](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024_Democratic_Party_Platform_8a2cf8.pdf) platform.**Chapter One: Growing Our Economy from the Bottom Up &amp; Middle Out 8**Economic Progress 8Investing In America 9Good Jobs 10Small Businesses 12Agriculture 13Fighting Poverty 14Ending Special Interest Giveaways 15**Chapter Two: Rewarding Work, Not Wealth 16**Cutting Taxes For Working Families 17Making The Wealthy &amp; Big Corporations Pay Their Fair Share 17**Chapter Three: Lowering Costs 19**Health Care &amp; Prescription Drugs 19Child Care, Home Care, &amp; Paid Leave 22Gas &amp; Groceries 24Corporate Greed 24Housing 25Education 28Social Security, Pensions, &amp; Medicare---Bernie Sanders has been campaigning on similar issues and he's never come close to winning the nomination. People can believe what they want about the DNC not wanting him around, but the reality is that he wins too few states by too small a margin, while getting annihilated south of the Mason Dixon line. It hasn't been a winning issue then, there's little reason to believe that's what's going to push voters over the finish line in 2026/28. Second. A lot can happen in a couple years. Especially with Trump in the Whitehouse. Democrats managed to flip the House despite steady economic growth and a tax cut. Two years later, they had control over everything. The party's economic messaging never changed. It was the electorate souring on the party and president - fair or not. It's entirely possible we'll see a similar crisis, flip at least the House back to Blue in a couple years.  And third. There's the candidate. Harris ended up quitting the 2020 Primaries before they even got started. And ended up losing states in this election despite those same states electing Democrat Senators (AZ) and Governors (NC). That's reason enough to believe that there's a candidate problem - not a policy one. Barack Obama didn't win 2 elections on policy, he won it because he was following the Bush Administration and just happened to be the most charming guy to run for office since Regan. The Party needs a new face. There's plenty of roads to victory for Dems in the future. No reason to hitch the wagon to a proven loser this early in the game.Edit: formatting","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"Wages are one factor in fixed costs, but not the entirety.  Prices might go up, but not 1:1 with the increased wage. (Or the CEOs/shareholders could accept smaller profits, but let's not be too unreasonable.

Only currently big corporations are raking in massive profits on the backs of taxpayers. And when more people have money for nonessentials, demand also rises.  That labor cost can be offset by more people being able to buy more stuff.

Or are you suggesting mandatory redistribution of profits, changing us from capitalism? So either you are suggesting someone run on fundamental change to our mostly capitalist economy, or running on just giving people the idea the government can do more then they actually can. Harris ran this election in big part on reproductive rights, while also being caught in interviews saying she had no plan B to do anything if democrats didnt have a majority on congress to be able to pass anything (and it was heavily suspected there wouldnt be a democratic majority even if she had won).. so that was a lot like running on an impression of doing something that wont actually be seen through.

I'll explain what I mean.1: A minimum wage on a federal level is a bad idea. Because each state has a vastly different cost of living. For example if I am looking to buy a house in West Virginia it's going to be around $150,000. If I am looking for a similar house in California it will be in the $750,000 price range.If we set the Federal Minimum wage to \\"What best fits California\\" then West Virginia is going to have everyone losing their jobs, and becoming homeless.If we set the Federal Minimum wage to \\"What best fits West Virginia\\" Then people in California are going to be getting underpaid and struggling more. They would be able to find work, but it would not be good paying jobs.Because of this States, or even just counties should be the level of government that is setting their own minimum wage levels.2: Your plan doesn't call for any form of \\"Energy Independence\\". This is very key for a healthy economy. Everything is shipped, and reducing shipping costs is always beneficial for the economy. To improve the economy you may have to make some environmental concessions. Being less environmentally friendly goes against the Democrat ticket. Democrats often oppose any sort of new pipeline or fracking for instance. So catering to environmentalism will always make the economy suffer. So, this will cause in fighting in the Democrats.3: Illegal Immigration is a major concern for many American voters. Democrats have the perception of being limp wristed and ineffective on border policy. The massive influx of illegals also takes jobs away from Americans. Not only that, but they also must compete over other resources like food, and shelter.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"Get off the cross, we need the wood.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"A union memba?

And problems continued long after 1946, after all in1968 the current communist government of Poland did raise an antisemitic campaign that was quite successful. It is worth noting that the reason for those was the same as any other problems with xenophobia - people were suffering and bought a lie about \\"them\\" being responsible. Those who are labeled as \\"them\\" change from time to time, because they are just an useful scapegoat to push for some agenda - whether it would be raising power of magnates, consolidating power via false unity or any different agenda/aim.That is why Eastern Europe does not have the \\"right\\" to be xenophobic and in reality no one has \\"right\\" to - because this is only a lie fed by oppressors to get power and exert control.

Economic plans that are simple and make sense to normal people. Most people know if you raise minimum wage, it raises inflation specifically on those who purchase minimum wage created products, because business raise prices to account for it.  You get paid more, things cost more. It's basic common sense most people understand. This is food to name the most important one. You cannot raise minimum wage, you have to find ways to lower prices, create competition between corporations, and stop the monopolies that exist in basically every single sector of private industry now.  Incentivize being a business owner, small business owner, etc. Raising minimum wage is a naive and childlike idea.2. Wars overseas need to stop or we stop being involved. The normal citizen doesn't want to see a shitshow after a hurricane from the feds sending a pittance of bullshit to families, while sending a bazillion dollars to ukraine and israel.3. They need a plan to stop illegal immigration, without trying to poison pill the bill to allow amnesty to millions and millions of people.  Everyone normal knows why they want to give amnesty to millions.  (This should be an easy get for Dems at this point knowing that hispanics are leaning more Republican on this topic, they will switch their stance sooner or later anyway... easy get).4.

This is similar to what they have done for a while now, and it is a mistake.The problem right now is inflation, and if there were a way to mandate that everyone in the USA got a big raise, well payroll doesnt come out of thin air or unicorn magic. It is a cost like any other, and has to be covered like any other.So if wages were mandated to be raised across the board in a significant manner, hiring in the USA stops and prices rise as employers compensate for higher costs. So inflation, people make more, but the higher wages buy less.And given inflation under Biden, and the tone deaf attitude his administration had in it, I believe this was a reason Harris was beaten soundly by Trump. The truth was that prices were lower under Trump, and people had an easier time of paying the bills.So the winning message is to raise the minimum wage to help those who need it most, because few actually make minimum wage by percentage, but to really push for a lower cost of living.Democrats would do well to change their tactic from what it has been and focus on making life more affordable without policies that can and would be called inflationary.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"And now Im seeing conservatives saying Alito and Thomas need to step down during trumps presidency because they are too old and those spots can be filled by younger people.

Due to distribution of seats between safe-red, safe-blue and swing states, 60 seats in the senate is a fantasy for the Democrats in this environment. Republicans also routinely refuse to cross the isle even if programs proposed, like IRA, benefit their states. And despite a narrow majority all throughout Biden's term, Sinema and Manchin made sure that the filibuster remains in place. I'm more lenient towards Manchin, Blue dog Democrat and all, but Sinema has proven to be nothing but a grifter.I wonder if that played a part in alienating the progressive vote. Both Sinema and Fetterman saw a lot of love from progressives during the election, but after assuming office they took a hard-right turn that made people who canvassed and donated to them feel cheated.I'll say it: Biden is the best president America has had in a while. Despite the gridlock he's been able to advance the most progressive agenda by helping out unions, signing off on big infrastructure projects, fighting tooth and nail for student debt cancellation, capping insulin at $35 for diabetic Medicare beneficiaries, not to mention giving Lina Khan the role of the FTC chair C and she's ruffled a lot of feathers in the business class as the trade commissioner.If you look for reasons why Democrats lost, look no further than [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_Voting_Rights_Act#).

What about education, should all their kids be trapped in their home country forever? What about people who already have mixed ethnicity families? Are some of them forced to leave? Are they forced to prevent their children from marrying the undesirable ethnicity? Not to mention that racism has well documented effects on individuals, societies, and governance. The country that forces homogeneity poisons itself, and then quickly exports that poison. Soon it is t enough that their cities and towns are pure, they start worrying about corruption from their neighbors. They also start drawing lines within themselves. western Fervorats vs Eastern Fervorats.On top of that, no Eastern European places have clear ethnic borders. The Soviet Union intentionally distributed ethnic groups. The EU and Schengen have facilitated mixing for more than half a century.In the end, encouraging homogeneity doesnt make sense, and hurts a lot of people.

Nowadays, everyone will probably agree that everyone decides about their own life.I think it's worth being honest with yourself and considering a few aspects before forming an opinion because there are few things in life that are completely devoid of consequences and it's the same in this case.1. It's not related, but you're misleading, pornography causes behavioral addiction, it's a scientifically proven fact and it definitely affects the brain - you can refer to research, they are available on the internet, but following simple logic it's easy to conclude that by watching porn you stimulate the same centers in the brain that are active during sexual intercourse, hormones are released that change the structure of the brain. 2. You should take into account that research indicates that among women, with the increase in the number of sexual partners, the probability of establishing a stable and positively functioning relationship decreases. This is related to evolutionary reproductive strategies and psychological research also indicates \\"attachment theory\\" as the main cause, the perpetuation of shallow and short-term relationships as behavioral patterns, multiple partners cause increased expectations and criticism and a looser approach to loyalty causes tensions in relationships.3. If you are thinking about a serious relationship at some point in your life, you must also take into account that it is almost certain that your potential future partner will evaluate promiscuity in a critical way.\\nI have often heard women indicate that they perceive it very negatively, I have heard accusations of bigotry, inseciurities or weakness.\\nI understand that they may not like it and you may not agree with it, but the lack of acceptance will not change anything. \\nI wouldn't even encourage to reconsider their readiness for a relationship if they consider blaming a man in this situation to be justified \\nMen have their preferences, some of them are conscious and some are rooted in evolutionary reproductive strategy. \\nMost men will choose a woman who has had fewer sexual partners, because this increases the guarantee of a long-term and stable relationship. 4. The reproductive cycle for women is limited in time by the number of eggs, if you plan to have children it is safest to do it before the age of 30. Leading a promiscuous lifestyle it is easy to exceed this period, short and quick relationships, one after another give the false impression that maybe the next one will be better 5. Sexually transmitted diseases 6. Contraception by pill. It is highly likely that you will use this form of contraception. The pill itself has no negative side effects. However, you obtain protection against pregnancy by simulating the secretion of appropriate hormones. I have heard a few times that after stopping the pill, they lost interest in their partner because it turned out that the traits desired by women had changed. As I mentioned, it is hard to say that promiscuity is bad.  Perhaps some religious circles will think so. Most people will leave it to your subjective judgment.That doesn't mean, however, that such a lifestyle has no consequences. If you are an adult and are able to face them, there should be no problem.Good luck","title":"CMV: Promiscuity is not inherently bad.

Neither demonizing nor glorifying promiscuity or chastity will help people genuinely value one or the other more, because both are based on individual preferences rather than any universal mores. Both glorification and demonization of peoples' sexual identity lead to repression of their particular interests and desires, which is the true cause behind the existence of the issues you talk about.I couldn't rationally change your view to be the opposite of what you're expressing because your perspective is acceptable for anyone to have, though the directly conflicting opinion you argue against (chastity solves these problems, promiscuity exacerbates them) is equally so. But this acceptance is born from that principle of tolerance which acknowledges the needs for individuals to realize the identity of their personal self-interest, not because either of those viewpoints are borne from reason. Alternatively, a reasonable ground to stand on says that moral imperatives do not touch these sexual preferences at all, and that they both come from the same place as kinks. A culture that acts as if it does or could have an objective ethical standard for any sexual preferences is toxic, because its members have progressed to the point where it's delivering ultimatums, and as per the usual for that kind of behavior, it's doing so at the expense of the individuals who are party to that dynamic.","title":"CMV: Promiscuity is not inherently bad.

(Hell, even with law enforcement, people are careless lol) Not saying we should put laws in place for this, i'm saying that this is reality, and we should judge the situation based on that.Don't get me wrong, it's always good to try to educate people, but it's a pipe dream to think we'll fix the problem with it. Humans will human. On the wedlock point, the same can be said about keeping abusive families together, and it's a weighed cost of that against the lessened risk of a single parent upbringing.I agree.

I cannot stomach the thought of enabling their hypocrisy, specifically their ability to perform acts that harm us one day, then show up to congratulate us and share in our joy the best day.Normally, i'd agree. But over the last few days, i've had conversations with people about the elections and it changed my mind on it forever.You make a good point, it seems hypocritical to vote for republicans and simultaneously attend a same sex marriage, if you take these stances in a vacuum. But, when you're voting, you're voting for so much more than just whether you think same sex marriage is ok or not. For many people, this probably doesn't even play a part in their decision.The issue with the US voting system is that you've only got *two* parties to vote for, that doesn't allow much leeway for nuances in your views to surface. When you're having a conversation with someone, and they tell you they vote democrat, people tend to automatically assume that they agree with every single democratic stance. This is often not the case. When you're voting, you're not voting just for Kamala or Trump, you're voting for the entire prebuilt coalition of parties that fall into the republican party or democratic party. It's a conglomeration of soooo many different views, opinions and ideals, that you can't, and shouldn't automatically assume that one holds a particular stance when they tell you they vote one way or the other. You can't conclude that untill you speak to them personally, because when you vote republican, you're not just voting for same sex marriage rights, you're also voting for economic policies, immigration policies, etc etc. It's a hard sell to tell someone to just give up on their vision of what will benefit the country and vote the diametrically opposite way because of a couple stances they don't even necessarily agree with.Here in the Netherlands, we have a different system that imo, works much better, although it still has it's issues. We have many parties, each with their own policies, representation and such, that all run for office. The coalition doesn't get formed untill after the vote results for this pool of parties come in. Allowing for much more nuanced views. Let's say for example that we've got two parties, they both have the same economic policies but one supports same sex marriage and the other doesn't. We can just vote for the party that supports same sex marriage and have the best of both worlds. In your system, that's not an option. You'd have to sacrifice your views on economics and so many other policies in order to appease this one stance (same sex marriage) so you become stuck between a rock and a hard place.So i'd say, have a word with these people individually if you can, as it's not at all ensured that they hold the beliefs you think they do.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"Theyll just run it like a MAGA version of taliban, where men pretend to follow their archaic superstitions but behind the curtain theyre breaking every religious edict.

If they understand how their political actions directly impact you, would that be more meaningful than simply asking them not to attend?On the other hand, could you argue that your wedding is a deeply personal event and that you have every right to decide who shares in your joy? If their actions directly threaten your right to marry and, by extension, your happiness, might it feel morally inconsistent or even painful to have them present? Does your desire for a peaceful day and the chance to celebrate your union outweigh the potential for family conflict?Would it also be worth considering that this moment, as significant as it is, might be part of a larger ongoing struggle for equality and recognition? Could it be possible that by standing firm, you set a precedent for others in your family to reconsider their stance in the future?Lastly, in light of your fiancs concerns about family fallout, could it be possible to find a middle ground?

Democrats won Senate seats in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, even as those states went for Trump. There may well be ways to improve the messaging for 2026 and 2028, but all is not lost.

They have historically been the spearheads that made cars get progressively worse, over time. CARB has historically been way more aggressive on regulations than the EPA, and that has always given the EPA an excuse to enact regulations over all 50 states, often citing Well, theyre already doing it in CaliforniaThis has made cars progressively worse. The reality is that not everyone wants an EV and EVs are not necessarily the best fit for everyone. And the tailpipe emissions standards have added extra complexity onto cars that has ended up making them less reliable. Issues like turbos overpressurizing and blowing blocks or wrecked main bearings at 10k miles or blown head gaskets at 10k miles..that just didnt happen when you could get a reasonably priced naturally aspirated V6 that had reasonable power and fuel economy and was easy to service and reliable.Or being overzealous with the types of refrigerants allowed, to force everyone to buy brand new air conditioners that cost $10k more than their predecessors because the new Freon is flammable and requires extra safety systems.Like I said, California can do California all day.

Thats an entirely meaningless phrase and most Americans (stupid as we are!) know better.The real culprits go hand in hand. Like the game _Monopoly_, unchecked capitalism gives such an advantage to the rich that eventually a very few people own _everything_. They can buy politicians and rewrite the rules to their own advantage.

This pattern becomes the new normal for the individual. If the individual later desires to find a more permanent partner, the brain mapping will have to be overcome, making a permanent bond more difficult to achieve.

I can see literally no downside that isnt already present(ie creeps and SA committing scum) why is it that promiscuity is viewed and put onto a pedestal of taboo where the opposite, the celebration of it would likely not lead to any negatives that arent already extremely common. Am I missing something? Genuinely I dont think limiting it or policing it will help anyone at all. Do tell if you have another opinion I would love to hear what your stance on it is, agree or disagree! Thanks for reading!Well, one could argue that promiscuity contributes to the epidemic of single parent households. An outcome that through research, shows that it's bad for the child. People are having more kids out of wedlock than ever before. And while i'm not religious myself and i don't like the strictness of waiting untill marriage to have kids, i can't stress enough that they *do* have a point, when it comes to the wellbeing of children, and family dynamics in general. Promiscuity directly takes away from these dynamics.**Before these arguments are made, i'll tackle them here:**Yes, marriage doesn't ensure that the parents stay together, but statistically speaking, it's a much more reliable system than just going out having sex with whoever, whenever, getting pregnant and (assuming one is against abortion) having a kid, that the father doesn't want anything to do with, and the mom being unprepared to take care of it.Yes, not everyone is against abortion, far from it, but as it stands, a LOT of people are, and there is enough evidence that kids *are* born in these detrimental situations as described above to call it a legitimate issue.Yes, contraception is a thing, but as it stands, there is overwhelming evidence that kids are being born into these detrimental situations as described above so either it's not failsafe, or (much more likely imo) people are just promiscuous in a suboptimal and careless manner, which is to be expected of people at all times.","title":"CMV: Promiscuity is not inherently bad.

Because it is a paradox, and I'll explain why it's a paradox.Generally speaking there are 2 outcomes for someone having an ex. That being a \\"Negative\\" or \\"Positive\\" outcome.So, say you are dating someone and they have just two exes. One negative, and one positive.The positive ex was basically prince charming. He was handsome, and great in bed, and spent a lot of money taking her out, he was tall, and drove a badass car, and he cared about her feelings and he was generally an awesome guy.Now you are going to be stuck with a woman who still has feelings for this guy. Okay, well what about the other ex?The negative ex... Oh that guy was a total dick. He was a rapist and abuser. A drunken fool that didn't give a fuck about her. And he has caused her trauma. Maybe he is even still stalking her. What does that say about her ability to pick a good man? What will she say about you after you two break up.Now you are stuck with this psycho ex that may slash your tires because you are dating his ex.Neither one of these exes is a gain for you, and can only possibly be a loss for you.And most exes aren't a total negative or total positive in general. They are usually a mix of good and bad things.So these exes are all just \\"Baggage\\". Every ex is baggage.Now I want you to imagine she goes back to one of them because she has feelings for that person.So more exes = more problemsThen you must look at the law of big numbers.If you are the 27th person a woman is dating... What do you think the chances of there not being a 28 is? Do you think you are the king compare to the previous 26 men and you are mister wonderful all of the sudden? Have you beaten all those 26 men in all areas? Surely mathematically she has dated men better and worse than you in a number of ways.I'm not saying that person having an ex disqualifies them from being worth dating. I'm just saying the more exes a person has the more of a red flag it is. If your goal is a \\"Long Term\\" and \\"Committed\\" relationship.Now, if you are just looking for a \\"Fuck Buddy\\", then yea, the persons exes are not really a thing. That doesn't matter.

I'm being diplomatic with you. Yes if you're infertile or 50 I guess you could go fuck around and my argument about pregnancy wouldn't apply to you. My point is that pomiscuity or at least many one night stands with persons one will never see again might very well reduce the risk of suffering violence opposed to one fixed partner.I'm gonna take you at your word about a statistic  you brought up. But I find it hard that even thst data would come away with it favoring one night stands as the solution to avoiding violence.Also, surely pregnancy is just as likely to occur if one not be promuscuous but do it with the same person all the time? Really, this is not so much an argument against being promiscuous, as in having sex with multiple different persons, but against having sex at all.I guess that depends on what we define as commited. There is certainly a line that's crossed in frequency like the difference between a 3 month relationship and a 1 year. Such relationships are ideal taking precautions and having a discussion. But I'm also pragmatic on the issue abortion is not officially the table so long as the couple have talked it through. I would consider them responsible within reason. An ideal world would just be couples waiting to get married to be as committed as possible. Such couples could still desire to not have children and use abortion as a method to prevent that from happening.Well that's simply not what most people would call promiscuous, which is having sex with persons one barely knows.Having 3 partners at the same time is not promiscuous because I know them well?

Nah.  It's completely fair, and I'll tell you why: it's easy to be a slut, it's fucking **hard** to be a stud.  To be a stud you have to be witty, charming, well-dressed with nice shoes and a fake job, to be a slut, you just have to be **there.**  There are fat ugly sluts out there, there are no fat ugly studs.  I've met a slutty dwarf, I've never met a stud dwarf.\\"As with most things in life, if something is perceived as easier, or taking a shortcut, it's looked down upon by those who worked harder for it.  This is the same reason people who work their ass off at the gym might look down on a steroid user, or somebody who works a hard job looks down on somebody doing an easier job for the same pay.  It's human nature.Speaking of human nature, on top of this, evolutionary psychologists would argue this has been an evolutionary response for a number of reasons, particularly that women need to be \\"pickier\\" because they are locked down for 9 months of pregnancy and have a shorter breeding window, whereas a man can \\"spread his seed\\" practically without limits.  The evolutionary benefit to men for deterring promiscuity would be that is also deters cuckoldry, which evolutionary psychologists theorise is the driving force behind sexual jealousy and even domestic abuse, too.  Those men, whether they realise it or not, are subconsciously trying to lower their risk of being cuckolded by physical threat.","title":"CMV: Promiscuity is not inherently bad.

Of course, please investigate further so you can fully understand them, but quick and useful simplifications helped me pay closer attention to libertarianism as a former liberal-left thinker myself, so they might help you too.**Public education:** A government controlled education system has the risk of being used to propagandise or teach inaccurate concepts, and even if these inaccuracies weren't intentional they'd be tough to correct. With the government completely out of the equation all schools would be private but that means everyone can make a choice of where their child gets their education, and without public education in the mix plenty of low-cost or even charity-funded free schools would show up, which can cover those that can't afford something more expensive. **Universal healthcare:** Without the government involving itself in healthcare, healthcare can truly be regulated by market forces. In the US, the healthcare system is as dysfunctional as it is because it's *technically* private, but the state intervenes a lot through extreme regulations and guaranteed funding, which makes it more expensive than it should. While yes, in emergency situations you might not be able to compare hospitals, you are able to compare things like insurance coverage while able-minded. **Unregulated market economy:** The leftist position regarding a real free market is the idea that if government doesn't regulate and tax the most powerful corporations, they can get too powerful and exploitative. Ask yourself, then: why do no US billionaires publicly endorse the Libertarian party, if a libertarian government would supposedly benefit them more than a Republican or Democrat gov? The idea that we need to give governments the power to regulate business is theoretically a great idea with the best of intentions, at first. But regulations more often than not end up being ways for powerful corporations to get even more powerful and depend less on actually competing in the market. Simply put, under a free market, your business could get big, but it could never get Amazon-level big. Under a true free market, you could get rich, but you could never get Elon Musk-level rich.

I, for example, would never be able to excel in any of a good number of disciplines, because I'm not tall enough. Does this bother me? No. I can still enter competitions, if I want, I'll just never be part of the national team.But it highlights one fundamental problem with sports: No matter, how hard you train, your draw in the genetic lottery will have a significant impact on your performance. This is especially obvious in the difference between \\"XX\\" and \\"XY\\" chromosome pairs. \\"XX\\" chromosome persons have, on average, less strength than \\"XY\\" persons. The traditional solution is to have those groups compete in separate \\"womens\\" and \\"mens\\" competitions. It's still not fair, there are a lot of \\"XX\\" people who's bodies are better suited for, say, basketball, than that of short \\"XY\\" people. Unless we can fine-sort athletes into groups with similar genetic advantages (and how would we do that?), sports will always be \\"unfair\\".Is there a good solution? No. We could get rid of the \\"women\\" and \\"men\\" split and have all compete in the same class with the result that XY persons would dominate in almost all disciplines. If we don't want to do that, then maybe we should not split the athletes into \\"men\\" and \\"women\\" groups, which, being binary, does not reflect the spectrum of sexual identities anyway. Instead, maybe we should make it a \\"XX\\" / \\"XY\\" split. This is still not ideal, due to the inhomogeneity within the groups, but unless we get rid of professional competitive sports altogether, it's probably the best solution.","title":"2 Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"will americans forget about indlation under biden in 2028","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If only we had an angry, charismatic man yelling about how the corporations are fucking us and spouting truth about wealth disparity...\\nOh wait...","title":"Bernie Sanders blasts Democrats for their attitude towards Joe Rogan"},{"text":"Nothing new there.","title":"I dont remember Bernie making noise during the campaign that the Democratic Party abandoned its base to defend the oligarchy, as any true populist outsider concerned more about the base than the Party wouldve done"},{"text":"And then for their bootlegged gender reveal party they got a big \\"It's a Girl\\" balloon and crossed out the first part so it just said \\"Girl\\"","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I really hope Biden convinces Trump.

In an election that is decided by small margins, that's a number you cannot afford to concede to your opponents.  Rogan spent years not wanting Trump on his podcast.  I think that if Harris went on JRE, he would not have endorsed Trump.  I think Rogan's Trump endorsement (when you consider he is naturally a Bernie bro) only happened because Joe perceived Kamala as a coward, and I agree with that sentiment.  There was also David Ramsey: when he asked to interview both Trump and Harris, Trump asked Ramsey \\"when and where?\\", Harris declined the interview.  Joe Rogan and Dave Ramsey are NOT small potatoes, Rogan is the #1 podcaster in the world, Ramsey is a giant in the personal finance space.  Conceding this ground to Trump, and not doing an appearance, with two guys who are NOT political and are not going to ask difficult questions, is lunacy.  They are not going to ask highly-detailed policy questions, they are just going to verify that you are a functioning human being.  In the 2028 cycle, if a Democratic candidate for president is incapable of doing 3 hours on JRE, they will not win the nomination.  In 2028, people are going to want to see the JRE appearance BEFORE the primary process starts.  Trump was able to do these podcasts, and Harris completely conceded that entire space by running away from it.  It's not even that young men, and male voters in general, are the dominant audience of these podcasts, it's that her refusal to even appear branded her as a coward who was afraid to do it.  Right or wrong, you don't get to define yourself when you don't even show up.  Jim Gaffigan yelled at her about it from the podium at the Al Smith dinner: Northern Pennsylvania is heavily Catholic.  The Al Smith Dinner is the biggest Catholic charity shin-dig around.  Harris skipped it, Trump was at least there.  Are you trying to convince Catholics you hate them?  Because that's how you convince Catholics you hate them.  What's frustrating is that these are all low hanging fruit.  The Al Smith dinner isn't hard, Rogan isn't hard, Dave Ramsey isn't hard.  This isn't an interview at the world economic summit, you show up, tell a few jokes, tell a few stories, answer a few easy questions and that's it.

Abraham George received the nod to replace Rinaldi as the billionaires party enforcer, perhaps because Rinaldi may have been caught supporting DeSantis instead of Trump.Texas Observer - [Meet Farris Wilks, Kingmaker of the Texas GOP](https://www.texasobserver.org/meet-farris-wilks-kingmaker-of-the-texas-gop/)Wilks is an elder at an idiosyncratic church that reportedly doesnt allow women to speak during worship. He also pumps millions into Texas Republican politics.Preaching at the Eastland County church founded by his father, Wilks explained to his congregation  the idiosyncratic, nondenominational Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day  that neither heaven nor hell awaited them when they died. According to Biblical revelation, they would simply go to the grave to await the Resurrection and the judgment that will follow, he said.The congregation celebrates the Sabbath on Saturday, observes dietary restrictions found in Leviticus and reportedly bans women from speaking during worship.Forward - Meet the Evangelical Christians Behind Ted Cruz  [Theyre Super Jewy](https://forward.com/opinion/335661/meet-the-evangelical-christians-behind-ted-cruz-theyre-super-jewy/)But [Farris Wilks]  is no ordinary Christian. The more you study his church  the Assembly of Yahweh, which combines political Christianity, messianic Judaism and the morality of the market  the more uncomfortable it gets for some Jews.

Its a predatorial lifestyle in that they need your children, and straight people having kids, to fulfill their sexual habits, he reportedly said. Hes also said in sermons that climate change is Gods will.Texas Tribune - [Texas GOP chair Matt Rinaldi backed a group with white supremacist ties  while working for its billionaire funder](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/12/farris-wilks-matt-rinaldi-defend-texas-liberty/)Since 2021, Wilks has given nearly $5 million to Defend Texas Liberty, which last year was the state partys largest financial supporter. With [Matt] Rinaldis help, the group has sought to purge the Texas GOP of more moderate voices by bankrolling far-right causes and primary candidates.In my two decades of involvement with the Texas GOP, I am not aware of anything even resembling the relationship between a state chair and a major donor that Matt Rinaldi has with Farris Wilks, said Mark McCaig, a former member of the Texas GOPs executive committee and Rinaldi critic who first noticed the SEC filings on Friday. Its certainly reasonable to ask whether chairman Rinaldi is working towards the betterment of the party, as he pledged he would do in 2021, or if he is more interested in promoting the agenda of Farris Wilks at the expense of a unified and functional party.Wikipedia - [Matt Rinaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Rinaldi)Rinaldi spent the next two decades working at different law firms but never made partner and never worked at any law firm for more than five years. After working at various Dallas law firm, Rinaldi worked part time with various gigs until he began to work for a billionaire political donor.Texas Tribune - [Texas GOP chair Matt Rinaldi wont seek reelection](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/03/15/matt-rinaldi-texas-republican-chair-reelection/)Rinaldi has served as chair for nearly three years, overseeing party operations during a time when Texas has lurched further to the right. Rinaldi has been a vocal proponent of that effort, aligning the party closely with far-right activists and disparaging Republicans he saw as too liberal? including embattled Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan.For many Texas Republicans, the incident underscored an ongoing shift in the state party, which was once primarily focused on fundraising and helping support local Republican clubs and candidates.Over the past three years, and especially since Rinaldi took over in 2021, the organization has tried instead to assert itself as a driving force behind right-wing policy positions, eager to challenge elected Republicans who they believe are not conservative enough. Rinaldi was particularly vocal after the Texas House overwhelmingly voted in May to impeach Paxton on corruption charges.NOTUS - [The Texas GOP RINO Hunts  Will It Stop?](https://www.notus.org/texas/republican-party-texas)[Abraham] George and [Matt] Rinaldi described the old version of the party as a cheerleader for elected officials when it should be both a support and enforcement organization.A lot of the others, they just want to make sure that we get the Republicans elected. I think thats just one of the jobs, not the job only, George said. Our victory is really not electing just Republicans, its actually getting Republican priorities done.The fight between Rinaldi-backed challengers and incumbents is still ongoing, but its clear both sides of the fight understand that the influence of the party is a major issue in the elections to come and could have a huge impact, even at a national level.","title":"Trans Moralism Is Killing the Democrats"},{"text":"Remember all those redactions 'for matters of national security', in C19 vaxx documents?Well, that puts everything in a whole different perspective now...","title":"Dutch Minister of Health, Fleur Agema: Pandemic response and preparedness are planned as part of our \\"NATO responsibilities\\""},{"text":"Actual science says their are more than xx and xy chromosomes.

The point is, close to 50% of Republicans support same sex marriage. Want to know how long ago only 50% of Democrats supported same sex marriage? 2008. Today that number's up to 83%. It's also worth noting that 25% of LGBT people are registered Republicans. So if Republican is a bridge too far, you will be excluding a good number of LGBT people from your wedding as well.  \\nBut at the end of the day it's your wedding and you and your fianc are the ones that get to choose. If voting for Republicans, even though half of Republicans support same sex marriage, is a bridge too far for you, it's your wedding. At the end of the day it's your day, and if having people who support politicians who tend to oppose same sex marriage, even though they have absolutely no ability to do so, is a bridge too far, then honestly that's completely fine. I'm in an interracial marriage, and if one party had language in their platform at the state level opposing interracial marriage, I would have felt a bit weird inviting them too, even if there was no chance interracial marriages were ending any time soon. You're the ones paying for it, you get to decide who will be around you on what will likely be one of the best days of your life.  \\n  \\n  \\nBut consider the fact that if they're accepting an invitation to attend your wedding, they at the very least support your gay marriage. And also consider that although it may sting, they didn't necessarily vote against your right to marry. They more than likely voted for things like lower taxes, opposition to illegal immigration which they saw as a grave threat to the country (I disagree with that, but that's for another post), a stronger foreign policy which would equate to fewer wars (again disagree but trying to explain their side), and maybe they read the party platform on gay marriage and said \\"well the supreme court ruled on it, Trump removed opposition to gay marriage from the national platform, states don't get to decide that anyway, so I'm not going to vote for the candidate who wants to get us into more wars, raise my taxes, and allow open borders so illegal immigrant criminals can come and make my family less safe and take my job merely to make sure same sex marriage stays legal as it will either way\\". Again if voting Republican is too far for you, you can make that decision to not invite them. But just remember you might also risk making not only the wedding but your future life much more wrapped up in politics than it needs to be. When I look back at my wedding pictures, I think of all the people who loved and supported us. There are plenty of people there who I massively disagree with politically. But that's not what the day was about. The day was about celebrating my wife and I as well as our families coming together to become one single family. And honestly my wedding day is the best day of my life so far. The amount of love and happiness we got from people who are die hard Trump supporters when both my wife and I are anything but that wasn't diminished in the slightest. So maybe think about putting politics aside for one day and inviting anyone who is interested in coming to celebrate you and the person you're going to commit to sharing a life with for the rest of the short time you have on this earth. Or again, if it really is a bridge too far, you also shouldn't feel like you have to invite people who will make you feel uncomfortable on what will hopefully be the best day of your life.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"Not only does he have no real power, but he has fierce opposition at every level in every level and corner of government.","title":"Only Half of Dems Accept Legitimacy of Election | And we know what comes next."},{"text":"I agree so bad with We dont listen enough; we tell people whats good for them, because during this election people complained about inflation and immigrants.

Gore claimed that SCOTUS voted against him unfairly in a recount that he would've won otherwise and... also, butterfly ballots were disfavorable but not necessarily intentional.

The left wing sees such things as a strength, but the right sees these things as evidence of a broken society.One of the biggest areas they demand absolute and total conformity is gender. From the cradle, you are expected to adhere and conform to your assigned gender and its assigned roles. And if you don't conform or deviate from that gender in any way, they will make life very rough for you. You are in for a difficult time.
