Yes, if 74 million people in the U.S.roughly a quarter of the populationstopped buying non-essential goods and services, it would have a profound impact on the economy. Heres how:1. Retail and Consumer GoodsDiscretionary Spending Decline: Retail sectors that rely on non-essential items (like clothing, electronics, and luxury goods) would see significant revenue drops, leading to layoffs and store closures.Small Businesses: Many small businesses depend on consumer spending beyond necessities. A sharp decline in this spending could drive many of them out of business.\\n2. Hospitality and EntertainmentIndustries like travel, restaurants, entertainment, and leisure would experience devastating losses. These sectors rely heavily on discretionary spending and employ millions of people.\\n3. Economic Growth (GDP)Consumer Spending Drives GDP: In the U.S., consumer spending accounts for about 70% of GDP. A major reduction in spending would likely cause GDP growth to stagnate or contract, pushing the economy toward recession.\\n4. Financial MarketsCorporate Earnings: Companies dependent on consumer spending would report weaker earnings, leading to declines in stock prices, particularly in consumer discretionary sectors.Investor Confidence: Market instability could erode investor confidence, amplifying economic challenges.\\n5. Government RevenueSales Tax: States and local governments would see a sharp drop in sales tax revenue, which funds essential services like education, public safety, and infrastructure.\\n6. EmploymentSectors hit hardest by reduced spending would lay off workers, increasing unemployment and potentially triggering a ripple effect across the economy.\\n7. Long-Term ImpactIf prolonged, such a shift could force companies to reevaluate their business models and potentially move toward essential goods and services.It might also accelerate trends like automation or reliance on global markets.\\nCounterbalancing FactorsSome sectors like food and utilities would remain stable or even see increased demand.Wealthier individuals or those unaffected by the shift might continue to spend, softening the blow somewhat.\\nConclusionThe U.S. economy is deeply reliant on consumer spending. A sudden, widespread shift to purchasing only necessities would likely trigger a recession, disrupt supply chains, and force major structural adjustments across industries.Now where could I find 70 million people....","title":"Walmart warns it will have to raise prices if Trumps tariffs are enacted"},{"text":"Yeah we should def have someone who went to school in 1953 running the dept of education","title":"Trump picks former WWE executive Linda McMahon for education secretary"},{"text":"For a guy who made a big deal out of Hannibal Lecter, he sure is picking a lot of cannibals","title":"Donald Trump nominates Linda McMahon to lead Education department"},{"text":"Me too really started to go public with Weinstein.

Trump got marginally more votes than he did in 2020 while kamala got significantly less than Biden. Roughly 2-3 million net Biden voters out of 150M flipped to trump and another 5-6M stayed home. Who are these Biden voters that didnt show up and why did they stay home this time? A huge chunk of them must come from cities because thats where we see much of the lower vote totals. Cities that normally vote for democrats 75-25 consistently shifted 8-15 points to the right across the nation. Alongside the demographic shifts, this screams low turnout among your most liberal voters and I wouldnt say theyre the demographic to get scared off by woke politics. Whatever their reasons for staying home were, I do know that LGBT people made up roughly 8% of the electorate this year per GLAAD and they voted for Kamala around 90% per NBC.

The day before, the administration had learned where gunmen were holding Philip Walton, a 27-year-old American who had been kidnapped that week from his farm near Nigers border with Nigeria. As multiple agencies now coordinated on final details for the evening operation, the State Department worked to resolve the last outstanding tasksecuring airspace permission from Nigerian officials. Around noon, Patel called the Pentagon with an update: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he said, had gotten the approval. The mission was a go. The SEALs were close to landing in Nigeria when Defense Secretary Mark Esper discovered that the State Department had not, in fact, secured the overflight clearance, as Patel had claimed. The aircraft were quickly diverted, flying in circles for the next hour as officials scrambled to alert the Nigerian government to their position. With the operation window narrowing, Esper and Pompeo called the Situation Room to put the decision to the president: Either they abort the mission and risk their hostage being killed, or they proceed into foreign airspace and risk their soldiers being shot down. But then, suddenly, the deputy secretary of state was on the line, Esper later wrote in his memoir: Theyd been cleared. Soon Walton was reunited with his family.  What had happened? Celebratory feelings gave way to anger as officials tried to make sense of Patels bad report. According to Esper, Pompeo claimed that at no point had he even spoken with Patel about the mission, much less told him hed received the airspace rights. Esper wrote that his team suspected that Patel had simply made the approval story up. Anthony Tata, the Pentagon official and retired Army general to whom Patel had originally given the green light, confronted Patel in a rage. You couldve gotten these guys killed! Tata shouted, according to two people familiar with the exchange. What the fuck were you thinking?

Asked if he was reconsidering his Cabinet pick, Mr Trump replied: No.?On Monday evening, Mr Musk had described Mr Gaetz as a Judge Dredd figure that America needs to clean up a corrupt system and put powerful bad actors in prison.The furore over the nominee gives insight into the qualities Mr Trump prizes most?[when picking his top team](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/14/florida-dominates-new-trump-white-house/).According to Mr Musk,?[who is intimately involved in the transition team](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/19/spacex-flight-6-live-trump-watch-starship-launch-with-musk/), Mr Gaetz has a big brain, a spine of steel and an axe to grind.But above all, Mr Trump prizes loyalty  especially in a position he intends to use to take retribution against his political enemies during his second term.Mr Gaetz, who has been given a route out of a potentially problematic ethics investigation through his nomination, now owes Mr Trump the remainder of his political career and reputation.The story is evidently not going away. On Monday, a lawyer representing two women at the centre of the Gaetz claims said that Mr Gaetz had paid them to accompany him to drug-fuelled sex parties. He denies all of the claims.Members of the ethics committee and the House leadership are now under intense pressure to release their report. On Tuesday, it was reported that it had been stolen by a hacker, who planned to release it.The episode has thrown Mr Trumps nominations process into disarray, and raised questions about the suitability of several members of his planned Cabinet. The president-elects nomination for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has been accused of sexual assault C a claim he also denies.Those in Mr Trumps circle feel the chaos of this week may be worthwhile in the long run.The president-elect is especially keen to avoid the clashes of his first administration, when he feuded with his attorney general Jeff Sessions over his refusal to become involved in investigations into Russian election interference.For Mr Trump, whose political agenda and personal history is so closely tied to litigation, appointing an unflinching ally in the Department of Justice is a top priority.There are those who argue that Mr Gaetzs nomination is a false flag, designed to create a commotion driven by Senate Republicans who may then decide to support a more moderate candidate later on.But the statements of Mr Trump and his allies suggest the nomination is sincere. For all the controversy of his nomination, Mr Gaetz is an appointee who owes the president-elect everything.If the Senate can be persuaded to confirm him, that fact could make him very valuable indeed.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/19/trump-fears-matt-gaetz-wont-get-confirmed-why-he-backs-him/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/19/trump-fears-matt-gaetz-wont-get-confirmed-why-he-backs-him/)","title":"Trump fears Matt Gaetz won't get confirmed, this is why he's backing him anyway"},{"text":"\\"What you're about to watch is a nightmare...\\"","title":"Trump names Linda McMahon as his pick for education secretary"},{"text":"Nah it 100% mattered.

Thats really about it. Neither Harris nor Biden pushed or ran on wokeness. They consider the woke issues to be Civil Rights issues and freedoms of our Constitution and have been handling those issues as such. Which is the proper way.Conservatives just make shit up like CRT in public schools and shout about it non stop. They manufactured the woke agenda. CRT in public schools is not a real thing, but they succeeded in making half of the country believe its a real thing. Eventually all media was using the term as if its a real thing. And then eventually even some Dems started using the term as if it were a real thing to respond to everyones concerns. Republicans ran on keeping men out of womens sports. Uh, okay. And some other nonsense about liberals giving children sex change operations, and even doing so in public schools. I mean, none of that is happening, but they were so loud and relentless, people believed it. Dems arent trying to put men in womens sports and theyre not trying to give sex change operations to children in public schools. If Dems tried to correct these allegations, it just seemed to fan the flames.Haitians are not eating peoples pets. Didnt matter. The facts never matter, even coming from the mouths of Sherrifs and the mayor.Dems won same sex marriage in 2015, however that was a Supreme Court ruling based on our Constitution. Thats basically the extent of the so called wokeness. Dems have just been trying to grant rights to Americans based on law and our constitution. Even the modern use of the term woke was some dog whistle nonsense Conservatives made up to weaponize. Theyre the only ones saying woke.Republicans made up a whole litany of lies. How do Dems distance themselves from things that arent even real? How do you do that when over half the country decided to believe the lies? Democrats have NEVER campaigned on woke politics.Our media has been hijacked by wealthy conservatives and foreign entities who have an agenda to spread disinformation. We lost the Fairness Doctrine a long time ago. Our government never stepped up to find real solutions as technology grew into a mass media Orwellian nightmare. Our Constitution is outdated. Freedom of Speech is a wonderful thing. The internet and cable tv didnt exist when it was written. Even 2A is great. The founding fathers didnt write that knowing what firearms would exist in the 21st century. The Constitution becomes harder to interpret and more challenging when the world we live in has changed so dramatically since it was written. Apparently we needed Bill Gates (and some other wealthy liberals) to buy up and control the media. Dem officials will never be able to get their actual messaging across without far reaching liberal media. CNN was bought and immediately purged the staff and started sane washing Trump. That was one of many game changers. TikTok probably shouldve been banned, but thats fReEdOm of SpEEcH. There are way too many ways to spread disinformation and there is zero accountability or fact checking for any of it. Thats the problem.And its not a problem because a Republican won. Its a problem because hes not really a Republican, hes a dictator who is compromised by foreign powers and, even though it seems impossible, I dont think most of his voters actually know that. I honestly dont understand how that happened because I wasnt embedded in that echo chamber, but it happened. It might not be long before R voters are the ones trying to protest in the streets and theyll discover that there will be consequences for that. If they really thought theyd get cheaper groceries and more money in their wallets, the shit will eventually hit the fan.

Yet isn't it important to make a distinction here though that this isnt about vigilante justice or creating chaos by allowing everyone to act without regard for rules, but it is about recognising that the rules themselves are often skewed to favour those in power; like corporations?Most of us (I hope at least you do) live in a capitalist and democratic society, give or take, the reality is that many of these systems fail to address corporate mistreatment effectively. They don't even abide by the rules that they claim to be bad. Society rewards narcissists. Wouldn't waiting for the system to work mean you will probably be left at a disadvantage indefinitely? And why should you? While those in power continue to exploit your ass?I'm not advocating for chaos, but about making decisions to protect oneself and level the playing field in environments that are inherently unequal. We have to survive in this system.

I spent two summers and a winter working for him with another highschool kid and a middle-aged guy who was basically his concierge after sustaining life altering injuries as an Asplundh tree climber.  Some key memories of that time include Mr. Asplundh telling me I spread grass seed like someone from the Special Olympics.  Also his gigantic African game hunting trophy room with every big cat, every ruminant on the continent, a rhino head, a bull elephant head, and an old treadmill piled high with ivory tusks like scattered laundry.  I know that sounds made up but this guy was in his late 70's in the early 2000's, he grew up rich and shot every endangered species in the 60's before it was outlawed.  Towards the end of my time there he tried to get me and another 16 year old to rip all the asbestos insulation out of his basement furnace room.  I actually knew that was fucked up and refused, they didn't push the matter.  But still what a cheap ass.I was finally fired when the tractor I was driving blew the transmission.  He expected me to pay for it, the bill was around $700.  I made $60 a day and worked Saturdays.  This literal billionaire expected me to work four months for free to pay him back for his own tractor.  I said no and left, that was the end of my time there.  Anyway, fuck that family.

Companies themselves often manipulate the hiring process by overpromising opportunities, underpaying, or rejecting qualified candidates for arbitrary reasons. In that context, lying or embellishing on an application can level the playing field rather than create true unfairness.While it's true that it might seem unfair to other candidates, the system isn't structured to reward honesty though, it rewards those who navigate it strategically. So why obey it? If companies prioritise profits over ethics, why should people feel bound to a moral code the system itself ignores? At the end of the day, the organisation holds all the power, and employees are just trying to secure their survival in a game stacked against them.If someone is principled until they come under pressure to betray their principles, then by definition they are not principled -I see your point, I think it's important to recognise that principles dont exist in a vacuum though but they are shaped and tested by the realities of the environment we live in wouldn't you agree? Because yeah its great to aspire to unshakable principles, but why rigidly adhere to them in an inherently unfair system, how is that practical or even wise? I don't think so.Im not describing a rejection of moral standards altogether, I'm trying to make an acknowledgment that the system often forces people to make compromises just to survive or thrive. If the system itself operates without principlesrewarding manipulation, exploitation, and dishonestythen why should people feel obligated to uphold moral standards that the system does not respect?It doesn't make much sense to me how acting in a way that ensures fairness for yourself is the right thing to do when the system often denies it.

Hoping they both run again, especially the Dem trying to flip my Assembly district. I really liked his speech. There was also a listening session during which members could discuss their post-Election feelings and present any ideas they had for local or national Dems going forward. Similar to this place, the dooming and finger-pointing was mostly kept to a minimum, with a lot of focuse on what wins we did get and what we're trying to accomplish over the next year. We have various town elections coming up, as well as County Executive in November. I also had a nice chat with one of the club Board members who's the founder of our local Indivisible group, which I hope to get more involved with as well, so good evening for networking.

Off the top of my head, a few examples:1) HITECH Act: In an effort to promote EHR adoption, CMS incentivized Meaningful Use and increased clinical documentation oversight. In my practical experience, this resulted in more scrutiny of clinical verbiage and coding and less focus on individualized patient care. Also supports health data exchange on a foundational level, though your mileage may vary.2) Value-based payment/ACOs: CMS has been heavily involved in the establishment and management of value-based payment models, accountable care organizations, etc. These models restructure payment to match prescribed order sets, heavily influencing clinical decision making for providers hoping to, you know, not lose money. Ive personally worked for multiple physicians who expressed conflict over ordering diagnostics based on intuition/experience over adhering to the payment hierarchy of Medicare/Medicaid. Literally every day in my job surgeons tailor specific procedures/surgical approaches based on what is reimbursed by CMS at the moment.I've had jobs where such administrative involvement was good AND where it was bad (for example, encouraging providers to prioritize truly addressing symptoms rather than ordering every reimbursable test under the sun or, worse, doing a CBC and calling it a day). I won't even say which side of the field I play on (spoiler alert, I'm on neoliberal lol), but I reject the statement that CMS administration does not affect clinical decision making. This department DEMANDS an administration that stands for scientific fact, evidence-based practice, and solid logic.

There is no money to be made with the general public (low/average credit) at 10%.If rates were lowered to 10% on *existing* cards, the banks would simply close the cards and sell the debt off in a securitized bundle to a high yield fund or distressed credit fund. There is no money to be made at 10% given chargeoff rates (that's why CC rates are so high to begin with, to hurdle the chargeoffs and still leave room for profit). Interest rates don't matter (from the perspective of the bank) when the borrower is not making payments, it just accrues and accrues until the bank sells the debt to someone else for pennies on the dollar, and then that person sues the borrower. I'm not saying they would immediately pay off their balance, I'm saying they would *not* pay off their balance. Default has a less of a correlation with interest rates, and more of a correlation with borrower creditworthiness. A person who is a low credit risk is going to pay their debt whether its 1% or 50% interest - they'll pay it even faster with 50% interest. A low-information, high credit risk borrower isn't going to pay it at any interest rate. The reason that the rates are so high on credit cards is that is the necessary rate for it to be profitable given the massive amount of bad debt and charge-offs associated with credit cards.","title":"Bernie Sanders giving credit: Trump's campaign promise to cap credit card interest at 10% would be helpful for many Americans."},{"text":"Going to blow past the current leader (his last admin) and take the crown for sure.","title":"100% on board: Border state offers Trump massive plot of land to aid mass deportation operation"},{"text":"\\"The Grossest Gr?faz of All Time.\\"","title":"100% on board: Border state offers Trump massive plot of land to aid mass deportation operation"},{"text":"They want to keep bringing up convicted felon as long as they can.","title":"Bragg Willing To Postpone Lawfare Indefinitely After Trump's Victory"},{"text":"I won't even call it ideology, it's so wildly inconsistent, I'd call it vibes-based voting, you know, what republicans accused us of.","title":"Trumps DOGE commission promises mass federal layoffs, ending telework"},{"text":"No its not.

He knows how to broadcast his brand and message through an omnichannel presence that can't be avoided when has a huge budget ?and yeah Elon money should be considered interference.It's not his rambling/weaving during his rallies that sends this message; it's social, tv, radio, podcast, display, sms, email, YouTube, etc. that reaches 100 million+ voters.  Foxnews and his rallies reach less than a few million, but that's all the Democratic party responded to and highlighted. The media buy he did for the MLB and NFL running the same anti-trans ad was a knife in the heart of Kamila's progress of talking about the economy or abortion. The DNC had nothing to counter it.Don't hate the messenger here, but the Democratic party ran a campaign based on a 15-year-old or more media strategy of celebrity endorsements and trying to appeal to issues only informed voters might care about.While Trump outright lied through repetition on the most visceral of issues.

The manager of a factor wouldn't be working class while the union foreman is even though their incomes might be somewhat close. The type of job you have is influenced by things like education level which itself was influenced by things like childhood household income.

People forget about it and set up autopay. I don't see a world on which a 20% interest rate drop suddenly results in a large percentage of CC holders immediately paying off their balances. If anything, it would have the opposite effect. Even more people would be likely to forget (or not worry about) their CC balances.The banks would still make plenty of money. Lower interest rate loans are more likely to be paid off (isn't that proven?), so consumers would pay off their CC balances and therefore default rates would go down now that the balance isn't skyrocketing due to disgustingly high rates.

It has only suddenly become a problem with Ukraine because Putin thinks he can grab territory there. NATO expansion WAS a problem. The Russians are not at all happy with Poland and the others in NATO. That's why in 2021, they tried hard to negotiate for a two tier system, where the \\"new\\" members in East Europe would have a lower tier status. NATO refused Russia's request.Side note, Gorbachev's country doesn't exist anymore. Even if it did, it's not like there was anything in writing, unlike Russia's promise to not invade Ukraine after they gave up nukes. So much for that Russian honesty, huh? Earlier you asked me:Idk why people who are so ready to question the US's excuses accept Russia's without question.So that's why the US has zero credibility. The US promised no NATO expansion. American word means NOTHING. You can't just say, \\"oh our promise was to the USSR and not Russia\\". That's why the US has no credibility. Throw in things like Iraq and its \\"WMDs\\" to add fuel to the fire. You're basically saying that the US is a real world version of Tarkin in this scene from Star Wars where he says the contracts were with the Republic not the Empire:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qydAnb3GYOA&amp;t=34sRussia being the Kamonians and the US being Tarkin.Even if it did, it's not like there was anything in writing, unlike Russia's promise to not invade Ukraine after they gave up nukes. So much for that Russian honesty, huh? Ukraine never had nuclear weapons. They old USSR nuclear weapons that were stationed on what became Ukraine were not usable by Ukraine. They did not have the launch codes to use them. It's like when the US stations nuclear weapons on Germany - they aren't suddenly German nuclear weapons or alternatively, if the US somehow lost a state that it had nuclear weapons (say 1 of the lower 48 states somehow became it's own nation) that state would not have nuclear weapons. The launch codes would be retained by the remaining 49 states of the successor state to the US. No honesty has been lost there. There's a reason why the world takes Russia seriously and not the US. Not usually something the world is chill about. So why is 85% of the world trading with Russia? Because you got your facts wrong. The US provoked this war. Your claims have been debunked by basically everybody, and they come from a country that has literally used video game footage as propaganda pretending it's real.Making up things on Reddit isn't going  to change anything. If you'd rather trust the sources of information that told you that Russia was going to run out of ammunition in 2022, well that's on you for not have the critical thinking skills to ask the hard questions and being blindly obedient to Western propaganda.Iraq 2: Electric Boogaloo was bad. Turns out, the west isn't perfect. No one is claiming it is. That doesn't mean Russia is some pillar of honesty in comparison. Iraq was an aggressive war, unlike what Russia was doing. Russia was left with a choice - be destroyed by the West or launch the SMO.  The US never faced an existential crisis like that from Saddam - the closest may have been the Cuban Missile Crisis, which the US provoked by stationing nuclear weapons in Turkey, which the then USSR responded by stationing nukes in Cuba. The US wanted to station nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which would have provoked a similar crisis. No nuclear nation wants nukes beside them.Russia isn't perfect, but it's acted in far better faith than the West has. That's why it's trusted in the Global South.  That's why when other nations experience crises like in the Middle East, Russia is trusted.","title":"As Biden himself repeatedly complained, Ukraines goal is to draw NATO directly in the war.

With each class being based, not on income, or property, or birth; but instead based on their social role, the work that they do.He gives examples going as far as ancient egypt. He thinks each class has an important role to fill, and that society runs well when the four classes find balance, with each one doing their part without undermining the others.In the modern day, he puts veterans as the warrior class, entrepreneurs and tech bros as the merchant class, the PMC as the bureacrat class and academics as the priest class (because the priest class are the ones who preach morality and truth to the masses). And he thinks the bureacrat class (the PMC) and the priest class (academics) have become too powerful in the culture and that's why people are lashing out.I have many criticisms to his theories, but I still find them fascinating.

At the end of the day, he didnt really do anything and NATO members started boosting defense spending (which is a good thing!). He also moved more troops to Poland.

It has only suddenly become a problem with Ukraine because Putin thinks he can grab territory there. Side note, Gorbachev's country doesn't exist anymore. Even if it did, it's not like there was anything in writing, unlike Russia's promise to not invade Ukraine after they gave up nukes. So much for that Russian honesty, huh? This is the real problem with this war, though. Russia invading Ukraine means that if you're bordered by an aggressive country like Russia that wants to break off your agreed upon sovereign territory, you have 2 options: join a nuclear coalition like NATO, or get your own nukes. Not usually something the world is chill about. Thanks for not answering why countries bordering Russia overwhelming want to join NATO, though. Wild to think that other countries have a will of their own and aren't exclusively NPCs to be used by the US or Russia. That's how Russia sees it, too, and probably why their neighbors are scared of them. And, like you, they also think it's okay for them to have boots on the ground in one of these NPC countries as long as it's unofficial.Your Ukrainian history is dogshit at best. Your claims have been debunked by basically everybody, and they come from a country that has literally used video game footage as propaganda pretending it's real. Any evidence of anything would help a lot, but there isn't any that stands up when you look at it for more than 2 minutes.

Rip up plastic, trade in bananas. Seriously though..this will absolutely have a short term impact. People have been conditioned to enter debt, and businesses that rely on those people WILL suffer. But at the end of the day that was a completely unsustainable model and human society has thrived for centuries without credit cards. I dont really put too much stock into arguments that banks ultimately deciding that credit cards are too unprofitable to offer, will be the death of the American economy.As conservatives, we WANT to remove debt. Less debt means less social benefits. Less social benefits means less taxes. Less taxes + less debt = more disposable income. More disposable income = more money spent locally at your town's stores, garages, restaurants, and local services etc. Compared with profits made from credit cards that go to a far-away bank, possibly a foreign one, where it benefits people hundreds of miles away who will never spend a dime in your local community.Philosophically, yes I understand reservations RE the growing nanny state.

Grad students (and non-self employed tax accountants) could absolutely be considered working class under this traditional definition since they receive compensation by an employer in exchange for their labour.This tension in the historical conception of working class is exactly what is being highlighted here: A lot of class theory is based on the assumption that working class (wage workers) = low education = poor and owning class = high education = wealthy; but modern socioeconomic status is simply much more fractured and complex. The entire professional class, for example, are wealthy, highly educated, wage(/salaried) workers; and homeownership and investment portfolios are sources of capital income that is available to more than just the extremely wealthy. The category of low education, blue collar workers may be united by some cultural commonality, but their economic interests are extremely fractured based on income, homeownership and being business owners vs. wage labourers. You can see a similar tension within the category of highly educated, culturally liberal, professional workers when divided between homeowners (blue state NIMBYs) and non-homeowners (blue state YIMBYs). When analysing socioeconomic class, its a lot more helpful to separate cultural, educational, wealth and capital ownership factors than to try to combine them to construct a nebulous working class. tldr; No, traditional definitions of class actually completely fail to capture our intuitions about grad students vs blue collared workers, which is one of the reasons why it is not a good model of modern political economy.

It is currently frozen as the unionists scored a massive victory last year but theyre sensing weakness and could advance towards other towns currently controlled by SL like Ceerigaabo. Its not particularly violent for civilians though as no terrorist groups are present there, it is very much unstable though.Ethiopia quickly invaded after the 91 collapse and an Islamist insurgency has been fighting them since then in the South. Nationalist talks to unify the country collapsed for good in the early 2000s and 9/11 led to an influx of jihadis seeking refuge in an ungoverned Somalia. In 2006, a group of Somali former law students from Sudan came to Somalia and united with Islamic fundamentalists to form the Islamic Courts Union. The ICU took over the entire south in a few months and intended to conquer the North to then wage a war against Ethiopia. Puntland didnt want that and therefore united with Ethiopia and the US to wage war against the ICU which led to the establishment of the current government in Mogadishu. The military wing of the ICU, Al Shabaab, became much more radical and decided to wage guerrilla warfare against both Ethiopia and the Federal Government. They quickly lost the support of Somalis (and gained their absolute hatred) as theyve spent the following years committing atrocities upon atrocities against Somali Muslims for unislamic reasons.Puntland is very important here (btw this is where Ilhan Omar comes from). They generally dislike the South and like their autonomy but they absolutely despise Somaliland. The clans that form both of these polities have been waging war against each other since the pre-colonial days for the land currently under the control of unionist insurgents. In fact, a big reason why Italy was welcomed by the Sultan in the north was to protect themselves against British Somaliland which was based in Hargeysa. So while they might have helped ?? to take Mogadishu in the 2000s, this was only on the condition that Somalias sovereignty over all of its territory would be secured (aka no SL recognition or ? annexation).When it comes to the South, you have to understand that this is not a conflict between islamists and secularists, its a conflict between unhinged idealist islamists (??) and more pragmatic moderate islamists (?). There is not that big of a gulf between the social practices in AS areas vs the ones under the state control and the Federal government could establish the Shariicaa pretty easily with no pushback from the population there. The political gridlock was caused by two things: 1) a political deal with AS would put Somalia at war with Ethiopia overnight and 2) Somalia would quickly lose all support from the West which it depends on. This is why in a previous comment in this sub, I lurk but do not post here outside of Somali related posts because I see a lot of Somaliphobia and Islamophobia, I said that Somalia would likely act in an escalatory manner in response to Ethiopian aggression, which they did. The coming war with ? and the hostile stance from ? would give Mogadishu political room to come to a deal with ?? without being regarded as a pariah on the international stage. But again this all depends on ?? as Mogadishu would need a new sponsor in the short term and arms suppliers to not collapse and simultaneously wage war with ?.There are also some other big events that are influencing this situation: ? got free of ? arms embargo last year, onshore oil reserves were found in the northern areas under the control of unionist insurgents, Turkey is currently searching for oil offshore and is likely to be very successful, etc.Edit: A deal from Mogadishu would likely be similar to the Azov/Ukraine situation: major factions within AS would be integrated into the army and the state, for example Somalias current minister of religion was an AS cofounder. There is no way in hell AS ever gets recognized as an equal partner as Somalis hate them too much and many within them committed horrible things against us.","title":"Donald Trump set to recognise African state as official country (Somaliland), says ex-Tory minister after holding talks"},{"text":"A mandate is basically a made up social idea that provides pressure on Congress to fall in line.

The Latino birth rate has been higher than that of any racial group (or really: ethnic *or* racial group, Latinos can be any race) for decades, and have the highest number of kids per mother. I remember seeing this on a chart somewhere: Latinas were the most likely to have 3 or 4 kids, Asian women were the most likely to have 2, black women were the most likely to have 1, and white women were around 2 (keep in mind these are children per mother, not birth rate which also includes childless women). In my experience even young Latinas who are pro-choice aren't super enthusiastic about it. They just view it as a utilitarian thing, like it's better to have abortion rights basically for the health and safety of women and babies. This is anecdotal, but here in south Florida, I notice Latinas (or at least Cuban women) tend to have kids in their 20s a lot more commonly than white women or black women, even while working jobs and studying (it also helps that Latino husbands help around the house a lot).","title":"Majority Black Counties swung to Trump at 2.7pts &amp; Majority Hispanic Counties swung to Trump at 13.3pts"},{"text":"And you know damn well most of them have never even met, probably never *seen* a trans person.

Maybe youre wrong. But well never know because Putin didnt invade Ukraine under Trump. Once again Im not here to say that everything Trump proposes in foreign policy is good. In fact, Im pretty worried for US foreign policy going forward now. Im just saying that his 1st term foreign policy was pretty good. [Also, Trumps 2017 decision to start sending lethal aid to Ukraine](https://apnews.com/article/71fd3f8ee74f488fb788accf1e7978e4)&amp; train them on it when even Obama wouldnt almost definitely helped Ukraine not collapse at the start of their invasion. Not only did Trump send them lethal aid for the 1st time, he sent them super fucking advanced weapons that were key to holding off Russia early in the war. And by the 2022 invasion, they had almost 5 years of training &amp; experience with the advanced weapons. Like if Trump had continued Obamas policies in Ukraine, I think theres a decent chance that Ukraine either wouldve collapsed early on in the war OR Russia would have a lot more land today. Its also important to remember that Biden was basically the point guy on Ukraine under Obama. Now its ironic that the POTUS who first sent lethal aid to Ukraine also temporarily withheld the aid (before restoring it almost immediately after pressure) for political reasons. So yes its possible that if Russia invaded Ukraine under Trump, Ukraine wouldnt be here today. Its also clear that if Trump had continued Obama-era Ukraine aid policies, Ukraine also wouldnt have been here today. This isnt me praising Trump (theres very few things to praise him on). Its just being factual. I do hope Trump doesnt abandon Ukraine even though theres a good chance he will. But in his 1st term, his Ukraine policies (besides the temporary blackmail) were pretty good &amp; critical for Ukraine today.","title":"Donald Trump set to recognise African state as official country (Somaliland), says ex-Tory minister after holding talks"},{"text":"Gummies.

Too scared for actual discussion.This is a good example of what you're actually here to complain about: being disagreed with. Maybe it's just reddit being wonky, but you're sitting at 0 karma for me, which means a grand total of 1 more person downvoted you than upvoted you. But you're so profoundly sensitive to any negative feedback that that alone forced you to edit your post to complain and accuse anyone who downvoted you of being scared of your \\"discussion\\". Which would be a silly idea if you were sitting at -20 karma for all I care, because it's always pathetic to complain about downvotes.To your more general points: it's not the majority and you've not been silenced. It's like 30% of the population, with his popular vote this time being victorious solely because the Democrats didn't get as many votes as normal. I think he got like 2 million more than last time, which is still like 5 million less than what Biden got in 2020. And for a silenced group we just can't seem to stop having to hear you. And it would be *wonderful* if Trump supporters were silenced for a bit because it would spare us a few moments of having to constantly listen to them.Ultimately, though, supporting Trump means something. It says something about you, and nothing it says is good. No one is obligated to be nice to you or friends with you or pat you on the back and say it's okay you're a raging misogynist or racist or fascist who doesn't know how the economy works. You made an important decision and people find you to be a reprehensible person for it. It doesn't matter that you want to force everyone to listen to you and be celebrated for it and never have a single person tell you what you are, you don't actually have a right to that.","title":"CMV: Majority of people wanted Trump, they have just being silenced."},{"text":"he gave us the middle finger in 2020-21now he's transitioning to the conquer phas of \\"divide and conquer\\"","title":"'Giving his middle finger to the American people': Bob Woodward reacts to Trump Cabinet picks"},{"text":"Just sentence him now for January 21st, 2029.

He used to be the paradigm of right wing politics in Alberta. He was an MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly; an elected politician) and Deputy Premier (second in charge of the Government of Alberta). He has since changed his position (relative to the crazy fringe rightwing Trump style politics that has taken over Alberta and Canada), so he is connected and informed about this issue. IE. He is actively opposing this kind of corrupt rightwing BS that is taking over the western world. Thanks [IDU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Democracy_Union)!Near the tail of COVID, Alberta purchased $80 million CAD of acetaminophen from Suna's company, begged the Canadian government to approve the bunk medicine, and then stored it in warehouses because no MD would sign off on it and no pharmacist would stock it.

Degree does matter as much as principle. For example the right to self defense is based entirely on the degree of the threat. As soon as there is one exception then the argument for principles is invalid. And anyway, whether the principle is violated depends entirely on whether you view the fetus is literally equal thing to a living child or not. On the one extreme that means that you shouldnt even be allowed to masturbate or implies that the unborn child should be given full citizenship rights. On the other extreme if birth is the line then late term abortions would be acceptable. Most people are in neither of those camps which suggest most people view a fetus as less like a human being child or more like a child depending on the time of pregnancy. Youre right that actions can create moral or ethical obligations. I might even concede for the sake of argument that having sex does make you responsible. But even that is vague. Responsible for what? Having to pay for your own abortion is logically consistent with being responsible for your pregnancy. But the idea that you are responsible to care for a loving child does not automatically obligate someone to care for a clump of cells. Obviously the responsibility attaches at some pointits not obvious why it should happen at conception. But this is kind of the challenge with using the law to enforce morality, isnt it? But whether those ethical obligations justify legal obligations is a balance of protecting personal choices and social functionality. We live in a society where the moral or ethical views on abortion are not consistent. So what is the principle behind using the states monopoly on violence to force a pregnant woman to give birth?

The Wizard, while not a healthcare expert, demonstrated an ability to think creatively and solve complex problems with resources, which could be valuable in overseeing large, complex systems like these. However, the Wizard's lack of a solid foundation in real healthcare policy would still present challenges. Ultimately, someone with actual experience in health systems and public policy would be better suited for the role.","title":"Trump Taps Dr. Oz to Take Control of Medicare and Medicaid"},{"text":"Yeah but did he throw an axe and miss the target and hit a military drummer?","title":"Pete Hegseth Scandal Is Rattling Trumpworld: ??People Are Upset About the Distraction"},{"text":"The gay wheel-chaired nazi tried to tell everyone..","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene: GOP Covered Up Sexual Harassment and Assault Claims"},{"text":"It depends on if you include children in the US population.","title":"CMV: Majority of people wanted Trump, they have just being silenced."},{"text":"Exactly.

And that's just among people who voted, which is probably around 65% of eligible voters. Meaning 153 million people either voted for Harris or didn't vote, while 76 million voted for Trump.The difference is the people who voted for Harris watch legitimate, mainstream news outlets, like broadcast television and major newspapers. Trump voters tend to get their information from podcasts and social media. The most popular podcast host by far is Joe Rogan, and he endorsed Trump. So did basically all of the other popular podcasters and social media influencers: Adin Ross, Theo Von, Ben Shapiro, Tim Pool. The audience that these guys have collectively is massive, they're very right wing, but they're also not news. They're not even really opinions *about* the news, they're just vibes. Conservative, macho vibes.The people who watch these influencers and podcasters are grossly uninformed or misinformed about politics and the news. They're not being silenced. Even in my mainstream news shows and newspapers, there were endless articles and interviews in local diners with Trump supporters. You guys are louder than ever before.
