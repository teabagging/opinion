More competition exists now for men. It's a perception thing, and I don't support that but that (often subconscious) feeling doesn't go away just by yelling at men.Another, deeper issue is there's a lack of good male role models, or a lack of much sense of what masculinity means anymore. All you ever hear is \\"toxic masculinity\\" and never any real mention of what healthy masculinity is. Starts to sound like all masculinity is toxic, and no one wants to feel like society sees them as garbage. Suicide rates are really really high for young men in good part because of these issues.And with the loss of much of traditionally \\"male\\" careers like resource extraction, farming, manufacturing, thanks to mechanization and outsourcing, as well as the trades (whose jobs often go to immigrants, so that comes in here too), as we move to a more service based and information based economy, favoring more \\"feminine\\" values as cooperation, teamwork, interpersonal skills (soft skills), men may feel under attack or left behind, not needed or valued.This isn't a small thing, because assholes like Andrew Tate, Jordan Peterson, Proud Boys, all kinds of awful men and groups, step in to capitalize on this lost feeling. THEY at least look at these young men and speak directly to them.Society continues to ignore men, and say shit like \\"you were on top for so long, you don't get to complain\\" while forgetting that through history, most men were cannon fodder and the working poor, not \\"in control\\" of almost anything. But we don't talk about class in America so we pretend all men were somehow living like kings on the backs of women and other races (also forgetting that black and Latino men were pretty well shit on for much of history in America too).Anyways, it's an interesting topic. I don't know the solutions here. I want to lift everyone up and have a fair distribution of opportunity and wellbeing. For me, a lot of it does come down to ignored class issues. But thats a whole other discussion maybe.I will say that your inability to even guess what might be male specific issues shows how completely absent men are in the narrative at all, except as villains. Not shitting on you personally, I know you were just asking. There are legitimate issues. One could also talk about rarely getting custody of kids, or the assets in divorces, but I know less about that.","title":"Prominent Texas Republican endorses Democrats Kamala Harris and Colin Allred"},{"text":"The Repugs won the 2010 midterms so they were going to screw the Dims anyway.\\nThe Dims told them \\"Gerrymander all you want as long as you get rid of Kucinich for us\\".

The Senate is at 50/50 right now.  We may not even keep control of it now without purposefully putting it at risk (the Governor of AZ is required to replace with someone of the same party, but that is only until a special election could be organized.I felt some of the same reasons could also be applied to Shapiro (the other one of the 3 top contenders).Also - Mark Kelly is proving to be a good Senator, but in speeches, etc.?  He's not particularly warm.  He wouldn't match Kamala Harris' energy in that regard, and IMHO, it is needed otherwise the WOMAN might come accross as leadership material (even though we're often told to smile more).  Also, Walz has the same energy that Biden did in 2008 - when they walked in the room as the VP or VP nominee and the POTUS or POTUS nominee was in the room, they just had/have a demeanor of \\"don't look at me, that is the person in charge and that person has my full support\\".  Critical when you are talking about a younger Black man running for POTUS (who didn't have a lot of experience in terms of Congress) and critical when you are talking about any woman, particularly a Black woman.  But you also knew/know they are fully capable of governing if POTUS isn't there.  Biden had that energy. Walz has that energy.  Shapiro didn't, and I'm on the fence about Kelly.Walz also has a lot more experience in governing, and in ways that Kamala Harris does not.  The two of them really cover a lot of ground in terms of that - her as Attorney General, Senator, and now MVP, Walz as a Congressman and Governor.  (Probably one of the most credentialed tickets in a long time in terms of state and federal government experience!!!)He appeals to the Midwest and rural areas in ways that Harris does not and Mark Kelly does not.  He legit goes to state fairs and can talk to farmers as a farm kid and as Governor of Minnesota.

I believe she absolutely plans on having a relationship with her VP as Biden has had with her, and as Biden had with Obama (per his request... he said he accepted the role only if Obama agreed to put him to work.

I suspect that was the original plan, but Harris was just not popular enough, so they had to try to give her something to do to build up her recognition and popularity before they pulled the plug (figuratively, although having to do that literally was becoming more and more likely the longer they waited).The reason they didn't want to do a primary is that they had already invested too much into Harris to waste it, and she still just wasn't polling well enough to actually win - so they had to try with Biden and have him step down after he was in office, and just hope that Trump was too old to run again next time. But after his debate performance, where even MSNBC and CNN were saying \\"ok, maybe this wasn't Biden's best performance ever...\\", they had no choice left. They knew that Biden was going to lose, so he had to retire. There was just no other way left.That Harris is even **CLOSE** to winning at this point is indicative that this election was never really about Biden (or Harris) from the start. It is, and always has been, all about Trump. People are either voting for Trump (grudgingly or enthusiastically, or somewhere in between), or against Trump. Almost no one is voting FOR Harris.

Which party honors their \\"southern heritage,\\" and which party throws a conniption fit and cries, \\"MUH HISTORY!\\" everytime a confederate icon's statue is taken down? HMM!? yah, that's what I thought.But here are some actual \\"facts\\" for you, and not a bunch of revisionist bullshit taken out of context to fit an absurd narrative.In the 19th and 20th centuries, as a result of shifting ideologies and political platforms, the Democratic party began departing from its earlier policies. This realignment involved Democrats supporting social justice reforms and the role of the federal government in helping to establish these changes, it also involved new deal Democrats who sought to expand federal power to address economic crisis, labor rights, banking reforms and the emergence of social programs.By the mid 20th century, Republicans began shifting towards conservative social policies and supporting a limited government.Democrats on the other hand, became more and more associated with liberal policies, civil rights, welfare programs, and a stronger federal government.The southern strategy was employed by Republicans, starting in the 1960s, to draw white, southern voters to the party who felt alienated and disarmed by civil rights movements and desegregation policies. The strategy was also successful in appealing to racial tensions and promoting conservative and religious \\"values.\\"The strategy proved very effective for Republicans, leading to a substantial realignment and more political support in the south.By the 1980s, a new conservative movement had formed. Over the course of two decades, conservative figures like George Wallace, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan of course, used \\"Law and Order,\\" \\"tough on crime\\" rhetoric and campaign talking points to engage with aggrieved white conservatives in the south particularly. This language was riddled with dog whistles meant to inflame racial tensions and inculcate conservatives with fears of racial violence and crime in their neighborhoodsOut of this movement also emerged the formation of the \\"moral majority,\\" and a Christian fundamentalist revival that drew more and more southern whites to the Republican party platform.Right wing political figures also attracted white conservatives to the party by catering to their grievances surrounding some of the sociopolitical changes that challenged the heteronormativity of a pre racial America and dominant white culture.Around this time, the Republican party began ramping up its \\"culture wars,\\" and \\"holy wars\\" that sought to establish a fight between the forces of good and evil, while also appealing to voters who felt that these fundamental societal changes were a threat to their white, Christian hegemony.Now, politically, the Republican party around this time also began reviving and refashioning for the modern era, previous era policies rooted in an anachronistic ideology and perspective that helped institute laws and cultural norms that brought about the Jim Crow era. Including policies that widened the racial wealth gap, that contributed to racial injustice, disparities in generational wealth, that reinforced race-based housing discrimination, policies meant to sequester black communities, and policies that disproportionately jailed black people and denied loans to black families, farmers, business owners, etc...The Conservative party today has deep roots in this movement and has grown increasingly more ethnocentrist as a result.","title":"Democrats: *Found the KKK*; Also Democrats: MUH PARTY SWITCH!!"},{"text":"It means burn down your local businesses when you get upset about something.","title":"Were not in a cult guys"},{"text":"He is going to be on Jimmy Kimmel... which is recorded in LA.","title":"Democratic vice president nominee Tim Walz campaigns in Los Angeles and SoCal"},{"text":"Dude, I have not posted a single link during our \\"discussion.\\"  You're the one putting words in my mouth.If you send me another message without conceding that I never posted any link, then I will immediately block you.","title":"How Joe Biden helped fuel a Middle Eastern war and collapse American credibility"},{"text":"TX makes is exceedingly hard to vote.

Its also worth noting that Title VII doesnt only pertain racial discrimination.I can *almost* see your position in large, diverse cities; sure, there are other coffee shops to go to and even if their werent, do we *really* need to purchase prepared coffee?

At the macro level, many US politicians (Biden included) support Israel because Israel acts as both a military proxy in the area and a way for our defense companies to test new stuff. It gives us a foothold in the region without having to put US troops directly in harms way. On a political level, most US politicians are scared to take too strong a stance against Israel because that will hurt them with many voters who are super sympathetic with Israel. The pro-Palestine/anti-Israel stance is popular online, but much less so across the broader populace, especially against those who vote consistently. People have always treaded carefully around Israel/US relations. Biden has taken the \\"hug bibi\\" approach where his public statements are all positive and he tries to exert pressure behind the scenes (which is not working all that well)Then for Biden specifically, I think there are two major factors. First, he's just a pretty conservative politician when it comes to international affairs. The idea of Biden as radical leftist is a brand new thing Trump created out of nothing. Biden has always been a very centrist Democrat and as such he is cautious to shake up the world order too much. Secondly, I think sometimes Biden puts too much faith in his own interpersonal abilities. Biden has been in public office for 51 years, Netanyahu has been in office in Israel for about 40 years. The two have known each other a long time and have likely spoken many times. In other areas Biden has been able to leverage similar relationships, but it doesn't seem to be working now. He seems to have miscalculated that he could use their relationship to influence them.","title":"Biden Gives Shocking Answer on Potential Israeli Election Interference: Did Joe Biden just admit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be trying to kick Democrats out of the White House?"},{"text":"Can you tell me what happened to the world in 2020?

In order to tell the difference, we need at least some piece of evidence that could suggest if a gift is a bribe. In Al Capone's case, we have evidence. Al Capone comitted a lot of crimes. Al Capone gave gifts to police officers who would be the people directly responsible for arresting Al Capone for his crimes. Al Capone probably even had conversations with various people about what those gifts might get him in return. Even without knowing about those conversations though, we have at least a clear motive for why those gifts might have been a bribe which is circumstantial evidence for bribery.What's disengenuous is.....if I give one to a politician whom I only know because I wanted something from themYou can't just make that claim from nowhere. That's the part that makes it a bribe. You have to demonstrate that partFor the supreme court justices, do we have any potential direct motive for why any gift could possibly have been a bribe? (That isn't an all encompassing conspiracy that anything they do that liberals disagree with is an overarching plot to subvert the will of democrats and get Trump elected despite extremely clear indicators that the overturning of Roe v. Wade has significantly increased voter sentiment in favor of democrats which is a significant factor hurting Trump's election chances.)Maybe any of those gifts were given by people who had cases related to them or their businesses on, or potentially coming to the supreme court's docket? Maybe they even just advocated for or agianst some piece of legislation potentially up for court review. That second potential example is an extremely low bar, that has probably happened, and if somebody could just point to that we could at least say, yeah that's a potential motive, and maybe the potential problem could be taken seriously instead of trivially written off by pointing out that every single person in this country has received a gift at some point without being expected to do something in return, and we can't just assume that some gifts did have expectations with absolutely no reason why we assume that.","title":"Supreme Court to weigh legality of Biden administration's ghost guns rule"},{"text":"But why does the USA support a genocide by a government that is trying to also overthrow our government?

Secretary Vilsack also noted that USDA has been serving the nations farmer cooperatives for 98 years with cooperative statistics, research, technical assistance and informational products.This year, National Cooperative Month comes on the heels of President Bidens historic announcement of more than $7.3 billion in financing for rural electric cooperatives to build clean energy for rural communities through the Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program. Together, New ERA and other investments in rural clean energy in the Presidents Inflation Reduction Act make up the largest investment in rural electrification and in electric cooperatives since the 1936 Rural Electrification Act.As part of the month-long observance, USDA Rural Development Under Secretary Dr. Basil Gooden will deliver remarks at the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) CLUSAs Cooperative IMPACT Conference in Washington, DC on October 2. The conference is the only national, cross-sector event focused on how cooperatives serve to create economic opportunities and strengthen communities across the nation.Cooperatives are businesses owned and controlled by the people who use them. They differ from other businesses because they are member-owned and operate for the benefit of members, rather than to earn profits for investors.Cooperatives are a trusted, democratic, time-tested business model that builds local wealth for members and communities. Organized to meet the economic needs of its member-owners, a cooperative is a particularly resilient business model and embodies the concept of self-help.USDA Rural Development offers a variety of financial assistance and services to assist rural businesses, including cooperatives and agricultural producers.   \\n...Statement from Secretary Vilsack:Cooperatives are the backbone of our nation and are central to President Bidens Investing in America agenda to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and middle out, Secretary Vilsack said. Today we celebrate our partnerships with these organizations and renew our commitment to champion the vital work they accomplish in building local wealth, creating new opportunities and serving the unique needs of rural communities throughout the country.","title":"USDA Celebrates Long-Standing Partnerships with Rural Cooperatives as Part of 60th Anniversary of National Cooperative Month | Department Highlights More Than $17 Billion in Investments to Support Rural Cooperatives Since the Start of Biden-Harris Administration"},{"text":"Look at Canadians flocking to Poilievre; exact same rationale.

Objectively.This has not been even remotely the most contested US election!In the 1800 election the House had to decide who wins. The VP killed the guy who took the President's job from him in a duel a few years later. It was such a disaster it led to the 12th Amendment.In 1824 the House had to decide the election again.By far the most contested election was the 1876 election. There was massive voter fraud, electoral violence. And not \\"fraud\\" like they allege today where there is basically zero evidence for it. Fraud as in, 101% of the voters in South Carolina voted! 150 people in South Carolina were killed to prevent them from voting. Ballots were intentionally printed with the wrong name and party on them, so you thought you voted for one person, but you voted for another. The Governor of Oregon just substituted the delegates who were elected by the other party with his own person, voters be damned. It was such a disaster constitutionally and procedurally that Congress just changed the laws on the spot in January before the inauguration since no one knew who won. They made a 15 member commission to pick the president. The parties basically traded favors to decide who would win. They decided who was president on March 2nd, Hayes took the oath of office on March 5th.In 2000 the Supreme Court stepped in and decided a winner. The win was by like 500 votes.Consider this.

Helloooo","title":"GOP refuse to work, then blame the Dems"},{"text":"Biden will go down as at best a mediocre president, and perhaps one that is well below average.1. The war in Ukraine has been disastrously managed. Biden has slow walked support for Ukraine giving Russia time to adapt. If Ukraine had gotten the support it asked for in the first 6 months, it could have fought far more effectively. Instead, we give Ukraine small amounts of new things constantly, just enough for Russia to see their impact and find ways to counter them. At the same time, he hasn't built a coalition in the US for Ukraine. Instead of people seeing it as a fight for freedom it's become a partisan issue. In the long term, when Ukraine is forced to settle for a bad peace, Biden will go down in history as the person who is responsible.2. He lost Afghanistan with a withdrawal that made no sense. A slower withdrawal, air and logistical support for the Afghan forces, perhaps leaving behind a few hundred soldiers, would have been enough to stabilize the situation. Instead, Afghanistan is back to where it was in September 2001. The next time the Taliban attacks the US, the next 9/11 we have, it will be Biden we will all remember.3. The US response to Gaza has been total impotence. The US hasn't been able to control the situation, to reign in either Israel or Iran's proxies. Even worse, the Houthi have disrupted global trade. Despite a massive military budget, the US navy is sitting there uselessly.4. The US economy suffered significant inflation. It's recovered on paper, but a lot of people don't feel like the economy is working for them anymore. Biden created a recovery for the top, not for the average person.5. Daycare has become a disaster in the US. Biden gave daycares money, getting them to change their cost structure to depend on it. Then, he didn't renew it. That resulted in large increases and big shortages.6. The COVID recovery happened because of scientists who made the vaccine. Not because of Biden. Everyone with access to the vaccines recovered.7. Among his many \\"wonderful\\" bills are massive handouts to the rich. The CHIPs act gave away $280 billion to the richest corporations in the world. Yeah, it generated a few thousand jobs. We would have been better giving people cash to sit at home than wasting this much money. On top of it all, rich companies took the money and still fired lots of people; see Intel recently.I should say, I hate Trump. I wouldn't vote for him. But that's because Trump is so horrible, not because Biden was a good president. He's been quite terrible for the world and for the US.","title":"CMV: Joe Biden will go down in history as the best democratic president since LBJ"},{"text":"If Kamala is so dumb, how did she manage to kick Trump's ass during the debate?","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Stuck on Repeat in Teleprompter Glitch"},{"text":"In other press releases:Sept 30 - [EPA Announces Start of Asbestos Cleanup at the Illinois Cabinet Site in Rockford, Illinois](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-start-asbestos-cleanup-illinois-cabinet-site-rockford-illinois)Oct 1 - [HUD Announces More Than $22 Million to Combat Housing Discrimination in America](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_259)Oct 1 - [EPA Announces $4 Million Funding Opportunity for Phosphorus Reduction Efforts in Western Lake Erie Basin](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-4-million-funding-opportunity-phosphorus-reduction-efforts-western-lake)&amp;nbsp;Enforcement:Sept 30 - [CBP officers seize over $210K in mixed narcotics at Eagle Pass Port of Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-officers-seize-over-210k-mixed-narcotics-eagle-pass-port-entry)Sept 30 - [CBP officers seize $17.4M in methamphetamine at Pharr International Bridge](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-officers-seize-174m-methamphetamine-pharr-international-bridge)Sept 30 - [Lab Owner Pleads Guilty to $14M COVID-19 Fraud Scheme](https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/lab-owner-pleads-guilty-to-14m-covid-19-fraud-scheme/)","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Invests in Rural Communities to Lower Energy Costs and Create Jobs in 34 States as Part of Investing in America Agenda | Projects Funded by President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act Strengthen American Farms and Rural Small Businesses"},{"text":"No.Why would someone making an uncoerced donation be fundamentally wrong?","title":"Would You Give Up Your Kidney for $50,000? | I mean, its one kidney.

Many of the projects are funded by President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act, the nations largest-ever investment in combating the climate crisis. The projects also advance President Bidens Investing in America Agenda to grow the nations economy from the middle out and the bottom up.Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA has invested more than $2.3 billion through REAP in 7,923 renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements. REAP enables agricultural producers and rural small business owners to expand their use of wind, solar, geothermal and small hydropower energy and make energy efficiency improvements. These innovations help them increase their income, grow their businesses and address climate change while lowering energy costs for American families.  \\n...  \\nUSDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. REAP is a part of the Presidents Justice40 Initiative which sets a goal that 40% of the benefits from certain federal investments go to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. USDA Rural Development supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care; and high-speed internet access in rural, tribal and high-poverty areas. Visit the Rural Data Gateway to learn how and where these investments are impacting rural America.\\n...An example list of recipients and the scope of their projects is in the press release, link to full list at the end of it. Statement from Deputy Secretary Torres Small:As drivers of our economy, farmers and rural business owners deserve affordable energy, Deputy Secretary Torres Small said. Thats why, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Investing in America Agenda, Im proud to announce an additional $104 million in REAP loans and grants that will lower energy costs for farmers and small business and help them expand their operations, all while tackling climate change.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Invests in Rural Communities to Lower Energy Costs and Create Jobs in 34 States as Part of Investing in America Agenda | Projects Funded by President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act Strengthen American Farms and Rural Small Businesses"},{"text":"Kamala is dumber than a rock.

This then has the unfortunate effect of making valid criticism seem antisemitic too. It wouldn't surprise me if Likud and Netanyahu actually boosted a lot of the antisemitic left alongside the right in the US precisely for this reason. Why? Because the biggest threat to Likud's and Netanyahu's plans with Gaza and the West Bank is a moderate left US government. By amplifying the antisemitic left it drowns out reasonable criticism while also making it more likely to be interpreted as antisemitic. Based on the recent DoJ indictments, we know Russia already does something similar to boost divisions in the US.To use something else as an example: When Star Wars: The Last Jedi released there was a lot of unreasonable criticism of that movie from the anti-woke crowd. This had the effect of drowning out any sort of reasonable criticism of the movie, such as what happened with Finn's character and the whole Canto Bight sequence, because it'd get grouped in with all the unreasonable criticism. As an aside: It turns out The Last Jedi was the best of the sequel trilogy. Rian Johnson really got screwed with how Disney and JJ Abrams handled the sequel trilogy. I think if there was a plan and/or Rian Johnson did all three sequel movies, we would've had something special.","title":"Biden Gives Shocking Answer on Potential Israeli Election Interference: Did Joe Biden just admit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be trying to kick Democrats out of the White House?"},{"text":"Were literally living in the fucking 1800s anymore with how bullshit and corrupt this party has become.

Then let's say Trump also 100% wants to remain in office in perpetuity. *Even if* both of those things are true, he'd have to: 1. have some means of enforcing that. which means the entire justice system, from your local small-town constable all the way thru the judiciary, at every level, would have to step in line. This seems, at best, far-fetched. 2. he'd likely also need the military to allow themselves to go along w/ a tyrant. not just at the executive levels of the military, but the everyday Joe reservists. They'd have to be willing to engage resisting citizens with force. Also seems far-fetched. 3. The international community would need to willingly acknowledge his new tyranny as legitimate and continue engaging the US as if nothing at all went wrong. Which makes the military alignment an \\"and\\", otherwise, here comes Iran, China, Russia, probably NATO countries, probably India. In fact, there's likely a case to be made that the US going tyrant mode does more to unite NATO and non-NATO countries than anything previous.  4.

And these other countries dont have the same gun violence issues as us. And these countries are much more liberal than democrats here in America. These countries have very high taxes on the wealthy, on business, free healthcare and college and other popular socialist policies. So we have two options as Americans. 1. We deny evidence that strict rules and lower gun ownership rates lower gun violence and just chalk it up to we Americans are for whatever reason more prone to violence and mental health issues Or 2.

One a student from my class asked why we needed to know some absurd integrations that nowdays comeputers do in seconds and we were taking half the class to do 1 calculation right. The answer was pretty much: to be a challenge; so you can practice harder stuff so easier stuff gets even easier; to open your mind; to change the threshhold; and to set the bar and, if necessary, exclude some peers into other areas that they will succeed. (or something along those lines) And I thought a lot about it.The whole educational system is a way to teach people to engane into challenging activities AND being social. Even if my father was a teacher and he thought me the same lesson, I bet doing it in school with time pressure, with surrounding disturbance, getting evaluated, sometimes failing and learning to deal with it... I think the one thing that school teach the best if to deal with adversities. We do not win everyday in our life, actually, we rarely win, we mostly tie and sometimes lose. One of the few if not the only ways to slowly getting this idea of challenge into kids for example are through school and test and activities and dealing with people they don't like and following rules and orders and keeping promises and commiting to stuff... this is a type of knowledge that outplays the \\"social interaction\\" in my opinion. Learning to deal with adversities is essential to grow into someone that is a function adult and that can take risks and deal with the outcomes on their own. We are risking creating a generation of people that can't deal with the outcomes of their own decisions when we are too bland and ok and we take all the responsability from them.

Yes the traditional economic indicators look good. If the numbers look good but people are experientially struggling, that should tell us that were measuring the wrong numbers. Not that people are imagining their own experiences. GDP growth is well and good, but where is that additional wealth going? Proportionally to all of our society or just funneling to the top? Low unemployment is well and good, but are those jobs paying enough for people to make a living on 40 hours a week?Look - I understand that the economy is a lagging indicator. Its stupid that the President gets the blame or credit for how the economy is now, when in reality economic policy now will affect the economy in 5-10 years.

In 2016, January 6th hadn't happened. In 2016, Project 2025 wasn't published. We're in a completely different world than 2016, at this point, and as such, the comparison will always be stupid.

Number of bills isn't a good representation of how meaningful legislation is. Does the fact that \\"To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 5302 Galveston Road in Houston, Texas, as the Vanessa Guilln Post Office Building\\" bill passed really make the legislation from Biden's session 0.2% more meaningful just because it's another bill passed? I'd also point out a President has limited power over the senate and bills passed aren't automatically down to the President. For something like Infrastrucutre bill by our can give Biden a fair portion of credit, but at the same time it's also fairly basic bread and butter governance. Countries need infrastructure and have to pay for it. Biden allocated a bigger slice to infrastructure. I don't think any of your examples are transformational ones like the Affordable Care Act or the Don't Ask Don't Tell repeal which make a substantial difference in people's lives and rights, let alone coming close to LBJ's civil rights act.2. With Ukraine Biden didn't take any notable steps to deter Putin when he arrayed his forces on Ukraine's border and prepared for war. He's donated since then, but that's both too late and hasn't resulted in anything other than a grinding stalemate which costs the US billions.For the I/P conflict, it is without question that Israel is committing an array of war crimes and human rights abuses, though the exact tally of some of the worst crimes (e.g. is genocide amongst them) is disputable. It is also clear that the USA is supporting them to do so. This is morally wrong and puts Biden firmly on the wrong side of history and is strategically unjustifiable. We have had decades where Islamic fundamentalist terrorism has been a core concern in geopolitics and Biden has decided to he wants to show that the USA is supportive of war crimes against Arabs. He's providing the impetus for the next four decades of Islamic terror groups.3. The economy isn't everything. The US is also one of the worst countries in terms of COVID death toll, which is in large part due to spikes which happened during Biden's presidency.

This is because inflation incorporates quality improvements. A house may double in price, but it will show up as only increasing a small amount if square footage has increased, the windows are more efficient at climate control, the blinds are now connected to Alexa and can power open, etc. If there are few houses on the market that are equivalent to the 1984 house that the CPI references, then people may be paying more than they are willing. This is true for most manufactured goods.Second, the composition of peoples expenditures naturally changes over their life cycle as their needs change. For someone less than ~50, their needs (not their wants) will grow by 1-2% per year.   Furthermore, people tend to purchase higher quality items as they age, further masking the true inflation rate from their perspective. Therefore, the real wage needs to grow faster for them to break even. This is true even without extreme inflation, but the recent inflation has caused people to confuse natural life cycle expenditure growth with overall inflation.","title":"CMV: People are letting Politics and Social Media ruin a pretty good economic run"},{"text":"We all know his brain is the moldy expired swiss cheese knocking around in the back of the refrigerator.

The passport collection drive, carried out under what is known as personal travel abroad management, allows local government officials to control and monitor who can travel abroad, how often and to where. It comes as Xi steps up state involvement in everyday life and clamps down on official corruption. Chinas powerful state security apparatus has also intensified its campaign against foreign espionage. Interviews with more than a dozen Chinese public sector workers and notices from education bureaus in half a dozen cities show restrictions on international travel have been greatly expanded from last year to include rank-and-file employees of schools, universities, local governments and state-owned groups. All teachers and public sector employees were told to hand in our passports, said a primary school teacher in a major city in the western province of Sichuan. If we want to travel abroad, we have to apply to the city education bureau and I dont think it will be approved, said the teacher, asking that they and their city not be named. Teachers in Yichang in the central province of Hubei and in another city in neighbouring Anhui province told the Financial Times they had also been told to hand in their travel documents. This summer, in the weeks ahead of the school year start, educators in Guangdong, Jiangsu and Henan provinces complained on social media of being forced to hand in their travel documents. I was an English major, my life-long dream is to visit an English-speaking country, but it feels like that is about to be shattered, posted one Henan teacher to social media site Xiaohongshu. The passport collection appears to be based on national regulations from 2003 that established a system to restrict travel for key personnel such as mid- to high-level officials and allowed local authorities to set rules for all state employees international travel. Residents of restive regions such as Tibet lost their freedom to travel more than a decade ago. Starting in the mid-2010s, some areas applied personal travel abroad management rules to local teachers. Last year, after pandemic-era travel restrictions were lifted, more education bureaus began to introduce teacher travel restrictions and stepped them up this summer. Chinas ruling Communist party has long prioritised instilling loyalty in students and has made the political education of teachers central to those efforts. Pre-travel instructions for teachers in the eastern city of Wenzhou indicates local authorities are concerned about the ideas they would encounter outside the country. Educators travelling abroad must not have contact with the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement or other hostile foreign forces, according to instructions published by Wenzhous Ouhai district education bureau in March on the districts website along with the new teacher travel restrictions.  The district demanded that all public pre-school, primary school and secondary school teachers hand in their passports and said their names would be registered with the public security bureaus border control unit. To travel abroad, teachers must file applications with their schools and would generally be restricted to a single trip of less than 20 days each year, the district notice said. Teachers who refused to hand in their passports or who travelled abroad without permission would be subject to criticism and education or referred to Chinas anti-corruption authority, depending on the severity of their case, the notice said. Offenders would also be barred from travel for two to five years. The restrictions on staff at state-owned enterprises appear to be connected to a growing campaign to root out foreign espionage. An entry-level salesperson at a bank in Nanjing said she was told to hand in her passport when she joined the state-owned group last year. After quitting in March, she had to wait six months for a de-secrecy process before she was able to retrieve it. In central Hunan province, a mid-level official at a local government investment fund said he gained approval from nine different departments for a holiday abroad but still could not retrieve his passport.  No one would tell me what exactly was needed to get my passport back, he said. The restrictions are hitting retirees as well. A 76-year-old who retired from a state-owned aircraft maker more than 10 years ago said his former employer took his passport back this year for security reasons and barred him from visiting family abroad. I have no access to sensitive information and I am a patriot, he said. My former employer has no reason to keep me from visiting my grandson. Chinas foreign ministry said it was not aware of the situation and referred questions to the relevant authorities. The education bureaus in Sichuan, Yichang, Anhui, Wenzhou, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Henan did not respond to requests for comment.","title":"China demands schoolteachers hand in their passports"},{"text":"what a stupid headline.

What could it cost? [J. Demsas]"},{"text":" Kidney disease is the eighth-leading cause of death in the United States. Since 1998, more than 100,000 Americans have died while on a kidney waiting list. And by 2030, more than 1 million people are projected to be suffering from kidney failure. The cure for kidney failure is a new kidney. But finding a donor kidney is an arduous process. After all, its a lot to askthe testing and screening before a donation, a surgery, and then the recovery. Most donor kidneys come from friends and family; just a small number come from altruistic donors. And despite advancements in making the surgery safer and research showing that the risks are minimal, unsurprisingly very few people are willing to take that step. In most situations where an important good is in short supply, prices go up, spurring more production. But its illegal to provide compensation for kidneys in the United States. Sometimes donors can get assistance with covering lost wages or travel, but that doesnt come close to compensating people for the time, pain, and risks associated with kidney donation. On todays episode of Good on Paper, Im joined by the Vox senior correspondent Dylan Matthews. Matthews himself donated a kidney to a stranger in 2016, after his research and writing on the issue led him to believe the risks were minimal and the potential benefit to a recipient was great. Hes reporting onand arguing for the passage ofthe End Kidney Deaths Act, which would provide $50,000 in fully refundable tax credits to kidney donors. You go into a hospital. You do something that is physically strenuous. You take time and effort out of your life to save someones life, and then you get nothing for it, he told me. Your surgeon gets something for it. Nurses get something for it. Everyone elseand it drives me particularly crazy when I hear transplant surgeons talk about how it undermines the altruism of the gift to compensate it. *Youre making $200,000 a year, and youre going to lecture me about how it undermines the altruism to get paid a few tens of thousands of dollars for saving someones life?* Like, *Go to hell.*!ping HEALTH-POLICY&amp;PHILOSOPHY","title":"Would You Give Up Your Kidney for $50,000? | I mean, its one kidney.

Thats the entire reason the fed just did a massive rate cut and suggested they planned on 6 more over the next year and a half. Current inflation rate is at 2.2% or something like that. Considering we literally increased our M1 money supply in 2020 by like 400%, the total 23% or so inflation weve gotten over the past few years has been pretty low - a much smaller shock in the 1970s and early 1980s led to 5% to 15% inflation year over year for almost a decadeWages always lag inflation a bit, but theyve been rising too.If youre under the impression prices or wages will go down, thats not how this works. That would be deflation and central banks **do not want that** because it has a ton of massive economic negatives - reduces the velocity of money, makes a recession or depression much, much more likely. Thats why even in normal years we have inflation at all - in a perfect world to central banks, inflation would be 0%, but the risk of a deflationary economy is too high, so they aim for 1% to 3% year over year, small, but with little risk of dipping into deflation.As for gas prices, they track global oil markets pretty much 1:1. The US is actually pumping more oil than ever before right now, this very moment. Prices are predicted to keep going down over Q4 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025 though due to oversupply (China needed less oil than anticipated IIRC). The US average gas price is definitely not anywhere near $5 per gallon though. It is currently around 3.30, which with inflation adjusted values, is pretty similar to gas prices we had in 2018 and 2019Happy to go over any of this more in depth, but long story short, we just weathered dumping in a metric fuckton of currency into our economy in 2020, and came out of it with fairly minimal scarring compared to the last major inflationary event we experienced in US history (oil shocks of the 70s &amp; 80s, with the aforementioned 5-15% inflation PER YEAR for 10 years)","title":"CMV: Elon Musk speaking at a Trump Rally in PA is the greatest gift you could possibly give to the Democratic Party."},{"text":"Are there any Canadians willing to register to vote for Harris?

One was not get found liable for 787.5 million dollars),  but when Biden was the candidate for re-election the data showed he wasnt losing support with NYT, Politico, CNN type consumers as much as they can be annoying with their political coverage, but rather the voters that are essentially tuned out of the news.  I guess the point-being is the main-issue is the massive amount of low-information voters that exist in this country.  See https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/22/poll-economy-recession-biden for an example of this. The Trump campaigns strategy is to go after low-info voters or people that may never or not often vote at all.  The media landscape has changed significantly in just the last 5-10 years in terms of where people get their news from (if it at all).  Its more diversified and legacy media outlets dont have as much of a grip at the macro-level.  A lot of people get their news from what their friends and family share or tell them and so its important to share news articles on the election with friends and families where one may think it is useful.","title":"Sen.

I'm talking about Westernised Black intellectuals.They viewed the British Empire as a global community, transcending ethnicity and tribal wars, founded on common language, religion and on modern science, still basking in the glory of its singular achievement of ending slavery. Whatever mistakes the Empire had made (which were not necessarily well publicised at times), that was then and this was now. A new century. Time to unite peoples from across the world in a common enterprise as civilised men.The ideals of nationalism and self determination emerge in response to the abject failure of their initial globalist ideals. Suddenly there's a realisation that people in London hundreds of miles away really don't care and can't help. That you can't trust your security to being a cog in some glorious machine. You need self determination.People have been shocked when I say that I see colonialism and imperialism as having a globalist character to them. I get why, because nationalism has been defined to be Hitler and globalism John Lennon's _Imagine_. But the nation state as a political idea is _not_ the old thing which caused all the old terror of eras long gone. The nation state is a newer idea which emerged precisely in response to the terrors wrought by people who wanted to build governments and institutions that were truly global.Thinking that you should run global governments is not a new idea which has yet to be tried. It is one of the oldest in the world and it has caused a lot of damage. And _while people were doing it_ they often did feel it was enlightened.Isn't this the same story on which the United States itself was founded? A realisation that self determination matters more than belonging to some glorious and better whole?Nationalism, when it means respecting sovereignty, borders and self determination, can be a good thing in the same way federalism can be better than a unitary state sometimes.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If Kamala wins, we should get to do just a little police union busting as a treat","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Still more credible than Mr statistics are just fancy numbers","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"in LA theres an oct 7 museum w video footage of hamas confronting festival goers. they said Where are the soldiers.

Heterosexual candidates literally never stop telling us that they're straight, either, so a gay candidate having that much of a hang-up about the topic is at least a red flag, as to me that speaks of a more deep-seated character flaw. How can you stand up for others if you won't even stand up for yourself? There's obviously also the blackmailing angle that others have already mentioned. Going into politics is a choice.

But still, if you know any Ukrainians who have fled the war, you will know that they are incredibly quick to attack anyone who doesn't embrace Ukrainian culture.
