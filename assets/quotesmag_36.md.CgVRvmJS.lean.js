Harriss team did a very good job helping her reach out to the rest of the party to secure herself as the partys choice. Convincing all of the many influential voices in the party to rally behind her is a pretty big challenge that she arguably did very well. It would have been career suicide for other dems to try and go against the establishment choise that close to the election, so that doesn't matter. Even then, Pelosi heavily pushed for an open convention, but again, no one wanted to risk the potential backlash.I didnt say that she ran a better or worse campaign, anyways. She lost, so it would be dumb for me to argue she had a better campaign. I just meant in terms of convincing a lot of very scared, unsure voters that she could win, and kept up that image by not making too many public mistakes. A big deal given that democrats all around the country really had a very tenuous alliance, as they were all kinda forced into this situation they didnt plan for and tried to make it work. Never said you did. I said you can't call it an almost perfect campaign when her stragedy was flawed. Doesn't matter how well you execute a plan that will never be successful. It is like drawing up a perfect final play for an open dunk when you are down by 3 and still missing the dunk. For the record, I think they both had terrible campaigns, Harris' was slightly better though, not that it mattered to the audience she was trying to reach.I was talking about how her chances may have been better or worse under hypothetical circumstances, not comparing hers to any other election. I was solely talking about this one and what some of the factors were, how she played into those factors, how consistent she was in rallying voters and party members alike across the country. Evidently, she didn't rally voters, and I have already mentioned how it was going to be career suicide for most people not to rally behind her. and with so many dems and others staying home this time instead of coming out for her, that doesnt conclusively mean her campaign wasnt workingYes, that is what that means. For the rest of your comment, you went so needlessly in depth with how she could have infiltrated the right wing media space better to reach out to those voters, and you didn't try analyse how she could have motivated her own base to try and go out to vote or tried to analyse why they didn't want to vote in the first place.It doesn't matter if she got the right message across to right-wing voting people.

Fulfilling that dual charge is impossible unless business people are more concerned about the good of consumers than they are about profiting business owners. Of course, officers of a business  have a legal duty to serve business owners.Anyway, the conflict was inherent from the start. And consumers tend not to out-bribe businesses or to out-perform businesses in the \\"revolving door\\" job game. So the inherent conflict got resolved against consumers.  On their respective websites and through their other communications to the public, agencies like the FTC tend to emphasize consumer protection, sometimes to a deceptive degree. However, unfair trade practices of Business A disadvantage both consumers and all businesses that do not engage in those unfair trade practices.  For example, actions against trademark infringement protect the interests of Calvin Klein as much or more than they protect consumers from confusion as to what is or is not a product approved by Calvin Klein. They also protect, as they should, businesses that do not abuse Calvin Klein trademarks. But the dual charge set up an inherent conflict from the start that was soon resolved against the best interests of consumers.","title":"Trump just appointed RFKjr to run HHS."},{"text":"Wages have increased faster than the rate of inflation for the last 18 months.

I know people close to me who had life-changing surgeries, that were considered on the non-essential spectrum. Not transgender surgeries, but not plastic surgeries, they were body deformity correction surgeries wherein the consensus was that they were non-essential (doctors tend to be conservative with these things). I cannot, in good conscience, condemn someone who got cancer or something to bankruptcy just because my other friend has to find ways to finance what I found to be genuinely important surgeries in other places. So for me, I view transgender surgeries the same way. For some individual people, it is very important, I don't deny that, and my political stance on it's funding isn't to discredit that. But at the end of the day it is not life threatening anymore than other body deformities/incongruencies are (threatening suicide doesn't count, because mental disorders are their own issue), and I would be equally, fanatically pissed at my friend if that person played the same gatekeeping role and effectively blocked relief for those with medical debt. There is a very powerful argument to be made on universal morality that no human being should go bankrupt over medical debt. Even many groups that usually shy away from the issue, like conservative Christians, could be shamed into supporting it if the issue was clear cut that way. But every time less relevant variables get added on, support is divided and lost.","title":"\\"Krystal And Saagar DEBATE Trans 2024 Importance\\" - Great example of culture war suppressing economic populism"},{"text":"Trump told Israel to finish the job.

It isn't sentient enough to find what the right moral framework is or understand what the goal of \\"politics\\" should even be.There are layers to this. There's no one correct policy in any situation. It depends on what angle you're viewing it from.Democracies are also not conducive to producing an ideal political system. There's nuance to this of course, because the ideal political system is subjective, depending on how you define the success of a civilization. We often define it by economic performance today. Some historians might define it as sustained political stability. Others might define it by average happiness...So there's nuance here. But either way, a democratic leader must appeal to the masses. The masses are simply not smart enough to understand a complex political or philosophical argument so a lot of political rhetoric has to be dumbed down. This is why a lot of Greeks believed in aristocracy, or the Romans believed in limited suffrage. Consider reading \\"The Prince\\" for example (or any historic political literature before widespread suffrage) vs reading policy plans of a major political party today. The political theory today is much more shallow - because it has to be for the masses to be able to understand it, and for the leader to be voted for.The internet, with which AI is trained on, only exists in a time period where almost every country in the world falls under a democratic system. So its comprehension of politics is equally as shallow as the politics of the society it's taking its data from.AI might be able to argue social security plan A vs social security plan B if left to \\"solve a social security problem\\". But if given this prompt, it's unlikely to consider that the problem might be more deeply rooted in the economic system of the country as a whole. It's unlikely to even consider if the problem needs solving in the first place, and whether social inequality is a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" thing.There are layers of political thought that it just simply won't explore... because we don't explore it today.","title":"CMV: We should replace all politicians with blockchain-backed AI language models."},{"text":"The Democratic campaigns were not run on progressive policies.

Harriss team did a very good job helping her reach out to the rest of the party to secure herself as the partys choice. Convincing all of the many influential voices in the party to rally behind her is a pretty big challenge that she arguably did very well. I didnt say that she ran a better or worse campaign, anyways. She lost, so it would be dumb for me to argue she had a better campaign. I just meant in terms of convincing a lot of very scared, unsure voters that she could win, and kept up that image by not making too many public mistakes. A big deal given that democrats all around the country really had a very tenuous alliance, as they were all kinda forced into this situation they didnt plan for and tried to make it work. I was talking about how her chances may have been better or worse under hypothetical circumstances, not comparing hers to any other election. I was solely talking about this one and what some of the factors were, how she played into those factors, how consistent she was in rallying voters and party members alike across the country. Messaging wasnt the only issue. She could have done that better too, I agree. I think thats less of a problem than the fact that she didnt have really any presence at all in these online, alternative media spaces that leaned right and other right wing media outlets. The odds were crazy stacked against her when you look at the data I was talking about and see how little exposure her ideas even had with Trump voters, and how much those people *liked* her policies. But anyways, I do think she ran a really good race for what it was worth. she didnt make many egregious mistakes that could sink such a delicate electoral position as what she found herself in a few months ago. She did a great job of taking that small chance and coming as close as she could to victory. For all we know, she may have done much much worse if she hadnt run it so smoothly and by the books. It didnt turn out to work so well after all, but theres a lot of factors that werent in Harris control, and I think she did a great job in spite of those things. But the fact that even after everything that happened with the campaign, and with so many dems and others staying home this time instead of coming out for her, that doesnt conclusively mean her campaign wasnt working. Especially not when factoring in the fact that every incumbent party in power during the inflation spike a few years ago lost power in every nation around the world. If she had run from the start and even did half as well as she ended up doing, she could have had a chance to reach a lot more people with her message. A lot of her policies were incredibly popular, and she represented them well to those who were paying attention and listening. The Dems did not perhaps have the best messaging strategies overall, Ill grant you that, but a much larger factor seems to have been the reactions to inflation and the lack of channels by which Trumps voters were exposed to Harriss ideas and policies.  Its just an anecdote, but I couldnt tell you how many ads I saw against Harris that just straight up lied about her policies and views to viewers. Just like we see on Fox News and virtually every other part of the conservative media ecosystem. These people might have been willing to listen to Harriss policies if the people they trusted as their sources of information were good faith enough to share it with them unfiltered and un-doctored. Its insane. If Harris, Walz, and Buttigieg all went on Joe Rogan  in the week leading up to the election, maybe they would have been able to reach those people. Maybe that would have been enough to tip the scales towards a much closer result or even a a victory for her. But yeah. She did run a good campaign, and she had a great plan ready for everyone that people broadly would have accepted and supported. Had she been the presumptive nominee form this time last year and had the whole year off as VP to campaign against Trump and find ways to reach into that right wing media sphere, I bet she would have been willing to. It probably would have gone great for her. If she had more time, I imagine its very possible that she could have figured out the need to reach into that media space and get her platform message out to those voters.","title":"John Oliver slams Democrats who think transgender people lost them the election"},{"text":"The next 4 years won't be crickets.

Senators on the Human Rights Committee have redoubled their calls on the Liberal government and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc (Beausjour, N.B.) to answer for the systems failures, and to address outstanding recommendations outlined in their 2021 report on prisons.

The minister and Edmonton MP has been tied up in multiple probes into past business dealings for months.

You're insulting their god and they will not stand for it. I used to think Pro-Vaccers weighed the pros and cons of the technology and concluded the pros outweighed the cons. Then I learned they don't know jack about medicine, medical technology, vaccines, vaccine history, clean bowl theory, the advent of over the counter medicine, or anything surrounding the topic. Like the Far Left they have mantras and they will repeat them without a thought behind them.Then when something contradicts their ideology emerges they'll shout it down or ignore it. Let me give you a huge example. The three measles epidemics in the US. Measles hasn't been deadly in decades thanks to over the counter medicine and a cleaner environment. You get hives, deal with it for a bit, and then get better. We're not living in an era where the common cold was a death sentence or a serious concern.Well the Pro-Vaccers blamed the Anti Vaccers for the epidemics. Until scientists tracked down the origin of all three outbreaks with DNA analysis. Turned out the Measles Vaccine, once again (yes this is an ongoing issue) had live cultures in them. So the vaccinated got measles. Spread it amongst the vaccinated. Then eventually it reached the unvaccinated. With this revelation silence. No, \\"hey we need to increase standards for vaccine production\\" or \\"hey that medical companies cannot be held liable for shoddy products is creating an environment where they don't care if the product is shoddy.\\" Just, muh vaccine.Let's look at Autism. The US government's own lead scientist was fired when he came forward and said the government suppressed his research and lied before the vaccine court. Now he split hairs, but this is what he said. Vaccines don't cause autism. They cause neural swelling and the neural swelling causes autism. When Congress was going to hold hearings on the issue of corruption, they aborted the hearings the day of because their legal council advised them everyone involved would be facing serious prison time.Then there is the issue of microcontaminates. The insert that comes with the vaccine flat out says it doesn't work, and it comes with a myriad of side effects. Historical graphs showing only the Rabies vaccines ever curb the death rates or brought a decline to disease. I'm glad RFK JR is going to play a pivotal role in fixing these issues over the next four years. I don't agree with half of what he says, but he is well aware of the issues facing the food and drug industries.","title":"President Trump has decided to withdraw the USA from the World Health Organisation and the Pandemic Preparedness Treaty, criticising them as corrupt entities that threaten free speech and national sovereignty.

I also think it will be difficult to draw sweeping lessons from this election. A lot of Trump voters were mad about inflation. However, the problem is that Trumps stated policies would increase inflation (not to mention his previous policies contributed to it). He repeatedly said he would bring prices down using tariffs. Economists said tariffs would increase prices. A two minute google search would give a definition of tariffs gives a definition that would make most people draw the conclusion they would raise prices. The google search what is a tariff and who pays for it spiked after Trump won the election.Not many flattering conclusions can be drawn but honestly it just raises a lot of questions. Why with instant access to information did people not bother to look this up? Trump commonly makes promises without specifying how would accomplish them, but in this case he did. For once, democrats didnt get overly wonky. They said tariffs are a sales tax on consumers. So why did they believe Trump over Harris? If they didnt hear Harris say it, why not (she said it over and over)? Theres been an affordability crisis in the United States thats effects have hurt the working class the worst. So, its easy to understand why people were angry. That isnt a big mystery. The real question is why did people believe Trump could solve these issues when the only real position he offered would only take a quick google search to get enough info to question it.Obviously there are many issues. This is just one but I think it shows that the answers are going to be more complex and multifaceted than people think. The one conclusion I think that can be drawn is that the democrats are a decade behind in their media strategy and need to catch up or the GOP will continue to dominate the sources of information where voters are.","title":"The lefts comforting myth about why Harris lost"},{"text":"So far, they arent doing that.

You make every move you can. You make the *best* move you can, because you don't know what will happen in the future. Donald Trump, who is of course a disastrous nightmare, nevertheless had nearly every sane person on the planet telling him he couldn't win and should drop out of the race in 2016 and then again in 2024. And then he won. You have to play the moves you can with the board as it is. **Surviving past scandals and trials doesn't mean you're more likely to survive future scandals and trials.**I get it. Trump gets away with everything. Because he's lucky. Because our system doesn't like holding the wealthy accountable.It is very easy to get into a mindset of nothing mattering. But that's not really how the world works. You don't become \\"more immune\\" to things over time. You have to throw everything you can at your opponent because you do not know what will stick. Voters - clearly - don't think like you or I. Do you remember \\"weird?\\" After 10 years of every name under the sun, \\"weird\\" became a HUGE source of ire to the right.It may not make sense to you. But you try. And if you want to piss and moan and put your head in your hands and claim all is lost, I just don't have patience for it. If you're here, play the game. Learn from the past. Do better in the future. Or lay down and let the boots trample over you.Every authoritarian falls sooner or later. Donald Trump's first presidency was a fucking disaster that resulted in most of his administration being sent to jail, and him *very nearly* being sent to jail. It wasn't a success. He got nothing done. He revealed a profound streak of incompetence that left him devastatingly vulnerable. He ran a terrible campaign in 2024. But he had a lot of help from a lot of the world's worst people like Putin and Netanyahu and China, all of whom clearly put their fingers on the scale to tip things in his direction. We all know that. And Democrats made a lot of missteps. So Trump's success isn't some kind of magic power. He is just, as he always has been, a very useful idiot for a lot of very powerful and very malevolent people. And sure. A lot of fucking goons are going to try and insulate him this time. But he himself is even older, even stupider, and even slower than the first time. And we know his game now. We know his plans. So play every move. Play until you can't. That's how everything in this world works. Life is just a series of problems you solve until you die. So do what you're made to do.","title":"Democratic senators call for probe into Musk's Russia calls"},{"text":"Also kind of ironic that Kamala did better than him in his home state","title":"Bernie Sanders Says Democrats Have Lost Their Way"},{"text":" Shitting on the rich is popular.

The obvious explanation is \\"follow the money,\\" the enormous amount invested in wi-fi and other tech, and captured regulatory agencies.

His ideas shaped much of our political culture and our capitalist system, including some of the ways in which our actual system of government would need to behave to keep his own vision of a capitalist system in check. Ive been learning about the guy recently. He understood many of these problems regarding the nature of governments, how they interact with people of extreme wealth and influence, social stratification and division, and so on. Like many others from that time, he understood a lot for the time he lived in. Men of his era never could have predicted things like this though. They warned against even many of their own ideas, though, and Smith was one of many who expressed caution about concentration of power and wealth, and of the need to check those forces for the greater good. I really think he would be sick today to know how people on the right who have gone and created all of his worst fears about the ideas he himself set forth. Perhaps hed be impressed still by how long his ideas had endured, but still. He very strongly opposed wealthy folks who didnt use their wealth or power responsibly, or acted selfishly, in fact. He thought it was a moral duty for those with those privileges to look after their fellow man, and criticized any idea or person who didnt agree with that. If he came back to the present day and learned how his ideas have been twisted and misrepresented by greedy men of power and privilege hed be devastated. His ideas of free markets and minimal government intervention have been weaponized and used to convince the laboring masses to destroy our liberal democracy and turn us into an oligarchy.

It was a campaign of domestic terrorism and fear based control. Something started in 2000, or maybe the decade before that. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dark_WinterQuote from UNZ:**The handful of anthrax letters had only killed five Americans and sickened 17 more, a tiny sliver of the 9/11 casualties, and the last envelope sent had been postmarked on October 17, 2001.** But I think the impact upon American public opinion during the year or two that followed was fully comparable to that of the massive physical attacks we had suffered a few weeks earlier, or perhaps even greater. **For all the death and destruction inflicted on 9/11, without the subsequent anthrax mailings, the Patriot Act would never have passed Congress in anything like its final form, while President Bush might not have gained sufficient public support to launch his disastrous Iraq War.**The anthrax mailings were almost totally forgotten within just a few years and today my suggestion that their impact had matched or even exceeded that of the 9/11 Attacks themselves might seem utterly preposterous to most Americans, but when I recently reviewed the articles of that period, I discovered that I had hardly been alone in that appraisal.Renowned investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald was just beginning his career, joining Salon in 2007. He soon began publishing a number of columns on the anthrax case, with one of the first including this paragraph near the beginning:The 2001 anthrax attacks remain one of the great mysteries of the post-9/11 era. After 9/11 itself, the anthrax attacks were probably the most consequential event of the Bush presidency. One could make a persuasive case that they were actually more consequential. The 9/11 attacks were obviously traumatic for the country, but in the absence of the anthrax attacks, 9/11 could easily have been perceived as a single, isolated event. It was really the anthrax letters  with the first one sent on September 18, just one week after 9/11  that severely ratcheted up the fear levels and created the climate that would dominate in this country for the next several years after. It was anthrax  sent directly into the heart of the countrys elite political and media institutions, to then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD), Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt), NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, and other leading media outlets  that created the impression that social order itself was genuinely threatened by Islamic radicalism...There were also some very direct consequences [of the anthrax attacks]. American government support for biodefense had been strong under Clinton, then sharply reduced once Bush came into office. **But those few deadly envelopes changed everything, and during the years 2002-2011, our government spent an estimated $70 billion on biowarfare and biodefense, vastly more than ever before. These days our total biowarfare outlays have far surpassed the hundred billion dollar mark, but almost all of that gusher of funding was triggered by a handful of envelopes bearing $0.23 stamps.** During September 2001, a biological defense contractor named BioPort was on the verge of collapse and bankruptcy, but **once the mailings reached the headlines, the company was saved by a flood of anthrax-vaccine government contracts; later renamed Emergent BioSolutions, it played a controversial role in the production of our Covid vaccines nearly twenty years later.**","title":"9/11 Truth at an Inflection Point?"},{"text":"yes, true but whats the baseline for AZ anymore? i have no clue. in a world without Trump it seems to lean blue but maybe if the GOP wasnt insane it would still be red","title":"Ruben Gallego has a blueprint to win Latino men.

Yes our arm's really help them but thinking that a two months halt on sending Israel bombs would force Israel to stop is naive at best. \\nThe military aid the US provides enables this genocide. The effect of Biden's lack of enforcing his own ultimatums inflames it.\\nA rough sense of the overall importance of US aid to the Israeli war effort can be developed by comparing the $14 billion in military aid proposed by the Biden administration with an estimate by the Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist, first reported by Reuters. Calcalist estimates that the conflict in Gaza will cost Tel Aviv roughly $50 billion if it goes on for eight to 12 months.If the Calcalist estimate is on the mark, that would mean that if the $14 billion in proposed US aid is approved and disbursed over the next year, it would account for just over one-quarter of the total cost of the war to Israel. About half of the estimate$25 billionrepresents direct military costs, with the additional costs related to negative economic impacts of the war, compensation for businesses, and reconstruction. If US aid is compared only to the estimate of direct military costs of the war, it would amount to more than half of relevant expenditures. No estimate made in the midst of an ongoing conflict will be entirely accurate, but what we do know suggests that US tax dollars are a major factor in sustaining the Israeli war effort.\\nThe role of US-supplied weapons may be even more important than the question of how much of the costs of the war would be paid for with American tax dollars. The United States has been Israels principal arms supplier since the nations inceptionsupplying military aid to the tune of $124 billion over that time period before adjusting for inflation. Washington is currently in the fifth year of a 10-year $38 billion military aid commitment to Tel Aviv, or $3.8 billion per year. This annual figure will be dwarfed by the $14 billion in military aid contained in the administrations pending emergency aid request. The types of weaponry in the package include large quantities of bombs and tens of thousands of 155mm artillery shells that can be put straight to use in the Gaza war. A recent policy brief by Oxfam noted that the supply of artillery shells is particularly problematic...-[Israels War in Gaza, Subsidized by the USA](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/us-aid-israel-gaza/)The war could end tomorrow if Hamas and Hezbollah both left Gaza and Lebanon. Until they do that I doubt Israel is going to stop.This is a bad faith argument considering Hamas has already accepted Biden's peace proposals, and the fact [Netanyahu has funded them for years](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/).\\nIn Gaza they elected Hamas as their government. Hamas elected by the people then went and committed a act of War against Israel. \\nThe majority of the civilians being slaughtered didn't exist or weren't old enough to vote for in that long past election. However, it wouldn't excuse their murder if they did\\nIsrael is in the same mindset right now.\\nIn light of Israeli atrocities, comparisons to WWII do them no favors.","title":"Biden now has his best opening to end Israels war on Gaza C and wont use it"},{"text":"He literally is president now.

The standard of \\"objective\\" journalism were developed during an era of print media where newspapers had classified ads, subscriber revenue, and ad revenue to keep afloat. When coverage caused a company to pull its ads, newspapers could sustain themselves using the other two for a time until they could make up the shortfall. Early tv newsmen came from the print industry and nightly news was funded as a loss leader by the networks. Get people onto your channel and they will keep watching it, etc.Well, the internet killed classified ad revenue and replaced it with Craigslist, indeed, etc. Then people stopped paying for news because there were copious free sources out there. So the only thing left are ads, and advertisers demand eyeballs - so you get race to the bottom clickbait trash. And all those legacy sources of news kept failing and failing. So what we have now is not bias towards the right or left, what we have is bias towards sensational bullshit over meaningful analysis. The only person who got punished when the Panama Papers were released was a journalist whom was murdered for it. Meanwhile, every single bit of nonsense that bubbles up on Twitter becomes national news. Remember when some right wing high school kids got in an argument with native American activists in Washington?

Trying to appeal to the progressive lunatics is a losing strategy, EVEN in the primary. Harris adopted it in 2020, and lost in that primary because its a losing strategy. People are mad about the 2016 primary (STILL, eight years later) where a terrible candidate cleared the mainstream field and then got a scare put into her by a fringe leftist that no one had ever heard of, almost solely because she was such a terrible candidate that even Democratic primary voters were looking for any possible reason to vote against her. There was never a durable pro-Sanders leftist coalition (as he saw in 2020), there was just a ton of people who hated Hillary and wanted to vote for literally any alternative. The lesson is: Don't run terrible candidates as the only mainstream offerings! Hillary never should have been in that position, because she's an awful politician. If Biden or anyone else from the mainstream of the Democratic party had run, they would have mopped the floor with her and maybe not lost in the general.","title":"John Ganz: Party Under Country: Dissecting the Democratic Malaise"},{"text":"The republicans most definitely do that.And so do the democrats.

Debarment refers to exclusion from certain contracts and privileges.  \\n\\"These relationships between a well-known U.S. adversary and Mr. Musk, a beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. government funding, pose serious questions regarding Mr. Musk's reliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder,\\" the lawmakers said in a joint letter dated on Friday.Several Democratic lawmakers have publicly called for a probe into Musk's communications with Moscow since a Wall Street Journal report last month on the alleged contact, but the letter to the U.S. officials who could launch such an investigation has not been previously reported.The call by Shaheen and Reed for a federal probe is a longshot effort as Trump prepares to return to the White House with backing from Musk, who spent over $119 million on Trump's reelection campaign and was appointed co-head of the president-elect's forthcoming Department of Government Efficiency.SpaceX, Musk and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In many cases it would seem that the doctors are grappling with saving the child and the mother but lose them both. However, the question is, would they have gotten the D &amp; C sooner in a state without the ban. Really, what those articles need to include, in order to prove that the women died from the abortion ban, is the doctors that worked on the pregnant, deceased woman need to be quoted or admitting that, \\"She died because we could not offer life-saving support due to the abortion ban.\\" A few articles quote other doctors from other hospitals saying,that they feel delayed with life-saving support due to ban but never a doctor who worked on the stated case. In these articles it is also stated that the mothers wanted the baby, so why would the doctors do a D &amp; C with a heartbeat?  \\nI don't know. It is a tough call.

It sucks to say it but there's a lot of people (men, women, both white and various minorities) or just won't vote for a woman no matter who. And we already know there's plenty of racists out there who won't vote for a black man or woman either.Combine all those things and she just underperformed, while Trump kept his base and pulled in right leaning independents who likely fell into the above camps. The economy is strong and Democrats were too afraid to tout that when inflation had groceries up and Republicans just got to run the narrative that Biden/Harris's \\"disastrous economic policies\\" were destroying the nation-- when they were clearly working and lifting us out of the post-Covid recession.If she had been a candidate from earlier in the year with Biden bowing out, maybe she could have had more time to see what paths to take and not go all in on the Republican voter appeal but we'll never know if that would have changed anything. I lay most of the blame on Biden not dropping out earlier when it was clear he wasn't up to running.That and once again Dems (and the media) completely failed to counter the OVERWHELMING false narratives and lies spilling out from Republicans at every turn, but it's hard to do that when they'll make up literally anything to flood the public conscious.

Our step is intended not only to satisfy public curiosity but also contribute to a deeper understanding of how and by whom the preparations for this terrorist attack were conducted.**Penned by former FBI employee Bassem Youssef, who was directly involved in the 9/11 investigation, the report details Omar al-Bayoumis interactions with officials from Middle East countries, including Saudi Arabia, between 1998 and 2000.

Although initially asked to talk to this individual, the FBI counterterrorism unit later ordered against using Youssefs services, likely due to a decision from top leadership.**In all of this story, it remains unclear who the good guys and bad guys are.** One thing is certain - the words of the former top-tier FBI employee Ted L.

However, overall US earnings inequality has plateaued in the last decade. This is due to particularly fast earnings growth among low-wage workers rather than median-wage workers catching up with those at the top. Key drivers of secular rising inequality have continued. However, these have been offset by rapid, although unsecured, earnings growth at the bottom of the labor market.AbstractUS earnings inequality has not increased in the last decade. This marks the first sustained reversal of rising earnings inequality since 1980. We document this shift across eight data sources using worker surveys, employer-reported data, and administrative data. The reversal is due to a shrinking gap between low-wage and median-wage workers. In contrast, the gap between top and median workers has persisted. Rising pay for low-wage workers is not mainly due to the changing composition of workers or jobs, minimum wage increases, or workplace-specific sources of inequality. Instead, it is due to broadly rising pay in low-wage occupations, which has particularly benefited workers in tightening labor markets. Rebounding postCGreat Recession labor demand at the bottom offset enduring drivers of inequality.","title":"Biden leaves Trump a booming economy, with almost no unemployment and inflation under control"},{"text":"The economy was good in 18, too.We will have a favorable electorate and Trump is going to irritate A LOT of people","title":"7 Reasons Democrats Should Be Optimistic About Their Chances in 2026 and 2028"},{"text":"Simply don't have sex if you aren't willing to face the consequences","title":"Abortion isnt your right to bodily autonomy"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|8nM6YNtvjuezzD7DNh|downsized)","title":"Ideally there'd be a complete separation of academia and state.

That law allows changes to federal loans during national emergencies, but the Court found it didnt authorize widespread forgiveness without Congress. However, the ruling didnt strike down all changes to the system. Adjustments like the new income-driven repayment rules and temporary pauses are still legal because they fall within the Department of Educations authority.The idea that borrowers should be expected to repay their debts makes sense in theory, but it ignores the unique nature of student loans. At 18, most borrowers dont have the financial literacy to fully understand the long-term consequences of their decisions. Unlike mortgages or credit cards, student loans are nearly impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, so borrowers are often stuck no matter their financial situation. The system is also inherently flawedtuition inflation and predatory lending practices mean colleges often benefit far more than students. In this context, loan forgiveness isnt about dodging responsibility; its about fixing a broken system and investing in the broader economy.Raising the borrowing age might seem like a solution, but it could end up hurting lower-income and first-generation students who rely on loans to access higher education. Delaying college can reduce lifetime earnings and opportunities, so restricting access isnt the answer. Instead, we should focus on financial literacy education, loan caps, or reforms that align loans with post-graduation earning potential.The bigger question is whether we should treat education like a market commodity. College is often a necessity for economic mobility, so student loans arent purely voluntary in the same way as consumer debt. If the system is driving people into unsustainable debt while benefiting institutions, thats a systemic problemnot just an individual responsibility issue. Student loan forgiveness and reform arent about letting borrowers off the hook; theyre about addressing the deeper flaws in the system.","title":"President Joe Biden has forgiven over $166 billion in student debtsee how much in each state"},{"text":"I think Trump voters would consider it lying to them, yes, but how they view it is pretty irrelevant to me as what CNN is saying is either true or it isnt.

Theres a difference.","title":"The End of US Democracy Was All Too Predictable"},{"text":"Key parts:Representative Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, cut me off before I even finished my question: Congressman, were you Surprised? No, I was not surprised, Torres, who represents a poor and working-class district in the Bronx, told me. Much of my side in politics, and much of the media, was in a state of self-deception. We confused analysis with wishful thinking.Which is to say, too many in Torress party assumed that they were heralds of virtue and endangered democratic values and that Americans would not, as a despairing New York Times columnist put it this week, vote for an authoritarian grotesquerie.This, Torres argued, was purest delusion. Inflation and steeply rising rates on credit cards, car loans, and mortgages may not have been President Joe Bidens fault, but they buffeted Americans. The immigration system was broken, and migrants swamped shelters in big cities. Theres no need to assumeas some commentators have after Donald Trumps sweeping victory Tuesdaythat the United States has a uniquely fallen electorate; across the globe, voters have tossed out governments on the left and right over the disruptions of the past five years. A majority of Americans disapprove of Bidens performance and felt they were worse off, Torres said; Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, was not responsible for the inflation, but objectively, that was a near-insurmountable disadvantage.Torres pointed as well to the cumulative toll taken by progressives who for at least a decade have loudly championed cultural causes and chanted slogans that turned off rank-and-file Democrats across many demographics. Donald Trump had no greater friend than the far left, Torres told me, which alienated historic numbers of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, and Jews with absurdities like Defund the police or From the river to the sea or Latinx.In recent election cycles, Democrats have invested much hope that people of colorthe widely varied and disparate peoples long imagined to be a monolithwould embrace an expansive list of progressive causes and rearrange American politics.Politics, alas, is more complex than simply arranging virtuous ethnic and racial voting blocs, and Trumps gains this year among nonwhite voters are part of a longer trend. Four years ago, even as Biden triumphed, a majority of Asian and Latino voters in California rejected a ballot proposition that would have restored affirmative action in education and hiring.Black and Latino voters are not the only demographics drawing blame for Trumps victory. Some commentators have pointed an accusatory finger at white women, suggesting they bear a group guilt for selling out womens rights. This fails as a matter of fact. Nearly half of white women voted for Harris. But more to the point, telling people how to think and not to think is toxic in politics. Yet many liberal commentators seem unable to help themselves. A week before the election, Marcel Roman, a Harvard government professor, explained on X that he and a Georgetown colleague had discovered that Latino voters deeply dislike being labeled Latinx, a gender-neutral term now widespread in academia. This term also came into use by Democratic politicians eager to establish their bona fides with progressive activists. Alas, voters liked it not so much.This problem seems easily remedied: Refer to voters by the term they preferLatino, say, or Hispanic. Roman drew a different conclusion, calling for political education meant to root out queerphobia in Latino communities.Professors might heed the words of Representative Ruben Gallego, a Latino Democrat who is currently wrapped in a tight race for a Senate seat in Arizona. Four years ago, I spoke with him about identity politics in his party. A progressive, Gallego is a favorite of Latino activists, who flock from California to work on his campaigns. He told me that he appreciated their help but warned them that if they used the word Latinx when talking to his Latino constituents, he would load them onto the next bus back to Los Angeles.Its just important that white liberals dont impose their thoughts and policies on us, he told me. And nonwhite liberals too, he might have added.","title":"The Cumulative Toll of Democrats Delusions"},{"text":"And the right wing media has brainwashed the right into believing the dumbest shit you can imagine.","title":"Bernie Sanders Says Democrats Have Lost Their Way"},{"text":"The People voted for Trump and to fill congress with Trump sycophants.

I believe that primaries have perverse incentives to appease progressive lunatics and the nature of them is such that it's entirely possible for a candidate to exist who can win the general, but would lose a primary, and those who do lose, by trying, would end up on record saying absolutely insane shit that centrist voters would hate.

And voters were completely and totally inoculated to the trump and/or democracy rhetoric due to MSM talking about that nonstop for the past 8+ years.The Harris campaign strategy *in general* was extremely stupid.We had an effectively anointed young / next generation successor to Biden, which voters did *not* vote on (and US primary voters rejected comprehensively in 2020), who spent 4 years as VP attempting to gain experience / name recognition / public support for an eventual and inevitable presidential run in 24 or 28, *if* the Biden/Harris admin wasn't voted out of office prior to that point.Said VP had nothing *but* PR / media / messaging disasters, and eventually settled on *Harris-is-the-abortion-and-anti-trump-communicator*, because... half the electorate are women, women overwhelmingly want abortion protections, and Harris... doesn't have any personal connection to any of that, but is a woman. And the pretty-much-exclusive sum of Harris's other, prior job experience and qualifications consisted of being a prosecutor... who very briefly went viral among liberals / on MSNBC for interrogating conservatives in Senate hearings.And yeah, I'm sure it'd be a *really* good idea to build an entire presidential campaign around *just* those two things...And not, y'know, the entire list of policy achievements that Dems had achieved under the prior presidential term, *and would push way further on* if given legislative support in the house / senate.AKA *don't vote for republicans period because they'll do ABC*.

The rate for salaried workers went up in July, and was set to go up again in January. I believe this ruling will roll the amounts back to what they were before July.Where you're wrong about is that this relates to  the IRS and that this circumvented established law. The FLSA regulations have had a salary level test for decades. The amount is rarely changed. This was an attempt to update the amount and to keep up with inflation going forward. Now we'll see if employers take back the pay increases they gave to some salaried workers back in July.What's really interesting is that the salary level test is not part of the actual underlying statute. There are some litigants out there currently trying to have that requirement removed altogether, so there would be no minimum at all.

But we certainly do not need to be the focus of so much attention. On the whole, I feel that the right has dragged us into the political spotlight as a boogeyman, and the left has overcorrected by calling anyone who disagrees with leftist views a bigot. 90% of people simply do not care at all about transgender issues, and dont want to have an opinion about it, because it doesnt matter to them. That doesnt make them bigots, it just means they are low on information. That lack of information makes it easier for them to be swayed politically. Im simply not willing to believe that every republican voter hates trans people. They dont. Its just that they have a different set of priorities, and the propaganda they consume is able to push them to the right because of those priorities. Most people are not hateful.

But that could also just be normalcy bias.Let's not forget that there are countless instances around the world and throughout history, including our own country, where the minority party does this and they aren't just larping.So long as they continue to recognize the statutory power of the executive branch and act within the bounds of the law (e.g. continue to recognize the legitimate and lawful authority of Trump) this is just an exercise in virtue signalling and won't be anything more than a minor annoyance.But, again, let's not discount the possibility, however small, that they will refuse to recognize the legitimate statutory power of an executive branch headed up by Trump... In which case this becomes something far more worrisome and impactful.Because again, there is a precedent in our own short history as a nation of Democrats forming their own government that does not recognize the statutory power of an executive branch headed up by a president they did not recognize as legitimate.To put it more succinctly; we shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking open rebellion is impossible because it's illegal because anyone openly rebelling de facto does not recognize the lawful authority of whoever they're rebelling against.If the left actually does this, it should be a major warning because on the scale of refusing to recognize the legitimate and lawful authority of the president it is a much bigger step to go from no shadow government to having one than it is to go from having a shadow government to open rebellion.The first step is the biggest, but the second step is much smaller.

In contrast to our Presidential and congressional system, Westminster style governments can \\"fall\\" at the turn of a dime.  It can happen at a scheduled election (if the country has one), or more likely, when the majority party loses the confidence of the legislature and they call snap elections/ lose a vote of no confidence.The prime minster and his cabinet are are chosen from the party that controls the most seats in the legislature and there is a very small transition period between governments.  Basically once the election happens power is turned over to the winner.  There isn't a lame duck window between the election and an inauguration like there is in the US - the new ruling party takes over essentially the same day.Because of that the opposition party has a slate of people that are better named \\"ministers in waiting\\" - they don't have any power when their party doesn't control the legislature but they stay on top of the current issues and often receive the same briefings their counterparts in power do.There is no analog in our constitutional system of government.

The pandemic triggered a brief recession, followed by a round of global inflation. The Trump and Biden administrations both responded to the downturn with multiple rounds of stimulus aid, dispatching checks to American homes. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and pumped money into the economy. Their collective aim, economists said, was to avoid a repeat of the Great Recession of 2008, which hobbled the U.S. economy for years. The Democrats from the start argued for the censorship that even prevented discussing whether there should have been such a response to the pandemic at all.I warned at the time four years ago that the response was simply repeating World War 1, dumping most of the costs of the response onto the young and leaving them with few prospects afterwards, which would lead to a repeat of the 1930s.I called this exactly at the moment it started to happen using simple lessons of history.

There was no winning :/ She supported trans rights but was faulted for not making it a primary topic so the fact she was faulted for being too much in identity politics is really based on what GOP ads were pushing. In reality she played everything really safe and on general values and not enough details or strong opinion on certain matters. As I tell my product design team people dont read - make it easy to understand. Saying her policies are on her website and not verbally painting a picture of what peoples lives would be like made that hard for undecided voters. Many people I asked why they didnt vote said they didnt understand her policies nor were they willing to do the research. Also that they just simply didnt understand how it all works. On identity issues - Dems have had to play defense because GOP kept pushing the topic and taking away lgbtqia+ rights. I think most people would prefer we didnt HAVE to focus on it but when a party is threatening someones existence and access to necessary care, its hard not to. The sentiment of the left is its table stakes. It becomes a damned if you talked about it, damned if you dont. I think there is a core difference between table stakes of values versus top political issues that broadly affect everyone.- Table stake values: human rights (often gets confused for politics as its whether or not certain groups have access to the budget).- Political topics: how money is being spent across budgets that gives everyone access to thrive and to what degree.If we dont agree on the first point it makes the second point so hard to get to talk about.In my mind it doesnt matter if I believe x,y,z person should exists - everyone should have access to the care they need that medical practitioners and science advises (abortion and trans fits under this between a doctor and patient construct rather than citizen and government; same for underage people who dont have support at home and need to make a decision around abortion - they should talk to therapists, medical doctors, and potentially social services without risking their safety at home but these are extreme cases) and to be able to marry within our system and start families if they choose. Boys and men also need more support, socialization to constructs of healthy masculinity, and access to self-care and medical. Our society needs examples of what good looks like for everyone and a strategy on how we get there. Allies needs to continue to support not just minority groups but what value majority groups bring to the table. We have spent so much time trying to get equitable solutions (which does not mean equal but what is necessary to fill gaps) but echo chambers that go extreme and demonize each other is making things worse. We then devolve into table stakes discussions and dont get to broad issues like whats happening with our economy (point 2). People get fatigued by the conversation and then throw in the towel hitting the chaos button.In point 2 people just want to thrive economically and work for their dollar. We are so stratified in who has what possibility of upward mobility. Too many have-nots are getting screwed.Im sad because I dont think Trump will make peoples lives generally better. I think he cares more about his legacy in the world than who he has to step on to get there. It might bring prosperity to the rich but it will be at the expense of the working class. Upper middle will be fine. Lower middle will struggle or be worked without concern for hours and safety.","title":"John Oliver slams Democrats who think transgender people lost them the election"},{"text":"frfrfrfrfrfrfrfrfr","title":"How the left viewed Election Night"},{"text":"We probably would all do that","title":"Breaking the ice?

You either move people to do that or you dont, Psaki continued.It was not just White working class voters, it was beyond that, she said of Trumps gains with minority voters.The pair also discussed the backlash to woke politics among voters within the Democratic Party.No one likes to be condescended to, or told that they have to hit a certain litmus test of things to be welcomed and invited to the party, Psaki said. And I think sometimes people feel that way about the Democratic Party.Both agreed that theres been a backlash to identity politics in the country among voters, before suggesting voters implicit bias against a female presidential candidate also played a part in the election.I think that some people dont even recognize their implicit bias, Couric said. I have a friend who said, Im just worried that Kamala Harris doesnt have the stature to deal with world leaders. And I thought, Wow. And this was a very successful woman. And I thought, Maybe just replace stature with penis.It was so perplexing to me. I was like, Oh, this is someone who doesnt realize her deep-seated implicit bias against female leadership, Couric continued.Psaki and Couric also addressed how the media should cover Trump in his second term, with Psaki suggesting they should tamp down on outrage over the crazy things Trump says in its coverage.He is still a story. Hes the President-elect of the United States. People cant not cover him or not talk about him. But I do wonder if the react to the crazy thing he said is the most informative and right way we should be approaching things, she said.Couric agreed, arguing that the press often doesnt take time to try to understand Trump supporters or their priorities.?Reporters should have spent more time concentrating on these voters concerns, rather than mocking them, she continued.When you did see stories about Trump supporters, they were often mocking them. They were interviewing them. They didnt understand the issues.

Harry Potter is a flat arc that has lots of flat characters. The purpose of flat arcs with flat characters is the lesson is *who prevails and why*. So the commentary on human nature isn't occurring at the individual level. It is using the characters for the moral lessons even when the characters don't act like normal humans. Other types of narrative arcs usually require the character to undergo some sort of change. That's the premise of the well-known hero's journey. In flat arcs, the character will have a belief/skill/whatever, get tested, and emerge the same. The point is showing that \\"good wins because our virtuous good guy remained virtuous even when they win.\\" Umbridge is an example where she doesn't change but she's used to teach that power has corrupting potential (and how those thirsting for power can gravitate towards those who promise it and that's why people support evil) and such people lose. What you are looking for is more of a hero's journey or other arc where the characters are round and undergo change. It is in these arcs that characters behave more rationally compared to real world counterparts. The idea is that external circumstances changes people but those changes reveal an inner truth. What Harry Potter is doing is \\"see, Harry was virtuous because under pressure he did the virtuous thing no matter what.\\"James we don't even get to know, we just get told that he was one of the good guys despite of him being a sadistic bully because he was popular in the right social circles (do I see a pattern here?)The thing here is we think of James as a bully because the depictions of him mostly come from Snape's memories. And Snape was antagonistic to them but was bested by them. Consider the scene where Ron tried to make slugs come out of Malfoy's mouth but his wand backfired. Imagine that Ron was successful, wouldn't Malfoy think of Ron as a bully if Ron always bested him even though he was the aggressor? But you can glean here and there - like a scene where Hagrid, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Fudge were talking about Sirius and James not knowing Harry was there to hear, so assuming it is closer to truth, they're talked about as pranksters. The point of their characters is to be a parallel to the Weasley twins. If you look at Harry's social group and James's, you see there's an equivalent for each. You also saw tons of virtuous examples and why they're seen as proof that love wins all. Like how James stands up for muggle borns - whereas Snape hated them - or how he stood buy his warewolf pal, joined a force that stood up against genocidal evil, etc.The whole point of James as a character is to show a blue print of self sacrifice is worth it if you're dying for the right reason, which is what lead Harry to give himself up in the 7th book. Every character in HP is proving that love wins all, and that individual talent alone is not enough, and that the quest for all power will leave a person alone and dead, etc. It's just a story of flat arcs to prove truths of the human condition the author believes in but that requires each character to not act like a normal human but act like a character in a book.","title":"CMV: Harry Potter depicts human nature poorly"},{"text":"Nope. Nate explains it in his article. She was further to the left of most Democrats, and firmly belongs in the left wing of the party. Which is fine for a senator from California but won't translate to success nationwide.She tried to pivot to the center in 2024, but she unfortunately came across as insincere\\"Overall, though, theres a statistically significant relationship. For every point on the -100 to +100 scale that the Democratic Senate was closer to the center than the Republican one, they gained 0.08 points of vote share. That means, for instance, that Angus King of Maine (-50) did about 4 points better than if hed been as left-wing as Sanders (-100). King would probably have won his race even with more liberal positions, as hes a popular incumbent in a state that tends to like its incumbents, but 4 points helps. Harris' score on this scale is -70. What if the Democratic nominee instead had a score like King (-50) or Tester (-40) or Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania (-51)? That translates to a popular vote margin that would be 1.5 to 2.5 points better against Trump than Harriss was.\\"","title":"Kamala Harris was a replacement-level candidate"},{"text":"Trans issues only matter to a very, very small fraction of the population.

While it is usually approved it's not guaranteed. Canada suffered its first Constitutional Crisis in 1926 when the PM wanted to run another election to gain more power after his party was involved in a massive scandal, but the Governor General said nope, everything stays the same except the guy from the other party gets to be Prime Minister now (that other guy had won the popular vote anyway).  It's quite rare for a Prime Minister's term to be shorter than the maximum 5 years. Minority Governments where the PM didn't get a true majority of the vote do fall very early sometimes, but usually they just make a supply and demand agreement with one of the other parties on their side of the aisle to support them in any votes of no-confidence, so they usually survive the full five years too. Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada has been leading a minority government for 4 years now. He has to call an election by the end of 2025 though. Anyway, that's not why shadow cabinets exist, they are really just \\"point men\\" for the House of Commons when they want to press the party in power over specific topics.

I have few charitable things to say about politicians but I don't think they are *literally* thoughtless. It is impossible to hack and democratic, actually.

To secure this list an entire community is tasked with finding the solution to a math problem which statistically is best solved simply by randomly guessing at an answer and checking to see if it is correct. The entire community works at guessing the answer as quickly as they can and eventually when an answer is found an entry is added to the list, and the problem is changed so everyone can start guessing again.The longest chain is considered the legitimate chain; anyone could fake an entry into the chain but to do so would require guessing the answer to those math problems faster than the entire community which would presumably require an impractical amount of computational power. Only the \\"owner\\" of the chain who knows a secret code can easily add new entries to the chain. Security of the chain then depends on performing those otherwise useless computations as quickly as possible forever.If blockchain can be \\"hacked\\" depends on if the computational power of the community is unable to be overcome. It is not at all \\"democratic\\" as additions to the chain are exclusive to whoever controls that secret code. The community may \\"agree\\" that the longest chain is the valid one but this is not democratic; if they did not agree on that then the entire system falls apart. Alterations to the blockchain by the will of the people is not possible while retaining this \\"longest chain\\" policy so in fact blockchain is one of the least democratic systems possible.

As an influential member of the Trump administration, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will have the opportunity to begin a reversal of this trend. He is developing plans to revamp the Federal agencies that regulate the medical and pharmaceutical industries.Mr. Kennedy has presented incontrovertible data about the state of our health. He says the first step towards change is reforming policies and restoring compromised government oversight.   It will take a concerted effort to convert a system that has allowed an array of degrading health conditions and an avalanche of human suffering. The statistics compiled by reliable scientific sources reveal details of this staggering crisis.* Six out of ten adults in America are living with a chronic illness. Seventy-four percent of American adults are overweight or obese. Rates of kidney disease and autoimmune conditions are going up. Cancer rates among young people are rising.\\n* One-third of American teens are taking a prescription drug and nearly 30% are pre-diabetic. More than 18% of adolescents have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In 2020, 77% of young adults didn't qualify for the military based on their health scores, forcing the military to lower its standards.\\n* Health problems of young Americans begin at an early age even as they receive vaccines to protect them from illness. The CDC currently recommends at least 70 doses of 18 different vaccines from infancy until age eighteen, yet children have never had more acute and chronic ailments. These vaccination protocols urgently need re-evaluation.The increasing use of prescription drugs by all Americans presents a dire warning. However, due to the unprecedented influence of lobbyists, elected representatives have allowed the pharmaceutical industry rampant freedom to sell questionable products.Washington has not solved the problem of the revolving doors between Big Pharma and government regulators. This is the primary reason federal agencies are paralyzed by corporate interests and remain negligent in their protective roles. Americans are also barraged with a one-sided view about the benefits of pharmaceuticals. The United States is one of two countries in the world where prescription drugs can be advertised. This inappropriate promotional effort has a secondary consequence; news and information about pharmaceutical issues cannot be trusted when coming from networks dependent on this huge source of income.","title":"The U.S. Disease Epidemic | Americans Are Not Feeling Well"},{"text":"The problem with this narrative is that Trump still won more votes than those Swing-state senate elects.

I think Harris loss is a very complex issue. Some of what Bernie said rings really true, but that isnt strictly Harris fault. In fact, its mostly not her fault at all. She hasnt even really been in national politics that long. Many of the things you could posit as to why she lost are more of a reflection of the Democratic Party as whole, but in particular the old-guard establishment dems and their failings. Not really hers, except for the few things you could point to in the last few years. She was a pretty active VP all things considered, probably the most active, by some accounts. Anyways, a lot of the frustration should be directed at other leaders in the party. Harris and Bidens chief mistakes, in retrospect, is that they didnt push to hold an early democratic primary and both refuse to run so someone new could take over. Given the huge backlash against dems over inflation (and against incumbent parties in elections worldwide this year), dems likely still would have seen significant losses and may have still lost control of the Senate and House to the GOP, but a candidate who wasnt Biden or Harris may have been able to beat Trump, at least. Even that is a bit of a stretch though, because you have to assume that this persons campaign would have been just as well executed and received as Harriss short, but passionate run was. Its not impossible, but it isnt likely either. Especially not considering how inflation affected voters choices this time around. \\n \\nMight she have fared better if she ran a different, more labor centric, working class campaign? Yeah maybe. But probably not, given how many other odds she had against her. The fact she did so well with such a short and wild campaign is still impressive as hell. But I think that acknowledging this means its also fair to say that its unreasonable to have expected her to be able to do much more than she did. The media environment she was up against gave her probably one of the largest uphill battles any presidential candidate has ever fought, and she only had a few months to do so. She came pretty close all things considered. From the time she took over, she essentially ran a flawless campaign, and still many people who voted against her had no idea what her policies or positions were, or what Trumps were, for that matter, but they voted against her and for Trump nonetheless. Democrats overall faired much better in terms of being informed on each candidates policies. But people who said they intended to vote for Trump only correctly identified the origin of some 15% of the policies they were shown (when shown to them without telling them who it belonged to, to be clear) For contrast, that number was around 70% amongst those planning to vote for Harris. In other words, the majority of people planning to vote for Trump had no idea what they were voting for or even what the options were, policy wise, while the majority of Harris supporters were better at correctly identifying policies from either candidate. Interestingly, her voters were also better at identifying Trumps policies than his own voters were, as well. The vast majority of voters who were voting for Trump misattributed Harris policies that they agreed with to Trump, in many cases they did so with policies that Trump publicly opposes. All this data is really complex, and these are some of the observations Ive drawn from reading the report, but yeah. It seems unlikely to me that Harris could have reliably forced a different outcome by either adjusting her policy or approach to talking about these issues. The data strongly suggests that the informational divide between the two voting blocks was a major factor, and that right leaning voters who likely ended up voting for Trump were severely under informed about the choice they were making relative to likely Harris voters. From this, one could gather that Harris could have run the most popular platform possible and still lost, considering the fact a large proportion of Trump voters were not likely to even hear about or know about her policies in the first place. Ill find the link to the report and post it here in a bit, for anyone who may want to read it for themselves and study it. Its pretty interesting, but it does seem to align with what we know about the election results, as well as the early findings that seem to suggest Trumps victory was very strongly driven by alternative, right leaning media, both of the traditional kind, and especially of the right leaning influencers and independent media sources online, based on the conclusions it had about how well different voters were informed and what kind of policies positions they believed each candidate held.Edit: https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/documents/Issues_Policies_Harris_Trump_YouGov_Poll_Results.pdf","title":"John Oliver slams Democrats who think transgender people lost them the election"},{"text":"Amusingly, AOC just removed her pronouns from her profile on X.","title":"Democrats Plan to Form \\"Shadow Cabinet\\" to Oppose Trump Agenda"},{"text":"Just wanted to draw everyone's attention to one quote in this article by Nate:\\"But I think people confuse their sympathy for Harriss position for her having been a good candidate.

It had little to do with actual Dem policy and more to do with what people perceived Dem policy to be, as well as just personal perception of Harris as a candidate, including, but not limited to, misogynistic and racist perceptions.

How else to explain why Biden would refuse a final chance to stop [Israels brutal war on Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war) and save Palestinian lives, when he has nothing to lose?On Tuesday, the Biden administration quietly [ignored its own deadline for Israel to increase the minuscule amount of humanitarian aid it allows to enter Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/aid-groups-accuse-israel-of-ignoring-us-ultimatum-on-apocalyptic-gaza-crisis). The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, imposed the 30-day deadline in a letter sent to Israeli officials on 13 October, which warned that they must take concrete measures to ensure that Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza have access to food, medicine and other necessities. The administration said it [could suspend US military support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/15/us-weapons-israel-gaza-aid/) to Israel if conditions did not improve. Despite the US ultimatum, [the amount of aid reaching the besieged territory in October had dropped to its lowest level in 11 months](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/11/aid-gaza-trucks-food-lowest-level-year-despite-us-ultimatum).As the deadline passed, the Biden administration did what it has done for more than a year: it caved and [continued sending weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/israel-weapons-gaza-aid.html) to the government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, despite the devastation and famine Israel has inflicted on Gaza. And Washington sheepishly told the world that it would not impose any consequences on Israel, even though [the US is legally bound to stop arming an ally that blocks humanitarian aid in a conflict zone](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/u-s-fails-to-implement-u-s-law-in-response-to-israels-blocking-of-aid/).Its the latest in a long series of decisions by Biden over the past 13 months that show his disdain for Palestinian lives. But his lack of action this week is especially egregious because Biden is politically unrestrained: the presidential election is over, and Donald Trump won. Biden can do whatever he wants without incurring a political cost. He doesnt even have to worry about a transition to his fellow Democrat and vice-president, Kamala Harris. If there was ever a time for Biden to use his considerable power to save Palestinians, this was it. Yet he squandered this final opportunity to make the right and moral choice C and help end the Gaza war before leaving office.Bidens decision to keep supplying weapons to Israel reinforces his legacy as the primary enabler of the slaughter in Gaza, and Netanyahus campaign to expand the war into Lebanon. While Biden and his allies have done a lot of hand-wringing about Trumps disregard for the rule of law, the Biden administration failed to uphold US law and its own policies C and it has undermined US credibility around the world even before Trump takes office once again.Biden has been fully complicit in Israels destruction of Gaza, in which more than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed, although the true figure is probably much higher. [One estimate published by researchers in the Lancet, a medical journal, found that the death toll could eventually reach 186,000 (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext). That accounts for [indirect casualties](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/12/gaza-death-toll-indirect-casualties) of war, such as widespread hunger, a cholera epidemic, unsanitary conditions and the destruction of Gazas health system.Following a relentless Israeli military assault that started after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, [nearly all of Gazas 2.1 million people have been displaced at least once](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html), and are now living in makeshift tents or in the ruins of bombed-out buildings. Last week, [a UN-affiliated group of experts warned that famine is imminent, or may already be unfolding, in northern Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/09/strong-likelihood-of-imminent-famine-in-northern-gaza-food-experts-warn-as-israel-continues-siege) C and that [the enclaves entire population faces acute food insecurity](https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_FRC_Alert_Gaza_Nov2024.pdf), which is one step below a full-blown famine.[Days after Biden decided to continue arming Israel into the twilight of his presidency, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a devastating 154-page report that contradicted most US and Israeli assurances that Israel is not violating international law](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/11/14/israels-crimes-against-humanity-gaza). The report, issued on Thursday, concluded: [Israeli authorities have caused the massive, deliberate forced displacement of Palestinian civilians in Gaza since October 2023 and are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. HRW urged western governments to impose sanctions and suspend their arms shipments to Israel](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/14/hopeless-starving-and-besieged/israels-forced-displacement-palestinians-gaza).[The US has provided Israel with nearly $18bn in weapons and other military assistance since October 2023](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/USspendingIsrael), according to a report released last month by Brown University. Washington spent another $4.8bn on its own military activities in the Middle East due to the conflict. Overall, the Biden administration spent at least $22.7bn in US taxpayer funds to enable Netanyahu and his government to prolong the Gaza war.But the US administration did not have to become so deeply complicit in Israels war crimes. Biden and his aides had the leverage, policy tools and legal mechanisms to restrain Israel, end the conflict, and save thousands of Palestinian lives. For months, Biden, along with his secretary of state, squandered any influence they could have exerted over Netanyahu by refusing to enforce US law and their own administrations policies on weapons transfers.In February, as Biden faced pressure from a handful of Democrats in Congress critical of his unwavering support for Israel, he issued a new national security memo which [required the state department](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/08/biden-memo-weapons-international-law/) to certify that recipients of US weapons would allow the delivery of humanitarian aid during active conflicts and abide by international law. Bidens [memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/02/08/national-security-memorandum-on-safeguards-and-accountability-with-respect-to-transferred-defense-articles-and-defense-services/) did not set new policies for arms transfers to foreign countries, but instead used provisions of existing US laws, especially under the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act.Washington can suspend shipments if it suspects that a foreign military will use US weapons to carry out violations of international law, or to countries that block the delivery of humanitarian aid C as Israel has done throughout its war in Gaza. By May,[the state department sent a 46-page report to Congress full of bureaucratic double-speak to justify Bidens decision to flout US and international laws to protect Netanyahu](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Report-to-Congress-under-Section-2-of-the-National-Security-Memorandum-on-Safeguards-and-Accountability-with-Respect-to-Transferred-Defense.pdf).[Long before the administrations report, the UN and human rights groups had amply documented that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war C a violation of international law](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/12/18/israel-starvation-used-weapon-war-gaza) C and [deliberately blocking food and other supplies from entering Gaza](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-access-snapshot-gaza-strip-1-31-march-2024).Yet the report [avoided concluding](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/10/us-weapons-israel-human-rights-law) that the Israeli military had obstructed humanitarian aid, or violated international law while using US weapons. Such findings would have forced Biden to suspend most weapons shipments to Israel under the policies outlined in his own national security memo. But instead of upholding US law and using the suspension of military support to force Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire, Biden sat by and enabled Israel to kill thousands of Palestinians since May.Back then, Biden was still running for re-election and could have feared political repercussions for breaking with Netanyahu. But this week, the US president was as free from politics as hes ever been in his entire career. He simply decided that Palestinians dont matter C and sealed his legacy as the enabler of Israels war crimes.    *Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian center for Near Eastern studies, and a journalism professor at New York University-[Biden now has his best opening to end Israels war on Gaza C and wont use it](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/15/biden-israel-gaza-palestine)","title":"Biden now has his best opening to end Israels war on Gaza C and wont use it"},{"text":"They hate NAFTA but Trump didn't get rid of it the first time, just gave it a different name.","title":"Democrat Sherrod Brown Explains How His Party 'Let' Voters Flip to Trump"},{"text":"One of the first stories after the election was Lara Trump, head of the RNC (and daughter-in-law of Donald Trump) floating the idea of federalizing national elections.

Nothing stopping any of us from being libertarian and making Joe's Cola Beverage.  With patents, the entire purpose of patents is to encourage the sharing of ideas with the public.  Before there were patents, skilled people just kept the tricks of the trade to themselves and perhaps taught their children when they handed down the family business.  Until then they kept it secret and to themselves and used the secret to command higher prices.  And then their children could command higher prices toofor as long as they could keep it secret or until someone else came up with something better.  The patent is a deal between the innovator and the state: Share your invention in a public document (i.e. the patent) and the state will enforce a monopoly for a period of time.and then it becomes public domain.  And the whole transaction is voluntary.....nobody is making the innovator obtain a patent.  But the state can't compel innovators to share secrets either.  And then you have the area of trade secrets.....and they are never patented because the innovators do not feel that the exclusivity provided by a patent (currently 20 years from the date of filing) is sufficient to share the secret.  There is a LOT in the pharmaceutical industry that is not patented and instead kept as a trade secret.  They patent their molecules because (a) they are forced by regulatory agencies to disclose chemical structures and (b) chemical structures are easily deduced by third parties.  And with biological drugs, often many of their components remain trade secret because its more advantageous for the innovator to do so.  And while it's bad for the customer that some of these products will NEVER go \\"off patent\\" and always remain somewhat expensive, the fact is these biologic drugs are often extremely fussy to manufacturer and the process is often not easy to replicate.","title":"How do you get rid of the tyranny of copyright and trademark laws?"},{"text":"They had them, it wasnt enough.

Still, corporate liberal media has done an amazing job on monopolising the intellectual and moral cause. Both sides are stuck in a propaganda bubble and neither side know it.

I have been punched in the face a fair bit. I wrestled for MANY years and caught elbows and headbutts. I was a bouncer at a rough dive bar. I was a sparring partner for people getting into MMA, at least one of whom made it to multiple UFC main card events. My nose has been broken 3 times. I know what it feels like to get punched in the face by a strong man. The thought of that happening to my wife or daughter makes me physically ill.So i share that fear. I just don't find it convincing, because it's not common enough to be an issue, nor is every trans woman even slightly athletic. Of the 5-6 trans women i have known in my life, only one of them is at all athletic and she's in her 50s (and 6'4). It is a problem that can EASILY be handled nation wide on a case by case basis.But dismissing the fear just alienates people that feel it. Instead, we can easily say, \\"No one wants men dominate women's sports, but that's not what's happening in any significant numbers, and we can handle trans athletes in a case by case basis.\\" Btw, wrestling has had a solution for this for literally decades.

Going to \\"oh well actually there was no fraud we just won\\"... I hold this firm belief, that something is off about the election, but we will likely never know the truth regarding what's going on. I fear everyone's trust in a fair election has been disrupted. Not just GOP but also Democrats.I will hold this belief for a long time that something's just so amiss about this election. The best way to explain it is through the bullet ballot data, the type of ballots in which a vote is cast ONLY for the president. There is a statistical anomaly this year. Usually there isn't as many people casting bullet ballot, it constitute 0.5% of the overall total vote or so. 2020 was an anomaly because of COVID, so I imagine due to more voting rights, it was more likely to see more people voting bullet ballots. Historically there are very, very few people who do bullet ballot casting.But now, as of this writing, in states with senator race, there is about 0.2% percent of bullet ballot in states where there are senate races, while Trump is almost 4% now. Someone compiled data of the % of bullet ballots. [https://imgur.com/a/vKTB3aq](https://imgur.com/a/vKTB3aq)Are we supposed to believe that there is actually an increase in bullet ballot? Doesn't it seem a bit much like a statistical irregularity? Like, is it plausible that disinformation actually contributed to it or at least caused people to swing in Trump side? I firmly believe in the pursuit of the truth: even if my post won't be appreciate, everything is so sketchy and I wish people were more onto it, instead of bowing down rather soon. It feels so unreal, like an alternate world.EDIT: An user made a site to compare bullet ballot data wherever possible, and I do believe there is an abnormal amount of bullet ballot in some states: [https://codepen.io/clydedroid/full/wvVOjRy](https://codepen.io/clydedroid/full/wvVOjRy)NC for example has 600k+ bullet ballots. I know Robinson was a very very bad Governor pick, so split tickets are common, but having about 25%+ bullet ballots still seems excessive to me. There's an irregular level of ballots casts that weren't regular voting (split or ballots). CA, Washington had way less bullet ballots. North Dakota has more normal stats. 8%+ of the Trump votes being bullet ballots doesn't scream normal to me.","title":"John Oliver slams Democrats who think transgender people lost them the election"},{"text":"Oh....damn is that really what happened?","title":"JUST IN: Nancy Pelosi Announces Bid for 2026 Reelection"},{"text":"If the average American is swayed by the right then that means the left isn't giving voters enough incentive.

We have managed to almost completely equalize any good role models or heros for young men out of the equation. And we did it fast as humanly possible with literally no room to grow or make a mistake. We did that and didnt offer up anyone to replace them. Is someone in your class trans and you used their old name by accident? Youre a bigot dead namer, these are adult assed terms kids throw at each other. Only a matter of time before they say fuck it.We cant even make a good comedy movie anymore because everything makes the liberals camp up and shit all over it. Could we make tropic thunder right now? Absolutely not. The liberals have gotten so smart in everything culture related that they can tell you precisely how insufferable they are. Frankly speaking, I think the mask is slipping because people (white men) are tired of trying to be your ally and then immediately shat all over if its not done perfectly every time. Young men have less patience obviously than an adult, so they immediately say fuck it. The republicans have seen that, drilled in on it and liberals have probably permanently lost those voters. They found that gaming culture is where men had a spot to be ding dongs and say stupid shit to edgelord each other and women and pearl clutchers werent lurking en masse ready to attempt to ruin their life with some type of gnarly accusation.  In college I was put in the middle of the class with 4 other white men in an urban studies class, we were told to sit in the middle as there were only 4 of us in this urban studies class, it was when the whole confederate statues thing was popping off. The professor then said ask these white men why the statues are still up or what their opinion of them are. Kennesaw state university, social sciences building behind the Starbucks. I was fucking shocked. Its shit like that, that is losing you white men and making authoritarian strongmen look good.","title":"The boys in our liberal school are different now that Trump has won"},{"text":"The fact Uber advertises itself as \\"be your own boss\\" when objectively its workers are low paid wagies speaks to this.

There were no trans speakers at the DNC, and iirc?trans people were only mentioned once or twice. When asked about Trump's rhetoric about her providing trans care deemed medically necessary to imprisoned migrants, all she said is that she would follow the law, and said nothing towards defending trans people in places where conservatives change the law. Additionally, it's a discouraging answer from a prosecutor who once argued (and lost) that the state of California has no obligation to provide trans care to prisoners. As a trans person myself, I found it difficult to trust Kamala?as her record showed a person without consistent positions, values or morals, and I think that quality of her's contributed to her loss in regards to the bigger issues.\\n? I am not arguing that she should have made trans issues a centerpiece of her campaign, that would have been foolish. However, in a time where conservatives are drafting hundreds of (very unpopular) bills per year curtailing trans rights, some enthusiasm towards defending us would have been nice to see, especially since it's easy to connect trans rights to abortion rights through the topic of bodily autonomy.

That success, ironically, may have helped seal the partys fate in the 2024 election.Two years ago, the Democrats succeeded in quarantining the swing states and won most of the key governor and Senate races within them, even as the powerful nationwide current of dissatisfaction with Biden and the economy moved virtually every other state, red or blue, toward the GOP. If the midterms had gone as badly as many analysts initially forecastwith predictions of a towering red wave of Republican gainsBiden likely would have faced greater pressure to renounce running for a second term long before his disastrous debate performance in June. That might have forced him from the race much sooner, allowing a full-scale primary to take place, which would have either yielded a nominee unconnected to the administration or helped Vice President Kamala Harris establish an identity independent of Biden.By the same token, their strong 2022 result also left Democrats too confident that former President Donald Trump had become unacceptable to voters. The decisive defeats of handpicked Trump candidates such as Kari Lake, Mehmet Oz, Herschel Walker, and Doug Mastriano across swing-state governor and Senate races encouraged a complacency among Democrats about the degree to which voters had rejected the former president himself. That overconfidence contributed to Democrats reacting too slowly as voters retrospective approval rating of Trumps performance in office started rising through 2023. By Election Day 2024, a majority of voters in the VoteCast survey conducted by NORC said that they approved of Trumps presidency, a level of support he famously never reached in office.... The Republican pollster Gene Ulm points to one reason for the change: the operational advantages that helped Democrats so much in those states Senate and governor races two years ago arent as consequential in a presidential contest. Tactics, money, and things like that, he told me, are just less important in a presidential race when the news is covering it wall-to-wall. The fact that Democrats won the Senate races in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada despite Trumps victories in those states supports Ulms argument: Those contrasting results suggest that the Democratic financial and organizational advantages mattered more in those contests than they did in the presidential race.One change in the swing-state environment may have been the most decisive. Far fewer of the voters in those states who were dissatisfied with the economy backed Harris in 2024 than had supported Democratic candidates two years earlier. Then, the exit polls in Pennsylvania, for instance, found that John Fetterman, the Democratic Senate candidate, lost voters who were negative about the economy by 18 percentage points; this time around, Harris lost those voters by twice as much. Then, Michigans Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, lost voters who were negative on the economy by 12 points; this year, Harris lost them by nearly four times as much. Harris lost voters who were down on the economy by at least 40 percentage points in Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. In each case, that was considerably worse than Democratic candidates had performed with comparable voters in 2022.Tellingly, the Democratic Senate candidates who narrowly won in the swing states in this cycle (as well as Josh Stein, the Democrat who comfortably won the North Carolina governors race) all won a slightly higher share of voters dissatisfied with the economy than Harris did. To some extent, that reflected the tactical advantages Ulm stressed. But these Democrats success, like the 2022 results, also suggested that voters were more willing to look past their economic discontent when picking for positions other than the presidencythe office to which they assign responsibility for setting national economic policy.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/UgiUOGnv](https://theatln.tc/UgiUOGnv)","title":"The Democrats 2022 Error Message"},{"text":"What a fun pattern.

Ben Gvir phoned a dozen countries asking about it, and it remains the official position of the Israeli government. When Benjamin Netanyahu promises there isn't going to be a Palestinian state, he's not promising they're all going to get to be Arab Israelis. He's been promising for years that they'd be gone, and that he would find some way to get them to other countries. This has been consistent in polling among Israelis, too - in opinion polling fewer than 20% expect there will ever be a two state solution.And they're probably not wrong. The West Bank is divided between a little under 200 separate and disconnected enclaves. The actual number changes week by week, with enclaves sometimes being split by new settlements and sometimes wiped out entirely, with more and more people moving out there every year. These days, one in ten Israelis lives in the West Bank.  It wouldn't ever be possible to carve a Palestinian state from it without kicking between 5-10% of the population of Israel out of their homes - something no democratic government is structurally or legally capable of doing. In the long term, we probably *are* in a situation where the only outcomes left are to either engineer a road to a shared state, or to engineer a Trail of Tears most of the world would recognize as a genocide.What's going to happen in the short term is clearer. Most of the rest of the  world will say that if Gaza is uninhabitable, the Palestinians there should be evacuated to the West Bank, which they will recognize as Palestine, while Israel will say that they should go to other Arab countries and that the West Bank Palestinians should follow. Neither will get their way, and the Gazans will be forced to stay under whatever horrific circumstances the Israelis engineer to try to pressure other countries into taking them, even if it means many won't survive. Those countries will experience the Palestinians' suffering as a pressure to adopt firmer anti-Israel stances, while Israel will disavow all responsibility and blame those other countries for the Palestinians' suffering, and the debate will be dominated by a blame game that only the Palestinians will lose.","title":"U.N. says Gaza \\"unfit for human survival\\" as Biden admin decides to continue arming Israel"},{"text":"Well, they want to enact tariffs on everything to bring back our manufacturing sector.
