If Trump tried to get the House &amp; Senate to pass a law revoking (say) Liz Cheney's pardon so she could be prosecuted for something like an unpaid Washington DC library fine, I think it's safe to say that enough House &amp; Senate Republicans would vote 'no' to protect her.

It was voluntary to do any of those atrocities and the Nazis literally considered those who did it \\"heroes\\". That is why every Nazi deserved to hang, particularly those involved with the Final Solution. They willingly chose to do it and the evidence is documented because the Germans kept meticulous records.

And I can actually see how people might think this, in part because this is been the cultural message for, Democrats always can be counted on to put up a fight and stop Republicans from doing things they say they want to do. From all of the polling and testimonial evidence we have, it does seem like there are a lot of people simply dont believe that Trump and Republicans will actually do a lot of things Democrats say they will or they think that the courts and Dems will stop it. I think it would be nice to imagine a world in which you can adequately warn people of threats without having to have it knock on your door for people to take it seriously, but unfortunately, weve tried that; we tried it a lot. Whatever qualms people might have about Democrats, I think the only way to get them to really recognize Republicans as a threat is for them to actually see.Another Narrative we need get in front of here is that I know Democrats are going to fight (and its probably the right thing to do), but there are going to be efforts to say Democrats did nothing to stop all of this and you shouldnt vote for them because they arent a real opposition or something similar. Its a perfect divisive message for people who want to keep the public divided against the true threat. But it is worth reminding people that this is what the American public voted for and it is not the job of Dems to answer for the misdeeds of republicans. You cannot expect them to earn your vote by completely stopping the damage when they dont have sufficient institutional power to do anything about the issues you want changed.

He [suggested in a Wall Street Journal op ed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464) in 2020 that only up to 40,000 Americans would be killed by the pandemic. More than 1.2 million people died.While he hasnt yet established how to measure academic freedom, he has been looking at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and the nonprofits scoring of universities and their rankings based on freedom of speech.The nonprofit bases its rankings on surveys of students views on whether they feel comfortable sharing ideas, with schools being negatively scored if their administrators punish faculty for opinions, or if they withdraw an invitation to a speaker following a possible controversy.Some of the schools that receive NIH grants but have bad rankings, according to the nonprofit, include the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, and the University of Southern California, The Journal noted.Those at the top of the rankings include the University of Virginia, Michigan Technological University, and Florida State University.Bhattacharya also has plans to fund studies that recreate the work of other scientists in an attempt to take on scientific fraud. There are also plans to create a scientific journal to publish studies with comments by named reviewers, to urge a more open discussion.He has also suggested limiting the amount of grant money that pays for publication in journals, and he would look eastablish a pause on research which creates new viruses for study purposes.In addition, Bhattacharya has a goal of enacting term limits for those in charge of the research institutes run by NIH. He would would review a congressional Republican proposal to slash the number of institutes and centers from 27 to 15, those with a view into his thinking told The Journal.Lizbet Boroughs, associate vice president of the Association of American Universities, told The Journal: Its not clear why wed roadblock the best chances of finding a cure for cystic fibrosis or cancer or Alzheimers by adding potentially political, nonresearch factors into medical-research grant decisions.Former director of the National Cancer Institute Ned Sharpless told the paper that Bhattacharya might find it hard to implement his changes. While he could change the rubric used to review grant applications, it may be difficult to get grant reviewers to follow his guidelines, Sharpless told the newspaper.Its much more complicated than it appears from the outside, he said of the top job at NIH.As many as 174 scientists on the NIH staff or who have received its funding have won a Nobel Prize, The Journal noted.NIH doles out as much as $25 billion in grants each year, which have led to major advances, including immunotherapy cancer treatments.","title":"Trumps Team Weighs Withholding Massive Research Grants From Universities That Are Too Woke: To take on what he views as academic conformity in science"},{"text":"Kent State is in Ohio.","title":"Russian TV host gleefully claims Trump's Cabinet will 'dismantle' America, report says"},{"text":"Have the day you voted for!","title":"Donald Trump's tariff plans will bankrupt Americans"},{"text":"Goodness I bet that cost the tax payer a pretty penny","title":"Diaper Don"},{"text":"And the demise of social security will ensure the end of middle class America.","title":"Donald Trump's tariff plans will bankrupt Americans"},{"text":"Popcorn?

The idea would be that with someone like Pam Bondi in the Justice department, you claim that the 2025 Virginia election was fraudulent (if the Dem wins), and you take steps to overturn that election.  Especially if you can get the secretary of state to issue a \\"corrected\\" vote total.Once that has happened you would claim correctly or incorrectly that the democratic governors of other states, specifically Maryland were involved in a conspiracy to use their national guards in rebellion.  You expel certain democratic congressmen, and then you pass an insurrection enforcement act to get rid of the likely problem governors and other power centers.  It would be an excuse to purge the bureaucracy of other \\"problems\\" as well.  And if they get away with it, they can do this to any state in the midterms.It would happen in 2025, because that is when trump will be most popular, and it will be easier to concentrate on one state.  It will also be difficult for the military to respond.  If Youngkin refuses to enforce the correct vote, then it would not be difficult to find a way to neutralize the Virginia national guard, and for another state to enforce it, then it would be playing into Trump's hands.

I have seen people claim that Biden appeased Republicans too much and was naive, believing that he could have good faith negotiations with them. Supposedly this is because he was old and was used to politics of a different era. People then say he was Republican-lite. Meanwhile Obama was supposedly much better at dealing with Republicans and didn't give in to all their demands. This is so stupid because if anything the opposite is true. Obama tried way too hard to compromise with conniving partisan right wingers who don't give a shit about anyone other than themselves. As a result, there wasn't a whole lot of progressive legislation passed aside from a few notable exceptions. On the other hand Biden without a doubt ran the most progressive government in US History for a long time, maybe since LBJ. The first two years of Biden's presidency were arguably more productive than the first two years of Obama's presidency. If anything wasn't accomplished, you could almost certainly blame Manchin, Sinema, Republicans in the House, or right wing judges in the courts blocking his agenda.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 6, 2024"},{"text":"Wow, this totally didn't occur to me!They want to crash the economy, destroy every institution and kill God knows how many people with pandemics to destroy and rebuild the country as a real life Gilead.The worst thing about it is that Margaret Atwood doesn't deserve the credit for predicting this, because she reiterates that Handmaid's Tale is no sci-fi, but is based on the real world events.","title":"Russian TV host gleefully claims Trump's Cabinet will 'dismantle' America, report says"},{"text":"I agree.","title":"Trump belittles leaders of Canada and Mexico at Fox Nations patriot awards"},{"text":"I agree.","title":"Trump belittles leaders of Canada and Mexico at Fox Nations patriot awards"},{"text":"Accumulating a net worth of like 350 billion","title":"Donald Trumps Washington: Not Your Typical Presidential Cabinet"},{"text":"Unreal.

A *pro forma* session still means the Senate could confirm the appointment if it wanted to, it's just choosing not to. Recess appointments weren't put in place to get around a Senate that doesn't *want* to confirm a nominee, so I don't think this qualifies as a shenanigan in the same sense. They aren't subverting the intent of the provision; they're accommodating it by making sure the Senate is available if needed.Trump *would* be subverting the intent, since the point is that the Senate is making *itself* unavailable and therefore there's a need for the President to be able to make timely appointments during that time. If Trump prorogues Congress just so that he can avoid the advice and consent of the Senate, then that's clearly contrary to the intent of allowing recess appointments in the first place.Similarly, the idea of being able to adjourn both chambers is predicated on the idea that, as a practical necessity, both chambers would need to adjourn for an extended time at some point, and because both chambers are needed to pass legislation, this time should coincide to minimize the amount of time where legislation cannot be passed. So if they can't agree on when the period where both are *allowed* to\\nbe adjourned for an extended time should fall, then the President picks the time. The idea was never that either chamber should be *prevented* from sitting, it was just assumed that members would need to take advantage of the extended recess whenever it takes place. In the modern day, there's clearly never a requirement for an extended recess for either chamber (since they usually just don't have one), and the Senate doesn't need the House for the advice and consent power regardless, so there's no reason that the House couldn't adjourn for an extended time with the permission of the Senate or the President while the Senate continues to sit and be available to consider presidential nominations should it choose to. Meaning there's no justification for the President to be able to *prorogue* the Senate just because the House might decide to take an extended recess which the Senate doesn't decide to take *as well*. The entire provision is based on practicalities that no longer exist.","title":"No, Trump Cant Just Dismiss the Senate | The threat from House Republicans should be seen and called out for what it is: an autocratic move that is not just unlawful but contemptuous of constitutionalism"},{"text":"Recount!","title":"Obama still doesnt get why Trump won.

It's not just going to be people that are here without legal standing, it will be anybody that looks like they're here without legal standing.Indeed. And you already see a lot of people and newspapers claim that this won't stand legally, or that it won't be properly organized, or that it the cost will be astronomical, ... But if you really want to do this, then chaos is exactly what you want. If you're going to infringe people's rights, you'd do it on such a scale that the legal system gets overwhelmed, so that any recourse, if it comes, comes when people's lives are already ruined. When you set up inadequate and illegal facilities, you then use that to justify improving (i.e. expanding) it, and use it as part of the \\"punishment\\". When your arrests are haphazard and random, then that only adds to the terror and it allows you to sweep more broadly when desired. You're basically designing an alternate enforcement / incarceration system that is so ad hoc that it could be used at your whim against anyone. Another benefit is that, once it's set up you'd want to legalize it, but not by adhering to the preexisting laws and standards but by lowering those standards to accommodate it. From that angle, the more illegal and haphazard it is, the more you get to dilute the laws and procedures later on. De facto erode as many rights as quickly as you can, and then worry about making it legal. I believe he needs to both co-opt the army and have his own personal guard of extreme loyalists in order to cement his power. He'll be able to get those now legitimized paramilitary organizations to do a lot of things that he will struggle to get the regular military to do, even with leaders that are loyal to him. One will be the hammer. The other will be a scalpel.pOr be played against one another. You see this in every authoritarian regime, where the leader needs a counter weight against any institution or fiefdom to keep himself secure. That's how you get competing intelligence services, official vs the unofficial army (e.g. contemporary Russia, Nazi germany), army vs. navy ... Ultimately, a dictator has no real legitimacy and needs to divide to rule, which is where much of the inefficiency of authoritarian regimes comes from.That said, it is hard to see how any militia could actually counter a force like the US army, both in political influence or power. Note that this never works out in the long run, and the paramilitaries almost always lose as they tend to be far less competent in an actual fight.","title":"No, Trump Cant Just Dismiss the Senate | The threat from House Republicans should be seen and called out for what it is: an autocratic move that is not just unlawful but contemptuous of constitutionalism"},{"text":"What about the cops that didnt arrest him at the scene and mocked the victim?","title":"Lock his ass up!"},{"text":"The working class who voted for him wont care about working class cred.

This kind of inequality, though, seems to be entirely outside of Obamas sphere of concern. Even the use of the word class in the phrase race and gender and class and sexual orientation is highly telling. The kind of centrist liberalism represented by Obama sees social justice in terms of making sure that the best and brightest members of each demographic group have an equal shot at rising to the top of society, where they can become CEOs themselves, or become politicians and participate in the process he rhapsodized about earlier, whereby bright and competent technocrats negotiate and compromise and hopefully advance our interests. When class is simply one more item on this list of identity characteristics, its clear that hes talking about making sure that particularly bright and deserving individuals from working-class backgrounds can rise to the top. Hes not interested in giving the working class as a whole more structural power in our economy or our society. In other words, this is the same old centrism.

Because he knows they will be loyal to him. Mind you at this point Trump will have suspended the Constitution especially the first amendment and he will go after any journalist that dares to call out what he's doing.Regimes that do use paramilitaries or extra-judicial killings, use it on a large scale. If you want to sow terror, you need to terrorize everyone. Anything less will simply invite a loss of support in the face of whatever resistance your actions generate.Which is why the very first thing he intends to do is terrorize millions of immigrants. It's not just going to be people that are here without legal standing, it will be anybody that *looks* like they're here without legal standing. As we know, this will progress to other groups beyond \\"illegal immigrants\\" in time. They also have new tools at their disposal that the Nazis didn't have with mass media, social media platforms, and the ability to spread misinformation unchecked. I believe he needs to both co-opt the army and have his own personal guard of extreme loyalists in order to cement his power. He'll be able to get those now legitimized paramilitary organizations to do a lot of things that he will struggle to get the regular military to do, even with leaders that are loyal to him.

The other will be a scalpel.p","title":"No, Trump Cant Just Dismiss the Senate | The threat from House Republicans should be seen and called out for what it is: an autocratic move that is not just unlawful but contemptuous of constitutionalism"},{"text":"Have you tried being born rich?","title":"Elon Musk Spent Over $250 Million to Help Elect Trump"},{"text":"I'm assuming the long barrel weapons are the only things they're finding and they're missing everything else, since they fail at their job 70% of the time.

Authoritarian regimes try to maintain a facade of normalcy in daily lives, because a large part of their enablers will be people who, above all, cling to a sense of social and moral hierarchy (i.e. reactionaries and conservatives), and anyone who unleashes chaos on the streets risks losing their support. That's why most authoritarian movements switch to using the normal implements of state power to do their violence and suborn or subsume their paramilitaries in them (usually removing the leaders in the process). They know full well that the people who support or enable them don't care as long as the bad things happen to other people (those lower on the social and moral hierarchy, for example), behind a facade of procedure and legality, and somewhere out of sight. Anything that stops them from pretending that they're supporting a normal government while living normal lives risks a loss of support.Regimes that do use paramilitaries or extra-judicial killings, use it on a large scale. If you want to sow terror, you need to terrorize everyone. Anything less will simply invite a loss of support in the face of whatever resistance your actions generate.So far, there doesn't seem to be anything suggesting that any of them want to use these militias. Rather, they seem to be moving to co-opt the army and various law enforcement agencies. This suggests the first approach, and frankly doesn't bode well for whoever leads these militias. Such lower tier leaders, with the ability to disrupt life and project power on the street but without the political clout to court the moneyed interests behind it all, tend to be the first to be purged, particularly if they are more radical in their beliefs than the guys at the top who just want power.","title":"No, Trump Cant Just Dismiss the Senate | The threat from House Republicans should be seen and called out for what it is: an autocratic move that is not just unlawful but contemptuous of constitutionalism"},{"text":"I mean, so was getting his mob to attack Congress.

Most of the time, fleet vehicles run specific routes, or are limited to set areas by design, so you can judge and incorporate maximum ranges much easier. In many cases, including for USPS purposes, fleet vehicles do not require extensive towing capacity. At the same time, the benefits are more pronounced in fleet vehicles. The cost of electricity is far less susceptible to price fluctuations, which is great if its just your commuter vehicle, but is phenomenal if you are operating tens (or hundreds) of thousands of vehicles.

This election was decided by a few people in the battleground states who couldn't make up their minds who was worse. This is more fodder for them to forgive and forget any future actions taken by a Trump administration to pardon J6ers, drag the names of innocent people through the mud, stick them in jail, and pardon themselves. I do not think Hunter Biden should have been preemptively pardoned, for the same reason.In the case that an election exists in 2028 even with voting restricted to one day, only if the masses who support Democrats act in a principled way can they gather others to their cause. People are losing sight of that and are feeling retributive toward Trump voters.One counter-point that I think about is that this move calls the bluff of Republicans to actually stand for limiting and checking the pardon. But I don't think anyone thinks that will actually happen, or perhaps it will happen perhaps only after Republicans start to lose power.","title":"Trumps F.B.I. Pick Has an Enemies List.

He mismanaged COVID at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden. And now, Trump will be inheriting a growing economy for the second time.- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans exploited both opportunities to point fingers at their opponents, choosing to take advantage of a crisis for political gain and campaign talking points.- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% - Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump put pressure on the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge.- The Trump administration hamstringed the labor movement and made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.- Trump shirked responsibility for the pandemic and encouraged his supporters to politicize every aspect of COVID, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*To elaborate more on Trump's tariffs:Most economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.This was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency.And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression.The process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations, things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved, and risks that Trump failed to take into account. Trump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.They will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources to manage the fallout. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesTrump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the outcomes are estimated to be severe for many Americans. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \\"national sales tax.\\"Trump is not an \\"economic genius,\\" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. Trump has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has often profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:- Trump Casinos and Hotels \\n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\\n- Trump Magazine\\n- Trump Airlines\\n- Trump Beverages\\n- Trump \\"The Game\\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\\n- Trump Mortgages\\n- Trump Steaks\\n- Trump Travel Site\\n- Trumpnet\\n- Trump Tower Tampa\\n- Trump Vodka\\n- Trump Fragrances\\n- Trump Mattress\\n- Trump Network\\n- Tour de Trump\\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\\n- Truth Social (why not call it \\"Trump Social\\" at this point?)Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.He has profited off of screwing over people who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties for decades, he even lied to get on the Forbes list.Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money, particularly from his father and from banks, avoiding paying income tax for many years, amassing unsustainable debts, then dumping them onto others.Then his lucky break, The Apprentice. By the show's premiere, Trump had squandered his riches, but the show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.Donald Trump is not some financial guru, his administrations \\"economic achievements,\\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.The next Trump administration will destroy what's left of the labor movement, which has been in steady decline ever since Reagan stepped into office. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of a crowd of union workers, where he said he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.Over the next four years, the MAGA coalition will use Trump to implement an agenda that will continue to redistribute wealth to the top.Even Trump's immigration policies, and his plan for the \\"mass deportation\\" of immigrants, will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP.","title":"Donald Trump's tariff plans will bankrupt Americans"},{"text":"As opposed to the American spyware we all have installed on our phones? (E.G. Facebook, Google, Amazon, &amp; Shitter)\\nI've been back &amp; forth on how I feel about the ban. I agree wholeheartedly that TikTok &amp; social media in general does significantly more harm than good. But, banning TikTok won't solve the problem, nor do I think it will even help all that much. Once TikTok is banned, another app with a new paint job will immediately rise from the ashes &amp; we're back to square one. The main problem is the predatory algorithm they use that keeps you watching shit that you really shouldn't.\\n If you're very careful, you could manage to make the For You page all about cute cat videos &amp; knitting tutorials.

It's so easy for a lonely kid to watch an Andrew Tate or a Jordan Peterson video &amp; get sucked into the far right scam because they initially said something that makes sense. \\nBUT, it's not just social media. It's also a failure of the parents who either refuse to or who literally can't devote time to monitoring their kids either. And for those who don't have the time to parent because they're working two jobs &amp; taking care of their elderly parents, the fault lies with capitalism for preventing people from being able to live their lives. \\nIn summary, TikTok is a problem, but it's not even close to being the main problem.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 6, 2024"},{"text":"But people tried to make her out to be the villain, I remember that shit!!!

If they hear climate change they say no, if you ask them if they think utility monopolies should shoulder more costs and consumers pay less considering companies are moving towards renewables (which will eventually be more profitable and economical anyways they just want to milk every penny in the mean time) but they will say no. As someone who grew up in the deep red south it is a mystery how reality and facts has been construed and manipulated to such a degree but when you enter some of these churches you start to see why. Every Republican voter I have ever met has bizarre and outlandish views on Christianity. You want to solve this problem you are going to have upset the religious left to start calling this shit out for what it is. Religion is destroying our academic and political institutions because we let whining religious people complain when institutions try to be neutral or we do nothing when rich powerful Christian governments or school boards infringe their beliefs every where they go, but because some of the left aligns themselves that way they turn a blind eye until it gets extreme but then there is no momentum to even try to change it. We have let religion mostly Christian fanaticism infiltrate and manipulate our public government institutions. There has got to be stronger stand of separation of church and state, but at the same time our registered voters are obviously dominated predominantly by religious ideology and have to find new to ways to remind and shed light to the dangers of it, but they are so goddamn delusional it is like arguing with a tree and that is where I am truly not sure what to do besides the way humans recover from failures before they make mistake after mistake until enough shit is on our faces we finally do something about it","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene loudly booed as she rages against trans rights in misinformation-filled rant"},{"text":"I'm certain there's an economist somewhere who got a Nobel prize off of Neoliberalism, if not several.","title":"Trump Has Handed Democrats a Fast Way to Build Some Working-Class Cred"},{"text":"What do you mean exaggerated?
