During these two years they have to not only work their sector with slower coordination times in a highly complex airspace but they have to train new controllers. Training new controllers in that airspace takes a long time and most will fail. New York Tracon and the Newark sector are dangerously understaffed and this move has only hurt aviation safety in the NYC area.?\\nIt's not as simple as hiring more controllers or moving controllers from other airports to Philadelphia to work Newark or Long Island to work NY Tracon.

Bottom line is Pete not blocking that move has resulted in increased delays in an already congested airspace and has negativity affected aviation safety in the NYC area.\\nEdit- love the down votes for posting something factual about one of Pete's failures that has made aviation less safe and increased delays in air travel.","title":"Trump taps Sean Duffy, Fox host and former Congressman, for Transportation Secretary"},{"text":"posse comitatus just isn't a thing anymore?","title":"Remember Trump said these deportations would be a Bloody story"},{"text":"\\\\ and its complete negligence to pretend otherwiseIs determined ignorance a phrase yet?","title":"Jen Psaki Doesn't Get It, and That's a Good Thing for Republicans"},{"text":"Xeteo and Midas and Guardian all the way","title":"MSNBC 'Morning Joe' Hosts Meet with Trump, Plan New Approach to Coverage"},{"text":"Should be closer in raw total.

In light of all of these being a threat to their lives, ushering in fascism is the only way to get rid of all perceived undesirables.Unfortunately the Democratic party en masse is too stupid to accept this rise in sentiment and has instead done everything to pander to those groups of people who would never vote for them to begin with, alienating progressives who would have otherwise voted. In a nation of stagnation, the people want big and radical changes, and the only party offering radical change in the last decade is the party of fascists.Until Democrats embrace actual sweeping changes that the working class will listen to AND market them heavily and consistently (wage increase, universal healthcare, tax reform, increased maternity/paternity leave + protections, rising costs of goods and services), fascism will continue to win.","title":"Project what now?

But that wouldn't be an issue as it would quite literally be Democracy in action since it came with Congressional approval. in both branchesThere are 3 branches.

The claim generally being made isn't that one Haitian ate one cat; it's that Haitian immigrants are taking and eating dogs and cats. That this is something the members of the Haitian community in general or a significant section of the community are doing. And with such claims, one has to look at whether available credible information supports or does not support those claims. In Springfield, the local police and government officials have come out to report that they have received  0 credible reports of Haitian immigrants taking and eating people's pets. There's no records of any notable increase in pets being taken/going missing.  If Haitian immigrants where taking and eating pets in any significant way, the city would likely have gotten some sort of credible reports of it happening or at least some noticeable increase in missing pets in recent years. The lack of credible evidence would indicate that Haitian immigrants in Springfield as a group likely aren't going around eating people's pets. From that it is reasonable to think that the claims of Haitians eating pets are generally false, unless or until some credible evidence emerged of Haitian people eating pets.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"Trump could personally tell them he raised prices while he raped their children and they'd still praise him.","title":"Ramaswamy: We expect certain agencies to be deleted outright"},{"text":"Jon Jones assaults women.

Propaganda Strategy C Tactical Focus:\\n  - **Leverage Republican Fiscal Rhetoric:** Republicans have established a strong narrative around \\"fiscal responsibility\\" by highlighting Democratic spending as wasteful. To counter this, the strategy must focus on isolating specific Republican-backed spending initiatives that can be framed as wasteful or controversial.\\n  - **Amplify Small Issues:** Even minor expenditures must be framed as disproportionately wasteful by leveraging Republican tactics of exaggerating issues.\\n  - **Narrow Focus on Deficits:** Target Republican bills or programs that involve deficits or overspending while holding them accountable for contradictions between their fiscal policies and actual spending.\\n  - **Create an Opposition Trap:** Frame these wasteful programs in such a way that Republicans must either defend them (and appear out of touch) or distance themselves (and lose credibility with their base). 2. Tactical Amplification C Identify Vulnerable Programs:\\n- **Small but Symbolic Expenditures:** Focus on programs that have small, yet impactful financial implications. These are often overlooked, but through targeted messaging, can be amplified to appear as egregious.\\n  - Example: Programs with minuscule but controversial budgets (e.g., specific military contractors, corporate subsidies) can be made to appear as emblematic of Republican waste.\\n  - **Public Misconceptions:** Utilize areas where the public might not have full insight, but where media coverage and strategic messaging can help create outrage.\\n  \\n- **Contrast with Republican Rhetoric:**\\n  - **Tax Cuts:** Publicize programs where Republicans have proposed large-scale cuts to taxes for corporations and the wealthy while simultaneously funding controversial or wasteful initiatives. Frame this contrast as hypocrisy.\\n  - **Highlight Republican Opposition:** Identify instances where Republicans oppose universally supported, beneficial programs (e.g., middle-class tax cuts) to amplify their inconsistency. 3. Surgical Leverage C Amplifying Specific Programs:\\n- **Focus on Single, High-Impact Issues:**\\n  - Choose one or two small but symbolic Republican-backed programs to target at a time. These should be issues with limited but public-facing budgets that can be portrayed as emblematic of larger wastefulness.\\n  - Example: Exaggerate the financial inefficiencies of funding high-cost, low-impact programs (e.g., corporate tax breaks, military contracts with minimal public benefit).- **Exploit the Media:**  \\n  - Create or identify media narratives around these programs and use them as wedge issues.\\n  - Use specific, easy-to-understand statistics or figures to illustrate waste.\\n  - Tie the program to broader national concerns (e.g., deficit spending, social welfare) to make the issue feel larger.\\n  \\n- **Utilize Public Outrage Mechanisms:**  \\n  - Amplify through social media and grassroots campaigning. Encourage public discourse, creating a feedback loop where the issue becomes larger due to media and public amplification.\\n  - Use shareable infographics, easy-to-read statistics, and impactful, emotionally charged messaging.\\n  \\n- **Highlight Republican Denials or Defenses:**  \\n  - If Republicans defend the spending, strategically highlight their defense as detached from reality, out of touch with public concerns, or hypocritical based on their stated fiscal positions. 4. Messaging Efficiency C High-Impact Communication:\\n- **Clear, Direct Messaging:**  \\n  - Use simple, direct language to highlight the wastefulness of Republican programs. Focus on the financials (e.g., \\"X million dollars spent on Y\\") and how it contrasts with the Republican narrative of fiscal conservatism.\\n  - Example: Focus on high-cost defense projects or corporate tax breaks and position them as wasteful spending that harms the American people.- **Visual Tools:**  \\n  - Create clear, concise visual content to distill complex issues into easy-to-digest narratives (e.g., comparison charts, meme-style posts).- **Emotional Appeal:**  \\n  - Tie the wasteful spending narrative to real-world consequences for ordinary people (e.g., cuts to social services, education, or healthcare), turning the Republican program into a symbol of negligence. 5. Political Leverage C Force Strategic Positioning:\\n- **Trap Republican Responses:**\\n  - Frame the issue in such a way that any Republican response either:\\n    - Forces them to defend the spending (making them appear out of touch), or\\n    - Forces them to distance themselves, creating division within their party.- **Undermine Republican Authority on Fiscal Responsibility:**\\n  - By showcasing these targeted, wasteful programs, undermine the Republican claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility and budget management.\\n  - Frame this as a moral issue (spending taxpayer money wastefully) to generate stronger emotional responses from the public.# Key Contextual Considerations:\\n- **Public Sentiment:** Leverage public dissatisfaction with perceived waste in government. Even small expenditures, when framed as wasteful or disproportionate, can trigger outrage.\\n  \\n- **Timing and Relevance:** Use specific moments of fiscal or budgetary discussions (e.g., federal budget debates, election cycles) to raise these issues at the most impactful time.\\n  \\n- **Framing Tactics:** Use terms like \\"fiscal irresponsibility,\\" \\"wasteful spending,\\" \\"corporate handouts,\\" or \\"inefficient government programs\\" to consistently reinforce the narrative.","title":"What programs do republicans fund that can be considered wasteful or controversial?

Secondly you are depriving the world of a murderer over the period they are imprisoned. Thirdly, ideally (and this seems to be rarely the case in practice) correctional facilities are supposed to be correctional soJ would hope that yes, immigrant or no, prison should decrease the chances of repeat offence.On your?second point, this is unworkable and unjust idea in practice. A country, simply by virtue of its geography as neighbour to an unstable nation, should not be shouldered with the responsibility of accepting all or many of its asylum seekers simply by virtue of geography alone. A diffuse distribution of asylum seekers where they can be feasibly accommodated is far more equitable and less likely to lead to international resentment.?This is a great cause of resentment between Mediterranean countries and their northern neighbours in the EU for instance.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Going to cut into their record profit and exploding CEO salaries....Poor corperations will have to wipe their tear away with only $50 bill not $100s.Having to paid legal citizens to work jobs.","title":"Trump admin prepared to declare national emergency and use military assets to carry out mass deportations"},{"text":"Edging closer to 1930's Germany","title":"Trump Says Its TRUE He Will Declare National Emergency and Use Military to Mass Deport Millions"},{"text":"Democrats are well aware of the ramifications of another Trump administration, aka the DC Dumpster Fire.","title":"Democratic voters experiencing schadenfreude watching Trump's next term coming together ..."},{"text":"Youve got a really good mindset!but yeah US schools suck.

The idea that we should be letting in any and everyone is ridiculous to me, and the idea that we should allow undocumented immigrants to live here is also ridiculous. The decision of \\"who gets to move to our country\\" shouldn't be based on historical precedent or anything like that. There's hardly going to be enough to go around for the people already here in the future. I have no idea about the viability of his economic policies, I don't have a deep understanding of economic theory but I don't think he will cause the economy to collapse. If it's a legitimately idiotic move to instate tariffs like he says he intends to do, I trust the rest of the government to protect (if nothing else) the financials in a broad sense. It's not like the economy was Biden's fault either. I also appreciate his desire to expand the power of the executive, but I know that's an unpopular view. I like J.D. Vance quite a bit, and I don't think RFK is nearly as much of a conspiracy theorist as people say. Elon Musk is super weird and I don't like him being involved at all.

What really made an impact was seeing my peers of color hurt in ways I never considered. With people being so isolated, they get into a feedback loop that confirms their bias.

There are a variety of factors that affect people's likelihood of receiving a college education. Growing up an area where there is a decent quality of education increases one's chances of getting into college, while being educated in schools that have a lower quality of education, less resources, and poorer funding will tend to decrease one's chances of getting into college. If you grow up in a lower income family, it's harder to afford to go to college than someone from a wealthier family. I have two master's degrees. I had to rely on scholarships and student loans to afford college and relied on help from family. If those things weren't available, I wouldn't have been able to go to college, no matter how intelligent I am. My father wasn't able to go college when he was young. Not because he wasn't smart, but because he grew up in a low income family and had to work to help support his family. Socio-economic inequalities on the family and community level, as well as state and national level support for education, effect the likelihood of a person being able to attend college. Additionally, factors such a whether a person's preferred career requires a degree or involves some other form of preparation, can effect personal decisions on whether to pursue a college education. For instance, if you are intelligent person who is interested a more manual or craft based trade, you may opt for pursuing vocational/trade based training and certification rather than going to college. Additionally, there are broader factors beyond intelligence that can shape people's partisan inclinations. A person's community life, social relations, the kind of media they watch, the kind of news they read, etc... can effect their general opinions on different political parties and certain policies. While intelligence can help with independent thinking, a person being surrounded with people who are mostly aligned with the same party and/or mainly getting their information from sources that favor a certain party, can make them more likely to align with that party. Furthermore, each of the major parties have tended to focus on reaching out to certain subsets of the population to appeal to them, try to convince most of those in those subsets their party is more favorable to their interests, and seeking to mobilize to vote for their party. With that, major parties may align themselves to supporting certain issues that certain subsets of Americans care deeply about and to convince people that they should side with their party. An intelligent person who care deeply about a certain issue, may side with a certain issue or issues may align with a certain party because advancing preferred policies on these issues is their priority. And this may lead to them overlooking or minimizing other policies that they don't agree with or may think are stupid. Also, when it comes to intelligence, being smart doesn't necessarily make one immune to being mislead or convinced of ridiculous things. In my years in academia, scholarship, and political and community involvement, I've come across all sorts of intelligent people, who are normally informed and thoughtful, who have been convinced of some pretty misguided or ridiculous ideas/positions. Often its connected to some faulty idea that they haven't sufficiently thought over, some unconscious bias that they haven't recognized and addressed through critical thinking, a lack of exposure to more sensible ideas on an issues, and/or some heavy emotional attachment to certain ideas and positions. Sometimes a person being smart and knowledgeable in certain aspects can lead them to become overconfident about their understanding of other topics. And finally, the type of views that an intelligent, informed member of a party may have a different view of an issue than how an average or lower informed member of that party may have. For instance, there a Republican aligned scholars and economists who favor increased tariffs. Their support is generally not because they think tariffs will make things cheaper. They recognize that tariffs will make foreign made products subject to them more expensive, but that making them more expensive can help enable domestic manufactures/producers to produce things at a relatively more competitive price, and favor the growth of American industries. They believe that the potential growth in American manufacturing and domestic production would have a net-positive effect on the country's economy in comparison to the increased prices.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"Oh cool, more rights being stripped from people that MAGA told me wouldn't have their rights stripped.

We saw this recently to our disadvantage with topics like Dobbs where, no, Biden couldn't just make Mississippi or Florida have reasonable abortion laws. Now there are a ton of blue states which will fight anything unconstitutional. Most swing states (NC, MI, WI, MN, AZ, PA) have Dem governors, NV has a GOP gov but state assembly and senate D majority, states like KS, KY, have Dem governors, etc. And that's even before considering the lower courts and SCOTUS (which while it has a conservative lean, at least 5-7 of the 9 are not complete hacks depending on topic, and even Alito and Thomas have rejected some crazier right-wing stuff).* The GOP thrive as obstructionists and destructionists. They struggle to enact or create. When they have power, as we saw in 2016 when they had a larger 241-191 House majority and 52-48 Senate majority, they still struggled to do more than weaken (not obliterate, thankfully) the ACA and pass tax cuts for the rich. This time around there are more MAGA faithful in power but their margins are still weaker. It's easier to mess up a working system but harder to create a system that does active harm.* The GOP coalition is more fragmented and smaller than it looks. If the post-election takes are correct, enough people voted GOP because of economic anxiety, not because they care about illegal immigrants or LBGTQ or whatever. When people see Trump spending more time dealing with that than the economy, or see worse gas/food/shop prices because of his economic plan, then they'll be ripe for swinging back to Dems in 2026 and 2028.

SCOTUS ruled that states don't have the power to keep someone off the ballot for insurrection because the 14th Amendment, specifically Section 5, states that the power to enforce the provisions of the 14th lie only with Congress. Ergo, CO Supreme Court could not make the decision to keep him off the ballot for engaging in treason or insurrection, only Congress can.

However, due to general understaffing in ICE they don't have the capacity to go pick up each and every immigrant convicted of any crime and deport them.Instead they focus on deporting those convicted of major crimes, reoffendors and those who have been deported multiple times once they have completed their jail time.Those with minor offenses are released from jail and basically told to self deport.Now the problem with the plan by Trump and the Republicans is that they have explicitly said that it will not stop with illegal immigrants.  They have stated publicly that they plan to also go after legal immigrants and first generation citizens by denaturalizing them, revoking citizenship and deporting them somewhere..  You do not have to be a criminal either to be subject to denaturalization and deportation according to what they have stated publicly.Trump has stated publicly in various interviews that he wants to deport between 2 and 24 million people.  You cannot do this without setting up detention camps to process people out.  This will make the immigrant detention camps set up in trumps first presidency seem like child's play and those were BAD.  People DIED in those camps and were abused starved and raped by the guards.  Many people were straight up lost in the system because of poor records.  We literally have no idea what happened to them.  Families were separated and children were given to fly by night non profits and foster families and disappeared never to be found.  Do you think things will be any better when the sheer scale is multiplied by 50-100x what we saw before?That's what people are worried about.Incidentally, if you are a Christian, the Bible is VERY clear on how immigrants should be treated.  They are to be welcomed and treated as a loved one or neighbor.  This plan is BLATENTLY against the teachings of Christ and the word of God.  You literally cannot be a Christian if you support this.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Real World - Road Rules - Congressman - Fox News Host - Presidential Cabinet position","title":"Trump taps Sean Duffy, Fox host and former Congressman, for Transportation Secretary"},{"text":"Great.

As generous and kind as we are as a nation, have you considered the fact that our actions are almost always done for economic or security reasons and not human rights or benevolence? I guess, from your view I dont think youve considered that we may need them more than they need us. Even the criminals, I assume those who committed violent offenses are likely in prison and not roaming the streets. Or that there are reasons why neither political party has ever demanded mass deportation before. To the criminal point, if someone is a criminal it means they have been convicted of a crime (people are innocent until proven guilty, so were not talking about people we assume might be committing them). Some crimes are like having marijuana or may reflect a bad decision and not bad character, being in America without authorization isnt itself a crime and many who are undocumented came into America legally, they are violating a law but not committing a crime. So, to be clear, were talking about criminals, people who have been convicted of committing a crime. And were talking about all immigrants, people from all other countries and all economic classes and educational backgrounds. If our system is just, it should be enforced equally to a wealthy businessman who had a DUI ten years ago, as a sex trafficker, a poor laborer who assaulted someone, and drug dealers. Wed also need to consider that violent crimes, like murder or aggravated robbery tend to carry long minimum prison terms and these individuals are likely in prison. We dont like wasting money, so why do you think wed prefer to house these criminals now instead of deport them when convicted? For example, under your law we would deport El Chapo back to Mexico.It sounds like something everyone would agree to in general, but I think thats because a lot of us automatically assume who you are talking about and thats not the reality of who it would involve. People who have committed a crime are not automatically a net negative to society, in fact most are still a net positive, see Martha Stewart. A farm owner would likely not want to lose all of their workers who were caught with weed in the past. Until we have the skill and ability to replace the labor they provide, or we are going to be discriminate in how we apply our laws, I dont think this idea is as good in practice as it sounds on paper.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I realize this week that I hadnt gone to McD since Trump's cosplay day.

It's all good!Whenever someone starts acting up about this stuff, I usually just cock my head to the side and ask them why they're upset. Digging into it tends to break their arguments apart. Again, not a 100% fix for this, but it's a starting point that could help to cut into the margins.Asking a question is an incredibly powerful strategy for situations like this.  Because asking the question means you care about the answer.  And it forces the other person to think about the answer.  And the thing is, these folks often haven't thought about the answer before.  That's how biases work.  Sometimes, it's just enough to make them go 'huh, guess that idea actually doesn't make sense'.  Maybe not in the moment, but it's part of the process.And from an electoral standpoint, I'm also a fan of the head-on approach.  When we're ashamed of what we support, people pick up on that.  And we don't want to create the impression that supporting rights for everyone is shameful.  We can stand strongly for women having full access to the halls of power, and make it clear that this doesn't mean men get left behind.  Won't convince everyone, but can convince lots of them.Finally, I see what you did here, even if unintentionally:I know of people who have made the argument that Democrats either ignore or neglect men, and have brought up different bits of messaging or an official campaign page (I need to find this) where there are sections speaking about pretty much every group except men (or white men).I'd instead grab the two articles on Harris' extremely detailed plans for men I linked in this little rant.

The people chosen signal things about the incoming admins approach, or commitment to various issues. It also serves to elevate potential future political stars into the limelight, or more shallowly, to pay back favors to those who may helped bring the admin into power (see, e.g. Mayor Pete at DOT under Biden for the former, RFK Jr at HHS for the latter).\\nFor #2: non-cabinet level officials absolutely set policy, although on a smaller scale. Federal departments are *big*. Orders from up top might be vague, openly defined (well see if that changes in our post-*Chevron* world), or even just aspirational. The deputy or assistant folks are tasked with figuring that outwhich inherently involves some policy decisions for which the boss simply wont have time.Ill also add: picks from within the military, former military, or other parts of the security apparatus are not entirely uncommon picks to lead DoD.

Its based on racism- to go back to the Jim Crow era.  Almost all of these people are also Christians, of one denomination or another, but a large part are Evangelical &amp; Catholic, &amp; believe in the Book of Revelation in the Bible, that when Jerusalem becomes the Capitol of Israel, several other prophetic things will happen, a lot of war, including a False Prophet, who is Trump, or Trump is like a King Cyrus, who wasnt a believer but helped the people of God.  Its some crazy ludicrous shit, but most of the militia groups, who are heavily armed, believe that they will eventually be called to fight for God, &amp; they see Trump as sent by God, theyre ready to jump in, weapons &amp; all, as they did on Jan 6, 2021, &amp; fight for Trump.  Trump has met with these groups many times &amp; hes promised them a government based on Christian Theocracy, so, if you look at his top-level candidates, most, by far, (Pete Hegseth, Trumps candidate to head the Dept of Defense, has a multitude of White Christian Nationalist tattoos all over him, underneath where shirts &amp; pants can cover up), are supported by the Heritage Foundation ppl who devised &amp; wrote Project 2025, who Trump says now that he will follow (surprise?  He lied AGAIN when he was campaigning &amp; said he didnt know anything about 2025).  The appointment of US Supreme Court Justices &amp; many Federal justices by Trump, that are strong anti-abortion, are supported by these White Christian Nationalist groups, whos agenda is to take control of the US, States (theyve already done so in many of the Midwest &amp; Southern states), &amp; local governments, change the laws &amp; the Constitutions to support Christian values (like anti-abortion), as they see it (Jesus Christ was a strong advocate of &amp; preached to love &amp; help the poor,the sick, like immigrants, etc., but when those ppl are POC, I guess the Word of God doesnt apply in those situations).  Trump is obviously, the farthest a person can get from believing in God or any religion, but hell give his followers what they want as long as the back him, donate to him, support him &amp; will vote for him.

I have heard from other nay sayers online about the tariffs that the product is still more expensive because then there is a tariff on the raw materials.  I have actually found this not to be true due to a loophole in the tariff system.Here is how it works. A company has a part manufacturing plant in, say, Mexico and an assembly  plant in the US.  The parts made by the company in Mexico are not considered an import because the parts are coming from company A. in Mexico to company A. In the US, there is no money transfer, so it is just transporting to parts.So, in the end, the company is not paying more for the parts, but they did create jobs here to avoid the import tariff of the assembled product!","title":"Tariff rant"},{"text":"I think the declaration of the national emergency will be the national emergency....maybe we can get Letterman to do an ongoing \\"Stupid President Tricks\\" segment.","title":"Trump Says Its TRUE He Will Declare National Emergency and Use Military to Mass Deport Millions"},{"text":"And was colluding with Harris yea really interesting","title":"Trump calls for probe of famed Iowa pollster J.

Additionally, many people who make below the amount needed to even pay income tax, bitch about taxes - when the only taxes they actually pay are payroll taxes. Ironically it's the GOP who opposes raising the cap on social security tax, so that rich people even have to pay it on most of their income, when currently they don't.And now people are self-owning themselves and wanting to go from a system where if you are poor you pay no income tax, to one where there's functionally a flat tax and the bulk of the tax burden is on people who currently pay no income tax -- but yeah sure, say these fools, abolish income tax so instead of getting refunded all my withholdings back at the end of the year, I can pay a tax on every good I purchase.People with zero investments were complaining about taxing unrealized gains for people who make millions a year.

I think I understand it now. It's an answer with many parts. 1. We lost the popular vote because we lost the most ground in safe blue states, and particularly in the high population ones. California trended R+8, New York trended R+11, Illinois trended R+7, New Jersey trended R+10, Massachusetts trended R+9, and Maryland trended R+6. A troubling fact is that Republicans did twice as good on average in safe blue states. The average trend for the swing states and likely Democratic states is R+3. The average in the safe blue states is R+6. That's a lot of votes lost. 2. Republicans overperformed in Texas and Florida. Texas and Florida are the 2nd and 3rd most populated states, and Republicans did crazy good in them. Florida trended R+9 and Texas disappointingly trended R+8. These hugely populated states decided that Trump was their guy, taking potentially millions of votes from us. 3.Not enough time. This one is somewhat speculative so bear with me. I saw a poll that validating something I was concerned about. It said that swing voters who decided before September went to Trump by a large margin, but in the next 3 months they broke for Harris by a large margin. She was winning people over, but she just didn't have enough time. If she had the normal amount of time to campaign, I really think she would be favored to win. I truly believe we had a winning campaign that was let down by a time crunch, economic anxiety, and a worldwide anti-incumbent sentiment.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 18, 2024"},{"text":"You don't know how reality works, so I'll take all you say with a grain of salt.","title":"Apparently Ireland is anti Trump"},{"text":"Why should you be paying taxes on any form of tip?

Have you seen how the price of eggs went up and down? Why did the price of eggs come down? Did corporations suddenly lose the profit motive?  ?Claiming that gas prices post 2020 were down because of Trump and not low fuel demand during the Pandemic, and believing that theyre back up again because of Biden and not higher demand. Everyone should know how supply and demand works. So, youre probably rights about gas prices in 2020, but generally Democrats have been more environmentalist and for restricting the supply of gas. And you know how supply and demand works right? ? Hive mind/ Taking things at face value. Immigrants are eating cats and dogs because Trump said so. The weather is controlled by democrats because a GOP rep said so. Climate change isnt a legit issue because Trump thinks its a hoax. The problem with the climate change issue is that environmentalists care about climate change for the completely wrong reasons and they exaggerate the problem. Man can and should change the environment to be better for himself to live, even if that means to detriment of other living beings. Environmentalists are generally against that, so the solutions they offer are generally bad for man. You know which side is primarily responsible for distrust in mainstream media? Its the intellectuals who have been pushing that objectivity is impossible in news. You know what side they tend to vote?","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"Mommm meatloaf!?","title":"Attorney Says Matt Gaetz Paid 2 Women For Sex"},{"text":"Thats legitimately terrifying.","title":"Donald Trump Is Preparing to Use the Military to Carry Out Mass Deportations"},{"text":"It's OK to make fun of an ugly person only if they're also ugly on the inside.","title":"Attorney Says Matt Gaetz Paid 2 Women For Sex"},{"text":"Yeah, they are definitely laughing behind your back lol.

Once you make the vehicles small (typically anything called a pod) and not traveling on a predefined route, you end up with a private car but worse.

Thinking prices on groceries are high due to the Economy and not corporate price gouging. The economy affects everyone, and these corporations would not be making record profit if it was just an economy issue. Once again this could be proven with research but no research is ever done.I'm just going to pick on one specific claim that I think is clearly wrong, but I think it's a significant one since inflation was probably the biggest pain point in this election: **Corporate price gouging has close to zero explanatory power as a source of inflation.**1) General corporate greediness is already priced into the market. Corporations have been greedy ever since the first corporation was invented. Their structure necessitates it because their primary fiduciary obligation is to their shareholders. So corporate greed can't explain fluctuations in inflation. Why did it specifically shoot up circa 2020-22?2) Greed doesn't lead to price gouging. Corporations are subject to both *price effects* and *quantity effects*. Corporations make more money per unit by raising prices, but they sell more units in total by lowering prices. These two effects settle at an equilibrium; they don't lead to unbounded price increases. A purely greedy corporation has every reason to keep prices low enough that it can't be undercut by other greedy competitors who would love to capture its market share.3) Inflation describes the relationship between the amount of money in circulation and the amount of real value in the economy. The average price of goods in the economy can't change unless one half of that equation changes. Any explanation blaming corporate greed would need to explain how corporations are somehow raising the money supply or else why corporations have an incentive to *reduce* output, which hurts their own bottom line.4) The main explanation given in the OP is that \\"corporations [made] record profits,\\" but that's not true. The stock market was in shambles for almost the [entire duration of COVID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash). Specific companies like Amazon made record profits, but isn't that what you'd expect? With everyone forced inside and onto the Internet, the one sector that benefits massively is the tech sector.And then to turn to Kamala's proposed anti-price gouging laws:A) Normal price gouging laws target specific products at narrowly defined times. E.g. \\"No raising gasoline prices in the immediate aftermath of a hurricane.\\" She never defined even in her longform policy document exactly what she had in mind, but if her proposal looks anything like existing price gouging laws, it would have vanishingly little impact on inflation because these laws are not intended to tackle broad, sustained price increases.B) These laws are not even obviously good things! While there's a lot of intuitive appeal to \\"don't let corporations jack up prices to take advantage of people facing disaster,\\" those high prices reflect a real change in market demand: all of a sudden, a huge number of people want a very limited supply of gasoline. If prices don't rise to match, you face problems like people overstocking gasoline to hoard it, or overbuying it to scalp it and claim that profit for themselves. High prices push consumers to only buy as much as they *need*, which prevents shortages and allows limited supplies of gas to go further.C) Kamala's campaign messaging suggested she might have had something more expansive than the above in mind because she kept pitching anti-price gouging legislation as a solution to grocery costs which, per (A), the above laws wouldn't affect. And if we're talking about longterm sustained regulations on the price of a wide variety of products at supermarkets, now we're entering the territory of *price controls*, which are almost universally hated by economists because they create structural shortages of basic goods as prices aren't allowed to rise to meet demand.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"Cry more, this video has not been posted here ever.","title":"Reddit is compromised"},{"text":"This interview is literally insane.

If Trump does rock up and start mass deportations on day 1, it's not going to be that simple. Those who are caught will need to be detained, processed and then deported. Now there's apparently 10+ million illegals in America and they'll need to be held somewhere until they're deported.So if prisons are ruled out as they're overcrowded already, then there is a good chance that additional detention centres will need to be built to house the immigrants until they are ready for deportation. That's more than likely at the cost of the taxpayers. And this process will take ages. Deportation isn't exactly quick at the best of times, but mass deportation could take years.So this raises 2 questions from me.1) Are Trump voters aware that as tax payers, they're on the hook to cover the cost for new holding and deportation facilities?2) Mobilising the military and declaring a state of emergency for mass deportation is one way to ramp up civil unrest, but are we also going to see the MAGA cult harass and possibly endanger innocent people?

Now Ill explain some different interpretations of republican stances:Tariffs will not lower prices but will help balance out the domestics foreign production costs. Its cheaper to produce in China because workers rights are not protected. People save money at the expense of the workers. Ideally workers rights should be enforced and protected everywhere but since we cant enforce that the least we can do is reduce the finical incentive to exploit workers. There is also a potential for reducing income tax by increasing tax revenue from tariffs. Abortion ban. Trump has never spoken in support of a national abortion ban his stance is that it should be up to the states. Which is how it is now, if democrats could change that why didnt they during this Biden Harris term? Less government spending to reduce inflation. This is one of the main differences between conservatives and liberals both stances are valid. At the end of the day the differences in opinion stem from differences in values. There are dumb people on both sides and in a such a large nation its easy to find extremely dumb takes to point at. Doesnt mean that stance represents the entire party.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"I'm trying to figure out what his wife's problem is/was.

I pointed out that the feminist movement was built on the foundation of egalitarianism so in a way, he should want to see more recognition of rights for others beyond straight, white men if thats what he really believed in.Trying to give examples of how women of color like myself still need to work extra hard on certain things to show him that white men are still the default did nothing to convince him, and he even said that the gender wage gap is a myth thats already been debunked.

Who is considered indigenous necessarily has a recency bias. are you disputing that Iranian Jews or Ashkenazi Jews are descendants from Jews who lived in modern-day IsraelIranian Jews are more closely related to other Iranians than to anyone else, but a small fraction of their ancestry is likely from ancient inhabitants of modern-day Israel. Ashkenazi Jews have more ancestry from ancient Israel than Iranian Jews, but they also have about as much European ancestry as Middle Eastern ancestry (and that's if we ignore younger generations of reform Jews in the US, who undoubtedly have less and less Middle Eastern ancestry).That's because Christians are not an?*ethnic*?group and never were one. Christianity spread through proselytisation and mass-scale conversion, whereas Jews managed to maintain their in-group status.\\"Jews\\" aren't an ethnic groups in the sense of shared ancestry either. Conversion is a perfectly legitimate way to become a Jew (though it is harder than becoming a Christian) and the various Jewish groups aren't all closely related. Ethiopian and Indian Jews are basically not related at all to other Jewish groups. Iranian Jews are pretty distant from other jewish groups.

As for ideas on how to combat the big lie I feel the best things we as individuals can do is to try to build bridges and foster relationships with those who arent too far gone.

Companies do this all over the globe, charging just enough to balance cost effective and good profit margins. Tariffs will only move those operations out of China, which is good. Even if you need to import parts or material from China they will just do it to another country in good standing with the US.

Both of these statements are just objectively not true and a simple google search would prove that to these people.It brings up wages while people on the brink of poverty import little besides clothes. That is in practice bringing down the cost of goods for the poor. Thinking prices on groceries are high due to the Economy and not corporate price gouging. The economy affects everyone, and these corporations would not be making record profit if it was just an economy issue. Once again this could be proven with research but no research is ever done.Albertsons is bordering on bankruptcy and the government is stopping a merger. They stopped a merger with Spirit and Spirit is now bankrupt. Corporations are not making good money outside of government contracts right now.  Claiming that gas prices post 2020 were down because of Trump and not low fuel demand during the Pandemic, and believing that theyre back up again because of Biden and not higher demand. Everyone should know how supply and demand works. Biden increases regulatory costs.  War in the middle east? Biden and Harriss fault. Russia invaded Ukraine? Biden and Harriss fault. Not even bothering to examine why these things actually happened.Lack of projection of power after the botched Afghanistan withdrawal is instrumental to general instability Immigrants are eating cats and dogs because Trump said so. The weather is controlled by democrats because a GOP rep said so. Climate change isnt a legit issue because Trump thinks its a hoax.

My guess is that you dont see any of that stuff because algorithms have identified that you support Palestine and you arent consuming any media that shows you the plight of what Israelis are going through. Rocket and terrorist attacks occurred for decades prior to 10/7 btw, it was nothing new.

It refers to Article V conventions, where 2/3rds of states can call for a constitutional convention, whose results would require 3/4 of states to ratify. There have been hundreds of attempts at this in the past but every time it has come close to succeeding, congress intervened to initiate the process the other way, which is 2/3s of both houses of congress proposing an amendment, which can then be ratified by 3/4 of the states. An Article V convention would have more power to drastically change the constitution, but despite what the website claims, the convention would indeed be accountable to voters since it would have to be ratified by 3/4 of state legislatures, which would preclude them from being able to pass anything massive in the unlikely event that the process even got to that stage. They also claim that 28 states have called for a convention but thats combining multiple initiatives efforts, and seems to include states where the legislation has been proposed but not passed.TL;DR: there are probably much more pressing things to worry about, including much more likely to be enacted actions by the incoming administration to dismantle democracy.

I know of people who have made the argument that Democrats either ignore or neglect men, and have brought up different bits of messaging or an official campaign page (I need to find this) where there are sections speaking about pretty much every group except men (or white men). Their argument is that it's less about hating men, and more about just not sparing them a thought. 2. As a straight, cis dude, I get mad at the arguments people make about either downplaying or completing abandoning those rights, especially the arguments this past week about abandoning trans rights. Never been a fan of throwing marginalized groups to the wolves. These folks making the arguments tend to directly or indirectly imply the same for black people too, and outside of being morally messed up, I feel like it's crappy strategy. Maybe the argument of sidestepping the topics in red/swing states could've had merit awhile back, but I think after Dobbs and with all this culture war stuff happening, it's better to just attack it head on. 3. I always try to go with the logical argument, with the full understanding that this probs doesn't work on a lot of MAGA people. Different groups having rights is pretty great for men too. More people and perspectives to learn from in the workplace, happier people in our personal lives, etc. There's an empathy argument to be made in day to day life too. People are less likely to hold onto these beliefs when they know folks from these group. As far as an in-person strategy: Whenever someone starts acting up about this stuff, I usually just cock my head to the side and ask them why they're upset. Digging into it tends to break their arguments apart. Again, not a 100% fix for this, but it's a starting point that could help to cut into the margins.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 18, 2024"},{"text":"He will and he can.

The other 90% of the land wasnt all Arab property C it was first Ottoman and then passed to the British empire.

In that sense the existence of Israel is just a byproduct of racist settler colonialism.The land was Arab because they were the ones who were living there.\\n Whats important is that the land where the Jews settled had been legally purchased. There was a time in human history where you could legally purchase other people. Does that make slavery right? No Jews constituted 33% of the Mandates population. They were given 56% of the land, because most of it was the barren Negev desert and the swamps in the North. So what? Land is land. The Jewish population at the time had no right to steal the Negev or the North. Most importantly, they were the majority in the lands that were alloted to them.You can gerrymander borders to create whatever majority you want.

Forcing people from their home is explicitly *not* genocide. It is still something bad, its called ethnic cleansing, but the very fact that you cant get this right is why the conversation with so many people is fruitless. Theyve adapted the word to mean anything they dont like.Now, I wont deny that its tragic that many civilians have died. War is hell and it sucks that so many innocent people are in fact caught in the crossfire. The disconnect here is that I blame everything on the military tactics you allude to in this very comment: Hamas uses their civilians as human shields! That is illegal according to international law, but you place the blame on Israel I disagree with you and put all (or at the very least most) of the blame on Hamas. They started a fight they couldnt win and now their civilians are paying the price. There is actually plenty of documented evidence of Palestinians in Gaza blaming Hamas for _everything_ but its not commonly shown in the media cause that would destroy their biased narrative.Now Ill point out that Id strongly prefer for further Palestinians to _not_ be displaced. Ethnic cleansing as I mentioned above is bad. However after decades of trying (and failing) to reach a bi lateral peace agreement, extremism on both sides is going to cause more displacement, cause no one has faith that they will actually live in peace with Israel. Its not just cause of Hamas either: the PA actively pays stipends to terrorists families that have died killing Jews. With that kind of policy, how can you so clearly blame Israel for causing all of this pain and terror? Ill agree that the current Israeli government is not a partner for peace, but you have to admit that aside from a _very_ brief period around the Oslo Accords, there has never been a Palestinian leadership that has been a partner","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"Make Agriculture Great Again has literally been what me and my buddies were saying all weekend playing the new farming simulator.","title":"Thanks, I hate Make Agriculture Great Again.

Then, a renewal gets delayed by a stalemated Congress, budget cut, or other red tape, and \\"undocumented\\" status begins as soon as the visa expires.One could self-deport immediately, but there are many voices promising to fix the situation with extensions, temporary reprieves, or other band-aids.

The leaders of the movement clearly positioned themselves as Europeans creating an outpost of Europe in the Middle East. Only after European Jews had created the state of Israel was there a large influx of Mizrahi Jews. So it really makes the most sense to understand Zionism as a European colonial nationalist movement created by Jews who were not indigenous to the middle east that subsequently incorporated (and was accepted by) Mizrahi jews who were indigenous to the middle east. [...] Even early zionists would not have agreed with that. It's an idea that has only gained steam in service of the legitimation of Zionism in a world that opposes colonialism.They positioned themselves as European *Jews*, and clearly regarded modern-day Israel as their ancestral homeland. While he did consider other locations because of practical considerations, he wrote of Palestine as \\"our unforgettable historic homeland\\" and of all Jews worldwide as \\"a people  one people\\" already his 1896's *Judenstaat* manifesto. No other \\"colonisation\\" movement considered themselves as recovering their lost homeland. Jews are indigenous indigenous to historical Palestine, because that is where their ethnogenesis happened, and where they last had sovereignty. Does a family of Native American who settle down in Europe stop being indigenous to the U.S.A.? Or are you disputing that Iranian Jews or Ashkenazi Jews are descendants from Jews who lived in modern-day Israel? Because there is really no doubt about it, according to genetic and historical studies. For example (quoting from Wiki),*The estimated cumulative total male genetic admixture amongst Ashkenazim was, according to Hammer et al., \\"very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%. This could be the result, for example, of \\"as little as 0.5% per generation, over an estimated 80 generations\\", according to Hammer et al. Such figures indicated that there had been a \\"relatively minor contribution\\" to Ashkenazi paternal lineages by converts to Judaism and non-Jews**Hammer et al. add that Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.\\"**Two studies by Nebel et al. in 2001 and 2005, based on Y chromosome polymorphic markers, suggested that Ashkenazi Jews are more closely related to other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than they are to their host populations in Europe (defined in the using Eastern European, German, and French Rhine Valley populations).**[Feder et al.] also found that the differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.\\" It supported previous interpretations that, in the direct maternal line, there was \\"little or no gene flow from the local non-Jewish communities in Poland and Russia to the Jewish communities in these countries.\\"* For example, the distinction between Jews and Christians was something that developed over centuries. At the beginning, Christians were just a Jewish group. That's because Christians are not an *ethnic* group and never were one. Christianity spread through proselytisation and mass-scale conversion, whereas Jews managed to maintain their in-group status.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"We have always been at war with eastasia","title":"The Trump administrations next target: naturalized US citizens"},{"text":"TIL (today i learned) that it seems to be only the wives received an envelope.

Basically, Trump cannot just sign an EO to denaturalize people. Once naturalized you have all the rights, privileges, and immunities of a US citizen and are not subject to deportation. The burden of proof is on the government to prove that someone has committed fraud or another crime to merit denaturalization. Basically think of denaturalization like an annulment. It means the person was never validly naturalized in the first place.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 18, 2024"},{"text":"He should be praying for a new barber.","title":"Oklahoma Superintendent Demands Students Watch Him Pray for Trump"},{"text":"Great topic and summary.  \\n  \\nIn my opinion, the majority of the shift from young men to the right wing comes not from any sort of policy analysis or belief that Harris/Democrats don't care about young men, but the more vibes based right wing \\"coding\\" of many male spaces.

Other than the fact that over 50% of Israeli Jews are Mizrahim, whose parents were expelled from the Arab states, all evidence points to genetic similarity between all major Jewish groups. The Zionist movement was created by Ashkenazi Jews who were from Europe and largely viewed themselves as European. The leaders of the movement clearly positioned themselves as Europeans creating an outpost of Europe in the Middle East. Only after European Jews had created the state of Israel was there a large influx of Mizrahi Jews. So it really makes the most sense to understand Zionism as a European colonial nationalist movement created by Jews who were not indigenous to the middle east that subsequently incorporated (and was accepted by) Mizrahi jews who were indigenous to the middle east.Also, saying that Jews are indigenous to the Middle East is quite a different thing from saying that they are indigenous to historical Palestine. There has been a small population of Jews in Palestine for millenia, and no one would argue that they aren't indigenous. That's quite a different thing from arguing that Ashkenazi Jews or Iranian Jews are indigenous to Palestine, especially given that the idea that all Jews are indigenous to Palestine is a very modern concept that Jews from outside of Palestine would not have agreed with 100 or 200 years ago. Even early zionists would not have agreed with that. It's an idea that has only gained steam in service of the legitimation of Zionism in a world that opposes colonialism. Another thing to note is that, much like self-determination is a collective right, indigeneity as a concept applies to entire ethnic groups, rather than individuals. Indigenous peoples are inheritors and practitioners of unique cultures and ways of relating to people and the environment, and in the case of Jews, there is a unique indigenous culture that spans millenia. Note that I am not denying that the Palestinian Arab and, more broadly, Levantine Arab culture has become indigenous too.But this approach to indigeneity doesn't make much sense. First, ethnic groupings are constantly in flux. The Jewish ethnoreligious category has only recently become a cohesive group. It has subsumed a wide range of different ethnic groups with shared or related religious traditions that existed as distinct categories with limited interactions with each other for centuries. Some of those groups would have considered themselves indigenous to Palestine (probably the ones that lived there), others would not have. Ethnic identity is something that evolves over time and is not a static property of specific individuals or groups of individuals and their descendants. If we were to accept your definition of indigeneity, Indigenous groups would constantly expand and contract as the way people identified changed. For example, the distinction between Jews and Christians was something that developed over centuries. At the beginning, Christians were just a Jewish group. At the end, Christians were viewed as completely non-jewish. Today we have a certain concept of who is Jewish and what it means to be Jewish. 100 years ago, that concept was different, and in 100 years, we may have a very different concept. If that concept includes a large number of people who are currently not considered Jews, will those new individuals suddenly be indigenous to Palestine/Israel and have a claim to live on the land there?Second, it doesn't make much sense to consider groups indigenous because they are \\"inheritors and practitioners of unique cultures and ways of relating to people and the environment.\\" There is no group of people today that has the same culture as Jews or Israelites from Millenia ago. Modern jews practice their religion very differently from ancient Jews - Rabbinic Judaism came into existence less than 2000 years ago. If we start talking about \\"inheritors\\" of the Jewish religious tradition, but allow for evolution in that tradition, why don't we also consider Christians and Muslims inheritors of ancient Judaism? They no longer share the same name, but they are no less evolutions of the Jewish cultural traditions from 2000 years ago. Even if we consider modern Jewish people alone, that category includes multiple groups with unique cultures and traditions that have elements that originated both in Palestine and outside of Palestine. For example, Ethiopian Jews have a very different practice of Judaism from mainstream rabbinic Judaism, which itself is distinct from the Judaism that was practiced by the original Israelites.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"Dont worry, the party of small government will surely be on the case to repeal this law.","title":"Texas still has a law banning gay sex.

They were indeed the majority there. What percentage of the *overall* Mandate's territory they owned is irrelevant. Would you argue that the Finnish, Estonians, or Latvians shouldnt have separated from the Russian Empire, because they owned a small portion of the Russian Empire? Or that the Czechs and Poles should have remained persecuted minorities in the German Empire?   Jews were not denied the Algerian citizenship at independence in 1962, Jews CHOSE to keep the French citizenship they had been granted almost a century before that.Wrong. The Nationality Code of 1963 restricted nationality to persons who had two paternal ancestral lines which had \\"Muslim status\\" in Algeria. Jews and other minorities were excluded. It also limited those who could naturalize to persons who had \\"participated in the struggle for independence\\", which is a subjective criterion and was used to arbitrarily deny citizenship. And you cant just dismiss a strong argument by just saying \\"its questionable\\". The dispute over the Baghdad bombings is beside the point, but, sure, we could discuss it. By the time they occurred, over 100K Iraqi Jews had already left and registered to leave. The Prime Minister of Iraq, Nuri al-Said, actually warned the Jews in Baghdad, many of whom had to flee pogroms in the country's periphery, to hasten their departure, lest he takes them to the border \\"himself\\". He had also talked to the British ambassador of his plans to place place Jews in armored cars and force them across the border.By 1950 Jewish residents were routinely pelted with stones or receiving death threats from their neighbors. In September 1948, the only Jewish Iraqi Senator delivered a long speech enumerating the mounting discrimination, harassment, and extortion. By late 1949 the American embassy reported on the widespread fear of the Jewish community and speculating that 100,000 jews would be forced to leave Iraq. All of this happened *before* the bombings.In light of this, there was no sense for the Zionist Agency to place the bombs, especially given that at that time they were struggling with accommodating thousands of new refugees and actually petitioned to al-Said to extend the deadline for the Jews' departure. There is also strong evidence that Iraqi nationalists placed the bombs and that the government covered up for them in fear of an international scandal.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"I pay more in taxes because of the cap on SALT deductions.

The fact that Israel has tried _hard_ over multiple decades to reach a peace agreement, only to have it be rejected by Arafat, Abbas, and all extremists that never wanted any recognition of Israel from the outset only weakens your argument that this is some fascist genocidal movement. There is no utility to armed resistance when it comes at the expense of your own citizens. There is nothing noble about it.

Just because Palestine was a province of the ottoman empire doesnt mean the Palestinians living there didnt own land or homes? The ethnicity of the ruler or the distance from the capital is completely irrelevant to that.Once again the jews were a very small majority in the land the partition plan gave them (around 55%) while there was practically no arab land where they would be a minority: it was objectively and mathematically a scam which is why they had no objection against it and why the arabs refused it. Youll note that when the UN sent an envoy who concluded another partition should be madr, jewish terrorists assassinated. And the partition plan always was a first step towards more colonisation, zionism never planned to just stop there.\\nYou really need to do some fact checking because you keep just making wrong statements. Jews were not denied the Algerian citizenship at independence in 1962, Jews CHOSE to keep the French citizenship they had been granted almost a century before that. A very small number actually stayed and got to be citizens but many if not most Jews left during the war, so even before independence.\\nAntisemitic policies post-1948 that led to immigration to Israel is, once again, irrelevant. And you cant just dismiss a strong argument by just saying \\"its questionable\\". But do you know what antisemitic policy and violence actually led to jewish immigration to Palestine?

Originally, I'd planned to talk about this later, but The Discourse has made it necessary to discuss now.  I've seen it all over the Internet, including this very subreddit, and we've got to talk about it once and for all.  Because until we do, we won't make any significant progress on understanding bias against women in politics.**So what's the big lie?**I'll get straight to the point: The idea I've seen bouncing around recently has been that *Trump's win is really the Dems' fault, because they spout such hatred and indifference towards men, and Trump offered them the kindness and understanding Dems refused to give them.*It's bullshit.This lie has taken kinder forms, too.  Maybe Dems just need to toss the radical feminists out of the party.  Maybe they just need to center male figures.  Maybe if Harris had just gone on Joe Rogan (he's so cool!), it'd have all been OK.  But those are just nicer versions of the same lie.  And we need to understand that it's a lie if we are going to make any worthwhile changes in light of the last election - and avoid harmful changes.**Hearing them out**[This article lays out the big lie pretty well.](https://www.glamour.com/story/why-did-young-men-vote-for-donald-trump)  You can find it in a lot of pundit and Redditor commentary, too, but the article makes the same points in one convenient place.So, what's it say?  It has lots of examples of men feeling like Harris and Democrats hate them.  But did you notice what that article *didn't* include?  **Literally any specific examples.**Im a straight white man, and I feel like we take the blame for a lot of things, Sumners says.From *who?*  *Who* is saying this?The people Ive spoken to who voted for Harris are constantly saying that were racist, that were misogynistic, that, you know, were transphobic.\\"*Name one.* Even just 'my friend', or 'my roommate', or whoever.??I feel like theres this cultural frustration that young men have that theyre not allowed to be young men, says 26-year-old Benji Backer from Arizona.*Who is saying this?* Just one link, and I'll shut up, I swear. I have always prioritized that in everything that I do, and so it doesnt feel good to feel like Im being blamed. I get told all the time, Youre a white man, sit down and wait your turn...\\"*Name literally one person telling you this.*  If it's happening to you all the time, surely you can point to someone!  You can't even name someone in your own life saying it, so I highly doubt Kamala Harris said it at any point!I'll stop here, but read the whole thing yourself, and look for even one real-world example.  You won't find one.  Go read another article, or posts about this on Reddit and elsewhere.  Many people *claiming* there's this epidemic of people hating men, but no one actually *showing* it.**Being fair to these guys**I'll pause for a second to say that I'm aware men do face challenges.  Mental health, loneliness, economic opportunity.  Women face these issues as well, but I know men feel them acutely - they do play into masculine fragility, after all.The point is, men do face challenges.  And who had a plan for that?  [Kamala](https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FMfcgzQXJZxzLGgcKmSNQSXCRKXShwxJ.pdf) fucking [Harris.](https://kamalaharris.com/adelante/)So yes, men do have valid concerns.  And Harris had answers.  But it wasn't about answers.  It was about this idea that Harris/Democrats/somebody hates men.I think this lie comes from a really weak source.**\\"If liberals don't hate men, then why do I keep saying they do?\\"**It comes down to a cycle:1. Find someone, somewhere, saying something that sounds like 'I hate men'.  Could be from a teenager, or someone with three followers, or even from a 4chan troll - it doesn't matter!2. Let the online trolls post and repost it, getting into a rage about it.3. Small-time misogynist bloggers and podcasters talk about the 'controversy'.4. The big-timers pick it up, and make it about politics.  Now Kamala Harris is tied to this random account she's failed to denounce, because she's busy trying to make life better for men.  (And if you're wondering why some GOP Reps and Senators are so online, this is why.  Fuel for the fire).Basically: **If you want to say women deserve rights, many men now believe that you hate all men, because of this lengthy smear campaign.**  The manosphere's integration into the GOP, plus Dems rightly fighting for womens' and LGBT+ rights, has made this even tougher.I've alluded to the fact that when I was younger, I nearly got sucked into all this stuff.  The gateway drug for me was a now-banned subreddit called TumblrInAction.  They'd find 'hilarious' posts on Tumblr about feminism gone too far, disregarding that many of them were by literal teenagers or admitted trolls.  Then the comment sections got into a frothing rage, which escaped to the rest of Reddit.  Before long \\"Did you just assume my gender?\\" and \\"Wow, check your privilege!\\" were top-tier Reddit memes, when they started on some blog with no followers.  And now a lot of guys who grew up on Reddit think that's what it means to care about women's rights.Want a more real-world example?  Look at [the sad story of Chanty Binx](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/big-red), better known as 'Big Red'.  She was one random feminist telling off misogynists, and the manosphere turned her into the evil, shrill face of women's rights.  (By the way, that only happens if a lot of guys secretly suspect that about women, and feel like there's value in sharing it).  Now if Democrats want to stand up for women, they get associated with an angry face.  Never mind that Binx's points were valid; it's all about the meme to these guys.**So, what now?**Well, this is a hard one!  You can't make everyone stop saying things that make men uncomfortable forever, and even if you somehow did, they'd use anonymous troll accounts to do the same thing.  Or just replay the classics.  I *still* see Binx's face posted by trolls years later.The idea is out there, and there's not much that can be done about it.  And no, better messaging won't solve it; [in fact, online figures pushing back on sexism often makes it worse thanks to male fragility.](https://lithub.com/how-many-ways-can-men-say-not-all-men/)  (And yes, that article is hard on men, but check the context - a woman venting her frustrations at trying to talk about sexism and being shouted down by men.  She's not talking to you).And I hope it goes without saying: The solution isn't to downplay women's rights or throw anyone out of the party.  We want to change these bigoted forces, not let them win.But an important idea has come out of our first two talks.  So many of us avoided falling for sexist nonsense due to our relationships with others.  That kept me from falling in.  It also keeps the other guys in our lives from getting snared.  **When men see with their own eyes that people care about them, it's much harder to fall for the 'liberals hate men' lie.**  Maybe they'll even see all the work Democrats are doing to make their lives better.The Big Lie of 2024 is that Democrats hate men, and that we need to listen to Republican lies to prove that we don't.  But if we do that, we'd be abandoning *everyone*, including men.  We'd be saying that comforting lies are more important than actually helping them.  We'd be holding up the system of masculine fragility that keeps guys from getting the support they need, and makes them think that hate is the answer to their economic situation.  And we'd be sending one hell of a terrible message to women, that if Republicans are hateful enough we'll listen to them.  It's even more dangerous than lies about a stolen election, because it traps everyone.Now you know the truth.  Tell it widely.**Questions to consider**1. Have you ever had anyone try to argue to you that Democrats hate men?  Did they offer any attempts at proof?2. When people suggest downplaying women's rights (or LGBT+ rights, which are closely intertwined), how does that make you feel?3. We've talked about the value in real-life relationships.  How else could individual people help combat the idea that standing for women's rights means you hate men?  (Note that I'm most interested in ideas that we, as individuals, could do.)4.
