It really depends on what the end goal is. If you go by traditional metrics of \\"an economy that functions\\" (which for 99.9999% of cases, this is the definition of \\"work\\"). You mention that:Every business and state in America would suffer horribly if Cali decides to be self sufficient and gives Trump the finger.This would be terrible, if the goal of trump was to be a competent president, or to get re-elected, or care about his party's standing into the future. You know, all normal president considerations. The question is, would that be trump's definition of success? Judging by 2016-2020, no. This is even more the case now that he doesn't have to worry about the bruised ego of losing re-election (I do not think he'll actually run for a 3rd term, but hey, at this point anything can happen). My conjecture is that Trump's version of success is measured by three metrics:1. How rich can he and his friends get? This is particularly important for him now that his finances are much less stable than they were in 2016. He needs to rebuild that nest egg of his once he leaves office, if he makes it there.2. How can he leverage his new term in office to escape any potential legal troubles and setbacks? Things are already on the upswing for him here.3. How can he make himself look/feel good while sticking it to his detractors/enemies? This goes back to his ego thing, and his potential push for vendettas. If he goes through with it, it will likely crush the national economy, but that isn't something he truly cares about, as long as he and his own can still exploit it. That will be the true tipping point, as he'll pull back if his rich friends complain to him, but not for anything else.So back to your point, if/when Trump sees the effect of his war with California, his first thought will be, \\"how can I blame this on someone else, and not make my friends mad?\\" If he squeezes through, then it will have \\"worked.\\"","title":"Sen.

It would have been a fantastic opportunity to open up an incredible amount of manufacturing jobs.   Further, artillery was the stumbling block because we gave very few units of vehicle; and there are *good reasons* for that, beyond just training and matters of national security.   But I have long been of the opinion that, if we cannot contribute against one of the world's largest autocracies, what will we contribute to?My cousin would put this a bit more harshly, but I blame the American citizenry who were committed for a week and then lost interest, much like other world news and events.   \\nPeople will *say* they care, quite passionately, show you things on their phones, like that *matters.*   But when it comes time for sustained action, the only thing that matters, that's too much to ask, because life here is like living in the existential dread of conquest.

So I can't even blame the people I blame domestically; it's a complex issue, like so many, and reducing it *just* to blaming one person or people is as ridiculous as it is faulty.But it is heartbreaking, yes, and I expect the conclusion to shock the same people who were shocked when we withdrew from Afghanistan and the results were as predicted.

That's why cops have discretion with arrests, prosecutors have discretion with charges, and judge and juries have discretion with convictions. The letter of the law and spirit of the law are separate ways to dish out justice.

A law no one else has ever been convicted of, and we all agree is and was not a threat to anyone or harmed society.

If I'm literally the only person being convicted of a crime, and it's obvious it's because of unrelated circumstances, i.e. that my father is a politician and they're using me as a way to get to him, then how is this not an absurd perversion of justice? How could anyone believe in a system like that and not become disillusioned?How many times have you ever broken a crime like jaywalking? If we could count those times up, and they resulted in years of jail time, which by letter of the law they probably would, then should you spend years in prison?

You cited two such instances split by 60 years. Brown was rightly decided. Obergefell is not really considered to be a case that overturned a major precedent (it technically did overturn a Minnesota Supreme Court case from the 70s, but that doesn't count). I assume you meant (or would otherwise want me to substitute) Lawrence v. Texas in 2003. Lawrence, imo, was rightly decided as well. So we have two cases 50 years apart that overturned relatively major precedents. I think that sounds about fair. Then, since 2016, we have Loper Bright (2024) overriding 40 years of precedent in Chevron; we have Dobbs (2022) overturning 50 years of precedent in Roe; we have Hyatt (2020) overturning 40 years of precedent in Hall; Rucho (2019) overturned 30 years of precedent in Davis; Janus (2018) overturned 40 years of precedent in Abood; Trump v. Hawaii (2018) overturned 70 years of precedent in Korematsu. And those are just the cases that were at the time noted for both seriously contravening the precedent in a major way. There have also been major cases that haven't directly overturned existing precedent, but were clearly on one jurisprudential path, but the new radical court put them on a different path. Affirmative action, school prayer, executive authority were all pretty firmly established, but this court took cases meant to affect things politically. If they did either of these things every 50 years, no one would care. They do it every other year with no accountability.","title":"CMV: Gorsuch is as good or better of a SC justice as Garland would have been"},{"text":"Not just community action focused non-profits!Tons of museums, libraries, and archives also have DEI statements.

Garland today released the following statement following the Supreme Courts decision in Dobbs, State Health Officer of the Mississippi Department of Health, et al. v. Jackson Womens Health Organization et al.: Today, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and held that the right to abortion is no longer protected by the Constitution.The Supreme Court has eliminated an established right that has been an essential component of womens liberty for half a century C a right that has safeguarded womens ability to participate fully and equally in society. And in renouncing this fundamental right, which it had repeatedly recognized and reaffirmed, the Court has upended the doctrine of stare decisis, a key pillar of the rule of law. The Justice Department strongly disagrees with the Courts decision. This decision deals a devastating blow to reproductive freedom in the United States. It will have an immediate and irreversible impact on the lives of people across the country. And it will be greatly disproportionate in its effect C with the greatest burdens felt by people of color and those of limited financial means.  The ability to decide ones own future is a fundamental American value, and few decisions are more significant and personal than the choice of whether and when to have children. Few rights are more central to individual freedom than the right to control ones own body. The Justice Department will use every tool at our disposal to protect reproductive freedom. And we will not waver from this Departments founding responsibility to protect the civil rights of all Americans.https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s","title":"CMV: Gorsuch is as good or better of a SC justice as Garland would have been"},{"text":"They are blockbuster!","title":"Voters Remorse"},{"text":"Poor Liddle Jimmy \\"Big Closet\\" Comer -- he was planning on investigating Hunter for another four years!

This mode of critique disrupts the illusion of naturalness or inevitability that power structures depend on, making space for alternative ways of thinking and being. So yes corporatism but also a corporatism that violently disrupts and thereby seizes State power through over-the-top imitation, mockery, and parody of tradition.

But also the idea that some races of humans are so far behind the superior humans - in particular the savage black Africans and probably also the mongrel Hispanics created by centuries of miscegenation - that they must also be subdued and taught their rightful place through the generous use of whips, ropes, blades, and bullets.

And it has many ethnic Russians and Russian speakers and was part of the USSR until 1991.

But the rest of reddit is a machine mobilized against its own cause, banning everyone from the moderates to the not-left-enough, radicalizing them to the other side.Twitter does this very well by comparison - they don't ban left-learners or the extreme radical right (except for extreme situations), simply letting them embarrass themselves for the world to see.

Alex Padilla says Donald Trump has \\"made it no secret that he has it in for California\\""},{"text":"The hypothesis that Trump won by cheating does not require \\"vote fraud to the tune of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of votes\\". Instead it requires total and massive corruption of our entire electoral system at EVERY level. ALL 50 states + the District of Colombia. ALL the Boards of Elections in ALL 3244 counties. ALL the employees and volunteers responsible for counting and reporting votes in ALL 120,000 or so polling places. To see why the corruption had to be this massive, if it happened, you must look at the reported election results on a local to national level.What happened according to the *reported* 2024 results is Trump gained 2% to 6% in margin (= difference between Trump percentage and Biden / Harris percentage) in each of the swing states: MI, PA, WI, GA, NC, and NV. But Trump made similar or larger gains in all the other, non-swing, states, too. So the national popular vote went from +4.5% D to +1.6% R, a shift of 6.1%. And the R gain in each state wasn't in just one part of that state, it was in most or all of the geographic regions and counties throughout the state.Just as an example, in my state of Colorado, where the outcome was never in doubt, the 2020 margin was +13.5% D, the 2024 margin was +11.0% D, or a shift of 2.5% toward R. In California, where the outcome was \\"even more certain than certain\\", the 2020 margin was +29.2% D, the 2024 margin was 20.2% D, or a much larger shift of 9.0% toward R.So now I can present three hypotheses.HYPOTHESIS I. Total and massive corruption of the election by the Trump/GOP side, including engineering big shifts toward Trump not just in the swing states but in the \\"solid\\" states like CA, not just in all the states but in almost all the counties, presumably to make the result look more conclusive and give Trump a popular vote (plurality) as well as Electoral College win. Obviously the corruption would have to be extremely widespread covering most of the 3244 counties and 120,000 polling places.HYPOTHESIS II. There was a REAL shift toward Trump of 2% to 10% in all 43 non-swing states + NC (which is considered \\"swing\\" but Trump won both times). But the voters in the 6 remaining swing states behaved completely differently than the voters in the other 44 states, and voted as much D in 2024 as in 2020. Trump then needed to corrupt and steal the election ONLY in the six swing states (but including most counties and polling places in those states). Now if we review all the elections from 2000 to 2020, we see there was a NATIONAL shift from D to R or R to D in every pair of elections, including swing and non-swing states.2000 - 2004: national shift D to R2004 - 2008: national shift R to D2008 - 2012: national shift D to R2012 - 2016: national shift D to R2016 - 2020: national shift R to DSo HYPOTHESIS II has to explain TWO amazing and unprecedented things: how the voters in the swing states, for the first time, didn't shift in the same direction as the rest of the country, and then how Trump/GOP managed to steal the election in those 6 states. I say HYPOTHESIS II is so bizarre it can be discarded in favor of either I or III.HYPOTHESIS III. The vote count wasn't corrupted period, Trump actually won both the popular vote and the swing states. (One could still argue that the election was corrupt in the sense that the Trump win was built on propaganda, emotional appeals, and lies, which the media allowed his campaign to get away with, but that's not at all the same as corruption of the vote count itself.)","title":"Trumps Next Term Could See Americas First True Oligarchs, Warns Democracy Activist Garry Kasparov"},{"text":"Now **hears** your ice cream and then off to bed.\\n??","title":"Trump picks daughter Tiffany's father-in-law Massad Boulos as senior Mideast adviser"},{"text":"Why would he care?

Also, there's a ton of infighting in his chosen cabinet.Second: This is a great opportunity to explain what I thought Trump really meant when he told all those Christians, 'You wont have to do it any more. Four more years, you know what? Itll be fixed, itll be fine, you wont have to vote any more, my beautiful Christians.\\" I think I know why he said that - and to Christians in particular.It's the fucking Book of Revelations.Remember when Trump said in his first term that the Christians loved it when he had the US embassy to Israel moved to Jerusalem? That's because legitimization of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (which Palestine disagrees with) is seen by certain Christians as helping bring about the apocalypse as described in Revelations. (Trump's 2024 Secretary of Defense pick Pete Hegseth did something similar during that same term by encouraging another prerequisite - the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple). A lot of Christians believe that when the prophecy of Revelations comes to pass, all the faithful Christians will be raptured away to heaven, avoiding a seven year tribulation, followed by a thousand-year rule by Christ himself, followed by the battle of Armageddon and the proper end of the world. (For more information about this popular model of the Revelations prophecy, read the Left Behind books - or better yet, *don't.* They *suck.*)So here's how I think it went down: before speaking before a bunch of hardcore Christians, Trump was advised about all this. He was told in particular that a lot of hardcore Christians don't vote, and was told that a lot of them believe that the Republicans will help bring about the End Times, during which God will fix all their problems and they'll never need to vote again.

Charismatic Leadership Is a Non-NegotiableOne lesson from Turkey and Hungary is clear: You will lose if you dont find a captivating leader, as was the case in 2023 general elections in Turkey and in 2022 in Hungary. Coalition-building or economic messaging is necessary and good. But it is not enough. You need charisma to mobilize social dissent.Trump was beatable in this election, but only with a more captivating candidate, as Nancy Pelosi has been hinting. For Democrats, the fundamental mistake after smartly pushing aside President Joe Biden was bypassing the primaries and handpicking a candidate. Future success for the party will hinge on identifying a candidate who can better connect with voters and channel their aspirations. It should not be too hard in a country of 350 million.Last years elections in Poland and Turkey showcased how populist incumbents can be defeated (or not defeated, as in general elections in Turkey in 2023) depending on the oppositions ability to unite around compelling candidates who resonate with voters. Voters seek authenticity and a connection  give it to them.5. Skip the Protests and Identity PoliticsSoon, Trump opponents will shake off the doldrums and start organizing an opposition campaign. But how they do it matters. For the longest time in Turkey, the opposition made the mistake of relying too much on holding street demonstrations and promoting secularism, Turkeys version of identity politics, which speaks to the urban professional and middle class but not beyond. When Erdo?an finally lost his absolute predominance in Turkish politics in 2024, it was largely because of his mismanagement of the economy and the oppositions growing competence in that area.Trumps appeal transcends traditional divides of race, gender and class. He has formed a new Republican coalition and to counteract this, Democrats too, must broaden their tent, even if means trying to appeal to conservatives on some issues. Opposition over the next four years must be strategic and broad-based. Street protests and calls to defend democracy may be inspirational, but they repel conservatives and suburban America. Any grassroots action must be coupled with a clear, relatable economic message and showcase the leadership potential of Democratic mayors and governors. Identity politics alone wont do it.\\"","title":"Trump Will Overplay His Hand. Heres How to Be Ready."},{"text":"Just the latest in the never-ending saga of American media normalwashing of every aberrant thing this man does","title":"Trumps extraordinary selection of his daughters fathers-in-law for key posts underscores his reliance on family members"},{"text":"Middle:\\"American democracy is about to undergo a serious stress test. I know how it feels, in part because I lived through the slow and steady march of state capture as a journalist working in Recep Tayyip Erdo?ans Turkey.Over a decade as a high-profile journalist, I covered Turkeys descent into illiberalism, having to engage in the daily push and pull with the government. I know how self-censorship starts in small ways but then creeps into operations on a daily basis. I am familiar with the rhythms of the battle to reshape the media, state institutions and the judiciary.Having lived through it, and having gathered some lessons in hindsight, I believe that there are strategies that can help Democrats and Trump critics not only survive the coming four years, but come out stronger. Here are six of them.1. Dont Panic  Autocracy Takes TimePresident-elect Donald Trumps return to power is unnerving but, as I have argued previously, America will not turn into a dictatorship overnight  or in four years. Even the most determined strongmen face internal hurdles, from the bureaucracy to the media and the courts. It took Erdo?an well over a decade to fully consolidate his power. Hungarys Viktor Orbn and Polands Law and Justice Party needed years to erode democratic norms and fortify their grip on state institutions.I am not suggesting that the United States is immune to these patterns, but its important to remember that its decentralized system of governance  the network of state and local governments  offers enormous resilience. Federal judges serve lifetime appointments, states and governors have specific powers separate from those granted federally, there are local legislatures, and the media has the First Amendment as a shield, reinforced by over a century of legal precedents. Sure, there are dangers, including by a Supreme Court that might grant great deference to the president. But in the end, Donald Trump really only has two years to try to execute state capture. Legal battles, congressional pushback, market forces, midterm elections in 2026 and internal Republican dissent will slow him down and restrain him. The bottom line is that the U.S. is too decentralized in its governance system for a complete takeover. The Orbanization of America is not an imminent threat.2. Dont Disengage  Stay ConnectedAfter a stunning electoral loss like this, theres a natural impulse to shut off the news, log off social media and withdraw from public life. Ive seen this with friends in Turkey and Hungary, with opposition supporters retreating in disillusionment after Erdo?ans or Orbans victories. Understandably, people want to turn inwards.Dancing, travel, meditation, book clubs  its all fine. But eventually, in Poland, Hungary and Turkey, opponents of autocracy have returned to the fight, driven by a belief in the possibility of change. So will Americans.Nothing is more meaningful than being part of a struggle for democracy. Thats why millions of Turks turned out to the polls and gave the opposition a historic victory in local governments across Turkey earlier this year. Thats how the Poles organized a winning coalition to vote out the conservative Law and Justice Party last year. It can happen here, too.The answer to political defeat is not to disconnect, but to organize. You can take a couple of days or weeks off, commiserate with friends and mute Elon Musk on X  or erase the app altogether. But in the end, the best way to develop emotional resilience is greater engagement.3. Dont Fear the InfightingDonald Trumps victory has understandably triggered infighting inside the Democratic Party and it looks ugly. But fear not. These recriminations and finger-pointing are necessary to move forward. In Turkey, Hungary and Poland, it was only after the opposition parties faced their strategic and ideological misalignment with society that they were able to begin to effectively fight back.Trump has tapped into the widespread belief that the economic order, labor-capital relations, housing and the immigration system are broken. You may think he is a hypocrite, but there is no doubt that he has convinced a large cross-section of American society that he is actually the agent of change  a spokesman for their interests as opposed to Democratic elites. This is exactly what strongmen like Erdo?an and Orban have achieved.For the Democratic Party to redefine itself as a force for change, and not just as the custodian of the status quo, it needs fundamental shifts in how it relates to working people in the U.S. There is time to do so before the midterms of 2026.\\"","title":"Trump Will Overplay His Hand.

Excerpt: Corral, a 40-year-old Hispanic American who voted for Trump, said she only hires workers with legal permits. Yet she said she knows that plenty of immigrants who lack legal status in the U.S. readily find day labor or jobs at smaller companies that are lenient with paperwork. She supports Trumps pledges to stop illegal border crossings because she worries about possible criminals entering the country, or people who expect benefits that prior waves of migrants didnt get. But Corral doubts the Trump administration will conduct widespread raids in the area because the migrant community there doesnt cause significant problems, she said. Unemployment in Whitfield County is 4.4%, higher than the state rate of 3.6%. Entry-level and day jobs are plentiful, with hiring signs posted at many businesses. A placard outside Corrals iLink Business Management office proclaims, Trabajos! Trabajos! on one side and Jobs! Jobs! on the other. One recent day, she had more than 50 positions available, and on a typical day, about 60 Hispanic applicants file in. Concerns about border security galvanized many Trump voters in the 2024 election. Television coverage spotlighted migrants crossing into Texas or buses dropping them off in cities such as New York and Chicago.  Less examined are smaller U.S. communities, many of them heavily Republican, where immigrant labor intertwines with daily life.This article is reported out of Dalton, GA, which is [right in the middle of Marjorie Taylor Greene's district](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/GA/14#q=Dalton%2C%20GA&amp;marker_lng=-84.96913&amp;marker_lat=34.771515).","title":"A Georgia Towns Vote for Trump Threatens Its Immigrant Workforce"},{"text":"Play it out then.

They cautioned that Patel not only lacked the right experience, but they feared his embrace of controversial theories could hurt his chances at Senate confirmation, people familiar with the discussions said. The team had already been through the wringer with Trumps first choice to lead the Justice Department, former congressman Matt Gaetz, who withdrew from consideration last month after Senate Republican pushback. Some of Trumps advisers felt that there were more qualified, less inflammatory options than Patel to lead the nations premier law-enforcement agency, the people said.  Trump ignored those aides and chose Patel anyway in a Saturday night decision that sent shock waves through the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Trump now hopes to install the bombastic, hard-line critic of the bureau as its leader, the latest step in his long promised plans to remake the nations law-enforcement and intelligence agencies more fully into an arm of his agenda.Guess what happened [the last time](https://politicaldictionary.com/words/saturday-night-massacre/) a President tried messing with the DOJ on a Saturday night?","title":"Trump Picked Patel for FBI After Some Aides Warned It Could Backfire"},{"text":"He just wanted his simple life back with his favorite sled though.","title":"Shouldnt Trump Voters Be Viewed as Traitors?"},{"text":"One things for sure - the Ukranian president has a great deal more diplomatic experience, savvy and persuasiveness than his presumed future American counterpart.

Trump did equally well with voters who agreed that inflation had caused them and their family significant or moderate hardship. Among the 46 percent of voters who said their familys financial situation is worse now than four years ago, 81 percent cast a ballot for Trump.This is unfortunately the reality of todays electorate. Despite the strength of the economy and the best in class recovery, there are people who are still struggling and decided to put their trust in the orange sex offender who presented no coherent economic policy and is demonstrably anti worker, anti union and anti-lower class. The Trump populism is real, his message of racism, xenophobia, and transphobia resonates with a large part of the electorate made up largely of working class white voters. This is not faux-populism, it is very real and speaks directly to a large segment of working class, who blame the difficulties of the post pandemic economy on the dirty brown pet eating immigrants. This is as tragic as it is hilarious. There is considerable doubt whether the electorate has any desire for left leaning policies or economic populism. The left leaning congress representatives are quite few and the only democratic governors and senators who have any success in red districts are decidedly moderate centrists. Manchin was a typical example of this and once he left the democrats lost that seat. Leftist policies play well in California and New York but not as well in the rest of America. There is no data to support that there is any reason this will change. Even more clear is that red states have lower minimum wage rates and lower Medicare coverage but the state politicians do not have any pressure to adopt more progressive policies. The electorate is not moving politicians to the left.","title":"Even in Exile, the Left Must Fight to Popularize Its Vision"},{"text":"Keeps the women and children out atleast","title":"What happened to Trumps border wall?

I disagree as to your reasoning.Democrats win when they cater to the middle.  Clinton's third way/DLC was the blueprint for the \\"emerging Democratic majority,\\" and Obama was able to position himself as the moderate choice in 2008 and 2012 (despite his left-wing leanings).  [Trump was viewed as more moderate in 2016] (https://www.vox.com/2019/7/2/20677656/donald-trump-moderate-extremism-penalty), and [was viewed as the moderate alternative this past election] (https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/presidential-polls-trump-moderate.html).  The Democratic Party [has moved to the left] (https://jabberwocking.com/if-you-hate-the-culture-wars-blame-liberals/) and moreso than the Republicans have moved right since 2000.  Gallup also does a yearly survey where they ask about people's ideology, and [the most recent survey once again shows \\"liberal\\" as the minority viewpoint] (https://news.gallup.com/poll/548459/independent-party-tied-high-democratic-new-low.aspx).You argue that Bill Clinton pulled the party to the right, and that brought us Trump.  In reality, post-Bill Clinton, the Democrats lurched in the opposite direction, and only when they ran people who could credibly be considered moderates did they win their elections.  So why is Bill Clinton sort of the starting domino that led us to Trump?  [The impeachment in 1998] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton).  The impeachment was perhaps the apex of the \\"moral majority\\"-style thinking that underpinned Republican politics from the 1980s through the \\"Contract With America\\" era.  Clinton's philandering, and the crimes associated with it, should have been a slam-dunk, but Democrats didn't get on board and Clinton [nearly got away with it] (https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/20/politics/exiting-job-clinton-accepts-immunity-deal.html).  It did, however, put the sort of morality politics on the downswing around the same time that the DNC killed off the DLC-style triangulation of the Clinton/Carville years, with a last gasp on the stem cell issue for Republicans back in the mid-2000s.  Then comes 2010 - the Blue Dog coalition is the last remaining vestige of Clinton-era Democratic Party activity, and they went in with Obama on the stimulus and ACA and got absolutely killed in the 2010 election for it.  Going into the 2009-10 session, there were 54 Blue Dogs in the House. 28 of them lost in 2010. Today, there are 11.If you want to blame the Democrats for not being progressive enough, that's fine.

Thats based on figures from the Secretary of States office, which publishes both vote totals as well as the estimated number of eligible voters in each county. The declines werent proportional by party. Donald Trump earned roughly the same number of votes as he did in 2020  but Kamala Harris earned more than 1.8 million fewer votes than Joe Biden did four years ago. That Democratic decline was enough to meaningfully shift the margins in the state. While Joe Biden earned 64% of the vote in these 49 counties in 2020, Harris earned just 59%. Trump earned 34% of the vote in 2020 and 38% in 2024. The data provide something of a counterpoint to trends in the rest of the country: While Democratic turnout dropped nationwide, at least some of the shift to Trump came from voters actively changing their minds from 2020 and switching their votes from Democratic to Republican. In California, turnout  or lack thereof, on the Democratic side  seems to have mattered far more.","title":"California swung right this election.

Yet they somehow cant properly anesthetize humans? If they can communicate telepathically, why wouldnt they have the ability to turn off consciousness?Maybe they dont care if certain people witness them, since their testimonies wont be taken seriously without video evidence. Even video evidence of UFOs is not taken seriously by the majority of people. So maybe they dont care to some extent. I have no idea why I witnessed the orbs, however like I said the first 2 UFOs I initiated contact myself and they decided to show themselves to me after I asked them too (this concept was inspired by CE5, what I did was very similar to initiate contact).As for the shapeshifters, why would a highly intelligent, likely immortal and ancient shapeshifting being, knowingly reveal its true form in front of you? Are you implying it was a mistake or that it was intentional and meant to disturb you?I think both sightings which were definitive were mistakes on the shapeshifters part. I dont know what shapeshifters are, they could be reptiles they could be demons they could be inter dimensional parasites. I have no idea. But Ill explain why I think they did not intentionally try to show themselves to me. The first sighting was a teacher who was bent over beside a student at a desk. I was teaching other students doing my own thing, but I glanced over at her for a brief moment. I watched her stick out her tongue ?? next to the students ear. I thought it was really weird and creepy, maybe some pedophile type behaviour. So I started watching her intently, paying close attention. Thats when her tongue transformed, and her head transformed into what I described earlier. I dont think she intended for me to witness what happened, I think she was doing her own thing and got hungry by the child or some shit and just slipped up with the cloaking methods, not expecting I would be paying close attention. Allegedly they use telekinesis to disguise themselves, but who knows.The second sighting was simply a shapeshifter in a car. Their tongue came out and was the same, long black, skinny and forked. I think this shapeshifter just slipped up for a few moments because they were driving on their own on a residential street which wasnt busy. I happen to just be walking by and looking in their window. I dont know what any of this means Im just being honest and transparent.

I am willing to agree to your submission that Clinton set the wheels in motion, so to speak. However, does setting the wheels in motion make you the *most* responsible. Also, did Clinton actually set the wheels, or was he simply another cog in the machine?There is a 16-year gap between Clinton and Trump's first term. It find it hard to believe that nothing more important happened in those 16 years to promote Trump. For example, what about Trump's TV show the *Apprentice*? I submit that Trump being on primetime TV from 2004 to 2015 made him a household name, and greatly contributed to his election. As such, I submit that whoever green-lit the show is more responsible than Clinton.Whatever about the rise of social media? I do not think it is controversial to say that Trump was elected both times because he had a more persuasive social media presence. So how much responsibility do the creators of social media have?How do you explain Obama? Obama is was a popular Democrat. In 2008 he won Iowa, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Indiana. In 2012, he maintained Iowa, Florida, and Ohio. These states now are mostly solid red. If Clinton killed the Democrat party, why did the Democrat Party have such as popular President?What about Bush Jr.? The war on terror in the first decade of the 2000's created a dramatic shift in American politics and society. Also, Bush only won by a slight margin. Had the Supreme Court ruled differently, Gore could have been President. If not for the Supreme Court in 2000, the 21st century could have looked a lot different.What about before Clinton? What about the effects of Reagan, Carter, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy? Take Nixon for example. Nixon is credited for starting the war on drugs. The war on drugs increased the militarization of the Mexican and Columbian cartels. This lead to more emigration from Central and Southern America. Trump ran on a strong anti-illegal immigration policy. Without Nixon's war on drugs, there would likely be less illegal immigrants, and so Trump would have less ammunition.In short, there are simply too many factors to account for here. Sure, Clinton played a role. But then, everyone plays a role. How do you say Clinton's role was the most significant?","title":"CMV: Bill Clinton is the person most responsible for Donald Trump"},{"text":"He and his cronies are the opposite of a patriots.

Permitting reform and subsidies can help build domestic production and processing capabilities. Overusing tariffs can have a negative impact. For commodities that the United States has limited or no supply of or is at early-stage development, imposing high tariffs can have two consequences: (1) it can make goods too expensive for end users to purchase, leading to a chokehold on important U.S. industries and jobs central to economic prosperity and national security, and (2) high tariffs on mineral imports can drive producing countries to export elsewhere (likely China)which could strengthen Chinas dominant position in minerals supply chains. Incentives to invest domestically and in allied countries will be an important carrot to stimulate mineral production and processing. Without this investment, building resilient supply chains will be nearly impossible.But cool. You totally know what youre talking about.

Congrats on arriving at the party 30 years late. Clintons Third Way politics may have peeled off Reagan Democrats, but he was no conservative hero. He was just trying to survive post-Reagan America, and yeah, it pissed off the left while being nowhere near the right.And Clinton didnt move your party to the right; he moved it into the swamp of opportunism. Welfare reform, NAFTA, and tough on crime policies werent were centrist sellouts, not right-wing victories. He didnt embrace conservative principles like limited government or constitutional fidelity. He embraced poll numbers and whatever kept him on top.And blaming Bill for Trump is hilarious. Americas collective frustration with corrupt elites on both sides of the aisle did, not the Clintons. Trump was the wrecking ball people sent to demolish the establishment, including Clintons crony capitalism. And lets not pretend Hillary losing was some fluke. Her arrogant entitlement to the presidency alienated swing voters. She got out-hustled and outsmarted. Thats on her.The real problem isnt that Clinton moved the Democrats to the right, its that he turned your party into a schizophrenic mess. On one hand, youve got the Bernie crowd demanding socialism on steroids, and on the other, the corporate neoliberals clinging to the Clinton era. Good luck reconciling those two without tearing each other apart. Meanwhile, conservatives are just enjoying watching the Democratic party fall apart.But heres the kicker: youre quoting Bernie Sanders to bash Clinton, but Bernies no constitutional scholar or patriot himself. The guys platform reads like a socialist wet dream, completely out of touch with Americas founding principles of liberty and self-reliance. If you want to restore the working class, maybe try policies that actually empower individuals instead of bloating government.If you want to fix your party, stop blaming dead weight like Bill Clinton for your problems. Hes been out of the picture for decades. Trump didnt win because of Bill, he won because voters didnt trust you. Clinton mightve steered the ship toward the iceberg, but its your party thats still bailing water while arguing about pronouns.","title":"CMV: Bill Clinton is the person most responsible for Donald Trump"},{"text":"Much cringe they are![gif](giphy|8hMD9YakVza3452SpN)","title":"Trump truly loves the poorly educated"},{"text":"And how will aviation work without weather forecasts?","title":"Republicans Would Regret Letting Elon Musk Ax Weather Forecasting"},{"text":":::: micropenis alert ::::","title":"Trump truly loves the poorly educated"},{"text":"No","title":"Shouldnt Trump Voters Be Viewed as Traitors?"},{"text":"Look at how Trump is cleaning the swamp with billionaires, convicts and all these great people that are under investigation for crimes.

He was actually pushing things like real immigration reform, trade reform, bringing manufacturing back, and if you go back to his speeches he spoke out on things like the international elite banking cartels and so on.Now when he got into office, he hired all the same Neocons and was largely ineffective at achieving any of his campaign agenda, and thats being generous, but I think that original message that ran counter to the GOP/Neocon agenda was what had people so excited and made him so popular.","title":"CMV: Bill Clinton is the person most responsible for Donald Trump"},{"text":"So much for Blue Lives Matter.","title":"GOP Sen.

Incidentally, thats [exactly what happened in 2022](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_New_York). In 2022, the New York Court of Appeals [threw out a democratic gerrymander](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/27/1095100208/new-york-redistricting-rejected), and the map was replaced with an [incredibly competitive and representative map](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/what-went-wrong-new-yorks-redistricting). However, the New York Court have appeals subsequently ruled that that map [would only be used for the 2022 election](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna129292), giving New York Democrats the power to re-gerrymander the state. Unsurprisingly, this re-gerrymander has given the democrats three extra seats.So no, article author, the three seats picked up by the GOP from the North Carolina gerrymander **are completely offset** by the three seats picked up by Democrats from the New York gerrymander.Also, the articles attempt to handwave away the fact that the GOP won the House popular vote is unpersuasive, and simply saying oh people dont vote because of gerrymandering does nothing to tell you how the vote would have gone, and theres no reason to think that GOP voters are more likely to show up in the face of a gerrymander.","title":"How Republicans held the House: It's the gerrymander, stupid"},{"text":"Childish hyperbole","title":"Star Wars icon Mark Hamill eviscerated for 'disgraceful' Trump comparison"},{"text":"First true oligarchs?

I agree with you that AOC has a strong brand and I like that she's been taking steps to mainstream herself and her views, but I don't think she will be in the best position to win in 2028. She's very young, especially for a politician, and has a lot of time to gain experience and endear herself to people outside her current base.","title":"For Rising Democrats, the Quiet Race to Lead the Party Began Months Ago"},{"text":"There are way too many things going on in NYC outside a Presidents control.

So having someone that knows how the state parties are run and how to best support them from the DNC is going to be very helpful.Sad to see him go in Wisconsin, but that was not a one-man show there and there will surely be a competent successor to run the ground game there.Generally, getting state party people running the DNC is very good  long term, because it means that all levels of the party will work together to elect democrats up and down the ballot - instead of having someone from a presidential campaign installed that favors the top of the ticket. It might not yield the best immediate results in the 2028 presidential election, but it will have long-term implications and benefits on the sustainability of electoral success. We can already see that in this years presidential vs. House elections compared to 2016: Democrats lost the House by mid double digits (in seats), now we have 215 seats. In 2016, the state parties in the midwest suffered another defeat, now they kept the lights on and are still breathing.

Of course they're going fire the people claiming the economy is great when people can barely afford rent, let alone food or medicine.Mind you, Trump is not populist. He never was. He's fascist. Bernie Sanders is populist and he's genuine. He doesn't flip flop or talk out of both sides of his mouth. He owns his positions and defends them. That's what people want.

On this both Trump appointees and career officials could agree.\\nA 40-year-old lawyer with little government experience, he joined the administration in 2019 and rose rapidly. Each new title set off new alarms.\\nWhen Patel was installed as chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense just after the 2020 election, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised him not to break the law in order to keep President Donald Trump in power. Life looks really shitty from behind bars, Milley reportedly told Patel. (Patel denies this.) \\nWhen Trump entertained naming Patel deputy director of the FBI, Attorney General Bill Barr confronted the White House chief of staff and said, Over my dead body.\\nWhen, in the final weeks of the administration, Trump planned to name Patel deputy director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, the agencys head, threatened to resign. Trump relented only after an intervention by Vice President Mike Pence and others.\\nWho was this man, and why did so many top officials fear him?\\nIt wasnt a question of ideology. He wasnt a zealot like Stephen Miller, trying to make the bureaucracy yield to his agenda. Rather, Patel appeared singularly focused on pleasing Trump. Even in an administration full of loyalists, Patel was exceptional in his devotion.\\nThis was what seemed to disturb many of his colleagues the most: Patel was dangerous, several of them told me, not because of a certain plan he would be poised to carry out if given control of the CIA or FBI, but because he appeared to have no plan at allhis priorities today always subject to a mercurial presidents wishes tomorrow. (Patel disputes this characterization.)#\\n  \\n Such is the present dynamic of Kash Patels life: marketing Orange Man Bad Punisher-skull license plates and dubious supplements while fielding questions about which major national-security or law-enforcement agency he might soon like to run. Kash, I know youre probably going to be head of the CIA, Steve Bannon said on his podcast, War Room, this past December. But do you believe that you can deliver the goods on this in pretty short order, the first couple of months, so we can get rolling on prosecutions?\\nBannon was talking here about receipts, the supposedly incriminating documents and emails that a second Trump administration would use to bring cases against deep-state dwellers and members of the press. Patel expressed no doubt about his capacity to deliver the goods. We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media, he said. Yes, were going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential electionswere going to come after you.\\nA lot of people say hes crazy, Trump once said of Patel, according to the longtime adviser. I think hes kind of crazy. But sometimes you need a little crazy.#\\n  \\n By the winter of 2018, Republicans had lost the House, and Schiff was set to take over the intelligence committee. Patel later wrote that Nunes, as promised, urged Trump to hire his protg onto the National Security Council. According to Patel, when Trump realized just whom Nunes was referring tothe man who had saved his presidency by revealing the unprecedented political hit job designed to take him downhe ordered his chief of staff to onboard Patel at once.\\nFormer administration officials told me that, from his first days as a staffer on the National Security Council, in February 2019, Patel was fixated on trying to get face time with Trump. He had a script, and it wasnt long before many of his colleagues could recite it themselves: Mr. President, the deep state is out to get you, as the longtime Trump adviser paraphrased it, and Im going to save you from it. Five months into his tenure, Patel was made the senior director of the NSCs counterterrorism directorate.\\nMuch has been written about Patels year on the National Security Council, including the early suspicions among his colleagues that he was funneling information about Ukraine directly to Trump, outside official channels. In the former presidents first impeachment inquiry, the NSC official Fiona Hill testified about learning from another colleague that Trump apparently viewed Patel as the councils director on Ukraine policy, though his portfolio had nothing to do with Ukraine. Hill said she had been sufficiently alarmed to report the conversation to her superior and then warn her colleagues to be very careful in their communications with Patel. Lets just say its a red flag, she testified, when somebody who you barely know is involved on one of your policy issues and clearly providing materials outside of the lineparticularly when she didnt know what those materials were.\\nPatel has repeatedly denied ever discussing Ukraine with Trump. In his rendering, his colleagues were jealous of his close relationship with the president and still hated him for the Russia investigation. Not only was the deep states plot against him still in motion, Patel seemed to decide, but it had expanded.\\nFor the most part, this is how he explains the rest of his time in the Trump administration, why it is that at virtually every turnfrom the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to the Department of Defense to very nearly the FBI and CIAthere emerges yet another crop of officials who object to his accrual of power. It could not possibly be the case, for example, that Bill Barr harbored genuine concerns about Patels qualifications to serve as deputy FBI director: In Patels version of events, Barr was simply one more top bureaucrat bent on foiling Patels success as payback for the mess hed exposed in their agency. And if this narrative begins to feel less and less plausible, if Patels latest detractors have to date seemed as reliably pro-Trump as Patel himselfwell, that just goes to show their cunning.","title":"The Man Who Will Do Anything for Trump"},{"text":"I think trump is trying to rile up Dems so there will be riots and he can declare marshal law/emergency.

I tried it as a larp, I didnt think it would be real. I tried it in a remote area, and it actually worked. 2 UFOs showed up clear as day.The second 2 UFOs I saw were at a large music festival on a farm. They were ORBs, although the second sighting the ORB was morphing and doing insane things. You can think that seeing orbs is rare/unlikely, but there are many videos of Orbs (MH730 plane video, Manchester airport, Afghanistan, etc). There are also numerous photos of orbs. The ones I saw had no visible propulsion, could move in an instant in any direction, could move at speeds faster than imaginable by humans. They also seemed telepathic and would react to your thoughts. I dont know what they were, if they were alive, if they were military tech- I have no idea, I just know what I saw.The first shapeshifter I saw was when I was teaching in Japan, another teacher shapeshifted right infront of me. Long skinny black forked lizard tongue, scaly beige skin. I walked out of the classroom and my ears starting ringing and I thought I was gunna black out, literally like what happens in movies when people experience extreme shock. I pretended it never happened because I didnt want them to know I saw their true identity, and I never told anyone because I knew nobody would believed me and I would be labeled a far right conspiracy theorist. \\nI saw one other shapeshifter clear as day, it drove past me while I was walking on a sidewalk. Big yellow eyes with black slits, long skinny forked black tongue.Anyway I suspect Ive seen many other shapeshifters, they dont expose themselves lkke these other 2 did but they smell the same as the first one and they have extremely weird skin textures. Another tell is they dont naturally hold their hand in a normal way, offer their pinky is sticking up all the time. They naturally rest their hands in a way that would be uncomfortable to humans. The eyes  is also very telling, there eyes look different even when they are in human form. Mostly Ill witnessed what I believe to be shapeshifters if I am doing deliveries to high end companies such as consulting firms, architectural firms, Tech companies like Apple, or financial firms.Anyway obviously this is a quick synopsis; I could go into much more intricate detail of these sighting and the surroundings/other witnesses, but thats the general story. Many people have had experiences with NHI, I was 99.999% convinced NHI existed before I ever saw a UFO IRL just researching peoples testimonies. Either millions of people are lying and schizophrenic, often having collective psychosis/mass hallucinations such as what happened at the school in Zimbabwe, or their is truth to the UFO phenomenon and the NHI presence on our planet. The evidence is everywhere if you are willing to look, but obviously this topic is heavily censored. They also explain the history of UFO censorship in the film the phenomenon. The government used to have a ufo investigation program but then they got rid of the program like UFOs dont exist anymore nothing to see here Lol","title":"They are Cloning Celebrities"},{"text":"Some of those who work forces.","title":"GOP Sen.

It flips the judeo-christian moral order that supposedly underpins our constitution and founding values on its head.You will know when the new hellscape arrives when you hear friends or family complaining (or bragging) that they had to pay a bribe for : their kids to go to a coveted public school, get on a coveted club team, to get a promotion, to get a job, to keep their job when mass layoffs happen, when they get stopped at an airport on the street by law enforcement for petty infractions, when they are at risk of imprisonment for a felony, to avoid paying taxes or to get a license.Corruption is a virus that infects, spreads, degrades, then consumes its host. It needs new victims and opportunities to flourish. While elites may materially flourish it internally weakens a country and set's stage for revolution. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the kind of stuff that happens when oligarchic corruption metastasizes to a point where an emerging democratic neighbor is viewed as a mortal threat that must be destroyed at all cost.The only way to keep this virus (oligarchy)  from taking over and killing the host (us) is to speak out against it when you see it, document and spread the injustice online to foster outrage at the betrayal of our American values and impose costs on the perpetrators, and be ready to make real sacrifices to maintain your individual rights and dignity.Project 2025 - Making Anti-Americanism Great Again.","title":"Trumps Next Term Could See Americas First True Oligarchs, Warns Democracy Activist Garry Kasparov"},{"text":"Wait, so your ilk has been on about fake news for a decade, but... just not this specific news, right?After what the media and Trump did to the USA in 2020 with covid and the vaccine, the burden is solidly in your court to prove that any given _story_ is based in reality.","title":"The first attempt at Trumps life was a setup by his team."},{"text":"Yeah I did a quick google search.

I think for some reason, I'm more concerned about Trump's image this second time around. On the one hand I like the fact that Trump doesn't f around and everybody knows that and the world leaders will not try to walk all over us. But on the other hand I think Trump's one weakness has always been that he doesn't know how to play politics. I suspect that's because in the real estate business everyone is a competitor and he's not used to forming alliances and coalitions and whatnot. I hope he learned enough from his first term to realize that whether he likes it or not he's going to have to become a politician too to get everything done that he wants. Not everything with governments and politics is based on the bottom line financially. There are a lot of other factors that go into this. And he has to learn how to appeal to those. The president of Mexico is a good example. She's a female and she's just in power. For Trump to make that tariff declaration publicly is probably going to make her lose face and make her appear weak and she might not like that. You notice already how her comments are variance with what Trump said happened. I'm not saying Trump shouldn't use tariffs but I think part of it is how he's using it. Why not call up the leader and talk to them first before making a public statement like that? You have to know your enemy. With Trudeau yeah go ahead and ass fuck him he deserves it and he's a lap dog who is a beta male and he's going to give in and fly all the way down to Mar-A-Lago to kiss Trump's ring. But a new entity like the Mexican president you don't know, maybe he should be a little more cautious on how he approaches her.

Decades ago governments decided the course of the nation, raked in the money for it and made it happen. Even republicans made lives of people better.
