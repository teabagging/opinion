The median American has savings. Politicians on both the left and right love the rhetoric of Americans working multiple jobs to get by. In reality, less than 5% of the labour force does so (and that includes upper-class professionals like a lawyer who does consulting on the side). Nor is it what voters themselves say: The average American thinks democrats are far too liberal. They see the party as to their left on both economic and social issues. Only 6% said they thought Harris was not liberal enough. This is not an electorate crying out for socialism, turning away from Democrats because they havent seized the means of production.Finally, the narrative (hereafter called the poverty narrative) often assumes an outdated (and decidedly masculine) vision of a frustrated proletariat of laid off coal miners, quite at odds with the reality of life for most working Americans in the 21st century. The 23-year-old barista serving you coffee at Starbucks, who lives with roommates in a small apartment, who doesnt have job security, or the ability to pursue her goals in lifeshe most likely did not vote for Trump. The electorate has undergone class realignment, but exit polls still show the lowest income Americans preferred Harris. https://archive.ph/Okt5w","title":"Why arent more politicians condemning Nancy Maces vicious anti-trans stunts?"},{"text":"Thats why articles like this are straight BSEither Dems are lying or this article is BS because you cant let Facism back into power and consider yourself a success.","title":"Bidenomics Was Wildly Successful"},{"text":"True.

Even though it was all bullshit, people listened because he actually spoke to their frustrations, unlike the DNC who just kept telling voters everything is great and nothing needs to fundamentally change.\\nHad the Dems focused on painting corporate elites as the real enemy in contrast to Trump's lies about immigrants, they could have won. The party needed to have a clear agenda of rejecting neoliberalism and the establishment, attacking the 1%, and pushing that message relentlessly and in unisonbut they didn't because they're controlled opposition whose only real goal is serving the capitalists that fund them.","title":"Joe Biden tells Kamala Harris \\"you're not going anywhere\\" after loss"},{"text":"Agreed.

For example, people scoring high in conscientiousness care more about cleanliness, are more organised and several other things. However, you can't describe somebody high in extroversion, openness, neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness independently of each of those specific attributes. In other words, they don't add up to a whole or a \\"type.\\" The Big 5 don't do harm or good really because they're aren't used to put people in boxes like mbti/enneagram or astrology. On another note, things like adhd, or even personality disorders, are beneficial on a clinical level because people are able to get treatment.

This is obviously much clearer in European countries with significantly better government-sponsored healthcare and education, but still true in the US. You said it yourself: when taxes were much lower, the government provided far less to the people. Now taxes are higher, but services from the government have increased as well. So, while you certainly may not *choose* to buy those particular services if you had control of your tax dollars, you do see direct returns to some extent. While the public may ultimately benefit from kiddie farms and reproductive coercion, the benefit wont be immediately and clearly visible. It would be a massive legislative fight that would never be accepted by the public.

It didn't work with Nazi Germany, Russia, the Middle East or pretty much any war-torn nation in the history of ever. Republicans only get away with it because they literally have a platform based on violence that simply declares an overarching enemy worse than anything on their own side (which is ALSO why they condone rape and pedophilia amongst their leadership: better a pastor who has raped his daughter than a Democrat).There is also older research that I remember from my college textbook that basically states that not only do such actions not drive unity, but actually ENCOURAGE polarization.

Not unless there is already a basis of shared values, and there can be no basis of shared values when it comes to Nazis.

After all, repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different result is the very definition of insanity.

Is it a wise tribe that does not send its best warriors to fight? You see, your masters will never give you the tools to dismantle their houses... The Republic of America has a so-called \\"representative democracy.\\" How can that be true when the \\"representatives\\" are all wealthy while the majority of the \\"represented\\" are poor?American two party politics is like the cartoon Tom and Jerry. Tom doesn't really want to catch Jerry because then he'd be out of a job, and Jerry doesn't want Tom replaced with a cat that will actually eat him. So they act like they hate one another and put on a show for the masses while continuing business as usual in the back room.

Furthermore, when the punishment for a crime is only a fine, it does not apply to the wealthy.

Again, i can understand that social adoption of semi-scientific terms has utility, but people do no exist on a spectrum of autistic - schizophrenic. These conditions don't operate like \\"tall vs. short\\".i guess where i'm going is something like this:1. our brains operate with categories and hierarchy as primary foundations.

Astrology may be a bunch of people just spamming words in a collective bible of sorts, but that text does get people thinking about who they are and how they click. Personality types are a more scientific approach to this, but in reality they may be less far off from astrology than they think. We are all different, and we need a language to communicate what those differences are and how we are going to react to the same situation differently - but the language is crude. Personality types are a current dialect of that language, evolving from astrology. But people get lazy in conversation, which leads to label plopping.

Its going to cost them for decades.","title":"Key Group Looks Past AOC In Democrats' Highest-Profile Fight For House Panel Spots"},{"text":"I agree with you that these personality types or ways of labeling ourselves and each other are often overly simplistic and don't give us a full picture of who someone is or why they are the way they are. However, I disagree that they do more harm than good. I think of them as pretty neutral, and I think your post is focusing on the ways that they can be limiting without acknowledging the ways they can be helpful or used to build deeper bonds and relationships.\\nFirst, I think humans like labels. The way that we talk to each other is often very metaphorical and we often use comparisons to make points or to explain how we feel to other people. Usually, I think people are using these types of labels to connect in ways that would otherwise be difficult in a first meeting or a setting that isn't conducive to deep conversation. At a party, telling someone \\"oh I'm a ravenclaw\\" or \\"I'm an INTJ\\" is a way to convey something about both your interests and your values. You'll get responses varying from \\"oh me too!\\" To \\"what's that?\\" And generally these responses open up the conversation for more discussion than stating simple facts about yourself would.\\nThe choice of label itself is a way of connecting too- sharing your hogwarts house indicates you like Harry Potter, sharing your personality types indicates that you've taken the time to think about the way you like to learn or communicate, sharing your astrology sign might indicate that you hold certain beliefs about the way the stars influence human behavior, etc. It helps you find like-minded people and can be an entry point into a conversation about why you like certain things or how you conceptualize yourself.\\nSecond, these labels can help people interact with or relate to other people who think differently than them. A lot of people, especially on the younger side, will assume that most people think/feel/approach problems in a similar way to them. These types of labels and personality types can be a way for someone to understand that, for example, quiet people aren't being rude/uninterested or that someone who asks a lot of questions isn't stupid/judgy, they just have a different way of responding to things.?\\nThird, having these frameworks can help guide discussions about yourself and your relationships with those around you. For example, when I told my friends that I'm a waterbender (from avatar the last airbender), many of them laughed and I was told unanimously that I am an earth bender. This was surprising to me, and upon further discussion I learned that I was perceived as a pretty stubborn person and that in conversations I was coming off as much more rigid than I meant to.?\\nI don't know if all of this makes sense, but the crux of my argument is that these labels are good tools to connect with other people, express your values and interests, and frame discussions about relationships. This only works, of course, if the label is not seen as a rigid- if people respond by being curious about the label (\\"oh why do you think you'd be a slytherin?\\") rather than judgemental (\\"oh well I'm a gryffindor so we won't get along, I hate slytherins\\"). I think the way you've described them being used is very prescriptive (\\"you are x so therfore you must feel y) whereas I think they should be (and usually are) used in a more descriptive way (\\"I feel y, so I identify with x\\").?","title":"CMV: Personality types do more harm than good."},{"text":"Private citizen of a foreign nation Elon Musk?","title":"Bernie Sanders urges Biden to very seriously consider pre-emptive pardons for House Jan. 6 Committee"},{"text":"ALL campaigns hire number crunchers from big tech and other corporations.","title":"Outgoing Sen.

The frustrating thing about Obama is he only showed up for his own races- we got clobbered in both mid-terms because his staff didn't want him to lose any luster. They also showed up to planning sessions unprepared. And the final indignity is Obama let the party itself wither on the vine. The DNC headed into 2016 with a crap ton of debt and Debbie Wasserman Schultz mismanaging (basically non-managing) because Obama's team would not step up to replace DWS or fundraise so they had at least a clean slate for 2016. They actually had to negotiate with him for his frickin mailing lists to try to raise $ back to 0. Then Team Obama pushed everyone aside (including Biden) for Clinton with absolutely no acknowledgement of her being a flawed candidate an enemy #1 of the entire right wing.","title":"Full Caucus Set to Vote After Key Panel Picks Pelosi-Backed Dem Over AOC for Oversight Spot | Rep.

You can spend years relatively close with someone before you start to really understand them. One might imagine that personality archetypes as a sort of tool to establish some base level understanding. A scaffold to construct a more complicated model. But in my experience this is rarely how it functions in practice. People who care about these things will use whatever personality categorization they like and stop further interest in the person. Is misuse really sufficient to completely dismiss an invention? It seems to me that you recognize the utility, but just believe that it is being misused. Well, if that's the bar, there are a wide, wide variety of inventions that would be bad under that rubric. Neoliberal capitalism is perhaps the most efficient system at creating material wealth, but it has come at the cost of elliminating community. Maybe for you. I met most of my friends through the internet, and have developed a very tight-knit community. Again, this comes down to use, not the utility of the invention.But this isn't what generates human happiness.

A free society would be a more prosperous one. This, to slaverys defenders, completely missed the point. John C. Calhoun, a proslavery senator, in a famous speech responded:Can as much, on the score of equality be said of the North? With us, the two great divisions of society are not rich and poor, but White and Black; and all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected... and hence have a position and pride of character which either poverty nor misfortune can deprive them.It wasnt, for Calhoun, about absolute financial status, but about always having someone beneath you.Once people gain a bit of comfort, the desire to punish people for not knowing their place (be it the working class, women, or a racial group) can become their sole political instinct.

The PM spoke to the Liberal Party faithful at a Laurier Club holiday party at the Canadian History Museum across the Ottawa River in Gatineau, Que.Speaking to a room filled with about 600 friendly faces, the prime minister made quick references to todays chaos before moving on to galvanizing party members.Thank you all for being here tonight, its obviously been an eventful day. Its not been an easy day, said Trudeau at the opening of his speech. But I wanted to come here tonight to speak to you, the dedicated devoted members of the Liberal Party because you not me or any other politician are the beating heart of this movement.In what sounded more and more like an election speech, the prime minister also went on to highlight his governments track record, touting the measures like the Canada Child Benefit and the national dental care program, before taking digs at Poilievre.Later he threw in some possible shade: Thats why I wake up every single day thinking about how to make this nation work better for all Canadians. That mission to consistently put in the work so that were living up to our ideals and values, thats at the core of what makes us Liberals. And that is why you show up here even on the toughest days as a party. You know that the only thing that ultimately matters is fighting like hell every single day to make life better for Canadians.The Hill Times could not spot Freeland amongst the crowd.Trudeau ended his speech by giving his party members holiday homework.So please enjoy your holidays. Recharge by spendings some much needed time with your loved ones, and come back ready to show Canadians we have a serious positive vision for the future of this great country that is worth fighting for, said Trudeau.Following the Laurier Club event, the day would not be over for Trudeau as the results from the federal byelection in the B.C. riding of Cloverdale-Langley City were still set to come in. The riding was left open when federal Liberal John Aldag unsuccessfully ran as a B.C. NDP candidate in the Octobers provincial election.Further readings:['We're not united': Liberal caucus meets, as PM Trudeau faces fresh calls to resign in light of Freeland's departure](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/we-re-not-united-liberal-caucus-meets-as-pm-trudeau-faces-fresh-calls-to-resign-in-light-of-freeland-s-departure-1.7147577)[Inside Chrystia Freelands surprising resignation  and the fallout that has Justin Trudeau fighting for his political life](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/inside-chrystia-freelands-surprising-resignation-and-the-fallout-that-has-justin-trudeau-fighting-for-his/article_f7a74166-bbb6-11ef-a5c8-dfb7d5b5e053.html)[It's time for Justin Trudeau to resign](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/it-s-time-for-justin-trudeau-to-resign/article_23865ec6-bc01-11ef-a55f-534351a90181.html)[Chrystia Freeland made it clear: There is no Liberal government.

The DNC has learned absolutely nothing in the past **16 years** of US politics and is going to stick to their geriatric, neoliberal guns while a corrupt Trump presidency actively undermines democracy in order to bury the left. If AOC loses this vote it will be a clear signal that the DNC has no hope in 2026 or beyond. The only real choice in challenging the risen oligarchy is to let the GOP blow all their autocratic ammo on the DNC while progressives sneak off the sinking ship, focus on downballot support, and rise up as a new 3rd party until it grows strong enough to replace the DNC. Unfortunately that means conceding the next 4+ years of federal majority to the right.

It wasnt like before when he weathered the message.**During the Oct. 23 caucus meeting, approximately two dozen MPs urged Trudeau to step down. The [Dec. 16th] emergency caucus meeting was held after Freelands (University-Rosedale, Ont.) bombshell resignation. Over the course of the 90-minute meeting, about 20 MPs spoke, with most calling for Trudeaus resignation. Sources said that while some MPs were more direct, this time even some parliamentary secretaries voiced their concerns about Trudeaus leadership. Freeland also attended the meeting and received a standing ovation from her caucus colleagues.**Liberal MPs told The Hill Times that Trudeau urged MPs not to publicly talk about this subject and assured them that he has received their message. However, he did not specify what decision he would make or when he would announce it.**I have heard very clearly, you dont need to go outside and talk about this. I have heard everything, a Liberal MP told The Hill Times, paraphrasing Trudeaus remarks inside caucus. It was absorbed this time, it wasnt weathered.**MPs said that it appears to them that he has decided to leave but wants to take a few days or weeks to reflect and decide the details of his departure.The sentiment was very similar . This time the prime minister clearly acknowledged and understood, said a second Liberal source. A lot of new people spoke who had not spoken before. The impression is that hes mentally made a decision. Hes thinking through it, working through it. Hes focusing on process and moving forward and what it means in terms of how things will develop very quickly.After the caucus meeting, most Liberal MPs declined to comment. But, Liberal MP Chad Collins (Hamilton East-Stoney Creek, Ont.) told reporters that Trudeau should step down.**The Toronto Star, meanwhile, reported that 45 Liberal MP had signed the letter asking for the prime minister to resign, up from 24, according to sources.**[...]We fear what a 'Make Canada Great Again' agenda from Mr. Poilievre means to our constituents, and I think the only path forward for us is to choose a new leader, and to present a new plan to Canadians with a different vision, Collins said.Some, however, expressed their support for Trudeau.\\"We know that President Trump is coming into office on the 20th of January, Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne (Saint Maurice-Champlain, Que.) told reporters after the caucus meeting. It is incumbent upon us, we owe it to Canadians, we owe it to our families, and to our friends, and everyone in Canada to be the best prepared, to make sure that we have everything lined up to make sure that we can stand up for Canada.\\"A third Liberal MP observed that Trudeau appeared to carefully consider his MPs' remarks, both through his words and body language. However, this MP noted that they did not sense the prime minister had reached any definitive decision.Meanwhile, Ottawa was thrust into political turmoil on Monday morning after Freeland resigned. In her letter to Prime Minister Trudeaus (Papineau, Que.), which she posted on X, at 9:07 a.m., Freeland, who has been Trudeau's top cabinet minister for nine years and who served as finance minister since August 2020, criticized the government's financial decisions in a harsh language. Freeland said her resignation was the only honest and viable path for her after Trudeau asked her to step down as finance minister on Friday, Dec. 13, and offered her another cabinet post, she wrote.In her letter, Freeland wrote that she and the prime minister had been \\"at odds about the best path forward\\" for Canada in recent weeks. To be effective, a minister must speak on behalf of the prime minister and with his full confidence. In making your decision, you made clear that I no longer credibly enjoy that confidence and possess the authority that comes with it, Freeland wrote.The former minister confirmed that she will remain as an MP for Toronto and will run again in the next federal election. Freeland warned that Canada faces a \\"grave challenge\\" with the incoming Trump administrations \\"policy of aggressive economic nationalism,\\" citing Trump's threat of 25 per cent tariffs.[...]Treasury Board President Anita Anand (Oakville, Ont.), meanwhile, called Freeland a good friend who she worked with closely in her files. Anand told reporters that the news of Freelands departure hit her really hard, as she went into cabinet meeting.To fill in the hole suddenly left by Freeland, Trudeau tapped longtime Liberal MP and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc (Beausjour, N.B.) Monday in the late afternoon. LeBlanc will add the finance portfolio to his ever growing roster of files, which includes public safety, democratic institutions, intergovernmental affairs, and the Canada-U.S. Cabinet Committee.[...]Government sources told The Hill Times that LeBlanc will temporarily retain his public safety and democratic institutions positions. But these roles are expected to be reassigned during a cabinet shuffle that was initially anticipated to take place this week or next month. LeBlanc did not assume the role of deputy prime minister.[...]NDP House Leader Peter Julian (New Westminster-Burnaby, B.C.) called it a \\"chaotic day, but he echoed the Conservative calls for a debate on the fall economic statement. NDP MP Matthew Green (Hamilton Centre, Ont.) echoed that view, saying: \\"I find it rather gormless that they came into this house, dropped the report, and then left without an opportunity for us to debate here today.\\"Speaking to reporters before Question Period, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, B.C.) said, Justin Trudeau has to go, he has to resign. However, when pressed, he did not clarify whether he would vote for a motion of non-confidence to bring down the Liberal government, and said that all options are on the table.Trudeau did not attend the Question Period, but did attend LeBlanc's swearing-in.","title":"PM Trudeau appears to have reached a decision about his future, but hes not yet prepared to announce it, say some Liberal MPs"},{"text":"But you lost, you have NO power, remember?","title":"Robert Garcia Demands Senate Block 'Conspiracy Theorist' RFK Jr.'s Nomination To Be HHS Secretary"},{"text":"He knows nothing, it is our birthright as Americans.","title":"This Parkland Shooting Survivor Wants a Top DNC Leadership Spot - We need to realize that we are increasingly the party of sycophants, David Hogg warned, stressing the need for a shift in the Democratic Party."},{"text":"Canadians after PM Poilievre finally verbs the noun -https://i.redd.it/1d18773hhf7e1.gif","title":"PM Trudeau appears to have reached a decision about his future, but hes not yet prepared to announce it, say some Liberal MPs"},{"text":"Schools should have armed security just like a bank and that is the only thing that will stop this.

It's more than just a google replacement. It's a google, quizlet, onenote, study guide, practice test, etc. replacement all in one. I was a great student and had a perfectly capable study system before using ChatGPT, but it's just *so good* at this particular application I really think people are sleeping on it. There is no platform that can unify every single aspect of the study process and enhance it like an LLM can. The only downside (for the moment) is that you have to type everything, and it's well known that handwriting is better than typing for durable memory. But it's definitely better for anyone who mostly studied digitally before, and we are now getting interfaces (themselves powered by AI) that are pretty good at interpreting handwriting on a tablet. The other stuff I agree is a marginal improvement that really is better than a traditional search engine but not so much better that it makes sense to change the way you do things unless you are like me and enjoy using new toys just to use them.As far as law, you're completely right. The greatest challenge for AI right now is the error rate, which means that the more error-tolerant a field is, the better AI is. In tech, we create test environments that allow us to make sure a thing is not broken before we ever expose it to real world use, which can catch AI errors as well as it catches human errors, making our field uniquely error-tolerant. With law, your error-tolerance is much lower and error-correction is so laborious that it eliminates the time savings entirely, and your privacy concerns are huge so I think your caution is understandable (local models would solve this, but we have some distance to go before those are good). So I suspect it will be quite a while before we use LLMs there.","title":"Can the US Power Industry Meet AIs Steep Energy Demands? | Thanks to AI, data centers are popping up across the country.

[World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/press/2024/01/wef24-climate-crisis-health/) estimates 14.5 mln excess deaths by 2050 only due to heat, pollution, fires, and extreme weather events. Additionally, 500 mln people can be affected by diseases (malaria, for example, is already migrating north).According to the [WHO estimates](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health), climate change will cause 250 000 excess deaths per year due to undernutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, and heat stress *alone*. These estimates do not include catastrophic scenarios like global famine due to massive crop failures (this becomes more likely as the climate worsens), mass migrations from equatorial regions, novel diseases, or dramatic changes in local weather and global climate due to crossed tipping points.It is also worth considering that older people are more at risk and will die in higher numbers. If humanity continues on its current course, life expectancy will drop and the ageing population may pose fewer problems.  \\nAccording to the [International Chamber of Commerce 2024 report](https://iccwbo.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/2024-ICC-Oxera-The-economic-cost-of-extreme-weather-events.pdf), the economic damages caused by climate change in the past 10 years totalled $2 trillion (in 2023 prices). This estimate is based on about 4 000 events from 2014 to 2023 and does not include damage caused by gradual impacts of climate change. The authors also note that they calculate only direct losses (e.g. property destruction and loss of human life). The report states: 'The estimated impact only captures a small part of the impacts so should be considered a lower bound, with the true economic impact likely orders of magnitude greater.'It is important to note that damages grow higher as global temperatures increase. Future losses will be much higher than what we've experienced so far.A [paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07219-0) estimates that by 2050 global incomes with reduce by 19% (likely range is 11-29%) *regardless* of any emission choices. All regions except at very high latitudes (e.g. Russia, Canada) are expected to suffer losses, with lower latitude regions (tropical regions) suffering the most.[Another paper](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/17/economic-damage-climate-change-report) (link to The Guardian article, the original paper is behind a paywall) found that economic damages might be comparable to financial losses due to a permanent war. According to the authors, a global temperature increase of 1C leads to a 12% drop in global GDP (we are already past that). At 3C (this is where we are heading now) the losses might reach 50% (this means that by 2100 people will be 50% poorer than they would be without climate change). At 1.5C (the Paris Agreement's target) the losses are projected to be about 15% (unfortunately, 1.5C is no longer a viable target, IPCC already aims for 2C).\\\\TLDR: Climate change is a much more serious problem and a greater threat to humanity in the next 100 years than low fertility rates in developed countries. Even in the absence of catastrophic changes, the excess deaths will be in the tens of millions and economic damages will cause a significant reduction in the world GDP and per capita incomes of the absolute majority of the world's population.","title":"CMV: The fertility rate crisis is the biggest crisis we'll face for the next 100 years."},{"text":"In 50 years or so will be my guess, she will be the apt age for congress.","title":"Full Caucus Set to Vote After Key Panel Picks Pelosi-Backed Dem Over AOC for Oversight Spot | Rep.

Women had more children because more children died in childhood than they do now. Often women would have 5/6 kids and 3 would survive until adulthood.

Its focused on if there are enough people to replace the _current_ working and earning population, not if we are going extinct as a species or if the lower birth rates say anything about the current state of the world or even if its sustainable or useful to have children at the replacement rate.

Older people checking out via firearm suicide is probably something that ought to be looked at more carefully.  Is the issue health related?  Financial?  Both?  Maybe fixing (presumably) financial/health reasons people commit suicide is a great way to reduce firearm deaths without banning any guns.  Progress doesn't necessary require bans.[And most firearm crimes the US are being perpetrated by handguns](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195325/murder-victims-in-the-us-by-weapon-used/), not assault weapons.This shouldn't be a surprise because most gun crimes are being done by everyday average criminals (rather than the high profile mass shootings that make their way to the news).  And those types of criminals (unlike many mass shooters) aren't suicidal.  They believe they have something to live for.  And that means not getting caught by police.  And that means they need something consealable, hence the prevelance of handguns in most firearm-related crimes rather than rifles.Democratic leadership, even the ones most out of touch on gun policy, know banning handguns in America is political suicide.But it's not as clear to them that the same is true for semi-auto rifles with pistol grips and adjustable stocks so they've delluded themselves into thinking that's an achievable goal.  It's not.American voters in swing states don't like what the party is selling on gun rights.You can choose to ignore that fact and risk losing more elections, but frankly I'd rather win elections because there are bigger issues at stake (like protecting democracy).

The solution is not a chatbot, the solution is a programming environment better than the archaic 70s era garbage we use right now, think SmalltalkI think you need to elaborate on this. Outside of some sort of ML, whether it's the technology underlying LLMs or something else, how does a better programming environment solve these problems? Moreover, isnt it kind of handwavey to say that we just need a new type of technology? As an industry professional I don't choose what language I use for a good chunk of my work, and Id rather not have a whole separate environment and language setup for personal coding. What makes GPT so good at this is that it works directly with whatever your existing technology stack is. If you work in React, it writes React components. If you're doing data science with pandas and numpy it writes your python scripts. So gimmicks?This is not really responsive. Especially the first educational use case is a pretty huge benefit for me personally. Even if I was somehow only able to use it for that it would still be worth my subscription as long as I'm in school and getting new certs. It's just superior to every other edtech platform out there right now. You can dismiss it as a gimmick but that seems like motivated reasoning. The other two I guess it depends on how you define a gimmick. To me, it means a feature that sounds good but isn't used that often. I on the other hand see these two things I'm describing as nice add on features that I use a lot and raise the overall value profile even if they aren't core functions that sell the product, the same way I like that my phone lets me remote control the lamps in my living room.Cryptobros said the same thing. The internet had a use case very early, it connected the US military and was resistant to nuclear war.The difference between this and crypto is it already does in fact have a wide variety of use cases, which are the ones I've just outlined to you and which you have responded to by saying either a) you just think another technology works better or b) you think those use cases don't seem significant to you personally. But dismissing then doesn't make it like crypto, where the value proposition is always about someone else having a core use case therefore justifying the person's own speculation. AI advocates like myself use it all the time.

He says a lot of stupid/terrible stuff, gaffes and bigotry, ignorance and lies like a fire hose, but people look past it because hes not poll-testing his words, which makes them trust him more even though hes a damn conman.?The key is people are tired of politics as usual, and when they see someone who talks like a usual politician, they attribute all of the stuff they dislike about the system/their life to that politician.?Kamala looked great right out of the gate, when she got Bidens endorsement and hit the trail. She looked like she was going to be this straight-talking, fun normal person with the coconut crew and all that, then she started getting more and more guarded as the campaign went on. Even the SNL appearance, which I thought was amazing, was scripted. She comes off as scripted. People are over it.?Im convinced she faltered enough that she couldnt recover back when she was being asked about the positions she took in the 2020 primary and she basically backtracked on anything that wasnt middle-of-the-road policy. Furthermore, she feigned indignation that people were confused about her positions. It came across as typical politician B.S. It told the electorate that she doesnt believe what she says, she just picks positions she thinks will get her votes.Trump, who has no principles other than perhaps racism and greed, gets a pass because he doesnt equivocate very often and he usually doubles down when he says something unpopular, rather than trying to convince you that youd misheard him or misunderstood it. People find that refreshing. They dont know/care that hes a conman.We need a communicator who has their heart in the right place, knows it, and is willing to double down on unpopular positions when they know they are the right positions. People respect that. People want confidence. They want a leader who isnt afraid of looking bad, or at least gives the appearance they arent.?","title":"Kamala Harris is reportedly eyeing another White House run.

The overview that I want to try to convince you of is that, like with any novel technology, you're going to get a huge expansion in usage that is kind of akin to a random walk, where sometimes it hits on a really good usage and other times it's kind of pointless. This mirrors exactly what we saw at the dawn of the modern internet, where there were lots of internet and ecommerce companies in the 90s that didn't make sense on a fundamental level and got wiped out. We also saw it at the beginning of the smartphone era, where you had apps and features being created that didn't make a lot of sense alongside the revolutionary ones.Here are some ways I use AI every single day that have made more productive. For the record, I use the version of ChatGPT that costs $20/mo. I assume it is reasonably capable of these on the free version but I can't make any promises.* In the past, if I had some sort of menial spreadsheet task to complete, I would write a custom Python script to handle this, which usually turned a four hour task into a thirty minute one. With ChatGPT, I can often simply upload the file, ask it to do it for me, and have my finished product in under five minutes. * It's pretty good at producing straightforward boilerplate code, it is basically a junior engineer in a box -- sometimes you have to correct logical or syntax errors, but it's a lot faster than writing it from scratch.* It's great when studying or reviewing for exams. Right now I am preparing to take a certification test, and I'm also in grad school. ChatGPT can generate a wide variety of practice questions, clear up misunderstandings, provide personalized instruction and tutoring, even generate a study plan or flashcards. * If I'm stuck or need ideas, I simply ask it to generate those for me. Ex, 'generate five random dinner suggestions I can make with these ingredients'. * It is a useful hobby companion. It can provide pretty good tips on questions related to my hobby. Could I find this stuff searching through old reddit threads? Probably! But this is faster and guaranteed to be relevant to my exact query.Lots of other people have other uses. My dad, for example, does some freelance writing now that he's retired. He uses it to workshop outlines, edit his pieces, brainstorm ideas, etc. He himself (a retired man in his 70s!) pays for the GPT subscription as well because he finds it so useful.","title":"Can the US Power Industry Meet AIs Steep Energy Demands? | Thanks to AI, data centers are popping up across the country.

How will the changes you're implying when you use the term renovate bring in enough voters to both compensate the ones turned away by the changes and also win elections? Especially in swing states and Republican leaning states where the Democrats need to win senate seats from.decides to run and everyone says he's \\"too anti-gun\\".The reason people are saying that is because that will be how he is perceived. Right now, the Democrats cannot afford to have someone in a highly ranked position who the Republicans can easily attack. If someone who held the views he had back in 2018 when it came to gun control, they'd stand a much better change.Someone who says an individual has no right to a gun and the second amendment is only about states having what is now their National Guards is red meat for political attacks from the GOP. Is that an accurate reflection of the content of the second amendment? No - while the 2nd amendment does mention militias, and the US 'militias' of today are organised military forces with advanced equipment which act as both a military reserve and state military force (I used air quotes as the current US National Guard has changed massively), it does reference the right for individuals to bear arms. That comma is incredibly significant - if it was a hyphen, that argument would be valid as that'd link well regulated militias and individuals bearing arms, but the comma separates the two concepts. Someone who holds that kind of view will alienate voters the Democrats need in swing states and red state senate races.His argument that the PLCAA (Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act) should be abolished will make him a Republican's dream. The PLCAA doesn't ban liability for something like a defective product or breaking and agreement. And yes, it should be changed - if a company markets a weapon in a reckless or dangerous way, it should face consequences - but the implications of saying a company is legally responsibly if someone abuses their product is massive. That precedent would mean knife making companies are responsible for every accidental or deliberate stabbing. That a car company could be held responsible for the actions of a drunk driver. It sets a precedent for establishing responsibility over a product when a company has no way of controlling how their product is used, other than to not release it. If Hogg wins that position, Republicans will be using arguments like that to launch political attack after political attack.This isn't meant to be a criticism of why he holds his stances - as you pointed out, what he went through explains his stances on gun control. But his stances get brought up because people are pointing out how vulnerable he is to political attacks.","title":"National anti-violence activist David Hogg launches bid for DNC leadership"},{"text":"No, you will train AI model in order to train the next AI model.

While its true that the US population has been increasing and electrifying more things as it does, that growth in power use has been offset by energy savings as buildings, factories and appliances become more efficient. Indeed, electricity consumption in the US has changed little since the start of the 21st century. Until now. Suddenly, America needs more juicefor factories and homes, electric vehicles and heating, and especially data centers and artificial intelligence. The surge in power demand is unlike anything utilities have seen in decades, perhaps not since World War II. Thats going to complicate the countrys already bumpy shift to clean energy, and Donald Trumps imminent return to the White House promises to shake up the transition even more. By all accounts, the industry isnt ready. The impact of AI on the power grid came on fast, says Timothy Fox, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners. Were seeing load-growth projections that are unprecedented. **US power demand is expected to climb almost 16% over the next five years, more than triple the estimate from a year ago**, according to Washington, DC, consulting firm Grid Strategies. Thats an enormous shift, since Americas demand for electricity has risen less than 1% a year for more than two decades. According to Grid Strategies, load growth will hit 3% in 2024. Although other industries can handle fast growth, electricity is different. Big infrastructure projects such as power plants and transmission lines can take a decade to build and can run for a half-century or longer. Consider whats happening in Georgia. The Peach State has a strong manufacturing base and an ever-increasing number of large data centersmore than 50 in total. Over the past year, the states largest power company has more than doubled its forecast for demand from committed and potential customers building large power-hungry projects. In 2023, Georgia Power said those projects would need 17 gigawatts of electricity by the mid-2030s, but in November it updated that figure to more than 36GW. For context, a single gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes. The surge is prompting utilities and their big power-using customers to make some unexpected decisions. After years of watching coal plants retire in droves as power producers sought to curb their planet-warming emissions, some utilities are reversing course on climate goals. Customers are clamoring for so much electricity that operators are keeping their dirtiest fossil fuel plants running longer than expected. FirstEnergy Corp., based in Akron, Ohio, plans to continue operating its Fort Martin and Harrison coal-fired plants in West Virginia, abandoning an earlier pledge to stop using the fuel by 2030. Other coal plants across the US that were scheduled to close in the next several years are getting life extensions as utilities contend with the increased demand.!ping AI&amp;ECO&amp;GET-LIT","title":"Can the US Power Industry Meet AIs Steep Energy Demands? | Thanks to AI, data centers are popping up across the country.

Having begun in earnest two decades ago with the overprescription of pain pills by pharmaceutical companies, it escalated through heroin and now to fentanyl, a synthetic opioid so potent that 0.2% of a gram can kill. Over a million Americans have died from overdoses since the turn of the century; 108,000 of those deaths were in 2022 alone. And yet there is reason to think that the tide may be turning. Data published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, a government agency, suggests that nationally, deaths peaked around August last year. In the 12 months to July this year, there were 90,000 deaths  still an appalling total, but **a reduction of around a sixth** (see chart). Could America be nearing the point where it is, as Mr Weaver might put it, done with opioids? No one is exactly sure why deaths might have started falling. Were all speculating at this point, says Daniel Ciccarone, a professor in addiction medicine at the University of California in San Francisco. Data on the number of people taking opioids is scarce, as is data on prices and purity. Addiction treatment has been expanding for years. But the drop in deaths is too sudden and too widespread (almost all states have experienced it) to be primarily down to this. There has been no dramatic increase in prescriptions of anti-addiction drugs, either. More naloxone kits (an injection which can reverse an overdose, first approved under the brand name Narcan) are being distributed. That must be helping, but also cannot explain the drop. One possibility is a supply shock. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, which polices drug smuggling, the amount of fentanyl in pills they intercept has fallen. Some reports suggest the Sinaloa cartel, a huge Mexican organised-crime group, has stepped back from smuggling fentanyl because of American pressure. In July two high-ranking members, including the son of El Chapo, one of Sinaloas founders, were arrested after being tricked into travelling to America. This cause-and-effect is difficult to prove. Professor Ciccarone says the suddenness of the improvement makes it plausible; others are less convinced. Nobody has any basis for assigning a cause to that drop, said Peter Reuter, a researcher in drug markets, at a conference on December 4th. Another possibility is that the decline represents a return to pre-pandemic norms. When covid-19 hit, opioid overdoses soared. It is hard to say why, but feels intuitive: hospitals were full of covid patients, many treatment centres had shut, and more people were experiencing the sort of traumatic losses that can make them turn to opiates. If this is the primary reason, the current decline will level off, and seems unlikely to keep falling. If this is instead a sustained drop, look to a third explanation. Though deaths have fallen in most of the country, the steepest improvements have been in places that were hit especially early, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. In Ohio, which covers both regions, the number of deaths dropped by a quarter in the year to July, the second biggest improvement of any state (North Carolinas was even steeper). The epidemic may simply be burning out, suggests Professor Ciccarone. The theory is that the most vulnerable have already died, those left behind understand the danger, and so new addicts do not replace them.!ping HEALTH-POLICY","title":"Is Americas opioid epidemic finally burning out? | Overdose deaths are falling steadily"},{"text":"Lol,  I can't wait to hear all the bitching and crying over the next 4 years.","title":"Joe Biden tells Kamala Harris \\"you're not going anywhere\\" after loss"},{"text":"He didnt win by sucking up to the MAGA, but thats who hes targeting with Pardon Trump.

Also, this is a trend based on this year alone, incumbents have been winning a lot the past few years, there aren't enough elections in a year to observe a trend. Let's analyze some of them:UK- This was the easiest election ever for Labour, the tories have been in power since 2010 and have been imploding for years. Even then the tories kinda made a comeback during the campaign and Labour had less votes than last time.France- Macron's coalition lost pretty decisively and they would've been third if not for the second round. But if you look at the results you will see that Macron has never been popular throughout all this, his party only lost 4.5% from last election.Portugal (my country)- PS had been in power since 2015, the longest they ever have. They won in 2019 and then got an absolute majority in 2022. This absolute majority imploded amid corruption cases (nothing came out of it and probably nothing will come of it) and with a new leader it was basically impossible to win this election. Even then they lost by the less than 1% and won the European Elections a few months after.Austria- OVP was widely expected to lose, polls have them behind since the end of 2021. If you look at it they actually made a comeback to numbers they hadn't seen since that same time. They will continue to lead Austria because the rest of the parties will unite with them against the far right.Belgium- The coalition goverment lost seats but held onto its majority. The prime minister's party fell from 6th to 9th but Belgium has a very complex and unique political system. The goverment won't continue.Bulgaria- They had 2 elections this year, their 6th and 7th elections since 2021. Even in this absurd scenario where they can't find a government the same party has won the last 4 (the party that was in power when this all began btw) and the rest is also mostly stable.Croatia- The incumbent party lost seats but won yet again.Iceland- The government lost. I didn't pay attention to this election so I don't have much to say.Lithuania- The goverment party lost pretty big. The election winner had been leading the polls since July 2021 tho.Moldova- The incumbent president won. She lost votes but still won comfortably.Romania- The incumbent party lost a lot of seats, as did their coalition partners. They will stay in government by extending the coalition to other pro European parties, this election was more about Europe and Russia than anything else but I guess inflation could've played a part.Uruguay- The candidate from the incumbent's president party lost. These had been the first 5 years that the coalition that just won (Frente Amplio) hadn't been in power since 2004, and they lost by 1.5% in 2019 after a 15 year incumbency!","title":"Joe Biden tells Kamala Harris \\"you're not going anywhere\\" after loss"},{"text":"I honestly don't think it is a problem.

I think a combination of these and more will help alleviate this - its worth noting that this is a problem weve been dealing with for the last 50 years and arguably are through the worst of it already.Birth rates globally are still well above 2. In developed countries there are plenty of measures that can be taken to boost birth rates. Its primarily an economic issue - many prospective parents dont feel secure enough to have children / more children. Better childcare support, maternity/paternity benefits, more even income/wealth distributions, etc are all left wing policies that have measurable positive impacts on birth rates, with little downsides.Meanwhile restrict abortions, banning contraception, limiting divorces - the classic right wing solutions - have comparatively little effect and do major harm to society as a whole","title":"CMV: The fertility rate crisis is the biggest crisis we'll face for the next 100 years."},{"text":"This is the same clown who thought he was healthy enough for a second term.Fuck Joe Biden forever.

Black Nationalists often refuse to accept that they're philosophically indistinct from Nazis, but are often given a pass by spineless white progressives.  [Relevant historical evidence](https://content.magnumphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cortex/lon4933-1280x864.jpg).(EDIT - Also, as a \\"Pan-African,\\" can you explain which side you take in all of the many intra-African wars and ethnic conflicts between Africans who would find your collectivist views utterly ridiculous?)Why did the civil rights movement fight for integration? Because black schools and black institutions were underfunded by the government. It was an economical struggle not a moral one.That's largely ahistorical.  The basis for desegregation was the acceptance that \\"separate\\" could *never* be \\"equal\\"; that equality could not happen because of separation, not because of differences in funding.  Even had black schools been equally funded or even higher funded than white schools, the inequality would persist because you can't separate two cohabiting groups of people without making one more powerful by default.  And the desegregation of public spaces and facilities had essentially nothing to do with underfunded black institutions.But now instead of being taught by black teachers that share their culture and connect with them, they are taught in majority by white teachers who don't care about them.The assumption that one cannot authentically care about students without a shared race is nonsensical and reeks of projection.  Just because you have deep-seated racial prejudice and in-group bias that's structurally identical to white supremacy (again, the real one) doesn't mean everyone shares that experience.  Many of us look at people of other races and see them as fully human.They're being policed by white and latino policemen, the social workers are white, the doctors are white.None of this is true.  There are a a great many black cops, even more so in majority black neighborhoods and cities.so why are those buffons representing and speaking for Black people as a collective (only happens to Black people I swear)?Because you've decided that race is of singular importance and cannot identify anyone who isn't black who nevertheless speaks on behalf of you and your values because all of your values are contingent on race.Because Black people don't want to lose their culture and racial identity to the melting pot promoted by the international clique of liberals who want to destroy any kind of collective identity.It sounds cooler when you say it in the original German.Yeah, so the deal is that culture constantly evolves and racial identity is unstable - especially in a multiethnic society.  In 50 years, everything will have changed whether you like it or not.  You can accustom yourself to that and make your peace with things changing, or you can piss into the wind and see if it does anything to stop it from blowing.So to solve that black people need to segregate again so that their culture can be preserved instead of being commodified and corrupted by American Consumerism. This will allow Black people to gain sovereignty, organise as a collective and bargain with the majority power. We'll see the emergence of a middle class that instead of fleeing as soon as they get money develop and advocate for their community.Or they'll be permanently ghettoized and cut off from avenues of economic and social advancement.  But at least they'll be racially pure, right!eventual return to African nations.Pretty sure they want you about as much as Ireland wants to receive a mass exodus of \\"Irish\\" Americans.","title":"CMV: America Should Bring Back Segregation."},{"text":"Who is black and who isn't in your eyes?","title":"CMV: America Should Bring Back Segregation."},{"text":"Because black people aren't second class citizens currently?","title":"CMV: America Should Bring Back Segregation."},{"text":"I would expect no less.","title":"Ex-FBI informant pleads guilty to lying about Joe and Hunter Biden | Joe Biden"},{"text":"That's only because the Irish parties are all equally useless and we've learned from Brexit not to go too far.","title":"Joe Biden tells Kamala Harris \\"you're not going anywhere\\" after loss"},{"text":"It's already us vs them.

Trump has always sued everyone, but this is not about defamation or his thin skin, it's about stifling dissent against him and putting the media on notice that there are going to be harsh consequences for writing negative things about him going forward, and that includes releasing negative polls about him. He is going to try to force news outlets to give up anonymous sources, he will put broadcast licenses in jeopardy, and he will have the FBI act as his secret police to harass or imprison people he thinks are out to get him. The way we've seen Kash Patel and Pete Hegseth also threaten these lawsuits against people for speaking out against them, even when what they're saying is plainly sourced, shows this is a coordinated plan of attack by Trump and his team. And the scary thing is that it seems to be working. Just look at the money donated to Trump by Amazon and Meta, by the bizarre way ABC settled Trump's lawsuit against them, or the way that the Washington Post and the LA Times are now forcing their editorial staff to kill negative opinion pieces about Trump. Trump wants everyone in line, and the people who don't fall in line are going to find themselves at war with the US government who is not interested in fighting fair.

To me the proof we need for corruption is Bill Barr in someway nefariously going after Hunter Biden with or without the direction of Trump. Bill Barr never made strong statements about Hunter Biden investigation to my knowledge. The investigation into Hunter Biden started in 2018 which was prior to the 2020 Alex Smirnov FBI informant.I think you could 100% argue that Hunter Biden's prosecution was political because Republicans started shit stirring as they do. And Garland buckled under pressure to not appear partisan and appointed Weiss (To be clear it's standard DOJ policy to appoint a special council in 'high interest cases'). The scope and jurisdiction widened and so the charges became more severe. Hunter was seen as a first time offender so from what I've seen it's odd that it didn't resolve in a plea deal. The court looks favorably on first time offenders that have also made moves to mediate whatever wrongdoing they did.I think Joe did the right thing by his son. The only reason he was in such a predicament in the first place is because he's the president's son. It's a useful way to discredit Joe Biden and attack him. I don't think an even standard was applied to Hunter either which is we want fairness and justice under the law.","title":"Former FBI informant pleads guilty to fabricating Biden claims"},{"text":"They've been Weekend at Berny'ing that bitch for at least a decade now.

You sound like a great candidate for a Montessori school.          \\n           \\nAddressing your points in order:         \\n1. School shootings are very scary. But also all shootings are very scary, and they arent more likely to happen in schools than they are in malls, movie theaters, sports games, or other venues. Your children will suffer if they cannot go any of those places without you. Uncertainty is a part of life, and I think that going out in public is worth a bit of added risk.        \\n        \\n2. You can pick a school that doesnt use tablets. The last school that I worked at gave students laptops at age 12, because learning to type is going to benefit them in later life. But also theres plenty of private schools that barely use screens. I also question how much better youll be able to avoid them than the schools, when so much homeschool curriculum is online in the later years.      \\n             \\n3. I feel like this is gonna vary a lot school to school, but again, private school. You can ask how they teach math and science. You can also supplement what they teach (kumon, khan academy, crash course, whatever) if you dont feel like your kid is benefiting.        \\nI will also say that I like new math, but its not the opposite of repetition. You need to know your times tables like the back of your hand to be able to play around with bigger numbers later, or it gets too complicated.         \\n           \\n4. Private school, again. Not all schools are like this. Montessori is like the opposite of this. Its still a lot of time indoors, but plenty of them have lots of play-based activities every day.       \\n         \\n5. I honestly feel like this is a red state thing, the only books banned at my last school are actual pornography (ie 50 shades of gray). If youre willing to change your whole life to devote it to your childs education anyway, you could also just move somewhere bluer. Bonus that shed have a peer group whose values probably align with yours a lot better.                 \\n               \\n6. Do you want your six-year-old to be taught really gritty parts of history? Ive never taught that Thomas Jefferson raped his slaves because I taught *young* kids, but I dont think it was whitewashed either. One of the writers of the Declaration of Independence, who was also the 3rd president was the gist of it.         \\nAlso, if you havent been to school in 20 years, you probably dont know how whitewashed itll be. Popular sentiment has changed. Its more likely to have a conservative narrative if you live in deep red territory, but again, its gonna be easier to move than to study, craft a curriculum yourself, and teach it well when theyre old enough to learn about rape.        \\n               \\nIt seems like you want to homeschool because you dont trust the schools where you are, and that you find the views of most people around you dangerous/offensive. But Id posit that its easier to  move or find a likeminded school than it is to homeschool. Teaching is a full time job, and it sucks if you dont enjoy it.          \\n          \\nDo you want to study what age-appropriate literacy and numeracy look like? Test their milestones regularly? Will you make sure theyre working on gross and fine motor skills? Will you find them opportunities to try out art, music, and foreign language? Can you engineer situations for them to practice conflict resolution? Are you willing to be the bad cop who makes your kid do stuff they hate for hours every day, if they need it? Its gonna involve spreadsheets. What are you gonna do when theyre already pissing you off and acting up, but you dont get a break from them because youre their mom as well as their teacher?            \\n               \\nNot saying its impossible, but its *much* easier to find a good private school than it is to do all of that. This isnt even getting into the socialization stuff, or my husbands problems with secular homeschooling. I hope that gives you something to think about.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"You have a lot of interesting conclusions.However, many countries have tried to subsidize families with children through financial support.

The global population is still getting larger and its going to hit a massive peak. Far as Im concerned it needs to level out fast for the sake of the earth. Normally historically Mother Nature takes care of that with a widespread disease or large disasters but now we have more technology and scientific works. Sometimes wars in history have had the same effect but now wars look a little different than the old days of true hand to hand combat.As time goes on there will be a lot of people dislocated from coastal areas throughout the world due to projected ocean levels or from desert climates that are already drying out. They will all relocate to already highly populated areas which will give the mixing pots of the world a dash towards more hatred, violence with a clash of cultures, religions and moral codes as it seems to be human nature to never get along. Diseases will spread faster with more people closer together. Poorer countries still breed a ton and wealthier countries are the ones that are being more cautious with the amount of children for their own economic understandings and environmental concerns. So regardless there will still be large migration from poorer countries that cant improve on themselves while constantly breeding more impoverished children that dont stand any chance of a good life. These parents are too busy making new babies and all the acts that make babies happen to make their countries something better.I want a very small future family and am uncomfortable with the idea of the population of the world going past what is currently is today. So much land in the world is being lost to human development and all the true beauty of the world is slowly disappearing into concrete. Where I live looks nothing like what it is was 20 years ago. Traffic is awful, nothing but buildings, roads, massive highways and boring water saving rock decor. One cant see the stars at night properly. Coyotes and bobcats dont have a home and creep in peoples backyards with no where to go but a storm drain. Houses and rent is expensive because of demand.

All that trash goes somewhere and it only increases with the amount of people on the planet.Economically here in America I dont see the benefits in large families that live on welfare making little real contribution to the world and frankly have little means to do so outside of being a consumer. That cycle repeats with each kid that doesnt decide to find a path outside of what they were raised in.

Not everyone is capable of being a robot/machine tech or a scientist. I know Im not.

In advanced economies, it costs money to have kids and maintain a similar standard of living.

I think one could make a pretty good argument that humans have gone past that level, albeit unwittingly.   We have grown our population through extracting fossil fuels, which gives us a supply of concentrated energy, but the waste product of using that energy is carbon dioxide, and it is starting to build up to levels that are going to be more than a little disruptive. In addition, humans really like to eat meat and dairy, and its production produces methane, which adds to the problem.  Setting aside the political issues, it is possible that we will come up with some technology that allows us to stop using fossil fuels while maintaining current quality of life.  Perhaps a new kind of battery technology.  But right now we don't have the technology to allow our species to live on this planet in the numbers we have now, at the quality of life we have now, indefinitely.  It has unfortunately always been true that people want to consume more labor than they themselves can produce, and this has led to people having more kids than are necessary to replace themselves.

And there are a great many (rich) people on the planet who would prefer it not be solved.\\n* You're actually wrong and right about economic impacts. We're already feeling the economic impacts of the boomers aging out. The biggest issue will be, as you say, having a population of people who are retired supported by a smaller population of people who are working.\\n* But then we're also working at putting people out of work anyway. The main driver behind robotics and AI research is to replace costly humans in the production line. So we're going to have to figure out what to do to support idle humans anyway.\\n* You're also making the assumption that this trend of population decline will continue forever. Perhaps, if we lived in a society where you weren't scrabbling for a living then there might be a greater inclination to have children. I don't know.\\n* What's REALLY interesting is that most people don't present this problem as an existential crisis but instead as an economic one. So, it's not that we may be dying out, it's that there's not enough people to drive the economic engine. Which, to me, kind of captures the entire problem of our current situation: We've made humans fuel for an engine that grinds them up and spits out quarterly earnings reports.\\n* Capitalism has been very good to me. But it's also clearly broken. I don't want to abandon it, but surely there's a way we can solve these problems. Perhaps shareholder value isn't the ONLY thing a CEO must focus on?\\n* Anyway, the population crisis is, in the short term, going to help us greatly. It will reduce consumption and help address the climate crisis (probably not, it will be too late). It will also force us to confront the fundamental issues with our economic system and drive us to come up with something better.\\n* This is not a fast moving crisis, btw. The worlds population won't peak for another 50-70 years, by most projections. We've got time to address it, so long as we don't allow people to spread doubt and FUD, like we have the climate crisis.Edit: This might make you feel a little better: [https://www.ted.com/talks/hans\\\\_rosling\\\\_religions\\\\_and\\\\_babies?subtitle=en](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies?subtitle=en)","title":"CMV: The fertility rate crisis is the biggest crisis we'll face for the next 100 years."},{"text":"remember losing is fun","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Nothing, he just triggers the shills","title":"YouTube Deleted OKeefe Media Group Video- Joe Biden is basically dead."},{"text":"he decides fuck it i'm staying home one vote doesn't matter anyway","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I'm skeptical the government can afford to pay them enough to compensate.","title":"CMV: The fertility rate crisis is the biggest crisis we'll face for the next 100 years."},{"text":"No one here is really refuting the crux of your argument - most of these comments are just vague climate change! references or people saying humanity survived the black plague (a very different issue).

Too many 85 year olds unable to walk or care for themselves, or for that matter too many infants unable to walk or care for themselves, is a problem. You need enough people able to farm, cook, care, whatever society needs to keep the lights on and help those who arent able.

I think the low birth rates pose a major threat to how societies function, especially your generation will be hit.

But some ideas, to consider:- There are large advances in AI and robotics. Fully automated robots that can do actual work or anutomated devices are a real possibility. This could alleviate the pressure on economy\\n- Countries have never really implemented drastic measures. In the sense, any policy aimed at encouraging births but not coercing people into doing so. So, there are a whole bucket of more coercive things that countries could do, including much higher taxes for not having children, etc.?\\n- At some point, states could intervene in the circle and produce baby by themselves. For example by cloning humans. Today this sounds far fetched, but if you look what was around 100 years ago part of the scope of responsibility of a modern state and what is today part of the scope of states, more and more competencies moved to the state away from families and individuals.

As a result, youll control a particularly scarce resource - labour.  When this has happened at other times in history, it has remade society.  * In World War 1, when all the men were in the trenches, they had no choice but to allow women to have jobs. They wouldnt have done so had labour not been so scarce.

After all, the lands they held were worthless unless the few remaining farm labourers would do their jobs, and why would they do that unless they got more rights and more money?

I could data mine and extrapolate data based upon the time, shift, weather, tenure of the associate, age, type of injury, mechanism, type of facility, etc. When deep-diving this we found that our 8 pack lines were one of our (if not the) worst areas for employee injuries, namely sprains and strains of the back and shoulders. This was due to associates having to bend down and reach for a solid 10ish hours a day, with an average work comp claim costing us $23,000. We averaged 1-2 a week.We had an Amazon ergonomist come in and survey the place, and they recommended that we spend the money (roughly $50k/pack line) to install lift tables to ensure that they cages and items can always be lifted and carried in the associates power zone. So, for a grand total of $400,000 we could have effectively eliminated our sprains and strains of the lower back and shoulders at our number one problem area, protecting people, saving from down time, and ultimately reducing work comp costs.Our GM decided that it was too costly, spent $2,000ish on a stretching room + equipment, and called it good. There was a negligible effect on our issues.

I dont think we need to quote Karl Marx to do it (that opens wounds with respect to liberals being associated with communism), but the point is we need to knock off trying to ban any new gun things, full stop, no exceptions.??Stop trying to ban assault weapons, stop trying to ban pistol braces, etc.If you really want to undo some of the reputation damage maybe even consider removing suppressors from the NFA.??But I have a feeling Republicans may try to do that without Democrats help under Trump anyway.","title":"David Hogg is running for DNC vice chair"},{"text":"Incredible.

Look at the 2026 Senate map. The only two even remotely winnable states are North Carolina and Maine. Maine has very strong moderate incumbent Collins who has more than separated herself from Trump to the normies, so she probably survives and makes that race not competitive. That leaves just North Carolina, which could be won by the Dems but their likely candidate has some potential weaknesses that may be overlooked for now but exploited significantly by the GOP in the general election. But even if we say the Dems win both races, that still only gets them to 49 seats. 49 is basically their hard cap for 2026. For 2028 it's basically just WI and NC that the Dems could maybe win but again, not a lock on either even if Trump fucks up a lot.

Since inflation was much lower in early 2021 at the start of the administration vs in the middle of 2021 when BBB negotiations started IRL, and since Manchin's biggest concern was inflation, this means the dems could probably get a bigger topline number from Manchin - perhaps $2 to $2.5t rather than $1.5t of IRL. This would allow them to do more things and be able to include at least a partial CTC expansion, full 10 years of healthcare spending, and climate spending, which would make it easier for liberals and progressives to stomach the bill. At the same time, democratic leadership would need to whip the party rank and file hard to get them to take Manchin's red lines seriously rather than acting like he'd be willig to budge and compromise (IRL this just pisses him off and made him do even less)-also immediately use executive orders to remove the Trump tariffs and potentially cut tariffs even more. The left would scream with rage and call it a betrayal of the working class, but clearly 2024 was primarily an inflation election specifically, and there'd be more people who would be pleased by lower inflation from tariff reductions (which is easier to message to the general public) than the small amount of union workers who would potentially defect to Trump because the democratic president lowered their cost of living in a way that is deemed \\"anti labor\\"-also slow the roll on Afghanistan withdrawal. Ideally the war wouldn't have ended at all but at the very least the president could have really sounded the alarm on the need to get everyone out asap, while running a mini surge to ensure that we got out in a neat and orderly fashion as opposed to a total disorganized routSince the Dems IRL came within 1 point of taking 52 Senate seats and holding the house in the 2022 midterms, these changes would probably be enough to reduce dissent over inflation and the Afghan withdrawal, and potentially make democratic messaging more effective, enough to overcome that 1% difference needed to attain those bigger wins in 2022From there, dems could do narrow bypasses of the filibuster for voting rights and abortion, and do another reconciliation bill, probably this time for paid family and medical leave in order to respond to labor issues with rail strikes. Blue collar labor still wouldn't appreciate it but this would help all workers, not just the \\"working class\\" From there, heading into the 2024 elections, the above mentioned single candidate from the 2020 primaries who polled similarly as strongly as Biden vs Trump and was pro free trade would potentially be facing a similar age issue as Biden was, but he was always more of a team player and willing to work for others rather than just himself, so he could bow out of the 2024 reelection efforts in 2023 before the primaries started, allowing Dems to run a competitive primary and pick another younger strong candidatePlus Dems could not undo all the Trump border restrictions at the start of 2021 and could instead push earlier for a border compromise that would grant citizenship for DACA folks and do a pathway to citizenship and increasing legal immigration while also increasing border security, ending asylum spamming, and potentially building the wall to sweeten the pot to the GOP (the liberal parts of the reform would more than make the bill an overall liberal leaning bill even with that reform added there)But even though that hypothetical democratic administration would have accomplished a lot more liberal stuff than Biden, and been actually electable going forward, it would have also had to say \\"no\\" to the Groups and Activists more, which the leadership is extremely afraid of doing","title":"Maybe Democrats Didnt Do So Badly After All"},{"text":"Thats mind boggling to picture, there of all places.","title":"Democrats: We hate life and ourselves"},{"text":"Late Boomer here: this is starting to really feel like the late 60s-early 70s generation gap and I still feel like the kids are on the right side of history.

I think there's a distinction between \\"morally bad person\\" and \\"bad candidate at getting people to vote for them\\". Berlusconi faced numerous charges of bribery, corruption, and perjury which were known by the time of his return to office in 2001 - but the Italian people gave him one of the longest tenures of any Prime Minister. Indira Gandhi suspended democracy and ruled as a dictator for a few years, got voted out as soon as she allowed an election to be held - and the Indian people voted her back in at the next election after she lost office. My personal theory (based mostly on Trump's approval ratings, which were very negative in fall 2016 and were only slightly negative by fall 2024) is that voters initially penalized Trump a lot for being a terrible person, making him a bad candidate; but after Trump presided over a period of strong economic growth and performance from 2017-2019 followed by Biden presiding over a period of high inflation, voters spuriously draw a causal link between Trump's policies and the good economy, enough to cancel out Trump's crimes and assholish behaviour, and now he's more or less an average candidate that performs about as well as a generic Republican would.","title":"Maybe Democrats Didnt Do So Badly After All"},{"text":"Hes not looking to become **the** leader, hes looking to become a vice-chair.

Using your math and physics, and the ISS continues at a rate of 5km/month without changing, the ISS will land very softly on the ground at a rate of about 0.1km/hr.The earth's atmospheric density is a gradient. The closer to earth, the denser the atmosphere (obviously). At some altitude, the deorbiting rate will increase exponentially as it encounters an increasingly dense atmosphere. So it's not as simple as dividing the ISS altitude by the current deorbiting rate and spitting out that number.It will be far less than 7 years if this proves to be true. I don't know exactly how long but I would say it's fair to say half of that number at maxEdit: ChatGPT says 2-3 years. Take that as you will. Here's the calculations:\\"\\"\\"Yes, accounting for the increase in orbital decay due to atmospheric drag requires incorporating the relationship between altitude, atmospheric density, and orbital velocity. As the ISS descends, the atmosphere becomes denser, causing drag to increase exponentially, which accelerates the rate of orbital decay.This phenomenon can be modeled using orbital mechanics equations and atmospheric models like the US Standard Atmosphere. Here's an overview of the key factors involved:\\n---Key Concepts:1. Atmospheric Drag Force (F):F = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho v^2 C_D A: Atmospheric density (increases exponentially as altitude decreases): Orbital velocity (~7.66 km/s at ~400 km altitude): Drag coefficient (depends on the object's shape, typically ~2.2 for the ISS): Cross-sectional area of the ISS (~400 m2)\\n2. Rate of Orbital Decay:\\nThe drag force reduces the orbital energy, leading to a loss of altitude. The rate of decay depends on the altitude-dependent density profile and orbital velocity.\\n3. Exponential Increase in Atmospheric Density ():\\\\rho(h) \\\\propto e^{-h/H}: Altitude: Scale height (~8.5 km in the lower thermosphere)---Numerical Simulation:To get an accurate time-to-crash value, you'd simulate the decay step-by-step:1. Start at 400 km altitude.\\n2. Calculate the drag force and resulting decay rate for each step based on the changing altitude and atmospheric density.\\n3. Update the altitude and repeat until reaching a critical burn-up threshold (~80 km).\\n---Simplified Approximation:Due to the exponential increase in drag:The decay rate would accelerate sharply below 300 km.A constant decay rate of 5 km/month is valid only for high altitudes.When drag becomes significant, the time-to-crash is much shorter.\\nEstimate:From simulations in similar scenarios:If the ISS begins with 5 km/month decay at 400 km, it could crash within ~2 to 3 years, considering the exponential increase in drag as it approaches denser atmospheric layers.\\nFor exact timing, a detailed computational model is required.\\"- ChatGPT\\"    - Wayne Gretzky\\"        - Michael Scott","title":"So it begins.
