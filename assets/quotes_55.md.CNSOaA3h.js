Public cemeteries are open to everybody in much the same way as a park is. People have family gatherings there, people use the land to jog, and some people aimlessly wander to kill (no pun intended) some time during their lunch break. Pretty classic park stuff, but with the obvious plots of dead bodies and headstones everywhere. Its different than golf courses in that way, because the land is more multi-use and available to all by its nature.So public cemeteries are open to anybody like parks, offer green space in urban environments which has been shown to positively impact people, and also fill a societal / emotional role that many consider innately human (even though many societies have not practiced burials, it is and has been inarguably incredibly widespread in human history).Do you also think parks and other urban green spaces should be gotten rid of?

The only reason anyone would dislike DEI is because they heard on Fox News or some right-wing podcast that it was a bad thing. You don't see any of this as a problem, because you're a left-leaning person.So maybe you need to get out of your right-wing bubble, and see what the Democratic party is actually about? They didn't lose because of  social issues -- the culture war is fodder to excite the base of voters that Trump already has, and Democrats never will. Rather, Democrats lost because of inflation, and because they still resemble the establishment of the last 40 years, whereas Trump has remade the GOP, not to necessarily something better, but at least something *different.* A slightly larger share of voters favored the chaos agent, because the government as they see it has not done anything good for them anyway, so they may as well shake things up. This also means millions of voters stayed home, because they didn't think their vote would change anything anyway. Both factors are far more crucial for the Democrats' loss than any social issue. In exit polling, the only social issue that actually mobilized any voters was abortion/women's right to bodily autonomy, and even then, it fell in rank behind the economy.","title":"I'm Anthony Fisher, senior editor at MSNBC Digital.

Call it religion if you like, but its a cathartic impulse so powerful its seen in almost every culture across hundreds of generations. Golf courses obviously dont have the same emotional connection, and as someone who doesnt play golf I wouldnt mind their removal, but broadly speaking play is also an important part of the human experience (and keep in mind there are public golf courses). Its also why we have baseball fields, ice rinks, and parks.

Maybe in the past towns and cities could have been designed better, thats a true and reasonable thing to say that I think most people agree with.

Where as the other is just a continuation of humans being dumb territorial animals willing to annihilate themselves to achieve a goal... We do not have to accept one to accept the other.

To think that we don't have some of those in orbit...I mean you don't even need that many in space to create a nuclear net around the world. Besides that icbms are positioned so that we can hit anywhere in the world within 30 minutes, and besides that we have  14 Ohio class submarines which carry up to 20 trident missiles, each of those missiles is capable of carrying EIGHT warheads which includes at least one 90 kiloton warhead.That single 90 kiloton.

Judge botched it."},{"text":"For thousands of years, the global order was essentially \\"Might makes right.\\"  The Mesopotamians, the Egyptians, Persians, the Huns, China, Japan, Great Zimbabwe -- every strong civilization tried to expand and exert their might on their neighbors in order to create larger, stronger, civilizations. That was the way of the world for thousands of years.Western European civilizations were no different -- The Greeks, the Romans, the Spanish, the English, the Americans, etc.  Colonialism is a byproduct of that.  It was a product of a \\"Might makes right\\" global order.  Western European civilizations were also the ones who tried to change it.  They founded the rules-based global order, and to their credit, they tried to change it at a time when they were at the top, which no other civilization who was ever on top really tried to do.  It's a process that is still ongoing, and there are setbacks.  They often don't live up to the ideals they espouse.  There have been, and currently are, western governments and leaders trying to turn the world back into a \\"Might makes right\\" global order (And they're winning right now).  There are some leaders and nations who are still looking out only for themselves and their interests.  There are western leaders and governments doing gross shit in the attempt to jockey for position among the other western leaders and governments.  There are problems of prejudice, lack of cultural understanding which leads to other problems, people who try to undermine the institutions set up to install and execute a rules-based global order, like the UN you think only works to cover up the crimes of western nations.All of that is true.  Yet, no other civilization in human history has come as far as western civilizations have in all of the ways you wish they would, and no other has progressed in that direction as quickly as they have given that western countries and leaders have only been at this for fewer than a hundred years.Continue to hold western powers accountable when they fail to live up to their ideals.  You should.  It's good to.  I do it myself frequently.  That's the only way for white men and western civilizations to continue to progress, and they still have a long way to go, but all I'm saying that if China were the dominant super power in the world, if the middle east were the dominant region in the world, if they had all the money and global power that the U.S. and Europe currently hold, would the world be a better place for most people?Here's an example of what I'm talking about:  The U.S. Navy, for well over a half-century now, has provided security for international shipping lanes.  No matter how rich or poor a country is, whether they are friend or enemy to the U.S., any country can conduct international trade via sea without having to supply their own navies to protect their trade ships.  The U.S. Navy and the American taxpayer, does it for them, free of charge.  It has allowed every nation in the world to access at least some of the benefits of the global economy without having to be responsible for it.  It's a benefit so great to the world that it's taken for granted.  We don't even think about it.  Well, that benefit to the world is going away.  America is slowly retreating from that burden.  It's not even building the naval ships that would be required to maintain that system anymore if it even wanted to, and given Trump, the U.S. doesn't have leadership that wants to.  We should expect that retreat to accelerate over the next several years.  Do you think China is going to step up and assume that burden for the world?  Japan?  Africa?  The middle east?  In the next 20 years, countries will either have to supply their own navies to protect their trade, a huge cost for poorer countries, or have their access to international markets reduced, which will again, hurt poorer countries most.  Emerging economies will stall.  Countries in the process of industrializing will deindustrialize.  The world is returning to a \\"Might makes right\\" global order, which is really the natural order, but at least western civilizations won't be in so much control over it as they were when they were far from perfectly trying to make something better.","title":"Aggrieved white men are a threat to democracy  history tells us we can't ignore them"},{"text":"No, you cant have good health care.

Trump negotiated the deal and did nothing to evacuate Americans despite having 11 out of 14 months the deal provided to do so. Worse, [Trump made it impossible to evacuate Afghan allies](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/570076-how-trump-broke-the-system-that-offers-protection-to-afghan-allies/), thereby abandoning them, by implementing policy which hindered the process.

And all while somehow agreeing to release over 5000 Taliban prisoners.If one looks at the time both Trump and Biden had to meet the deal and then compares the effort both took to ensure the deal could be met, it's *impossible* to not objectively lay the vast majority of the blame on Trump.

Twelve of the guns were purchased personally by Union commanders and used in the trenches during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia (June 1864April 1865).

Heres a detailed analysis based on the known facts:\\n \\n 1. Foreknowledge by Authorities and Media\\n Police and Emergency Services Warnings: Eyewitness accounts indicate that police and emergency personnel were warning people to move away from the area hours before WTC 7 collapsed, implying some had prior knowledge of its impending fall.\\n Media Reporting Before the Collapse: Both the BBC and CNN reported the collapse of WTC 7 before it occurred, with footage showing the building still standing. This anomaly raises questions about how the media could have been informed of the event in advance.\\n 2. Freefall Acceleration\\n Observation: WTC 7 experienced a period of freefall acceleration for approximately 2.25 seconds during its collapse, as acknowledged by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\\n Implications: Freefall indicates no structural resistance, which would require all supporting columns to fail simultaneouslysomething that is extremely unlikely due to localized fire and asymmetrical damage.\\n 3. Symmetry of Collapse\\n Perfectly Vertical Descent: WTC 7s collapse was almost perfectly symmetrical, with the building falling straight down into its own footprint. This contradicts the behavior expected from an asymmetrically damaged structure.\\n Inconsistency with Fire-Induced Collapse: Fire and localized damage typically cause asymmetrical and progressive collapses, not the kind of sudden and uniform failure seen with WTC 7.\\n 4. Unprecedented Nature of the Collapse\\n First Skyscraper to Collapse Due to Fire: WTC 7 was the first steel-framed skyscraper to allegedly collapse due to fire alone. No comparable collapse has occurred before or since, despite many steel-framed buildings enduring intense fires for longer durations.\\n Lack of Changes to Construction Standards: If fire-induced collapse were a genuine risk, it would have led to a global overhaul of building codes and construction practices. The absence of such changes suggests skepticism within the engineering community about the official explanation.\\n 5. NIST's Explanation and Criticism\\n Official Theory: NIST attributed the collapse to thermal expansion causing the failure of a critical support column (Column 79), leading to progressive collapse.\\n Criticism of NIST's Model: Independent researchers and engineers have pointed out flaws in NISTs simulations, which omit key structural components and fail to replicate the observed freefall or symmetry.\\n 6. Controlled Demolition Hypothesis\\n Characteristics of Controlled Demolition:\\n Sudden onset of collapse.\\n Freefall acceleration indicating simultaneous failure.\\n Symmetrical and clean fall into its footprint.\\n Explosive Residue Evidence: Some studies have claimed to find evidence of thermite, a high-temperature incendiary material, in the dust from Ground Zero. This material is capable of cutting through steel.\\n 7. Behavior of Similar Buildings\\n Historical Fires: Many steel-framed buildings have experienced severe fires without collapsing, including buildings subjected to structural damage and prolonged exposure to flames.\\n WTC 7 as an Anomaly: The collapse remains an isolated event, further casting doubt on the official narrative.\\n 8. Lack of Transparency\\n Destruction of Evidence: Steel from WTC 7 was quickly removed and recycled before independent investigations could be conducted, raising concerns about the integrity of the investigation.\\n Control of the Investigation: NISTs investigation has been criticized for lack of transparency, with models and data not fully released for peer review. **Summary and Conclusion** The collapse of WTC 7 defies conventional understanding of structural engineering and fire behavior. The combination of foreknowledge, freefall acceleration, symmetrical collapse, lack of precedents, and flaws in the official explanation point to the need for a more comprehensive investigation. While definitive proof of controlled demolition remains elusive, the official narrative appears to be incomplete or flawed, failing to account for all observed phenomena.\\n \\n If the collapse was genuinely caused by fire and structural damage, it would have prompted widespread changes in construction and safety standardsyet no such changes have occurred, further undermining the official account.","title":"If you never read the official Architects and Engineers 9/11 statement- prepare to be shocked!"},{"text":"It's actually an important safety valve for miscarriages of justice even if it sometimes is misused or used corruptly.","title":"Victims shocked after Biden grants clemency to kids-for-cash judge and $54 million embezzler"},{"text":"lame","title":"Democrats have picked a side and it's not us...

In fact, considering the vast scale of colonization and resultant unbalanced world order led by the victors--for centuries and to this day--it is the crimes of Asian  and Black men that have been highlighted in the countries involved and as Americans as well. Chinese, Japanese and Black Americans have been vilified for perceived savagery and un-patriotic beliefs (their political allegiances and their supposed threat to the nation scrutinized minutely and obsessively) whilst living in America as American citizens for decades-- it's actually only been a short period of time that their lives haven't come under AS intense scrutiny-- although that's changing again.You must be living under a rock if you don't regularly read articles upon articles about crimes led by African dictators of various countries, the international action taken by UN against such crimes, same for Middle Eastern countries and even Asian men- umm Kim Jong Un anyone. It's actually the crimes committed by men in western nations that go undetected or un discussed because of the veneer of civility and \\"democracy\\" they are hidden under..and also because of the hegemony of global world order where a handful of countries control international geopolitics and intelligence sharing. So umm for example, USA's unbridled support of Israel-- will never ever get prosecuted or truly criticized in any meaningful way. EVER. But America will be able to interfere directly or indirectly via spying or punitive actions in the affairs of foreign countries at the drop of a hat. Meanwhile, there are American states led by white American men that are behaving like we live in the middle ages but that is not something that will ever be covered to the scale of crimes of say radical Islam.Some of the crap peddled by these crazies is really no different from what's happening in poorer \\"democracies\\" globally. Not talking about Saudi Arabia etc but democracies with lax freedoms and protections that still operate as democracies in name. Some of the declarations in recent months by Trump and acolytes make America seem like a very, very different country-- the free press getting threatened, the crackdown on non-profits for perceived terroristic allegiances etc. are templates from laws created by countries where human rights is a mere concept. If anything, all this should be discussed more seriously and frequently. It would be un-American to not do so while we still can.P.s. And while we are at it, let's also recognize the contributions of Black Men and Asian men to creating a progressive world too. Yknow- cuz democratic ideals, contrary to your beliefs weren't the invention of white men ONLY. Maybe a more robust education about world history (global freedom movements, fights for equality etc) would help reduce this divisiveness but hey that's too much to expect anymore in America.

It doesnt just happen, it takes you understanding and wanting your habits, and choosing each day to commit to them. It gets to be a really easy choice ime after not much time.And thats where the cognitive reframing comes in.

Lack of routine has its own MANY restrictions in the form of limited options or limited capacity or limited opportunity, which you are probably feeling if you are even asking this questionThere are impossibilities you may want, but there are possibilities you can achieveIdk your situation, but this is my advice from my situation, and its widely applicable.

Its also generally acknowledged (or at least speculated) that Freemasons are Luciferian. Conventional legends about Lucifer always state that the fallen angel was cast out of Heaven. The Statue of Liberty holds a torch that represents light to lead, so she bears the light. Since the definition of Lucifer means light bearer she probably represents Lucifer. This story of Lucifer is similar to the fallen goddess scenario of Sophia or the idea how Lilith was cast out from Eden, which is an idea that originates primarily from Jewish mystical and folkloric traditions, such as the Alphabet of Ben Sira (8th-10th centuries CE). In her book Isis Unveiled, the 19th-century occultist Helena Blavatsky corresponds the fallen Satan to the serpent in Eden which is a widely held opinion among Christians. She states: The personification denominated Satan is supposed to have been represented by the serpent in the Garden of Eden. In the Disney movie Maleficent (played by Angelina Jolie) the titular charcater symbolically gets cast down or in her own words, cast out, and she loses her wings, possibly an ode to Lilith. Some have equated Lilith with the Satan or the Devil, forming half of Azazel or Leviathan. The idea that a goddess is a Devil is not such a stretch. The word Devil comes from a Indo-European word Devi which mean goddess and this word is still used in India. Even the word Hell comes from the Nordic goddess Hel.","title":"The Statue of Liberty is a representation of the demon gods Lilith-Samael (being Leviathan or Azazel as the two combined), the ones who some believe helped build the Tower of Babeland waged war against God"},{"text":"Fuck all that damagog bullshit, fuck the democrats and republicasn take fucking control yourselves Y'all are tough son of a bitches, you can tear the government in half and you should","title":"What can Democrats do to regain control by 2028?"},{"text":"Impersonating a President too","title":"Joe Biden Pardons Wife Jill For Impersonating A Doctor ??"},{"text":"This idiot is actually correct!

This is the estimation of capacity installed on Australias main grid over the next 25 years. It is based on Coalition leader Peter Duttons preferred scenario C the one he used to emblazon the claims of $260 billion in savings across the front pages of the mainstream media on Friday. Since this is the comparison that Dutton is seeking to sell to the Australian public, lets look at in detail. In contrast to the Australian Energy Market Operators Step Change scenario, the one that the federal Labor government has used for its policy and planning blueprint, the Coalitions Progressive Scenario imagines a world still revolving around the concept of baseload power, of petrol and diesel powered cars, of gas-powered homes and a lot less renewables. The scenario also assumes a lot less rooftop solar, which means that the Coalition is banking on consumers buying more from the grid, and paying money to big utilities such as the Hong Kong owned ElectricityAustralia. But the Frontier model focuses only on large scale capacity and generation. For large scale solar it is a bad look: Just a doubling of capacity from 2025 to 2050. Given that 5 GW of capacity is likely already locked in, that reduces the rollout of large scale solar to a trickle over the next two decades. For wind, the story is actually worse. The modelling assume no offshore wind at all, given the Coalitions promise to scrap the newly declared offshore wind zones, and despite the legislated target in Victoria of 9 GW by 2040. For onshore wind, Frontier puts the installed capacity in 2025 at 12.8 GW (according to OpenNEM it would be closer to 14 GW by the end of that year, and predicts the total rising to 28 GW by 2050. Given that more than 5 GW of wind power is already locked in and under construction or contract, then that is a painfully slow build rate over the coming two decades. Its the Coalition telling local and international investors: F off we dont want you here: And forcing consumers to buy more power from the big utilities at the same time. Apart from scrapping the offshore wind zones, the federal Coalition has also promised to rip up contracts for large scale underwriting agreements written with the federal government. According to the Frontier report , Large scale renewables total 49 per cent (wind 32 per cent and solar 17 per cent) by 2050, with nuclear likely to be 38 per cent, assuming that everything gets built in time. The graph above shows limited growth in each of wind, solar and utility storage after 2030. This  would represent a dramatic slowdown in the installation and investment of renewable energy across Australia and will be a massive shock and concern to investors who have invested $40 billion into large-sale renewable energy in Australia since 2020, Clean Energy Council CEO Kane Thornton said. Australia has been a world leader in rooftop solar with over four million systems installed on homes and small businesses and an additional 300,000 plus systems being installed every year. The Coalitions plan means millions of Australians would miss out on the chance to install solar. And Thornton also pointed out that it would not be good for the owners of rooftop solar. Currently, households are up in arms at the prospect of having their panels switched off C in an emergency C once or twice a summer. In the Coalitions nuclear plan, it would likely be a daily occurrence to ensure that the nuclear generators are always on.  A nuclear-powered energy grid would also be a disaster for the four million Australian homes that have already installed a rooftop solar system as a way to lower their power bills, Thornton said. These systems would have to be switched off regularly if Australia was to move to inflexible nuclear power.Because it's relevant to the article, I just want to mention that any (typically conservative) force advocating for nuclear is actually just doing so to stop the deployment and development of renewable energy, and they don't actually want to develop nuclear energy in any capacity either. It's just a cover for their anti-climate and anti-environment policies Wish this subreddit could start recognizing and stop falling for when some midwit political party loudly boasts about developing nuclear energy when they actually mean to cripple renewable energy, but I doubt it ??!ping ECO&amp;AUS","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Nothing of the sort actually.

It will have a storage capacity nearly five times larger than Frances current largest operational battery. The project will be connected to the RTE grid | Image: Gros chat violet, Wikimedia Commons Lisbon-headquartered renewable energy company TagEnergy has launched construction of Frances biggest battery energy storage system (BESS). Tesla will contribute to the project also, offering market access services and its expertise in advanced storage solutions. The 240MW/480MWh BESS will be in the commune of Cernay-ls-Reims, in the Marne department in the northeast of France. On-site activities commenced in April 2024 with archaeological investigations led by the Communaut Urbaine du Grand Reims, two years after initial discussions with landowners, including the Municipality of Cernay-ls-Reims. Construction will begin in January 2025, with grid connection scheduled for late 2025. The BESS will boast a storage capacity nearly five times that of Frances current largest operational battery. It will have the capacity to store around 20% of the residential electricity needs of the Marne department, which is home to more than half a million residents. The Cernay-ls-Reims project will also help to stabilize the grid and provide critical capacity during peak electricity demand periods. The BESS includes a 225kV connection to the national grid managed by French transmission system operator RTE. Financing for the project comes from a banking consortium that includes Netherlands ABN AMRO, Germanys NORD/LB, and French cooperative bank Caisse dEpargne CEPAC. TagEnergy is proud to announce this flagship project in France, just weeks after connecting the first phase of the Southern Hemispheres largest wind farm in Australia and the UKs largest transmission-connected battery, said Franck Woitiez, CEO of TagEnergy. The Yorkshire, UK project was energized in October and has a capacity of 100MW/200MWh. Christophe Lonard, Managing Partner for France at TagEnergy, described the Cernay-ls-Reims project as being pivotal for the French energy transition. The trajectory outlined in Frances Multi-Annual Energy Plan, currently under public consultation, calls for a two-and-a-half-fold increase in wind capacity and a four-fold increase in solar capacity by 2035. This transformation requires significant development of flexibility solutions. Alongside demand-side flexibility, battery storage is set to become a cornerstone of this transition, and TagEnergy is committed to deploying this technology while accelerating its solar development activities in France in 2025. TagEnergy has been in operation since 2019 and has a presence in Portugal, France, Australia, Spain, and the UK. The company is controlled by TagHolding, a joint venture controlled by the Impala SAS Group, Exor N.V, and TagTeam Holding, the holding company for TagEnergys manager-shareholders. Other shareholders include Mirova and Omnes. According to its website, TagEnergy has more than 6 GW of assets in operation across all its locations.!ping ECO&amp;FRANCE","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Actually Trump is known to be the worst president of all time.","title":"Victims shocked after Biden grants clemency to kids-for-cash judge and $54 million embezzler"},{"text":"Project Blue Beam's most horrible aspect is that they're telling you that they are not on your side.

I agree with what you're saying, but we definitely shouldn't neglect the discrimination aspect of things. The US seems really focused on race as skin color, but around the world, there are many more ways we discriminate: religion, ethnicity, nationality (see the 'polish plumber'), etc.The problem with these discriminations is that they highly contribute to people being poor.If landlords in 'nice' areas won't rent to X category people (polish, black, muslim, have a weird accent, look foreign, etc), they'll live in a worse area with more crime and worse schools.If a teacher has a bias, then X kids will get a wirse education (worse relations with the teacher(s)).If employers won't hire X people because they're perceived as less competent, they'll make less money.\\n(Edit: And yes, those things are usually illegal. It doesn't mean that people don't do them, they just do them under another excuse).So yes, the problem of poverty and discrimination are linked.  But presenting discrimination as the one and only issue and disregarding poverty is a huge problem with the discourse today. And it's becoming true in more and more countries  because the US is exporting it's views on racism as the only thing that matters and politician gleefully exploit it because it's much easier to get their electors to hate someone than try to solve poverty and real economic issues.

The tl;dr is that it is a trippy book with good ideas that can absolutely be understood as a standalone, but does reward people who understand the context. Possibly the best book Ive read this year: inventive, sharp, and surprising.To fully explain the context of the book will take a little while, but I personally find it interesting.In 1989, despite just having done two of the best seasons in its history, *Doctor Who* was cancelled. This made a lot of people very angry.Sensing an opportunity, Richard Brandons fittingly named Virgin Publishing licensed the rights to original *Doctor Who* printed fiction off the BBC. They released three ranges: collections of short stories, novels with Doctors 1-6, and an ongoing range continuing the TV series with the Seventh Doctor and his companion Ace. Later, Ace would be replaced by 26th Century archaeologist Bernice Summerfield, and then by Chris Cwej and Roz Forrester, cops from the same sort of time period.Some of the writers Virgin hired are now big names. Some, like Ben Aaronovitch (*Rivers of London*) had previously written for the TV series. Others, like Russell T. Davies (*Its a Sin*), Mark Gatiss (*Sherlock*), and Paul Cornell (*London Falling*) would go on to write for the revived TV show. And Mary Robinette Kowal (*The Calculating Stars*) and Todd McCaffery (*Dragonriders of Pern*) would go on to be famous independently.The series, the *Virgin New Adventures*, was a modest success, and became Virgins flagship range. Eleven books came out a year, one a month except December, and they sold well enough to keep getting commissioned.Then the BBC teamed up with Fox to make a *Doctor Who* movie in which the Seventh Doctor regenerated into the Eighth. While this didnt lead to a TV series as hoped, the BBC did decide to take publishing of the books back in house. This was a disaster for Virgin. *Doctor Who* was a reliable income stream for them. Fortunately, a solution was at hand. Bernice Summerfield, the Doctors archaeologist companion, was an original creation the BBC didnt have the rights to. So the Virgin New Adventures switched from following the Doctor to following Bernice.This worked quite well, but eventually started to grow stale, and from there comes *Dead Romance*, a story following the Doctors other companion, Chris Cwej. A policeman of Polish descent, the Doctor had dropped him off on Gallifrey at the end of their travels and he had been put to work as an intelligence officer by the Time Lords.The book, which is supposedly three journals by a young woman called Christine Summerfield, opens slightly oddly, with Christine being found by police, stumbling dazed around a car park in 1969 London, off her face on coke. When shes released the next day, Cwej is being brought in, having been fitted up for some murders. Christine quickly realises Cwej is not the most dangerous thing in the station and they escape together.There are references to *Doctor Who* in there, but Virgin didnt have the rights to BBC trademarks, so theyre obscured. But this actually works quite well, because the thing Cwej is running from can use names as a form of control, and so hes deliberately not using the true name of his employers.Lawrence Miles went on to write the best novels in the BBCs Eighth Doctor Adventures series, and from there spun-off his *Faction Paradox* series about a Gallifreyan cult who reject Time Lord society (a description that does it a disservice). The edition of *Dead Romance* I read, re-edited by Miles five years after publication, uses the Faction Paradox terms for shared concepts.I know people for whom books like this were their introduction to *Doctor Who*, and while youd gloss over references to Pyramids of Mars, Genesis of the Daleks, and The War Machines, understanding them is not essential to understanding the book. Probably the biggest change in interpretation such a reader would have is not understanding the extent of Cwejs brainwashing.Paperbacks are expensive.

Why they may be perceived as racist towards certain minorities? Well, due to them being over represented in criminal cases. And why are they over represented? Poverty, for starters. It's crazy, self-propelled wheel. To break it it's not about beating back racism, but poverty.

There are many factors to this: education is valued less because historically it hasn't been a real tool for social mobility and wealth accumulation in that community, the community is generally low-income which means that parents have less time to help kids outside of school, property prices are low so schools are less well funded, etc etc.And yes, some of these reasons are historically rooted in racism.BUTHow this problem is presentented today to Americans is: (I am exaggerating on purpose to make a point here)Right wing: black people are stupid and want to be criminals instead of studying.Left wing: black people are victims of racism and have no agency in their lives which are controlled by the evil white hegemony.If the discourse didn't stard with 'black people' but 'low income' or 'historically disadvantaged', the discourse could be about how to make the educational system work for people in these situations.

The concept of \\"whitelash\\" is a real and painful reaction to the progress of Black Americans, and the examples you bring up are valid and crucial to understanding the setbacks that have occurred.However, I think it's important to consider that racism isn't the only thing holding America back. I would argue that capitalism also plays a significant role in these issues. The way capitalism functions often prioritizes the profit of a few over the wellbeing of many, and racism has been used historically to justify the exploitation of Black Americans and other marginalized groups to maintain this system. When people are divided along racial lines, its easier for those in power to continue exploiting labor and resources without facing unified opposition.Take the War on Drugs you mentioned, while its often framed as a response to crime or social issues, it was also a way to incarcerate Black and Brown communities, keeping them out of the workforce and preventing any significant challenge to the capitalist system. Even more recently, the rise of P2025 you mentioned can be seen as an attempt to maintain this economic structure that keeps wealthy elites in power, using division and fear as tools.So, while racism is a major factor that slows down progress and harms many communities, I think its the intersection of racism with capitalism that truly inhibits societal advancement. In a system where the rich get richer and the poor stay divided, progress for anyone who challenges the status quo becomes difficult.In the end, until we address both systemic racism and the exploitative nature of capitalism, lasting progress for marginalized communities will remain elusive. I agree with LBJs quote, but I would also add that those in power will continue to manipulate divisions to maintain their dominance, racism is just one of the tools in that toolbox.","title":"CMV: Racism is what holding Americas progress back."},{"text":"No, selfishness and individualism is what is holding America back, racism is just one of the many symptoms","title":"CMV: Racism is what holding Americas progress back."},{"text":"Another brainwashed, delusional liberal blaming the failure of democratic party on those who don't vote for the democrat's candidate.","title":"LOOOOOOOOL"},{"text":"a problem I had w this is I became really angry and frustrated with the rigidity of the routine and have trouble getting back on track after a bad dayBut I should probably try again","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"This is insightful. No leftist is going to like to hear this, but America is basically a center-right country. It has been for decades. The people are willing to accept economic populism that has the potential to improve their lives (via Democrats like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama), but they have no interest in left-wing social dogma that runs up against individualism, merit, upward mobility, law and order and self-reliance. The sort of people who come to this country are individualists interested in improving their own station in life economically. They have zero interest in overturning the social order -- and this is especially true of culturally conservative Latinos. The Democrats would be wise to return to their economic focus and try to co-opt certain (current) Republican talking points about trade in order to influence and recapture the white working class in the center of the country. As long as they continue to indulge in identity politics and favor social policies that strike average people as extreme, fringe, or intentionally divisive, they're going to have problems.

Firstly... a civilian does not have any way to be in violation of that. That statute tells the State to whom it may issue a hunting license. Secondly... that statute only applies to hunting.

Laws which allow you to hunt unsupervised with firearm starting from 14 years of age which would be a contradiction with the \\"city\\" law it ties into.So, Judge made the right call.

The criminal liability Rittenhouse theoretically incurred was 948.60(2)(a)[https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/948/60](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/948/60)(2)(a) Any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.You claimed this:Judge conveniently left out the part about :unless the person under 18 years of age discharges the firearm and the discharge causes death to himself, herself or another.Irrelevant to Rittenhouse. That is 948.60(2)(c). Which only applies to a person who illegally loans a rifle to a person under 18. It did theoretically apply to Dominick Black.(b)?Except as provided in par.?[(c)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.60(2)(c)), any person who intentionally sells, loans or gives a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age is guilty of a Class I felony.  \\n(c)?Whoever violates par.?[(b)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.60(2)(b))?is guilty of a Class H felony if the person under 18 years of age under par.?[(b)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.60(2)(b))?discharges the firearm and the discharge causes death to himself, herself or another.Furthermore, the judge didn't \\"leave out\\" this part, which is 948.60(3)(a). All of (3) are exceptions to the general prohibition on persons under 18 possessing a dangerous weapon. As in if they meet the exceptions in (3)(a), (3)(b), or (3)(c), the section does not apply to them, making possession legal.Rittenhouse fell under exception 948.60(3)(c)(c)?This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s.?941.28?or is not in compliance with ss.?29.304?and?29.593.941.28 bans possession of short barreled rifles or shotguns. Rittenhouse didn't have one. Also, you quoted something from 941.28 that you don't understand, and for some reason you changed lawfully possessed to unlawfully possessed. And just note, when it says \\"section shall not apply\\" it means that the restrictions don't apply.Your versionsection shall not apply to any firearm unlawfully possessed under federal law, or any firearm not lawfully registered at the time.The actual version[https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/941/iii/28/4](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/941/iii/28/4)\\\\This?section?shall?not?apply?to?any?firearm?that may be?lawfully?possessed?under?federal?law,?or?any?firearm?that could have been?lawfully?registered?at the time of the enactment of the national?firearms act of 1968.29.304 only applies to persons under 16. 29.593 is saying that while you are hunting, you have to abide by hunting restrictions.","title":"CMV: Rittenhouse trial should have been tried at the Federal level, not State.

Can you cite the federal law? I do not think that crossing state lines with a stolen gun would be \\"arms trafficking\\".Furthermore the firearm was not \\"illegally obtained\\". It was legal for Black to purchase the firearm. It was legal for Rittenhouse to possess the firearm. It was **not** legal for Rittenhouse to purchase the firearm himself... which he did not.The relevant question is the legality of Black providing the firearm to Rittenhouse for his use, and either being legal or illegal has no implication of Rittenhouse being involved in \\"arms trafficking\\". According to WI state law, somebodys use of deadly force MAY be justified for the purposes of defending their property. But this shouldnt apply to Kyle because he wasnt in Kenosha to defend HIS own property, he was there to defend OTHER peoples property.Wisconsin law also includes provisions for defending the property of others under the same conditions as one would defend their own property. It also doesn't seem to be relevant to a case of self-defense, because regardless of the legality of defending the property in question the relevant situation is defending his own life. So once again you are wrong *and* it doesn't matter! ...and not complying with local curfew mandates and refusing to leave / disperse when ordered by authorities to do so.Rittenhouse was charged with that, and it was dismissed because the state couldn't prove a curfew was actually in effect. ...Kyle returned home (gunman crossing a state line)What law exactly do you think was violated here? You can't expect federal charges to be brought based on what you imagine might be naughty. Regarding short barrel rifle judge cited the weapons length to throw out that charge, which allows a 16 year old to possess one. He ignored the fact that it only applies to target practice or licensed hunting, while under adult supervision, neither of which was the case for Kyle.What about (c)? 948.60(3)(c) This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 (941.28 Possession of short-barreled shotgun or short-barreled rifle.) or is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 (29.304 Restrictions on hunting and use of firearms by persons under 16 years of age.) and 29.593 (29.593 Requirement for certificate of accomplishment to obtain hunting approval.). This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941.28.The section does not apply to someone who is under 18 but not in violation of 941.28 (which Rittenhouse was not), or to someone who is not in compliance with 29.304 **and** 29.593 (which Rittenhouse was not). Because the section does not apply all that stuff about target practice, licensed hunting, adult supervision, etc. are not requirements. They do not matter! section shall not apply to any firearm unlawfully possessed under federal law, or any firearm not lawfully registered at the time.First, where exactly are you getting that? Please cite the actual law. Also, the firearm was not unlawfully possessed under federal law and it was lawfully registered at the time.

Despite what others here are saying you are correct that Hawai'i is indeed a very racist place. I will say some of your points are wrong since you don't have actual experience living there. I was also recently banned on a certain subreddit for speaking out against racist locals that frequently leave racist comments on them. Your take on them wanting tourists or not is a bit off. So is your comparing Hawaii and Natzi Germany. I somewhat agree with your other points. I would also not put Hawaiians and \\"locals\\" which is what most people think of when it comes to this topic in the same group together.There is Hawaiian culture and then there is \\"local\\" culture when it comes to Hawaii and most people think of local culture as that is what it mostly is currently. In my experience most native Hawaiians are fantastic people, interestingly non-native \\"locals\\" much less so more often. Most \\"locals\\" are descendants of immigrated plantation workers who are majority Japanese with a mix of other Asian races, white, or maybe some pacific islander in there and they are the ones who tend to be the most racist and entitled. In my own observation much of the racism is a result of a combination of very poor education in Hawai'i as well as what looks to be some sort of inferiority complex. I'd estimate most of the locals are more racist and have more prejudice as it seems to be something baked into their \\"culture\\" in general. Similar to some areas in white rural America.The truth is that the annexation of Hawai'i was much less a result of race and more a result of class and the interests of the wealthy along with the United States government. Locals often use Haole people, or white people, as scapegoats for all of their problems. Racism in Hawai'i is usually passive aggressive and interpersonal. If you are white or black in Hawai'i you'll get stink eye, be singled out for random things like being stopped or harassed by local police more often or yelled at because a local thinks you are doing something dumb when you're not you are just happening to inconvenience them in some way. Locals will be more short with you and generally treat you worse and have a shorter fuse with you. Rarely does this result in a very aggressive incident but it does happen.I would say a small minority of locals don't want tourism, most do but I'd describe their take on it more as a general annoyance with tourists, nothing that deep and nothing any normal person wouldn't feel or think about it.This is the first time I've heard of someone comparing the Natzis and Hitler to Kamehameha and Hawaii. I would say they are quite different and not really comparable enough but I can sort of see where you are coming from. King Kamehameha did indeed slaughter and enslave many people to unite the Hawaiian islands, but his slaughtering of people wasn't a genocide. The way many \\"locals\\" are very racist and praise/romanticize Kamehameha as an idealized hero is somewhat comparable with the Natzis and Hitler and also some modern-day racist white folk who probably still romanticize Hitler.Many locals do indeed move to Vegas, Seattle, or Southern California. For most though it's Vegas for gambling and the cost of living. A lot of them do indeed complain about people moving to Hawai'i while also taking advantage of the mainland's education system by going to school on the mainland instead of Hawai'i. I agree that it is incredibly hypocritical. Again, I hear mostly \\"locals\\" complaining about this and not often native Hawaiians.I also agree with you on their complaining and doing nothing about it other than trying to be more racist as well as fear mongering, as some of them do frequently try to scare people off, for example by lying about how often \\"haoles\\" or tourists get beat up in Hawai'i. Locals are being priced out because a part of their \\"culture\\" is a strange sense of pride in acting and being uneducated, and for a lack of a better term, stupid. Resulting in their not being able to afford rising costs or compete with other people outside of Hawai'i. Again, most of these locals are majority mixed Japanese and not native Hawaiian. After my 7 year stay on O'ahu, I have zero sympathy for these locals and their racism is mostly misguided and unfounded arrogance. I do 100% have sympathy for the native Hawaiians and believe more needs to be done for them. In just 7 years I noticed many more transplants versus locals being on the island so it's happening at a relatively fast pace. I can't think of a negative interaction I've had with native Hawaiians. Native Hawaiians were all very warm, friendly and helpful people in my experience.","title":"CMV: Hawaiians are incredibly racist"},{"text":"How could you get into trouble for not commuting a sentence I assumed it was 100% at the Presidents discretion","title":"President Biden commutes sentence for former Dixon, Ill.

Many people just don't want to give up on the delusion that Americans overwhelmingly support democracy and the rule of law despite the evidence (elections) that they do not.Almost nobody is talking about the fact that such a small percentage turned out to vote against dictatorship and why 2/3rds of eligible voters are either pro-fascism or at least aren't willing to take the time to fill out a ballot to try to prevent it.Until people see that problem no steps can be started to try to correct it.

In 2015, Apatow made Trainwreck, the Amy Schumer vehicle that follows a woman who decides to abandon her boozy promiscuity in favor of monogamy and responsibility. Apatow movies are perhaps subconsciously conservative, despite the will of their creator.Fast forward to 2024. Wicked  the Broadway musical adapted into a two-part film starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo  is a box office hit, already grossing hundreds of millions. For those unfamiliar with the plot, Wicked is both a Wizard of Oz prequel of sorts and a reframing of the original movie, with a focus on the early life of Glinda the Good Witch and the Wicked Witch of the West, known as Elphaba in this version. Its not spoiling the movie to reveal that Wicked portrays a world where Elphaba is actually good, and Glinda is, while more nuanced, actually bad.And the Wizard of Oz himself is the one who leads the charge of shifting the narrative on Elphaba from good and noble to badand wicked.Perhaps inevitably, the 2024 election has been grafted onto this cultural phenomenon. Director Jon M. Chu recently made his political narrative explicit in an interview during the press tour. A charismatic leader who gaslights a community that this woman is wicked just because shes standing up for a marginalized group of people in the society, how could that be [political]? he asked rhetorically.The implication is obvious  Donald Trump is the Wizard of Oz, and Elphaba is Kamala Harris, who was unfairly maligned by the right during the campaign because she was simply trying to stand up for the less fortunate.The Wizard is America governed not by a con man but by a strong man  an authoritarian dictator, wrote Voxs Constance Grady last week in making the case for why the Wizard is Trump-like, in a column titled Why Wickeds politics feel so bizarrely timely.Grady is partially correct, and, like Apatow, Chu seems to have made a movie with a political message that did not come through as intended.Instead of a critique of Trump, Wicked is actually an allegory about how the establishment is fake, nefarious and ultimately a failure. And like in 2024, the audience gets to see the house of cards come tumbling down.Elphabas Wicked Witch is ostracized and marginalized, just like Americans who turned to Trump in 2016, and again in 2024. She is first scorned, then labeled controversial and dangerous. She has a connection with Dr. Dillamond, a talking goat teacher at her school, who is also being targeted by the forces of the establishment. When people are hungry and angry they look for someone to blame, he says, before being forcibly removed from the premises.The Wizard is ultimately exposed as entirely fraudulent, as in the original film. Both Glinda and Elphaba see the truth, but they choose different routes. Glinda aligns with the Wizard in an effort to accrue power and influence  like the lefts continued reliance on supposed expertise, despite the establishment demonstrating more than enough reason to abandon it. Elphaba fights back, and is determined to expose Oz to the public as a fraud.This is how MAGA aligned with a unity coalition in 2024, from RFK Jr. to Tulsi Gabbard to Elon Musk, to bring Trump a sweeping victory.The best way to bring folks together is to give them a real good enemy, says the Wizard near the end. And he successfully does, or attempts to, creating a false narrative about the elements he cant control. Prince Fiyero, who teases an alignment with Elphaba over Glinda, is thus a Trump-like figure, singing about dancing through life and mirroring the way Trump became a turncoat to the elite during his political transformation over the past decade.On Joe Rogans podcast last week, he explained to his comedian friends a central theme of Trumps place in our culture. What youre seeing with Trump, regardless of his flaws, is a massive, concentrated psyop, he said. Theyve distorted who he is to the point where most people think that way.That distortion is echoed in one of the final lines of Wicked, from the Wizards companion, Madame Morrible, who puts out the call to Oz that Elphaba is evil: Believe nothing she says. This distortion! This repulsion!It was all gaslighting and scapegoating, a total inversion of the truth  that the establishment should not be believed, was actually evil and was distorting reality.Will Elphaba convince the people of Oz of the fallacy of the supposed elite, so they can achieve a 2024-like moment where the people defeat the gatekeepers? We know what happens in The Wizard of Oz, so its unlikely. But well find out in part two, out next year.Until then, audiences can enjoy a film that secretly mirrors our political moment, in a way they may not want to admit.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"i was a wawa skeptic until i had a peppermint cookies and cream cold brew at 2 am on a Wednesday night needing to sober up so i could finish an assignment due at 9 that morning.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"What that","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/2kjur1lq8r6e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8259649338103358a0412d389194e3d5dea84985","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Thing is is that there has been famine, drought, war, earthquakes, instability, volcanoes, disease since the age of time.

Autism was only added to the DSM in 1994, so using the 1995 number is going to be pretty inaccurate as far as a true baseline. Many are slow to change their ways and practices even today, and many doctors, including my own child pediatrician who never even attempted to screen me for autism during my childhood, even though I was born a few years after it was added as a diagnoses to the DSM. My previous physician before my current one also never asked or even mentioned possibly having autism to me. And not to be self-deprecating, but Im Very autistic lol, and didnt get diagnosed until last year. The difference was my most recent physician went through med school after autism was added to the DSM, not before. As such, they werent resistant or adverse to screening for it, and actually acknowledged its existence, unlike my pediatrician physician. And this would have been a decade+ after it was added to the DSM by the way. There are still plenty of doctors today that refuse to test for it, they certainly arent actively searching for it. But that is changing over time, and Im not saying that all doctors were like my old pediatrician. But there were and still are many these days. This would certainly help to explain the increase in the amount of diagnoses, alongside with more children getting tested and the decreased social stigmas around being autistic.

I think if I had the power to commute sentences and/or pardon people of their crimes I would be wildly hesitant to issue a blanket pardon/commutation. I am not sure how to particularly feel about the clemency here.

I would readily believe they acted in good faith and believe this to be a net positive decision for one reason or another. On the other hand: whether by design or chance some relatively grotesque people are being pardoned or having their sentence commuted. I can understand how this might leave the victims of their crimes wondering how justice is served and the rest of us wondering whether they will reoffend or offend in some other horrible way.

If you borrow money from a bank, you are obligated to repay it with interest in the currency you borrowed it in. Period. So, money absolutely does have value.So, it absolutely does work.I just wanted to point out, obligation is a trick that is used to enslave people and that I am debt free. People take on monitary obligation and they became slaves to the system. :-)I find it really crazy that people are basically required to create financial obligations to be qualified to have income to repay them. It really is a broken system, but the trick to become free again is to repay your obligations.The better version of this trick is to flip obligation by operating a business that you invested zero capital in. That way the labor that is done to repay the obligation is technically done by your employees. :-)I learned a lot from this church flipper guy, he used to buy run down churches, do a marketing campaign, get the people to basically donate to fix the church, their time, resources, and money, then he would just sell the church. He was doing it for like 10% down or something... Which for a depressed property is like nothing...

Heres why:1. Youre underestimating how historians judge presidenciesBidens legacy wont be defined by debates or approval ratings in the way youre describing. Historians evaluate leaders based on the broader impact of their policies, not the 24/7 news cycle takes. Think about Harry Trumanhe left office with abysmal approval ratings but is now celebrated for his foreign policy achievements and rebuilding post-WWII America. Similarly, Bidens work on infrastructure, climate, and international diplomacy (like rallying NATO against Russian aggression) is the kind of stuff historians love to elevate over time.2. Isolationism is cyclical, but leadership during crises mattersYou argue no one cares about foreign policy, but Bidens handling of the Ukraine war and reinforcing global alliances are exactly the kinds of achievements that are re-evaluated positively down the road. Much like how Carters emphasis on human rights became a cornerstone of modern diplomacy, Bidens global stance could be seen as stabilizing during a tumultuous period.3. Biden vs. Trump is not the only narrativeYou frame his legacy entirely around Trump, but thats shortsighted. Theres a good chance that the long-term narrative will focus on Biden as a stabilizing figure after a volatile administration, much like Gerald Ford is remembered as bringing dignity back to the presidency post-Nixon. A return to boring governance isnt as dramatic, but it often ages better historically.4. Impotence vs. pragmatismYou liken him to Carter, but thats not accurate. Carter struggled with stagflation and Iran; Biden inherited COVID, inflation, and global instabilityand actually passed major legislation during a polarized era. His ability to work with Congress, even in divided times, will probably be viewed more favorably as the dust settles.5. Senility narrative is mostly partisan spinThe senility trope you mention says more about political spin than reality. Reagan faced similar attacks, and yet most Americans now remember him as a strong leader. The same could happen with Biden, especially as his accomplishments start to outshine the sound bites.6. Redemption arc isnt necessary for every presidentCarters post-presidency humanitarian work is impressive, but not every leader needs a redemption arc. Bidens success will ultimately depend on how his policies hold up, not whether he gets a post-office halo.At the end of the day, contemporary opinions are always noisy. Bidens presidency might feel underwhelming to some now, but history isnt written in real time. If his legislative accomplishments (like the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure investments) have tangible long-term benefits, people will eventually see him as a transformational figure.

Also there's been plenty of expansions of government programs to help people in need, and we could always do even more, targeted to help people actually in need without disrupting the economy of course, as opposed to doing dangerous populism from either side. **Inflation** was by far the biggest economic issue Americans were angry about in the 2024 election. Dems indeed didn't focus enough on it. But trying to twist it around to suggest that actually attempts to fight inflation via actually economically literate policy would be bad and would piss off the electorate that just wants burger cheaper, well, that's just not credibleAlso immigration isn't even necessarily a matter of \\"wages being suppressed\\". Research suggests that even if there is an impact on wages, the impact on lowering the cost of living is even greater. And some research suggests that actually even low skilled immigration helps *increase* wages rather than decrease it. We are at a point where there's labor shortages in many different key fields like construction and the trades, and wages have increased but not led to the shortages going away. It's not like there's more workers than jobs, at this point inflation can be in part due to jobs just being unable to get workers at all at any pay due to labor shortages. Deporting workers in a labor shortage isn't necessarily going to help blue collar workers at all, no matter how much they scream about how much they hate capitalism or whatever Capitalism works and protectionism, whether it be for housing, trade, immigration, or whatever else, just doesn't work and never will. Maybe that's too politically incorrect for the masses, maybe they'll react with rage against this reality and the experts who deliver the message to them.

A large group of 1500 convicted felons is bound to include people who did bad things, duh. Theyve paid their debt to society, he isnt granting full pardons, and just commuting sentences that were already partially commuted in the form of house arrest. The embezzler here served 12 years of an 16 year sentence and just had 4 more to go, which shed otherwise spend on house arrest.

The US produces a lot even today. The biggest factor in declining manufacturing as a percent of employment has been automation, not outsourcing, since trade results in outsourcing in both directions anyway (plenty of American workers work for foreign companies due to trade expansion). And pushing against automation would be incredibly bad policy (which is of course why the unions and Trump are now pushing for it at our docks lmao)The economy is now financialized, the FIRE sectors are the only working parts left.What lol?From what I'm seeing online, finance/insurance has around 8 million workers, and real estate around 3 million workers. For the US economy in general,there's around 160 million workers. So FIRE is like 6 or 7 percent of the workforce. If we look at median real wage numbers, workers in general have been steadily seeing improvements since the early 90s in real wages (that's adjusted for inflation btw) so workers overall have been doing better and better. Plenty of other jobs outside of FIRE that have plenty of folks doing fine. In terms of industries that have good paying job openings, there's industries like healthcare plus all sorts of construction/trades jobs, and truck driving and other transportation stuff. Education is also an in demand field, where the pay can be a bit lower than private sector jobs but the job security is great and the education requirements are also often rather low compared to other jobs. Plenty of STEM job shortages too. Hell, even when it comes to the lowest entry level retail/food type jobs, we've seen a lot of wage compression over the past few years with some of the fastest wage increases seem among those parts of the economy. At this point there's decent job openings in all sorts of fields, for both the high and low skilled workersBut maybe people just don't give a shitWorkers at home are told to learn to code?Workers at home who lose their jobs are told to *do something else*, out of the many different at least decent opportunities that *do* exist. But maybe workers don't want to ever have to change career paths and do something different. Maybe what we the people really want is an American caste system where we are guaranteed a job in one particular career area for life. Considering how butthurt that boomers can get about seeing their kids moving out of their rural areas and going to the suburbs and cities for job opportunities outside of the work they themselves used to do, maybe blue collar American workers also want an American caste system to mandate that the guarantee/requirements to work in one particular type of job be inherited as well, so that the working class can be nice and secure in the notion that their kids and their kids' kids and so on will never have to evolve to deal with a different and more advanced economy, and that things can just stay the same forever! Capital scours the third world shopping for the most vulnerable cheap labor.And uplifts the global cheap labor to the global middle class. Multinational trade exploits global inequalities... to lower the cost of living in the first world via specialization, while increasing income in third world countries too via offering \\"low\\" pay that is still higher than the domestic labor in those countries. Why do you hate the global poor?Amazon and Temu offer everything you could want from china except maybe a job.Plenty of Amazon jobs in the US. Plenty of jobs in general. It's not like we have a job shortage.

Not a source in general, but I think one thing that can help searching, impressionable young men who might not otherwise have an 'easy way to relate' to these issues is just to *read more.*  \\nThere is a bevy of good literature out there that, while not being *explicitly* feminist, introduces concepts and a basic sense of life's difficulties in a way that is not 'challenging,' such as presenting said themes in the context of fantasy, science fiction, or horror - far more neutral and less potentially exhausting topics for many, hahaha.Pretty much anything by Anna Kavan comes to mind, though I am partial to *Ice.*      Further, this applies for other visible and invisible minorities, too; and much of this writing can be outre or uncomfortable in ways that might not only remind some of us that an increasingly censorious culture is dangerous to all of us, while also challenging other assumptions we have.   \\nEssentially, the commonality between both Butler and Heinlein is that they had *no* filter, ahaha, but that can be an easier way to introduce topics that would otherwise be too much for some, possibly *many.*2\\\\.  If post, post 9, which I very specifically avoided responding to.   \\nMisanthropy rarely helps action, and sometimes, well, see my final point.   \\nIf in this closing point, *I never saw the starfish video!*  \\nAhaha, and it might sound silly, but... Oddly, just what I needed.3\\\\. I think that one *cannot* be a Democratic activist and abandon women, visible or invisible minorities, sexual minorities, etc. That doesn't mean I believe we must be perfect; I understand our coalition will have very different ideas of what support means, and I would rather work with people who fumble but try, then never try or actively oppose things in the first place.4\\\\. The reason I'm leaving this response here is, I think many people in their own fight against the forces we deal with have very ingrained ideas of what our opponents look like and sound like.From my perspective, the most difficult thing to address it that it is easier - though still too difficult for many - to fight people visibly opposing us.It is much, much, harder to confront people you thought were good, who would stand by you, or those you love, and are now saying they will happily abandon you and not lose a night's sleep.   To me, people cannot speak of class consciousness if they are talking about redistribution of wealth from minorities and women to young men, and in the last few days I have seen a lot of that kind of talk.    \\nEpisode 8 went into this a bit, and again, you and I would absolutely be for - and have been! for years! - about helping young men, but... C'est la vie.   The fight is difficult, and people are often disappointing.  \\nBut the world is beautiful, and even disappointing people *can be worth fighting for.*   \\nI feel if a tired old misanthrope like myself can feel that way, anyone can.Thank you for writing these.

I strongly disliked the editing. Most chapters were at around a middle-school reading level. Woodward has a strong pro-Biden bias, but not to the point where it gets in the way of the facts, apart from some instances where he denies Biden's cognitive decline.The book talks, generally, about Ukraine and Gaza, with chapters about what Trump is up to interspersed. The reporting on Ukraine war is where the book truly shines. I genuinely couldn't put the book down- it was informative and riveting.IMO, Woodward is much too lenient on Biden regarding Israel. He tries to paint a picture of Biden as a man to whom the extent of devastation in Gaza is a top issue, and who is doing almost everything he can to stop it. While I'm sure Biden cares somewhat about Palestinian lives and is increasingly frustrated with Israeli leadership, actions speak louder than words. His refusal to stop sending weaponry and repeated backing off of ultimatums and red lines show that Woodward isn't telling the full story, or even half of it.Overall I'd give it a 7-8/10. Definitely worth a read.","title":"Bob Woodwards judgement of the Biden admin- what are your guys thoughts?"},{"text":"If they were non-violent offenders that were released on house arrest by Donald trump during Covid they were also commuted.
