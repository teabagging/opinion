I slip up with pronouns and I still get a bit of that uncanny valley feeling when around them. However, I don't like that about myself and I am actively working on it. What I really need is to be around trans people all day for like a week and my issues would disappear.  I know so because my issues are caused by our natural response to things with which we are not familiar, but intellectually I know that is all that it is.Even with that natural response, I have definitely seen trans women that I think are attractive. If they are pretty, they are pretty. If they are witty, they are witty. I don't think I could ever be sexually involved with a trans woman, though, because dicks gross me out.\\nAnyways, I will not leave trans people behind just to win elections in the short term, and I will not support anybody that will.

Would it have been better if Biden had stuck to the one term and we had been through a primary? Yes. But that wasn't enough... Young people - Gaza - they didn't vote because they wanted to teach Democrats a lesson - and they took away any hope for those poor people, but they got to wag their finger at Democrats. They also believe both parties are the same. I've personally seen change - look at my list in the other comment. But younger people haven't.What they and others don't grasp is you need a REAL MAJORITY to get things done, especially  because of the way the filibuster is used. People should get what they vote for, so Democrats tried to kill the filibuster, but they had only a slim majority, and they were blocked by Manchin and Sinema.  Fix Climate change, fix gun control, fix manufacturing, fix prices, legalize abortion - people complain that it never gets done. Nothing is happening!   Hey,  to get things to happen,  they need to VOTE in greater numbers. Biden managed to pass the chips act- but people won't see that right away. He did a lot for the future of manufacturing, He was going after monopolies, but again, that doesn't happen tomorrow. He tried to use laws to protect abortion, so far the supreme court is blocking him.Jon Stewart did a great monologue on how Republicans just do shit, throw spaghetti  at the walls, no care for  norms, they   find loopholes,  they get a thing done. And he was berating Democrats for constantly following the norms, working on bipartisan proposals. Plodding along following the process. I get that they prefer to do things in a way there's less chance of another president coming in and undoing, but they wouldn't have to worry about that if they win the election by getting things done. Just skirt the law and get stuff done. Find the loopholes. That's probably why people didn't turn out. They think It doesn't make a difference. I believe soon enough, they'll find out it does, but that's what they think. Now - Why they voted for trump- It takes too long to explain economics. What Biden did was amazing considering the fight against Republicans and a right wing supreme court that blocked him at every turn. \\nHe brought back a new New Deal with long term investments and, if trump doesn't kill them, will show up in a few years. Even right wing WSJ and other finance news outlets praised the work he did with chip manufacturing.  And he was the first president in decades that finally used existing law to go after monopolies that are raising prices - not just to end consumers, but to small businesses. They are also strangling young entrepreneurs. I'm sure trump will kill that. Many of his bills went to states with stipulations that they fix processes that are slowing down permits for housing and businesses.  My own Republican senator regularly boasted about the money and jobs that were coming in - he didn't mention his party fought it tooth and nail. But, that's TOO MANY WORDS. Immigration - the problem is amnesty. For decades Cubans jumped off a boat on to a Florida beach and claimed amnesty! I mean they were here for a better life and $$$, but ok. They have to have a hearing. Same is happening on the southern border. Biden tried to fix that with a bipartisan law that would limit amnesty until the backlogs were caught up. It also gave money to hire more  border security and judges. Guess what -  Trump went berserk because he didn't want the border fixed - he needed the border to be broken to win! He was pissed. So this deal Republicans put together , they suddenly had to come up with bullshit reasons to kill it. It was ridiculous listening to them- , ummm, ummm - it still lets too many in. But wait, Trump said these were rapists and criminals - you are going to walk away from STOPPING  most of them from coming in ??!TOO MANY WORDS.Prices were going down. Not fast enough. COVID had been a bottleneck and there were studies people were starting to see them go down locally, but assumed they were high everywhere else. Using anti trust laws will do something about price fixing...So that's a LOT of words. Too many words. \\nDemocrats suck at messaging. Trump - I will fix high prices.  The immigrants are raping you and taking away your homes and boys are going to school and coming back as girls. I  will fix everything! Instantly!The people - we feel heard!Experts - tariffs are going to raise prices.

The rich, on the other hand, only have other rich people to personally betray since those are the people they know/are friends with/grew up with and so they just don't have the incentive to legislate in ways that would help the working and middle-class (b/c to do so would to go against their rich friends' interests) - they have more of an incentive to just keep rigging the game for their rich friends.

In fact, the definition of veganism means \\"elimination of your contribution to animal suffering in all the ways that are possible and practicable\\".If eliminating meat from your diet is not possible or practicable due to some obscure medical condition, then fine. Most vegans also would say that anyone living in the Arctic where they survive on whale blubber is under no obligation to eliminate that food from their consumption. But the point is that, for anyone who can make the decision (which is most people), they should.","title":"CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing"},{"text":"Moronic.

Under Wilson there were isolationism, until the Zimmerman telegram blew it up. WWII the US wanted to sit it out until Pearl Harbor. It also comes off as American exceptionalism, American centric and a bit Eurocentric that I'm having a hard time taking your points seriously. Ex.A general perception that the rest of the world benefitted from this system yet simultaneously held anti-American sentiment. True, the US could be an arrogant bully on occasion, but the American people began to ask: if this system is so good...why aren't other countries doing more to maintain it themselves?This is a mixed and complicated topic. The Bretton Wood system largely benefitted the US primarily, and then what we would now call the Western bloc. The end of the Cold War solidified those gains more than anything. You're largely ignoring how a lot of these institutions do not benefit the Global South as a whole - that's why the Chinese are able to put in a wedge as a counter offer. Your analysis is also very hollow (I couldn't think of another word and I don't mean this as a pejorative) in the sense that you seem to look at the problem on a surface level. Your average American did not become stupid over night. There's been a gradual decline in cognition mostly (personal take) due to social media removing any safeguards. The people back then are the same people as today, but they're not getting the same quality information to make informed decisions. And this one is a bit of a nitpick but the analysis on ME oil is off - the US doesn't need Saudi oil as much as to stabilize the global oil prices or else we might have something like the 1970s recession. Personally, I don't believe he's convincing people against what you call the American identity and Grand Strategy (this isn't a game, no nations have a grand strategy hahaha) but he is channeling anger against the status quo. The US has a lot of problems but no one wants to have an honest and open conversation - things like over militarization (Prussia was not a country with an army but an army with a country), lack of funding for public education (which will stifle innovation and economic development that this will trigger a negative cycle per Ray Dalio), extreme income inequality, etc. Also, to solidify, those issues are core beliefs for some of the American constituents, it's not a Trump thing.

And his ability to get the \\"weird\\" wave going mattered. I don't think most candidates could've won - this was just a trash year to run as an incumbent.

Reagan was a populist who was a racist piece of shit. But at least he cared about Democracy and respected the process of US government.

Let's take the Predator drone, the default American one as an example.The tech was only able to start early testing in the 80s, and it didn't really come online for actual manufacturing and use until the Predators started flying in 1994-1995, and at that point it was only engineered for recon purposes. So Clinton didn't really have access to drones as a weapons platform yet. The USAF only started testing them out as weaponized drones in mid 2000, and they were still developing them further for a solid year by 9/11.So by the time that rolled around and we went to war, we only had a few drones overall and they were still mostly being used as recon vehicles because they weren't quite ready for armed use yet. So for the first half of the Bush admin, armed drones weren't a major viable tool yet. They finally started being useable during his time as president but that was already part of the way into his presidency and it was only kicking into gear at that point, so Bush isn't really seen as a big drone strike guy either. But then comes Obama's era. He comes into office as the *first* president where armed Predator drones are already being manufactured and have already started being used. The USAF also realized really early on in armed Predator testing that they wanted drones as *dedicated* armed vehicles instead of just retrofitting existing Predator designs with missiles, so they had started working on a Predator redesign by 2001 as well. That's how the Reaper drone came to be, and the government would order several hundred of them but the USAF only owned single digit numbers of those by the time the election 2007 rolled around and Obama got elected.TL:DR, Predator drones as armed vehicles only started being *tested* after Bush took office, only started being real world use after he had been in office for a while, and had *just* started to get into full swing during the Bush-Obama transition era, which was also the same time that dedicated armed drones started being made. He was the first president who came into office with access to them already and they were just entering fever pitch of manufacturing right when he started.Of course, Trump ended up crushing Obama's numbers. You could question if drones had just become more numerous during Obama and Trump took over that already in-progress process (the same way Obama inherited Bush's burgeoning drone strategy), but overall, drones had already pretty much matured into the default tool for the American military and had already been in full swing manufacturing for a few years before Obama even left office. It's probable that Obama's usage of drones was what one might consider a 'baseline' amount of usage, and he got a reputation for it because he was first up to bat.","title":"a little hint at the truth for the most faithful citizens, the non democracy-practicists."},{"text":"And all LGBTQ groups","title":"The 15 Democrats Who Voted to Give Trump Insane New Powers"},{"text":"Citizens United is directly blocking this movement.What are your thoughts/solutions to end Citizens United first?","title":"We need a new party."},{"text":"I'd like to win elections, we have to deal with this or concede the point to the right, not dealing with it will result in the Harris campaign","title":"What Democrats Are Getting Wrong About Transgender Rights"},{"text":"I think people would vote for Pete (gay) over Kamala (black AND a woman).

Angels are loyal to God, while demons are those who rebelled against Him (Jude 1:6; Revelation 12:7-9).Greek gods, in my understanding, align with a group of spiritual beings referred to in the Bible as the divine council (Psalm 82:1; Deuteronomy 32:8-9, ESV). These beings were appointed by God to oversee the nations after humanitys rebellion at the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9). However, many of them also rebelled, leading people astray into idolatry (Deuteronomy 32:16-17; Psalm 106:37-39).The rebellion of the divine council is not explicitly described, but there are allusions to it in Scripture. For instance, Psalm 82 depicts God judging these rebellious beings, saying, You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince (Psalm 82:6-7). This suggests that while they were given authority, they failed in their duties and acted corruptly.Regarding the Nephilim mentioned in Genesis 6:4, some interpret this as part of the spiritual rebellion where the sons of God (a term often referring to divine beings, e.g., Job 1:6) intermingled with humans, producing the Nephilim, described as the mighty men of old, men of renown. While interpretations vary, this event may illustrate how spiritual beings sought to disrupt Gods creation.I dont know much about skinwalkers, but it seems they are a concept specific to Navajo folklore and not addressed in the Bible. However, Scripture warns against interacting with spirits or engaging in practices tied to the occult (Deuteronomy 18:10-12).","title":"What are demons?

So...what? Biden did what every President but one since ever had done. Gracefully welcome the next President to the job and hand them the keys to the White House without protest.Not sure what the complaint is. They said he's a dictator and a tyrant, but he's now *America's* dictator and tyrant.As to resistance, what resistance is there to mount? The man isn't President yet, any resistance would be token and all words and bluster. At the state level, some states have been very clear they're fortifying themselves against what the project will be Trump craziness, and resignations at every government level are flying from people who will refuse to serve, others will remain to perform their last duty of transfer of power, because it is still their duty, knowing they're likely going to be purged.The lack of disorderly rebellion at this point doesn't mean anyone was lying about anything. But the future has not come to pass yet and nothing has been proven true or false. We don't know who will be around to temper Trump's worst impulses and who will cave, will the Supreme Court be loyal to democracy or the majority rubber stamp Trump's desires? Are the Republicans really so enamored with Trump that they'll allow his takeover of the government and attempted dissolution of the current system?At least in the beginning these things have to happen, and they haven't...yet. Last Trump term was rife with stories of how responsible human beings despite having really conservative views, simply refused some of Trump's wilder ideas, literally saving themselves from prison and us from his insanity on more than one occasion. Even his own Vice President had to defy him to administer actual democracy, despite him being as right-wing as they come.Trump is going to try to install the weirdest most sycophantic people to surround him this time, and that means there will be no adults in the room to say no. All it takes is for Congress to go along with the MAGA line and his Supreme Court to sit on its hands despite the cries of its minority, and his road to dictatorship will be paved. That's it. We could be living in 1930's Germany right now, as all the pieces are set. Trump has made it clear what he'll do with that power as well. Or not. 4 chaotic years could pass and though it won't be what the left wants, but it won't be apocalyptic as predicted. That doesn't make Democrats liars, that just makes them wrong. Everybody is hoping to be wrong, actually. The alternative is scary, dangerous and will require actions that no democracy wants to have to take.Anyways, I think this columnist is just stoking fires and throwing mud, and advancing that tired, crappy 'both sides suck' narrative that to this day still damages our ability to get our electorate to participate, even when the ability to do that in the future could be compromised.

According to the Commission, this new campaign is meant to mobilize investments into renewables in Africa, to tap into its enormous potential. As disclosed, the campaign will rely on the policy support of the International Energy Agency and will seek to drive new commitments on policy and finance from governments, financial institutions, the private sector and philanthropists. Coordinated with the international advocacy organization Global Citizen, it will conclude around the G20 summit in South Africa in November 2025. This initiative builds on the EU-Africa Global Gateway Investment Package, which supports Africa through projects jointly identified in priority areas. As per the Commission, Global Gateway projects focus on accelerating the green and digital transition, creating sustainable growth and jobs, as well as supporting health systems and improving education and training. The package contains 150 billion worth of investments and is also designed to attract investments from the private sector. Ursula von der Leyen commented: Africas clean energy journey is picking up speed. We are proud to be part of it. Europe has been investing massively in renewable energy projects in Africa with Global Gateway. Now we are calling on the world to join us. Im happy to co-host the campaign Scaling up Renewables in Africa with President Ramaphosa. Together, we will help bring clean, affordable power to Africa. Cyril Ramaphosa stated: Africa has enormous potential and the necessary resources to lead a revolution in renewable energy. A mass roll-out of renewable energy across our continent would enable many countries to propel their economies along a clean energy development path. We welcome this initiative, which, if undertaken in a just and inclusive manner, could have a huge impact on the lives of Africas people. To remind, in September 2024, the European Union committed R628 million (approximately 32 million) in grants to promote the sustainable development of green hydrogen value chains in South Africa. The European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson remarked at the time that the investment shows the EU Global Gateway strategy in action, boosting smart, clean and secure connections in the energy and transport sections. Our cooperation in support of South Africas green hydrogen agenda aims to accelerate the green transition, drive sustainable development, create new economic opportunities, and build a more sustainable future for the region. It is worth mentioning that the Global South, including Africa, has been recognized as a promising market for green fuels. By implementing the concept of green shipping corridors, countries in the Global South could be supplying green fuels to the countries of the Global North. In August 2024, trade and employer association Danish Shipping urged Denmark and the EU to intensify investments in Africa, reflecting on the continents potential for both green energy and economic growth. Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping, said at the time: Africa has massive potential for renewable energy, which can play a key role in the future of green fuels for shipping. If we are to ensure the green transition, it is crucial that we strengthen cooperation on the development of these energy sources.!ping EUROPE&amp;AFRICA&amp;ECO","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Pizza trucks or I walk.","title":"U.S. Rep.

It is a philosophical question, from a moral perspective, whether one of those choices is better for the American people, or better for the Democratic Party. It's possible that by not obstructing Trump, American society dissembles so much that the Democratic Party will appear more appealing to more people than in 2024. On the other hand, it is possible that Trump by obstructing Trump, American society is not as harmed, and therefore American society does not dissemble to a state that enough of the electorate finds the Trump admin sufficiently unappealing to vote for Democrats - that is a philosophical question to the extent that it implicates a moral choice.","title":"Democrats welcome Trump the fascist with open arms"},{"text":"Who up creating value for their hair shoulders?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Thanks, yeah I was feeling like that","title":"John Fetterman offers his office bathroom to Sarah McBride as she says shell follow GOP rules on restroom usage"},{"text":"You can keep neoliberalism alive by buying KO shares.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The contrarian takes trying to say things like this isnt so bad because we didnt lose by that much are asinine and demonstrate a naive privilege that takes liberal democracy for granted.

It just makes shit up to fill in the blanks.  I tried it on Chat GPT. And it came up with a completely different answer. The song \\"Two-Way Street\\" by The Mamas and The Papas was included in their fourth studio album, The Papas &amp; The Mamas, released in 1968. This album marked a departure from their earlier, more polished sound, leaning instead into darker and more introspective themes. \\"Two-Way Street\\" reflects this shift with lyrics that explore the challenges of mutual understanding and compromise in relationships.\\nThe song's arrangement retains the group's signature harmonies but incorporates a more somber tone, aligning with the overall mood of the album. The group was navigating interpersonal tensions during this time, which influenced the album's themes of longing and disillusionment.\\nIf you'd like to learn more about this song and its context, you can explore resources like The Mamas and The Papas' official discography or album reviews. That's just what AI does. If it doesn't have an answer it often creates an authentic sounding one. In this case it also knows there have been Bing searches recently for Mamas and Papas Two Way Street (which might have been you or me doing it) which is then uses as its source and it fills in the blanks.But seeing how both their 1966 and 1968 albums (depending on which AI model you're believing) were *massive* hits, it's impossible that the song would be removed from every copy in existence and have every trace of it removed from the world with only AI able to pull up lengthy details about it. It's just makes zero sense.

The point isn't that Allred wasn't perfect, or that his campaign made mistakes, its that it wasn't really designed to win. It was designed to burn out-of-state donor money into the pockets of consultants and ad agencies. Allred wasn't really that serious about winning to begin with. Most of these red state campaigns work the same way. Donors are wined and dined and convinced their money could be what flips an important state or gets rid of a particularly vile Republican. The money is promptly wasted on boring Dem ads and mailers and phone calls, stuff that doesn't really work or matter because it changes nothing and offers nothing new. The campaign fails, because again, it did nothing new, promised nothing new, and probably relied on the charisma of yet another worthless neoliberal Dem technocrat. Consultants, ad agencies, TV stations, etc. all go home with a bag of money, the politician who lost gets name recognition, maybe a sweet job down the line. Rinse and repeat. Honestly, Dems mostly win by relying heavily on self-motivated, self-organizing progressives doing the ground work and by the general political winds falling in their favor. They do not actively change narratives. They do not name enemies. They do not try to change minds. They rely on the low racist notion that demographics are destiny and people should vote for them because the other guy is worse. They do not actively do the populist work of organizing ground operations much any more and when they do attempt to the ground work, its extremely lame, with uninspiring messages that are deeply undercut by feckless congressional compromises or blockages and the constant cozying up to conservatives by Dem leadership.","title":"The 15 Democrats Who Voted to Give Trump Insane New Powers"},{"text":"How do you know those of us who know don't care?

The idea that this was a security is a post-hoc reason given that does not at all match what actually occurred.Russia wanted Ukraine as something of a vassal state and this was working out with an extremely friendly Ukrainian president Yanukovych in power. But then in late 2013 there came a point where there was a choice between two trade deals - one with the EU and one with Russia. The Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly supported the EU vote, but the president was set to ignore them and sign the Russian one instead.This lead to protests, and (taking cues from his Russian advisors), Yanukovych responded with an extremely heavy-handed and violent response to break up the protests. This sparked even larger protests, to which Yanukovych responded with even harsher measures, with this back and forth escalation eventually resulting in 100 protesters dead.Yanukovych had decided at pretty much every possible juncture to go with the most oppressive and least popular choices since the start of the protests. Once there were so many dead civilians on the ground, the entire political spectrum of Ukraine had turned against him. It was a series of colossal mistakes and own-goals that eventually lead to parliament opening investigations against Yanukovych, him fleeing the country to Russia rather than face them, and then them stripping him of his office for abandoning his post.There's some talk of the US being behind the protests without much solid evidence, but that wouldn't have yielded this end result without Yanukovych *so massively* screwing up his responses to them. The US was certainly found to have had influence over what happened after Yanukovych was out of office, but that's after the biggest events had already taken place.From there, Putin invaded Crimea. Then he spent the next few years supporting rebel groups in the Ukrainian east in the hopes of breaking off that part of the country. But when this didn't work he instead started building new rail infrastructure for moving military materiel en masse as well as growing and deploying the Black Sea fleet in preparation for more serious involvement (which the pandemic scuttled, leaving any potential plans on hold for a while).This whole thing has, from the start, been about Putin wanting to be able to keep Ukraine solidly within Russia's sphere of influence, whether Ukrainians wanted that or not, and being willing to use conquest to ensure it happened.","title":"CMV: American patriots who sympathize with Putin are not actually patriots"},{"text":"things that would have never helped you if it lasted longer: \\nyour gas car\\nyour gas chainsaw\\nthings that would have helped:\\nsolar pannels\\nhand tools","title":"Tax Dollars to Ukraine"},{"text":"Even if unintended, the consequence of not supporting Ukraine is culpability for the eradication of Ukraine and its people by Putin.

And if misogyny and transphobia is the price I need to pay to be my true self, then its well worth it.","title":"John Fetterman offers his office bathroom to Sarah McBride as she says shell follow GOP rules on restroom usage"},{"text":"To start with Im /very/ anti Russian, Ukraine is like my second home, but you have a very flawed premise of all of this.One: Those arent inherently American values, those are your values that you want America to have, many Americans disagree. Our founding fathers explicitly disagreed, for the vast majority of American history your average American and our government disagreed, even now probably the majority of Americans disagree. For example, we legalized gay marriage less than a decade ago, dont act like LGTBQ rights are a pillar of the American identity and culture lmao. It never even became widely popular and has managed to drop in popularity since. Freedom and democracy are the only two things you mentioned that most Americans through most of American history have agreed are a pillar of the American identity, and even that looks very different to different people, even in the early days the federalists were popping off about it, many of our founding fathers had views you would consider downright fascist. Im assuming that youre also shocked that over half of American voters now seem to hold what you consider anti American views, at what point of them being the majority do your views become the anti American ones? Is anyone who doesnt support Trump and laws he brings these next four years Anti American? How much of your government/laws/culture can you disagree with and still be a patriot?Two: similar to one, even if we do accept these values as being integral to the American identity, what exactly that looks like is different for every American. You likely hold some views that even people who agree with you are against, at one point does disagreeing become anti American to you? Is someone who supports equal opportunity but not laws enforcing it anti American? Is someone who supports equal opportunity laws but not affirmative action anti American? The same can be said for any other thing you mentioned, and just know that no matter what your beliefs are there is someone further along with those beliefs who looks back at you and thinks youre the anti American one for it. Where is the line drawn, and why do you think youre the one who gets to draw it?Three, the biggest point: To a patriot, especially one more isolationist, literally why should they care if a country other than ours doesnt have our values if it doesnt affect us? Saudi Arabia for example has literally nothing going for it that I approve of or would want here, I can still respect their leaders for things they do well and if they did manage to do something good acknowledge it, and as long as they contribute to our goals, trade with us, let us base there, dont mess with us, etc, then ultimately what they do just isnt my concern. I agree with worrying about Russia because theyre a security threat to America, but for someone who doesnt agree that theyre a security threat, or thinks that that threat is best dealt with through negotiation and warming relations, why would any of the stuff you mentioned matter as long as Russia is benefiting America through its actions? Why /should/ Russian or Saudi internal politics matter to us on the other side of the world other than with how it affects us? I respect you feeling differently, but at the end of the day thats a political opinion that has no correlation whatsoever with how much you love your country.Four: A simple thing to point out touched on in three but you can support some aspects of someone without supporting them all. I can objectively admire many things Putin for example does while also hating him and hoping the worst comes to him for what hes done, the same can be said of any person out there. Its likely rare to impossible to find someone who hasnt done a single admirable thing in their life that we can point out tbh.A patriot is someone who loves their country and wants whats best for it. You dont even have to love the laws, government, or culture. You can be a patriot on any side of the political spectrum and with any political belief as long as you genuinely believe that you want whats best for your country, nearly all politically inclined Americans agree with that, we just disagree on methods and disagreeing with methods doesnt remove someone elses intent and patriotism.","title":"CMV: American patriots who sympathize with Putin are not actually patriots"},{"text":"Did you read the article?

The Ukrainian delegation argued that the caps should be higher but did not oppose these limitations in principle, making it possible for the two sides to meet in the middle. These concessions, though seemingly steep in a vacuum, must be weighed against the remarkable terms on which Russia was apparently willing to end this war.Next while it did stop them from joining Nato it actually allowed them to join the EU Not only did this arrangement leave the door open for Ukraine to join the EU, but it allegedly called on Russia to confirm its intention to facilitate Ukraines membership in the European Union. This marked a stunning reversal of Russias quest to block Kyivs European aspirations, laying the groundwork for Ukraines eventual integration into a common Western political, cultural and economic bloc.Also that is not what was portrayed in 2022 in the Kyiv Post after they interviewed people in the meeting.

I'm not trying to imply that all teenage boys think this way or that only teenage boys think this way. Just that it is a pattern of thinking common in that group. Beyond that different gender, race, and age groups do have genuinely (on average) different ways of talking and writing. Obviously not everyone matches that, but there are trends. Based on the way OP writes, I do suspect they are approximately a teenage boy. I may very well be wrong because not everyone in one group is the same, but there are genuine patterns that can be picked up on 3.

However, I do agree with you that the primaries present an issue.

As per my last sentence, yes, there is nothing to be done about Trump, himself. But the problem with extremism is a big problem for a country only if it persist. I'll elaborate: first, midterms do exist, and other politicians have an incentive in moderating him if they want to continue their career. Second, Trump's extremism is already not incredibly popular, so if he doesn't behave moderately, it's going to be hard for the next Republican presidential candidate to earn the trust of peopleand for sure, the candidates to the primaries won't be able to show even an ounce of extremism, or they will get voted away, making the problem of extremism self correcting over the course of the history of the country.

Most primaries are closed meaning that only the voters registered to the party can vote in the primary. Some states have open primaries and any voter can vote in whichever primary they prefer, however, even then most independent voters arent going to vote in primaries. They normally wait for the general.Proportionate representation will alleviate a lot of the issues because there are more than two candidates, so an extremist candidate cant barely win the primary and then receive the support of their entire party. For example, lets say there are 5 parties - 1 extreme left, one extreme right, and 3 relatively moderate candidates. The 3 moderate parties will split up the moderate votes, however, even though none would have a clear majority they would be able to form a moderate coalition. Its unlikely that the extremist parties will get a plurality of votes because its the moderate voters would for one of the moderate parties instead of voting for the extremist candidate that happened to win the primary.Essentially, youre isolating the extremists into a smaller voting block that wont have as much power. Since the moderates will be able to choose a candidate that is more aligned with their views rather than being pigeonholed into voting for an extremist candidate that barely won their partys primary. The extremist will still get votes, but likely not enough to have meaningful power. Im not sure what you mean by your last sentence to be honest.. once Trump is elected he gets to serve his 4 years under our system.

Donald Trump is terrible for the world. Now just imagine how badly Democrats must have fucked up so badly to have most of the country prefer him over them. And before you say it no. If youre conclusion as the Americans are racist and misogynist, that is simply incorrect. This is facile, glib, naive and lazy argument. The simple fact of the matter is the Democrats had veered so far away from the American mainstream, especially on cultural and identity issues, they simply became on appetizing for the vast majority of the country. No, it is not simply inflation. The US had the best economic recovery after the pandemic, than almost any other country. Unemployment is at a record lows and real wages have been rising under the Dems. Democrats and Harris in particular squandered all this by not appealing to the center. The election was all about culture, and immigration. Donald Trump made record in inroads with black men and Hispanics. He was the first Republican to win the popular vote since 2004 and only the second in 36 years. Eight million people who voted for Biden last time around, simply stayed home, while Trump got roughly the same amount of votes. Make a mistake, people were sick of the Democratic agenda. This is a wake up call for Democrats. If they decide to simply double down, they will get absolutely eviscerated next round.

No.When I go to the range, its *almost exclusively men*. You can say theyre only outnumbered 2:1 in weapon ownership, but in this hypothetical, all men have decided that women need to be subjugated. How many women would *actually* take up arms? Im willing to bet that a decent portion would be unwilling or unable to fight, and that number advantage would multiply to at least 3:1 if not 4:1. This tips the scale towards the males.As far as police officers go: based on the poor marksmanship rate from the article I posted, Id wager that most of them dont practice with their weapons off duty. Again, anecdotally, since I almost never see a woman at a range, Id put a couple more pounds on the mens side of the scale in terms of training advantage here.Now, onto your point about women and men performing comparably in the Olympics: thats great. How many of those women have actual or simulated combat experience? Bricks dont hit back and all that. Again, in this hypothetical, *all men* have decided women dont deserve rights. Combat is a much more stressful and fluid environment than competition, and men have done most of the fighting since time immemorial, including recent warfare.

Each idea deserves to be thought through and given a chanceI stand by the arguments I've made. Hobbes is the single philosopher who is the most influential on my own thinking. And collective action is the single area of philosophy I'm most familiar with.That being said, I do want to flag that feminism is another area of philosophy I'm relatively well versed in. And I agree with the other comments that suggest (or say) that the premise of your question betrays sexist assumptions. It seems like there are some subtle sexist attitudes baked into your way of thinking about this. This isn't an immoral thing, or likely even your fault. Our society also has underlying sexism that will leech into people's minds, even if they try to avoid it or excise it. I can't tell you what to do, but I would encourage you to think about that. Sometimes people come along and invite us to analyze and evaluate ourselves and find ways to do better. We all can stand to be better. If you do decide to reflect on this, here is where I would start: whenever there is a thought or discussion about men or women or gender, remember that women are human too. They have all the things that make men human. They have the same emotions, the same emotional capacity, the same intelligence, the same ability to make choices, the same ability to think through options and arrive at the best one, etc etc etc. While men and women can be different in some ways (mostly in the ways that they interact with society and society interacts with them), foundationally they have the same core. Ultimately, women are just people, just like men. I'm not making any assumptions about what is actually underlying your post here, what beliefs you have (conscious or not) but the way you have framed this sounds like the way a teenage boy with some subconscious sexism (picked up from society) would frame it. Because these beliefs may be subconscious, you may not realize you have them and you may be slightly offended that I would even suggest you do. That's ok and very normal. Those kinds of beliefs infect us all and it's uncomfortable to be confronted with that. But all of that makes them hard to access directly. That's why I suggested just adding something to your thinking whenever possible: women are human too, with all the things that come with that. If you take that seriously, over time, some of the deeply embedded beliefs might soften and change. But trying to find and pick at them directly won't work. Again, I can't tell you what to do and I wouldn't try. But please seriously consider what I'm saying here.

The median democratic voter is to the left of the median voter in the general election (and the median Republican voter is to the right). Because of this, the primaries dont necessarily self-select for the moderate candidates. For example, you may have a party running a few moderate candidates and one extremist candidates- the moderates collectively may have a majority in the primary, but because its split among several candidates the extremist wins with a plurality (see the 2016 Republican primaries where Trump won with a plurality in several states; see also the 2020 democratic parties when the moderates dropped out ahead of Super Tuesday to help prevent this scenario). Now, even though the extremist wasnt even necessarily the partys collective favorite choice, they still become the candidate and get the support of most voters in the party. In some circumstances, you may also end up with two candidates that are perceived as extremist (see 2024, where Kamala was perceived by many to be an extremist leftist). In this scenario, the extremist (Trump) doesnt need to move that far to the center or cater to moderate voters because they may already be perceived as the more moderate option. All the extremist needs to do is make voters believe that the other candidate is *even more extreme* (playing ads from Kamalas 2020 primary campaign, like the transgendered inmates clip, over and over again) and they will capture more of the moderate voters.","title":"U.S. Rep.

They make more money when we're all content and willing to spend money.  If MAGA starts pushing for changes that will create civil unrest, you can bet money on the fact that the greedy corporations will step in and start pulling sponsorships and donations.  Republicans work entirely for the upper class, after all (not to say the Democrats don't too, but they at least do more than just paying lip service to the lower class).Second, assuming american oligarchs don't step in to put a stop to civil unrest to save their profit margins, our country's populace is quite well armed.  The NRA driven gun humping ammosexuals like to talk a big game, but they actually make up the minority of gun owners in this country.  When people's rights to a free and fair election get threatened, those people will start to revolt.  (Which again, is bad news for our oligarchs, so if they haven't stepped in yet, they either will here or be throwing their wealth away).But anyways, as for Clinton, ya, she had multiple things working against her.  I didn't think of her loss as being due to misogyny at the time, but after 2024 I do wonder how much it played a part.I think you'd be surprised by how many people on the left are also misogynistic.  They don't say anything because unlike the far right, they're still capable of shame so they keep their opinions to themselves.  But I was asking around my social circles, and I fully understand this is anecdotal, but there was an alarming number of people that came up with every excuse to justify a Trump vote, then threw in a \\"And come on, a woman as president?!  Let's be serious here.\\" line in there too.I'm not saying it's the strongest reason she lost, but if everything else remained exactly the same I think a straight middle-aged white guy could have squeaked out a win over Trump.  I hate that we have to even consider that about this country, but we can't sit around and delude ourselves about it, people here have proven time and time again how bigoted they are, and it's not entirely relegated to only one side of the aisle.

I believe you are phrasing it the way you are, as if men bestow rights to women out of generosity as if they are gifts to be given because you don't want to face the reality that all people of all genders and races are born with innate rights, and if they lack rights, it is because others have taken their rights away. Why not phrase it like that? What you are saying is like saying white people gave black people the right to vote as a gift. \\"Blacks only have rights if white people agree to grant them rights.\\" Regardless of the truth of such a statement, it doesn't sound good to say white people are granting black people rights, as if they are gifts to bestow. It is more accurate to say white people stopped restricting the rights of blacks. Look at how the 15th Amendment is written:**Prohibits the denial** of?the right to vote?based on race, color or previous condition of servitude.Men prohibit the rights of women. Men don't grant women rights. If society so chooses, it would be not to prohibit the rights of women. I think it is a distinction you should reconsider.\\\\To the point of what power men have: that is only the status quo. Things change. Women could select for feminine traits in men, and men could evolve to be like women, and women could evolve to be like men in stature.

It just happens that there are more ideologies that require the subjugation of women. Like I said, only the creation of government and its initial structure requires broad consensus. Once formed, it will be relatively stable (for all the reasons described above). So, if society is created as a monarchy, it might change to a democracy or theocracy or whatever later, but the structure of government will persevere. So, to use Hobbes' own example, he thinks that a total, dictatorial monarchy is good (for reasons we won't get into) and so should be chosen. If there is a woman monarch, she should be able to remove rights from a large portion of the population, including men, and as long as she keeps the structures of law in place. In fact, the longest reigning monarch in world history was a woman and only recently diedAnd as a historical example, any feudal monarch who was a woman subjugated a ton of men (and women). But because the structures of law were in place, this subjugation largely continued and only changed slowly Even your Taliban example is some ~~been~~ men subjugating a lot of both men and women. Ultimately the world is complicated and very rarely breaks down on gendered lines as clearly as people might expect. Women have lead groups that take away rights, and men have done the same. The bonds that hold a group together in order to control another are law and the fear of devolution to violence and betrayalnot gender.","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"If that's true what is to be done","title":"The 15 Democrats Who Voted to Give Trump Insane New Powers"},{"text":"A picture is worth 1000 words.https://preview.redd.it/yy0sv6pz1e2e1.png?width=1229&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fa32f43ed1b7e2cf4b6c167ffd11293f49c900eThis explains in 1 chart the Democrats' motivation.","title":"Omg literally fascist Germany. /S is this what the left was afraid of?"},{"text":"And they have the audacity to say we play identity politics","title":"John Fetterman offers his office bathroom to Sarah McBride as she says shell follow GOP rules on restroom usage"},{"text":"Yes, but that only proves my point.

Because what you're talking about physical strength, but it's really a question of social norms and structure.?\\nFor instance, let's take the Inuits. Men would find it hard to suppress women's rights, because they were rarely around - famously, the men would go on months-long fishing expeditions.?\\nOr let's take the modern United States. Men can suppress some rights, but largely only those available to them based on the governmental structure. It would be extraordinarily hard, basically impossible, for men to suppress a right from all women but no men. It's happened - most recently with abortion, then with for instance owning a credit card until the 1970s (not getting into whether either of those is necessarily a fundamental human right on the level of speech, which is what we should really be talking about).?\\nIn the latter case, we changed the structure of the law so that credit card ownership couldn't be based on gender. In the former, I mean, I disagree with the Court's decision but they certainly wouldn't say they were stripping women of their rights.?\\nSo the big buffer the United States has - assuming you're correct and that guns aren't a corrective for physical strength - is diversity. It's not only unlikely, but functionally impossible for all men to agree on a concerted effort to strip all women of a given right, and to protect that through force. For one thing, men just won't agree as a consequence of partisanship. For another, women are too deeply ingrained in our society, their social roles too well-defined for all men, or even a quorum, to agree that women just don't have the right to peaceably assemble anymore.?\\nAfghanistan didn't have either of those.?\\nIs it theoretically possible for a supervillain to brainwash one gender in order to suppress the rights of the other? I guess so. And in that case, sure, I think it would be wiser for the supervillain to choose men for a bunch of reasons.

I'd argue never. be honest about it.how could anyone call the USA the \\"land of the free\\" when it was founded on land stolen from tens of millions of murdered indigenous people and then built up for hundreds of years by enslaved africans? what part of any of that was democratic? we're talking about nearly 400 years of racialized chattel slavery.I'm sure you've heard of jim crow laws? we live in a country that had legal, institutional apartheid until the 1960s! what part of any of that could be considered freedom? do you sincerely think we as a society have moved past all that, or that the state has ever put forth any good-faith efforts to remedy any of it?Members of the LGBTQ community are terribly persecuted in Russiajust as they are in the USA.do I need to point out the fucking batshit insane legislation that is being enacted all over the country against people who are not the gender they were assigned at birth? shit, soon enough, cisgender gay people are going to lose the right to get married once the supreme court (whose members are not elected btw - very democratic) has its say in the matter.There is alot of censorship in russia and freedom of speech is pretty much non existent there. Putin has his political opponents jailed, executed or exiled.the USA does the same shit. in fact, we've just made it easier to do!thanks to the (once again, unelected) supreme court, the president can never be charged with ANY crime if what they did falls under the incredibly vague category of \\"official duties.\\"shit, you don't even have to be a political opponent to be jailed or killed in the USA; you can be killed by the cops or beaten, charged with bullshit charges, and imprisoned just for the color of your skin.No fair elections.you think they're fair in the USA? you think voting here changes anything?we have the most gerrymandered voting maps imaginable.both parties are completely owned by their corporate donors. one party gets elected, then the other, then back to the other, ad nauseum, yet nothing fundamentally changes.we still don't have healthcare. economic inequality continues to worsen. housing, food, and education keep getting more and more unaffordable. both parties rubber stamp increased funding for the cops and the military. people here don't even have control of their own bodies!the DNC just decided to say \\"lol fuck a primary\\" and handed the candidacy to kamalocaust, a woman who had to drop out of the 2020 elections before the first primary because she was so unpopular.the DNC fucked bernie over in 2016 when all we, the citizens, wanted was some goddamn healthcare. we don't have a democracy or fair elections here. it's insane to assert that we do. it's all a facade, an illusion of choice.I just dont understand how someone can stand for both things. CMV I could go on, but I'd rather try to reframe the conversation... first, let me be clear - I do not support putin in any way. he's a violent thug and an oligarch. but, if I try to remain as unbiased as possible, I realize a few things: 1. every US president is much worse, and nobody in the USA has the right to act like our country is morally superior to anyone.the USA is the dominant global superpower. we have nearly 1000 military bases all over the world, which we use to invade sovereign countries and steal their natural resources, all while recklessly destroying the environment.every US president is complicit in this unbelievable violence. they're the commander-in-chief of the US military.russia has never even come close to the military or economic might of the USA, even at the very peak of the USSR.2. I can understand putin's precarious geopolitical situation.NATO was created solely to counteract the soviet union. this is not speculation, this is a fact. the soviet union fell over 30 years ago, and all its assets were sold at pennies on the dollar to private interests - btw this is the main source of russia's little oligarchy problem.anyway, the USSR is no more, yet NATO continues to exist. in fact, they've done nothing but expand since the early 1990s. why?the stated goal of NATO was to combat the USSR. if the USSR no longer exists, then why does NATO still have reason to exist?regardless, NATO expansion has forced russia into a corner. ukraine joining NATO has always been a line in the sand for russia. from their perspective, NATO poses an existential threat. not to mention the ukrainian state has been bombing its own citizens in parts of the country that are more sympathetic to russia for over a decade.what would you think if the situation were reversed? would you be ok with an antagonistic economic bloc with a military constantly encroaching upon your country's borders? think about this scenario - china, russia, north korea, venezuela, iran, cuba, and various other countries form an economic bloc and create a military to enforce it. they keep expanding all over the globe, and they want to add mexico to their cadre... would you be ok with this hypothetical group building military bases and stationing troops on the US/mexico border? I don't think you would like that very much. neither would the president of the USA. and I think that's totally understandable given the context.so, in the end, what's my point? I think calling yourself a 'patriot' means you want your country to be the greatest force for good in the world that it can be.if somebody said \\"I want the USA to actually live up to all the ideals it claims to represent, and maybe, in this scenario, that means the USA and its NATO puppets shouldn't be able to go invading and robbing other countries all over the world,\\" and so they support putin as the primary form of resistance to global NATO hegemony, could you really not understand that perspective?","title":"CMV: American patriots who sympathize with Putin are not actually patriots"},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 3:  **Refrain from accusing OP or anyone else of being unwilling to change their view, or of arguing in bad faith**.

Rights only exist in actuality insofar as a government grants AND enforces them through laws. All laws are compelled by physical force.Well, not exactly. Rights are necessary to enforce for man to live based on biological facts about man. You saw what happened in Venezuela? Or you see whats happening in Haiti? Or you seen the how the world population has changed historically? Thats what happens when you dont have a government to enforce rights. Murder and theft are still wrong (harmful to your life) regardless of whether the government enforces laws against murder and theft. A simple way to think of this view is, if the President convinced all men to kill all women, the women would be killed fairly quickly.So, I dont think this is the case. Because if men were that irrational or in denial of reality, then women would win. Rationality is more important to war and production than physical force. Though, what youre proposing is impossible because the more rational men would join the women and then trounce the male losers who decided to go through with it. And unrealistic scenarios arent helpful for learning about reality.And, if men want their rights secured, they need to secure the rights of all individuals. Your Middle East example is a good illustration. Yes, women have less rights than men there. But men also have less rights there than in a Western country. You wouldnt want to be there as a man or a woman.Women will always have rights as long as men decide to secure their own rights. The only way women will lose rights or not have their rights secured is enough men and women turn against their own rights or dont support their own rights.","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"Women also work in positions that operate guns, and if a war is starting, people will arm up.

No one person is so smart and so strong and so careful that any other person couldn't kill them if they tried hard enough. This seems true to me. Even the strongest smartest person ever has to sleep, and in an environment where there is no reason to work together, such a person is on their own. Even if you could get some people on your side, you would be susceptible to them turning against you in the same way. Ultimately, no person could guarantee their own safety in such a situation, even if they were the smartest and strongest and most careful person around.  \\nFor Hobbes, this state of affairs would make human life \\"nasty, brutish and short.\\"  \\nThus, the only solution is to come together, set some ground rules, and have a way to enforce them and punish those who break them. This is the only way, in his view, that we can have things like cooperation, trade, business, safety, society, or rights at all. But, because of the rough equality of humanity, the rules (or at least the structure for creating the rulesHobbes likes a monarchy, but that's beyond the point) need to be set in a way that is broadly consented to by most people. There is really no way for some subset to simply dictate the form of government, thus men and women, broadly, have to be involved in the creation of society, trade, business and rights.   \\nI say all of this not to suggest that societies have always valued women or that shall minorities have not run governments in various societies. I say all of this to argue that it is US as a collective that grants and takes rights to and from each other. Could any large group come together and deprive rights from others? sure, but the point is that, ultimately, rights aren't men's to give. They are the expression of the collective, at least originally.  \\nAnd keep in mind that there is no natural way to have \\"men\\" as a unit coalesce in this way to directly physically fight against women in the way you seem to imagine. Now that society does exist, there are rules in place. And systems in place to punish those who break the rules, including, physical attack. Sure, \\"men\\" as a collective could dismantle this, but doing so risks putting them back in a place where there are no rules, and it is every man for himself. This is one reason I think we find crime movies so exciting. When a group is operating outside the law already, there is nothing stopping them from cheating and stealing from each other, except, maybe, the collectively recognized power.  \\nUltimately, (1) men and women are more equal than you suppose because there is a rough equality for the purposes you care about; (2) rights arise from the collective, not some group of men alone that have graciously bestowed them on women; (3) even if men were to act in the way you describe (which, because of (1) and (2), is unlikely), there would be no force controlling them and preventing cheating, violence, and disloyalty (again, because of the rough equality of humanity), meaning that such a collective would dissolve into in-fighting.  \\nBasically, we are all in this together, whether we like it or not, and we ought to act like it.","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"Why wouldnt the weak men ally with the women?","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"Already done.

In other words, that of the men strong enough to either take or grant rights, all of them (or enough to enforce whatever decision was made) would have to all agree. This is further unlikelythe decision would be far from unanimous. So much smaller pool of men who are strong enough to impose their will on women, would not only have to be large enough to take on women, but would also have to be large enough to take on those women PLUS all the men who'd be standing on their side and ready to fight with them.

This brief remark encapsulates the Republican party's platform. Only *they* are entitled to \\"a say.\\" Only *they* are entitled to the god given rights afforded to them in the Constitution. *They* get to dictate your rights, and God have mercy if you have any \\"say\\" in the matter. This is a biological man trying to force himself into womens spaces, and Im not going to tolerate it. Im the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina. If some guy in a skirt came by and said, No, thats my achievement. Im going to be there and standing in the way and saying, Hell no. Im not going to allow men to erase women or womens rights.First of all, trans people statistically do not pose any risk to people in bathrooms and are instead far more at risk of being abused or harassed while trying to use facilities. Yet Republicans, and in typical fashion mind you, pretend like this issue is some widespread, inescapable epidemic.Think about how ego centric this is too. They're the victims at the center of a trans agenda thats oppressing *them,* \\"erasing their rights.\\" This isn't about the rights of trans persons, it's not even an effort to address which bathrooms should be reserved for the trans community, It's about *their* feelings, no one else's. It's about what kind of experience they're entitled to while using a public bathroom, and f*ck the feelings of the trans woman, this is about me me me.Someone should ask Mace, or any Republican congressman for that matter, to identify any cases of trans people harassing someone in a public bathroom. And you know what, for the sake of argument, let's say they do identify a case, It still doesn't mean that one incident is broadly representative of how all trans persons behave.What's particularly unnerving here is that Republicans like Mace just presume they will be tormented in public bathrooms by trans people, that they are under attack, that they are the victims here, when in reality, it's not only a presumption attempting to justify discriminatory policy, but it's people like McBride who are the actual victims of harassment in these scenarios.So Mace and her fearmongering coalition of bigots ignore or outright dismiss the fact that it's trans individuals who are much more likely to be hassled in public bathrooms, while Republicans like Nancy are the actual enablers of that harassment, and they're basically resorting to a form of victim blaming.These Republicans just suspect that trans people prioritize using bathrooms to make others feel uncomfortable, that whenever a trans individual uses a public bathroom, it's, first and foremost, for the purpose of provoking others. Instead of the fact that, you know, they're just there to do their own business, and mind their own business for that matter, just like most people who use the public restroom.Republicans presume a whole lot about the LGBTQ community. And most of it is rooted in their own insecurities, their prejudices, their hate. So they pass laws to validate these feelings. If it's written into law, it becomes an official acknowledgement. If there's a law prohibiting Sarah McBride from using the women's bathroom, it must be for a reason. And now that reason becomes a reality for them.While make no mistake, this is only one step away from Republican men refusing to share a bathroom with people like McBride. Which is one step away from either banning her from using public bathrooms altogether, or designating a bathroom strictly for people like McBride. You know, just like how bathrooms were segregated a century ago.This is what Republicans do, they incessantly vilify out-groups, foreigners, gay and trans people, \\"the other,\\" so that they can create scapegoats and boogeymen. Then these scapegoats and boogeymen become the targets of their outrage, their hate, their blame, their grievances, their discrimination and ultimately, their legislative efforts. And all of these things are part of a kind of feedback loop.Their fears, their hate, their hostility towards these groups, and the misinformation and propaganda they generate, help them justify the legislation they pass, and that legislation helps reinforce their fears and contempt for those groups even more, which then strengthens their case for more discriminatory and suppressive measures, and around and around it goes.","title":"John Fetterman offers his office bathroom to Sarah McBride as she says shell follow GOP rules on restroom usage"},{"text":"and every normal person who thinks what you are suggesting is deranged.\\nYou should learn the difference between normative arguments and descriptive arguments and respond accordingly: namely not being rude and hostile based on not understanding the difference.","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"u/mateo_yo Won't give an intellectually honest reply regarding the US State breaking contract/expanding NATO Eastward.

Putin sucks and deserves anything bad coming to him. If anyone is actually full-on on Russia's side in this war, they're no patriot. However, the problem that many on the right have with this war is the increasing threat of the war including NATO and the US and that the current administration appears to be helping Ukraine more than their own citizens. Billions of dollars have been sent to Ukraine, which isn't good, but is made even worse when the US has been experiencing problems that should've took priority. To add to this, Biden is now allowing Ukraine to use US missiles. Not only is it ignoring problems going on in the US, but it's also bringing us way closer to war with Russia. The right, and most people in the US, for that matter, want to avoid that at all costs.I'll admit, the right does take some of the anti-war stuff a bit far.

Russias decision to go to war over perceived threats doesnt make it justified, especially since Ukraine was not an imminent threat to Russia. The idea that states only act on interests ignores the international norms that have reduced global conflicts over the last few decades by prioritizing respect for borders and sovereignty.As for Ukraine being a threat to Russia, the reality is that Ukraine posed no offensive military threat - it was Russia who made it a threat by invading in 2014 and escalating in 2022. Ukraines pursuit of military ties was a response to that aggression, not the cause. Seeking military ties with the West doesnt justify war any more than Canada or Mexico having military ties with the U.S. threatens Russia. The real destabilizer here isnt Ukraines aspirations; its Russias willingness to violate international law and use war as a tool of foreign policy. Capitulation would only embolden further aggression, not end it. If we stop supporting Ukraines defense, the precedent we set will make the world far more dangerous for everyone.","title":"CMV: American patriots who sympathize with Putin are not actually patriots"},{"text":"Sometimes that is the choice, you have to choose between two bad options and if you don't support the less bad option, you get the worse option.It's not unreasonable to think that if Putin were ousted from power there would be chaos and bad actors could take advantage of that chaos.

In that case, it's clearly patriotic to support Putin.","title":"CMV: American patriots who sympathize with Putin are not actually patriots"},{"text":"So, America has a long history of supporting (and by support i mean actually give weapons and aid to) dictators and warlords who aren't aligned with us ideologically or share any of our values.The politicians, CIA agents, and contractors providing this support, even if you don't like them, (i dont either) are often motivated by *intense* patriotism. They want to protect their vision of America, even at the cost of aligning with dictators and warlords who share *none* of our values if they think it will be for the greater good of their own nation.There have been American pariots who have shown far more support for dictators in South America and Asia than any American has ever shown Putin. I'm not *happy* about any of this, but that's just our nations history.","title":"CMV: American patriots who sympathize with Putin are not actually patriots"},{"text":"I would agree with you in terms of the small minority that I see actually supporting Putin. I see lots more others making pretty valid arguments that boil down to either \\"the west started it\\" or \\"we're spending too much\\", while acknowledging that Putin is still a bad guy. I've only ever seen fringe radicals like white nationalists, talk kindly about Putin, since they see Russia as some kind of white ethnostate. Those people are obviously not patriots, and are definitely pieces of shit. The people I hear a lot more of, make some pretty sensible points. The biggest one is people pointing out the cost, or the likely corruption surrounding the cost. It's hard to imagine that there isn't some money disappearing because of corruption, and the cost is extremely high, so you can agree of disagree if it's worth it, but that's definitely a valid argument. The other pretty reasonable argument is that the west have actually been aggressors. Think back to the cuban missile crisis. We almost blew up the world because the USSR was planning to put nuclear missiles right on the US border in Cuba. That seems pretty unacceptable to most Americans, but somehow nobody considers that they only did that AFTER the US put their nuclear missiles in Turkey, right on Russia's border. How would anyone think that if it's not okay for them, it would be okay for us? The US was the clear instigator there. Then, NATO membership has slowly encircled Russia, bordering Russia from 4 countries. It's pretty obvious that the US didn't do that because it desperately needed the military support of Estonia and Latvia. That was a slow aggressive play against Russia. One more argument that I thought sounded ridiculous when I first heard it, but it's actually at least somewhat true, is the idea that Russia is fighting Nazis in Ukraine. It sounds absurd, but it's at least partially true. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov\\\\_Brigade) \\"The unit has drawn controversy over its early and allegedly continuing association with?[far-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics_in_Ukraine)?groups and?[neo-Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism)?ideology,[^(\\\\[15\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Brigade#cite_note-sources_neo-Nazi-18)?its use of controversial symbols linked to?[Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism)\\". Ukraine literally has soldiers walking around with swastikas, obviously not all or most, but it's surprising that they accept any amount. There's a saying about if you find out you have one nazi at a dinner for 6, and the dinner continues, then you have 6 nazis. I'm definitely not denying that Russia has done plenty of terrible things, and had made a bunch of aggressive moves of their own. I don't support Putin, and I think he's in the wrong in this war, but I'm just saying that there are some reasonable arguments on the other side. You shouldn't think of this in black and white terms as if everyone critical of the war must just love Putin. There's definitely some grey area here.","title":"CMV: American patriots who sympathize with Putin are not actually patriots"},{"text":"They should all need to voted out of office.","title":"The 15 Democrats Who Voted to Give Trump Insane New Powers"},{"text":"We need a strong narrative and ways to champion liberalism that fit into a story that is easy for people to understandPeople understand the story of Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, JFKWe don't have that anymore.

From your own link, though:While more viable political parties can improve electoral competition, dampen polarization and provide greater opportunities for marginalizing extremist movements, they also risk fragmentation: a phenomenon where too great a number of parties produce overly broad and fractious coalitions.\\nA good way I've seen it explained is the following. In a two party system: if you pander to an extremist, you gain one vote (+1), and your opponent loses zero votes (+0)\\nIf you pander to a moderate, you gain one vote (+1), and your opponent loses one vote (+1)Therefore there are strong incentives to pander at least in part to the moderate block, since parties can't affort to lose those voters.

Because nations and countries?consist of people, they also have changeability as their nature. When they begin to lose it, or when it begins to produce too defective changes (\\\\~not energy efficient) they begin to die/reborn.USA, melting pot of humanity, was created by record-breaking?changeability. During history there were no times/places when generations had been more different from each other than in the USA of 1900-2020s.&amp;#x200B;But because of a chain of events, USA changeability became defective (producing contradictions).Foremost by biggest USA blunder in its history, second only to industrialization of USSR, by ban of soviet?criticism?during Nuremberg?Trials.In 1945 year USA had enormous?chance to reaffirm own commitment to truth and publicity by sharing enormous weight of USSR-related risks with World by full disclosure of all trues about?USSR.But by absolute shortsightedness, USA politicians took the first step towards USA fall?- they start to copy USSR censorship, paternalism, and sociopathic utilitarianism.In the 1960s all of this evolved into the main USA poison - Political Realism, separation of morality from politics (main reason of cultural problems), and politics from economics (main reason of economic problems as result of trade with autocratic regimes).&amp;#x200B;Remember when I said that USA was created by enormous changeability of melting pot of humanity? This melting pot function by the most long-term strategies/goals which could exist, Western values: Rational Humanism, Secularism, Rule of Law, Democracy, Freedoms, foremost Freedom of Speech (low information transaction costs. Which at the same rise variety and reduce fear of unknown.When USA separated morality from politics, and politics from economics, it also suppressed Western values and own changeability. Creating such disharmonious waves as Kissinger, NeoCon, Reagan, George Bush and so on, which made nature of USA changeability more chaotic, xenophobic, past-centric. Contradictory (including by social decisions).Up to recent... Let's name it phase transition.&amp;#x200B;Modern USA reached a critical point when its changeability became too different from the USA/West fundamental?values to bear useful fruit.\\"Old USA\\" is dying (on most level except monetary, but as I already?said, countries consist of people, and people not consist from money, people use money as tools for more important?for them sociocultural?goals, but no more).Which good (in same historical sense as it was with Rome Empire or \\"Old Order\\") because it is a chance for the USA to be reforged to something more actual. Without issues that gradually oversaturate USA by contradictions.And due to Trump \\"Old USA\\" is dying?very fast.Which also very good because USA received chance to be reforging before times with much more dangerous technologies, more nukes among totalitarian regimes, and much older/conservative/conformist population.&amp;#x200B;What if USA won't be able to be reforged into something?new?In long-term perspective it also not very bad for the World because USA will be replaced by something completely new, as the USA in its own time replaced the British Empire.In 1920-1990s USA melting pot mixed almost everything that could be mixed and spread it through globalization (which also attracted into USA melting pot the World's worst) to everyone else.Right now most World's countries, at least socioculturally, essentially?USA children.And if USA will not be able to cope with its Political Realism (alienation of the USA fundamental values) illness - most likely USA children, by \\"necessity is a very good teacher\\" principle, will be able partly or fully replace USA.

More than anything what stands out to me is how many people's perception is simply off, and has to be corrected even before we ask them to make difficult political sacrifices for the long-term benefit of the country and the world.I think part of the issue here is that people's views on the world are calibrated poorly. Not *their fault*, but human nature. The average American was born in a world post WW2, where a lot of the Great Issues have been (relatively) solved. Sure there's still scary threats of war and disease and other issues but it's *nothing* like the past. The Spanish Flu despite occuring in a world with a much smaller population killed more than 5 times (maybe even more than 10 times!) the amount Covid did. Overall there's less wars and what does remain seems to be less deadly. But we don't calibrate off the lives of those times we never lived, we calibrate off the world *we grow up with* now. They don't understand the insane progress humanity and the US has made because when they look back they don't see the 100 years ago. We live in the most prosperous era ever (at least, so far). People will complain about food prices when (relative to income) it's cheaper than ever. And when was the last time a major famine happened in a first world nation? Even the poorest of the poor families can get food pretty easily from SNAP or food banks. I've met poor rural families who have *virtual reality systems* like PSVR or the Quest, literal sci fi devices unimaginable 50 years ago. Van Gogh was given multiple times the average pay of a factory worker in his era for free by his brother and he still drove himself poor because of how expensive art supplies were. Now they're so cheap that little kids all around the world have art classes and finger drawing.When you exclude the housing crisis, a largely artificial problem caused by zoning and restrictions then even many of the poorest Americans live a better life than many kings and queens of the past. Abundant food from all around the world even out of season, entertainment on demand (why have one royal jester when there's millions on your TV and phone?), personal high speed travel, air conditioning, all sorts of science fiction technologies and healthcare far more advanced than any of their shamans or spiritual healers could do.","title":"Why Donald Trump's Victory is Bad for the US and the World"},{"text":"Ukraine didn't join NATO when Russia invaded for the first time in 2014.

OR is it just a wise prediction based on technologies that work in theory? Because right now we *don't* know how to automate most things, but we *trust* that we will in the coming years and decades.Yes, if replicator technology was available as something anyone could own or have access too, the government would have a hard time keeping it to themselves. Nothing about this implies anything even remotely like a replicator. \\"Fully automated economy\\" does not mean a magic black box in room that can churn out anything with the press of a button. What it means is a complex system of supply chains and interdependent jobs (so basically just a modern economy), but with machines doing every step. Now, I *do* also think a universal printer like that is feasible, but that has absolutely nothing to do with automation or even post scarcity, that's just a bonus convenience that relies on technology more akin to modern 3d printing than anything vaguely resembling automation, and both still require a supply chain (well, maybe the printer doesn't *need* one, but having to refine every material you need as a pain and would take *even more* compact, cheap tech we don't currently have).But in the real world, it takes resources to make things. If it costs money and resources to maintain the automation, that means those money and resources have to come from somewhere. That means people with the money will run those facilities, because only they can fund them. That also means, they still get to charge for the products. I don't think you understand (which is understandable, people have a hard time grasping what true automation actually means). Nowhere did I ever mention violating thermodynamics or not needing resources. And yes, they do need to come from somewhere, which is why automated mining and power plants would be pretty nifty. As every machine has a machine that makes it's parts, and parts are standardized to be useful for many things, which AIs are in charge of sorting out and distributing to various stores after receiving the materials for those parts from an automated refinery which got them from an automated mine, transported by automated vehicles on roads built automatically, designed by AIs which were built by robots and designed by other AIs... You get the picture, that's how economies work right now anyway, it's almost a chicken or the egg paradox since it's all self sustaining and self contained, every job facilitates another job, so rather than a chain leading down from a human to various robots, it's a closed web or \\"ecosystem\\" of robots that don't need human intervention aside from very basic direction like \\"we need you to design a new farming machine with such and such parameters\\", or in the \\"near term\\" more like presenting a complete design or at least basic scientific discoveries and technologies and saying \\"design a machine based on these requirements and with these technologies\\" or even just \\"make more of this machine we designed\\", which could be designed by people volunteering for that job in exchange for *extra* income on top of what they already get from the economy functioning without them.And if it's so inevitable that people will force governments to do the right thing, why aren't we already in a free and loving society unplagued by corruption? It's not like after the French Revolution no one in France ever died in poverty again, or no French politician ever did anything wrong from then onward.I'm not saying it will solve all corruption, but it'll fix the automation issue for a great long time until somewhere it starts being a problem again as corporations or similar entities start getting too much power and the public accepts it at first since it's been many generations, then the cycle repeats but likely not as bad as the first time, and so on. And right now we're not at that level of desperation, most people are still middle class and not left starving in the streets. And in countries where that *is* the case, there's not really much that can be done right now as far as I understand it.","title":"CMV: Automation can only be a good thing."},{"text":"My Rep (Sylvia Garcia) didnt vote for it thankfully.","title":"The 15 Democrats Who Voted to Give Trump Insane New Powers"},{"text":"Are traditional American values really based around equality, democracy, diversity etc..?\\nOur country was built through slavery, the vote was originally limited to landholding white men, until the last century if you werent English or German/Scandinavian you werent even considered white even if you were European, to say nothing of minorities.

Absolutely pivotal stuff.    \\nI think, on a broader note, going over *how radically world and American history, both, have changed* is something we can't have enough of.   \\nWith plenty of more room to grow, of course, but it's fairly humbling and sobering both, to think about.1\\\\. Not particularly, but that's also due to my political mentor, who I think would have found the recent results faintly amusing (we shared a similarly gloomy sense of humour). Not amusing in a *fun* way, of course, but - so it goes.   What I do think is that there are an *incredible* amount of people who simply *don't* think. For some it is because of entrenched beliefs, sexism. But I think you can find even people whose actions are mostly good, who will - if left to their own devices - often return to a baseline of being... Don't know how to put this, mildly-to-severely sexist/racist.I'd also add that *scepticism* of power and institutions is more often directed at women then men, for many reasons; it's acceptable, they are perceived to be 'soft' targets, and it can 'earn respect' with others who feel similarly or are unaligned.2\\\\. Listen, quite honestly. I only bloviate online, and mostly just nod sombrely offline, bahahaha!.. More seriously, though, I think the most important thing is being *willing to confront friends and family.* We often let those we care for and love have more wriggle room, *because* we care for and love them. But those are precisely the kinds of people, when we are in an environment where it is safe to stand up to them, it is vital that we do so. Even if the metaphorical man in question didn't mean it, he does good work; even if the metaphorical woman in question couldn't mean it, she has had similar struggles, it was just a moment that 'slipped out.'   \\nDefending our candidates and colleagues from people we care for is often the most difficult, and most important task I think we have.3\\\\. This doesn't feel old to me, but I suppose it counts as old, now. There exists a certain candidate who has been repeatedly attacked for being stiff, practised, and cold. This candidate also was emblematic to many of certain political strands and tendencies - really, *any,* because it became fait accompli to place any position the person didn't like on her. And when people learned about her or interacted with her, they were often shocked - and then *angry,* at *her.*  Where was the punchy, fiery, amused woman they'd seen? Why wasn't *she* campaigning, she'd win a billion votes!Obviously, I'm talking about Hillary Clinton.   \\nBut I don't think there are many, even here, [who really remember](https://fair.org/extra/the-media-factor-behind-the-hillary-factor/) how far this goes.     \\nAttacks at the time were absolutely abominable.   \\nConspiracy theories about Clinton using security detachments to retrieve tampons, everything cartoonishly evil you could imagine.I often wonder if many of her critics would have been able to handle the amount of horrible materiel thrown her way with a fraction of the dignity.  \\nAnd of course, these attacks are hardly new for women in politics, those in our party and otherwise;   \\nShe is just a perfect high-profile example, and one that's important because many people *continue* to hate her, to this day, and get weirdly defensive without being able to label the exact reason why.None should have to instantly like a politician or a person; but I think it takes great strength and moral character to look at oneself in the mirror, ask 'hey, are my opinions just as vulnerable to mass politics as anyone else's?' and come back a little more humbled, and more aware.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 21, 2024"},{"text":"But they need to actually mostly endorse democratic candidates.

And the ones we do lose on that front, I bet we gain a few MAGA women and increased turnout because of the excitement.Clinton lost because of Comey and Putin. I'm well aware that she didn't campaign in Wisconsin and that she had likeability issues and all the rest of it. But I'm convinced beyond doubt she would have been the 45th president of the United States had those two jackasses hadn't done what they did. In fact, it looks to me like Trump's brand of politics isn't *quite* popular enough to win reliably. Not without a strong tailwind. He got that from Comey and Putin in 2016 and won. He didn't have that in 2020 and he lost. But he got it again in the form of post-pandemic inflation this cycle. My worst fear isn't that he or others like him run again in the future. It's that he'll do enough damage in the next four years that it will end free and fair elections and they'll have established a de facto minority rule.","title":"Democrats, Its Time to Say Goodbye to Our Neoliberal Era"},{"text":"Where did they blame anyone for anything?","title":"Democrats Need to Stop Defending a Broken Democratic System"},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 5:  **Comments must contribute meaningfully to the conversation**.

Five years ago, all of my claims were based on simple observations. They had absolutely nothing to do with the Bible or Christianity. In fact, in my September 2019 Reddit post about the time difference, it was another user who informed me of Matthew 24:22.In regard to the Mandela Effect, context is everything. For the anatomy changes to make sense, you don't need the time difference. But the reverse is not true: For the time difference to make sense, you ABSOLUTELY need the anatomy changes (since things like track and field records are the same on Earth and Bozrah, which is mainly due to the differences in human anatomy). But lo and behold, I discovered the anatomy changes BEFORE I discovered the time difference! I discovered the anatomy changes in August 2019 and the time difference in September 2019. That matters a great deal, because it's not as if I discovered the time difference first and then desperately tried to figure out why sports records were the same on both planets.And by the way, all of that biblical stuff that you see on the 812info.com Reddit page was written just last year (2023).

I remember how Obama deported more immigrants than Trumps first term. I remember Biden saying you aint black when asked about why he deserved the vote from communities of color.The assumption people have of democrats is that theyre opportunists whose moral stances are driven by a small but loud wing of young activists who eventually shame them into lip service. Better than republicans does not suddenly make democrats seem like they actually care about peopleLike I said, the problem is that your average working class person currently feels more marginalized economically than ever before. That includes gay and trans people, black and brown people, immigrants etc. These identities are all part of the working class that feels like theyre suffering from pretty bad economic problems that are neglected in narratives of marginalization and empathy that dont involve alleviating those economic woes.People of color dont just want better history in schools. They want to know their tax dollars are going to improving their material standing, and if they dont have that confidence in government, theyll ask for them back.The argument Republicans have been making more and more is that their economic stances will do more for those marginalized groups because theyll have a fairer chance to compete, while Democrats are using the appearance of supporting marginalized groups to keep an economic system working for only their elite selves It works because democrats simply do not have the trust they expect people to give them, and theyre not articulating why they should. They should not be relying on a narrative made decades ago that people have seen lots of counter examples to.","title":"Trans People Shouldnt Be Scapegoated for Democrats Failures - Politicians and pundits are stoking a backlash to trans rights in the wake of the election.

This marked the start of Crimea being part of Russian-controlled territory for more than a century.Soviet Era: After the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the subsequent civil war, Crimea became part of Soviet Russia as the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. During World War II, Stalin deported the Crimean Tatars en masse, accusing them of collaborating with the Nazis, which drastically altered the regions demographics. Transfer to Ukraine: In 1954, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. At the time, both were part of the Soviet Union, so the transfer was more administrative than geopolitical. When the USSR dissolved in 1991, Crimea became part of the newly independent Ukraine.In summary, Russia controlled Crimea for a significant period before Ukraine, particularly during the Russian Empire and early Soviet eras. However, the 1954 transfer established Crimea as part of Ukraine, which remains the basis for Ukraines claim today.","title":"Tax Dollars to Ukraine"},{"text":"Institutions are only as strong as the people you put in them.
