I suppose technically we could be *under*estimating the presence of conservatives in the dataset, but looking at the results I don't think that's the case. We have tons of liberals, that's very clear looking at their voting patterns. * We are conducting an adaptive survey, where all voter comments are fed back in and voted on. The actual product we are building conducts an adaptive search; it's not a simple poll, it's also attempting to do MAB optimization. The problem we're trying to solve more generally is how to conduct votes on enormous ballots. You can't have everyone vote on 157,000 items, that doesn't scale. * Do you mean \\"canary\\"? I'm not sure what it is you want to establish. We're very confident they are human, which is our actual long-term goal metric.* Disqualifying criteria are established as a bulk property. Supermajority polling means that up to one third of your participants can be disqualified without affecting results as a majority indicator. This is, in fact, the core concept of our website: Noisy polling incorporating the ideas of Byzantine fault tolerance. The long term technical goal is to be able to remain a robust indicator of human opinion under heavy attack by robots, we model polling error as adversarial noise.* Our baseline algorithms were tested using the [Open Discussion.](https://agreedupon.solutions/participate/badca59a-0c0d-4378-950f-d76276a4b811-02713b4db8) Participants were recruited through online advertisements, whose reported metrics indicated a good mix of demographic representation. Data was collected more slowly, over a period of months, making it not subject to the bias of a single-day voting drive. Statements were collected in an open ended manner, which gave us a diverse sample of 139 comments, from political comments to offhand remarks to spam. Our search method separated out the outright spam comments quickly enough to satisfy our product goals, and high-agreeability opinions onsite were found to have strong agreeability during in-person interviews. We have a similar sample (although smaller) for the Every Thing poll, which we will be analyzing as part of our continuing work. No targeting of any kind was applied other than \\"United States\\" and \\"English\\" during our Every Thing testing.* Those checks having passed, presenting to this subreddit is the next of our evaluation passes. You have not said anything that makes me think we've reached a fundamentally incorrect conclusion. A quick Google search indicates that government housing support has [majority approval generally](https://endhomelessness.org/media/press-releases/new-polling-shows-americans-hold-elected-leaders-at-all-levels-accountable-for-solving-the-nations-homelessness-crisis/), so it makes sense that a majority liberal sample group would also support this.* If you want the bit of signal that has (informally) really stood out for us, it's restrictions on advertising. Would you be more or less likely to support a candidate who wanted more restrictions on the kind of data Facebook and Google could collect about you and use for advertising? We weren't able to find anyone in person who would support them less.","title":"Agreed Upon Solutions: The Freelance Democracy"},{"text":"Democrats need to change their rules.

The Piedmont wetlands for example have been developed on so much, and it's especially tragic given how biodiverse that area is. Things like the bog turtles and eastern coral snake and white irisette.  We've likely lost a whole lot of things that we don't even know about because they got paved over before any biologist got a look at the area.And some of this stuff just doesn't exist anywhere else. The Venus Fly Trap exists pretty much entirely within a small radius around Wilmington NC. Luckily that plant isn't endangered (but it is listed as vulnerable) but there's some **really rare** stuff that has been snuffed out forever because it just didn't exist anywhere else.The issue is that they're fucked up in implementation, especially thanks to all the other bullshit planning and zoning rules. What's the point of any sort of environmental review when you force everyone to have huge parking lots and massive SFH sprawl? The single best thing we can do for the environment is to stop encroaching on it as much and densify. And environmental rules often just get used as a weapon to delay and attack construction. There's no reason for a long drawn out process to replace a parking lot with an apartment complex.Edit:like here's a bit on the white [irisette I mentioned above](https://saveplants.org/plant-profile/7705/Sisyrinchium-dichotomum/Reflexed-Blue-eyed-grass/) (also known as Reflexed Blue-eyed-grass) This species is a narrow endemic found only at four sites in the upper piedmont region of North Carolina. These populations are extremely threatened. Two of them are within highway rights-of-way and another is in an area that was planned for residential development by the private owners. This last population is sadly the largest containing about a thousand plants. One of the populations is on public land maintained by the NCDOT which may be this species only hope of survival. The more we do car centric SFH sprawl, the more and more areas that get developed on. We need to densify and minimize the harm done to species like this. The best environmental rule we could ever do is to tell zoning to fuck off.","title":"Dems going after trans people this week should be ashamed of themselves"},{"text":"Welcome ??","title":"I use to be a democrat"},{"text":"The US educational system has been whittled away for decades, particularly in lower socioeconomic areas.

But women suffered in silence for the future. Same with public education for girls. Girls didnt have rights to education until the late sixties. By that I mean parents didnt have to send the girls to school at all. We were bullied, beat up and called a waste of space. Our mothers made us go for the future. I was lucky because when I asked what a homosexual was when I was around six years old, mom said, when two women or two men fall in love with each other. No one remembers what thirty year old women look like after ten pregnancies with six living children. Or the orphans when their mothers died in childbirth after her sixth child is born. Husbands of the same age feeling like a failure because the responsibility of such a large family is unmanageable. Women believed if we could control how many and when to have children they would survive childhood and prosper. And they did. The fascism movement in North America has been strong since 1880, their plan is to cull as many women and children as they can. The only way we can fight fascism and their mission statement project 2025 is living wages all benefits a living income retirement, safe food water and working conditions. Today I read first order of business for the fascism party is no social security for people already receiving pension benefits from their unions. Believe me when I say we need more than social security to retire. The fascism plan is poverty and human trafficking and medical cruelties against women and children. Crime against humanity is just that. We have supported other democracies fighting crimes against humanity. People think civil war is a solution. But our military cannot invade a state. But other countries can, for crimes against humanity. The fascism ideology does not need civilians or voters to stay in power. Women voted in a fascism government in their state executive branch. Women voted in a fascism ideology in a republic democracy ideology. As women and the men that support them we need to know why women voted against the future and all children.

Im perfectly comfortable with theories of war, just wars, and property rights. Im a a Christian and a libertarian after all. Wars are fought. This is a truism we can both agree on. Wars are lost, also a truism. Sometimes instead of prolonging a war its better to accept a conditional loss than to continue it (at a high cost to human life or risking an absolute loss, Sun Tzu , Laozi, and Machiavelli would agree with this) This seems to be where we diverge.Simply because something is just doesnt mean that it is the best course of action in any given circumstance. For example, if you are mugged walking down the street by 3 men with guns and they demand your wallet, you are perfectly justified in fighting back and killing these men if they persist. However, if you are unarmed and alone that is not the correct course of action. I believe you agree with this.When looking at the Ukraine war we must use our best judgment. Is Ukraine justified in defending itself? Yes, absolutely. But also, from our third party perspective we must consider, does continuing to escalate the war risk planetary nuclear annihilation? Does it risk an untold number of Ukrainian boys dying ultimately for marginal territorial retainment? Does it truly benefit us at all?My comment is ultimately dismissing the entire context of the Ukraine War too but thats a whole other discussion. Id suggest you preorder the great Scott Hortons upcoming book Provoked: How Washington Started the New Cold War with Russia and the Catastrophe in Ukraine if youre at all interested in that.

Democrats were dealt a bad hand this term, but they also played it abysmally. Whether in hindsight or not, Pelosi is right. Biden's decision to run for reelection all but guaranteed an uphill battle Voter turnout stayed consistent for Trump this election, the same cannot be said for Democrats. The why is something that the party will need to deeply reflect on.Walter Lippman, one of America's most influential journalists, who had the ear of presidents, called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" almost a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever. He argued that Americans don't make politically informed decisions, and that's what happened this election, Americans let their *feelings* decide the outcome. The onus was on Democrats, not Republicans, to help Americans make those politically informed decisions, however unfair that may seem.So Democrats have to take some of the blame. But first, yes, Biden was supposed to be a transitional president. His decision to run for re-election put democrats in a very tough spot. He was also tasked with overseeing an economic recovery and his admin was blamed for the fallout that followed the pandemic.In fact, an economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped into office and oversaw an economic recovery. Republicans exploited these situations for political gain.It was particularly effective this time because, unfortunately, many Americans care more about their immediate circumstances than they do any \\"threat to democracy.\\"What's more, American voters tend to have short memories and a large swath of low propensity voters are who decide our elections. Many of them don't tune in until they're being inundated with political messaging months leading up to an election. And that messaging is excessively sensational, propagandistic, misleading, deceptive, partisan, heavily distorted etc.And this is, in large part, because, as studies consistently show, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda and lies travel farther and faster, reaching wider audiences. The truth receives far less engagement I'll be willing to concede that this type of messaging comes from both parties, but it's Republicans who disproportionately benefit from it.Combine this with the fact that incumbent leaders around the globe were facing political challenges due to world wide economic tensions, and it becomes obvious that this was always going to be an uphill battle.Add Kamala Harris being shoehorned in at the last minute, and you've got yourself a recipe for an election loss What's really frustrating is that Donald Trump is going to be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. One he'll surely take credit for *again*. The only consolation is that Joe Biden's presidency will act as a sort of stop gap effort, sandwiched in between two Trump presidencies. Two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.Trump's loss to Biden in 2020 was of necessity. The beginning of a return back to normalcy, and it could very well set up obstacles for Republicans that would not have been put in place otherwiseYes, Democrats would have had a much better shot had Biden refused to run for a second term, but what was done was done. And after Biden stepped down, Democrats continued to blunderWhile they failed to take into account how Americans care more about their immediate circumstances, how they have short memories and show disinterest or lack of concern for political nuance, they also failed to articulate a message that should have emphasized, above all else, Trump's poor economic and foreign policy record.Inflation and economic issues were the key drivers this election, and while many Americans tend to think in black and white terms, e.g. \\"when inflation/economy bad, it must be the fault of whoever is in power,\\" it still would have benefitted Democrats if they prioritized, above all else, the message that Trump was *not* better for the economy and his economic policies for his next term are even more potentially damaging.Voters cared far more about this than they did about Trump as a threat to core Democratic values.But the national debt ballooned under Trump.He instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. He pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His admin took actions to that made it more difficult for workers to unionize, and for unions to operate effectively.He championed tax cut legislation that is estimated to cost the govt trillions (while Republicans bragged that it would pay for itself), and these tax cuts permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations. Trump and his Republican allies preserved a GOP agenda that has been hamstringing the labor movement, redistributing wealth to the top, safeguarding a broken tax code, promoting corporate profit-mongering and personhood, prioritizing rich/special interests, cultivating an economic culture of greed and profligacy, and widening the wealth gap, among other things, for *decades**All of these things contributed to inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the Biden administration*Trump's foreign policy record was a disaster too. He weakened our alliances, escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our ability to act as peace brokers, withdrew from the working non-proliferation agreement with Iran, emboldened Putin's autocratic agenda, aided his proxy wars and aligned himself with Putin's goals, cozied up to dictators around the globe, dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone, forced Congress to pass not one, but two historical war powers resolutions, abandoned our Kurdish allies, negotiated with terrorists and the list goes on and on.On immigration, Democrats weren't going to reach through to anyone cheering on mass deportations, but Trump tanking the bipartisan border deal should have been emphasized more along with how Republicans prefer to run on immigration as a wedge issue, stoking fears and appealing to grievances while proposing extreme, non viable \\"solutions\\" instead of more practical, economically considerate, humane ones.Most Americans don't know this stuff. And, yeah, maybe they don't care as long as they're paying more for groceries and gas, while believing that whoever's in charge is responsible for higher prices, but even if this is the case, you at least try to convince them otherwise.And if Harris was ever going to have a shot, despite rolling in at the last minute, her campaign was going to have to articulate these points, emphasize them over and over again, so that those low propensity voters might get the picture.In the end, there were a multitude of factors working against democrats, they also likely miscalculated how some voters just weren't willing to vote for a woman considering the alternative was a perceived strongman, especially during a period where a movement and \\"crisis of masculinity\\" is on the rise. Walter Lippman was right a century ago, and he's still right today. The general public *is* an irrational force. He argued that voters don't make politically informed decisions. Well, they're especially not making politically informed decisions if you're not *informing* them. So instead, they're voting based on feelings, and that's what won Trump this election, *feelings.*","title":"Nancy Pelosi says Kamala Harris should have faced a primary contest to succeed Biden"},{"text":"I did.

His point is basically that if I complain about other migrants than that is unequal. (Very typical critical racial theoretical style of thinking). I also have been told repeatedly by workers in the system that \\"the reason why I came does not make me special\\" (I have presented how am I going to archieve legal residency once I arrived) and \\"you can't say that you are better than other migrants\\" (despite my grades in school can slap all of their faces, and I have never skipped school to work illegally like my \\"peers\\" do)7. My friend who is an activist, came as an adult to seek asylum (also in CA), he did a lot of work. One of his works is stopped an attack on US soil by translating the crime trailer by a CCP-supporter. 8. My friend came by plane, when he applied for bail from immigration jail. The judge rejected him because he did not crossed the border illegally, by law he is not an \\"illegal alien\\", therefore he has no jurisdiction. Later another judge set the bond to 15000 USD which is unusually high for criminals and illegal entrants.9. Chinese propaganda used his case against America, and claimed that there is no place for people who don't support the CCP, people with Chinese descent can only submit to the CCP, which is an easy way to connect Authoritarianism to \\"opposing racial oppression from Whites\\" and pushed more people to oppose the US and its values.10.

It is 100% a culture thing. American lore is filled with stories of heroes that represent virtues.  People have chances to adopt these virtues to feel something, and consider themselves virtuous, in a way.  Many of those heroes have been vilified, and for sound reason.  I'm not here to debate that.Also, many virtuous acts have been shifted to eliminate any opportunity for people to make a decision to do something good.  Tipping, for example, used to give someone a chance to be appreciative, and that culture has shifted to an expectatio.  There are plenty of other acts fall into this category.  I understand these shifts represents progress and there is plenty of good reason for them.  I'm not here to debate that. What folks on the left don't understand is that this leaves a void in the culture that isn't seen to those whose eyes are always looking forward.  That void was never filled with other opportunities for people to acquire \\"American\\" virtues.  And so, that void is filled with resentment to those old enough to feel it, and by extension to younger generations fed stories of an America they'll never experience.  Progress will always be stymied if that void is not filled, that is where progressives need to strategize their campaigns around. What Trump did was name things responsible for the void - \\"woke\\" stuff -  and attacked groups he named for being responsible. This amplified and channelled all of the resentment while also establishing himself as the fighter against those who will continue to take away the heroes and opportuties for \\"American\\" virtues.  Many of which he would even invent - \\"remember when water would flow from the shower\\", and stuff like that.  Regardless, it's an easy strategy to run on.  Progressives need to recognize that the winning strategy is designing a campaign around culture where folks get an opportunity to feel more virtuous and \\"American\\"(however it gets defined) for participating in that campaign.  Obama did this.  He named divisive politics as unamerican and defined hope as an American virtue.","title":"Ex-Obama Adviser Snidely Boils Down Harris Defeat To 1 Faction Of Democratic Party"},{"text":"Joe Rogan isn't the talent scout, his audience is one of the focus groups.Send Andy beshear or Mark Kelly or whoever the fuck they think is the future of the party.

When a little known car repair shop owner won against a MAGA conspiracy theorist [in the biggest upset of the entire 2022 Midterm Election?](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/E0iQ9NamYi) Well, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez has done it again, and shes defeated Republican candidate Joe Kent by what seems to be an even bigger margin this time around, despite 2024 being a much, much worse political environment for the Democrats. She won by just over 2,000 votes last time, but her current margin is now **15,000 votes**. Unlike almost all other downballot Democrats this election cycle, she actually **improved**.Considering how unlikely it was for her to win not just once, but twice, could the Democrats learn something from how shes won both races? I hail from this house district, in Southwest Washington, and shes made herself known as a down-to-earth, no-nonsense Democrat who focuses mostly on local issues more so than national politics. Shes a Blue Dog Democrat, in the same vein as Jared Golden (whos also expected to win re-election) and Mary Peltola (who sadly wont unless a miracle happens); something once extinct in the Democratic Party but has recently seen a resurgence in very rural and normally unfavorable House districts for Democrats. Washingtons 3rd District is based around Vancouver, Washington, a large suburb of Portland, and also a large expanse of smaller cities that span from the SW Washington coast to the Cascade Mountains. We have a Cook PVI index of **R+5**, voted for former Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler several times until [she lost a primary challenge against Joe Kent because of her vote to impeach Trump,](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/us/politics/jaime-herrera-beutler-concedes-washington.html) and voted for Trump in all three general election cycles, and yet Marie Perez managed to not just win, but win on the same ticket as Kamala Harris and by an even bigger margin than in the 2022 Midterms where Trump was not on the ballot.Could it be a symptom of how bad of a candidate Joe Kent is? Someone whos an open [far-right nationalist?](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-joe-kent-republicans-congress-perez-extremism-1235151017/) Could it also be because Washington was the **only state that did not shift rightwards in the 2024 General Election?** Possibly. But regardless, Im sure the Democratic Party will deeply study what made her so successful in order to try to figure out what they can do to try to take back Congress in 2026 and the White House in 2028.","title":"Gluesenkamp Prez, a Democrat, wins re-election in Washington, NBC News projects"},{"text":"I'm really getting sick of her man.

I'm the polar opposite of this thinking: I'm excited to soon earn my Masters degree, get a job that makes 4-5 times what I did, and actually be able to contribute to others' education/healthcare because we all live here together, and therefore we're all in this together.Some people can work their asses off to get through school - my hats off to you that you could, seriously. That's an immense amount of work and determination, and it shouldn't be downplayed. Not all of us can do that for whatever reason, though. Me, I'm in an accelerated program and there is literally not enough time for me to work and do school; the program warns you of this before applying, but I'll be done quicker and I only have to take out student loans for one school year instead of two. And some schools are so expensive that it doesn't matter how much you work - you're not going to make enough to live and pay for school.The doctors and surgeons that save peoples lives? That may save yours and somebody you love's life? They most likely have student debt, and a shit TON. Teachers? Debt. Lawyers? Debt. Social workers? Debt. Even those who go into trades have to pay for that training in some way, and if grants aren't enough, I'll give you one guess what will finance their education. If you said student loans, you win. All these people who contribute to society - and to your life, I bet, in some way - were only able to do this because they took out student loans. And most of them are mired down in that debt - even the doctors; only the highly specialized ones are well-off, and they usually came from money to begin with. My own doctor does okay for her family, but we've commiserated over student debt. My friend who majored in economics and mathematics has a good job but still has to share an apartment with his partner and his best friend. They cannot afford anything else, and student debt is a big reason why. The only friend I had who paid off her student debt by 30 was a therapist, and her parents are well off; like, they gave her a down payment for a home in a HCOL area. And student loans are seriously fucked up: another friend of mine is a teacher, but we live in a state and area that pays teachers pretty well. He's a Marine veteran and got some assistance with college from that, and got a BS in...not gonna lie, I can't remember but it's one of the sciences. He got his teaching credential, and has been a teacher for about 20 years. A while back he was telling me how he finally qualified for a certain amount of loan forgiveness. Because, you see, even after paying for 20 YEARS, he still hadn't paid it off. Technically, the principal itself only went down by $300 in that amount of time -he'd been paying off interest.And I'll point out...most degrees these days are $100k, and liberal arts degrees cover a lot of different subjects, including the natural sciences (biology, physics, etc). If you meant an art degree, I'll then point at that if you enjoy movies and TV with any amount of CGI, the people who have to create it usually have to go to school to learn those skills...and that costs money, which brings us back to student loans.So...if you're really against paying for others' student loans in any way, shape or form, I would never go to the doctor or any kind of healthcare provider including pharmacies; never see a lawyer if you need legal services; if you have children (or plan to have any) then definitely don't have them be taught by a teacher; don't watch any movies or TV ever again; and you should probably feel resentful or something about being paid because at least a few of the people involved in the accounting department (or whoever puts together your paycheck) probably has student debt. Basically, a good portion of people under 45 have student debt, and we are drowning. Many of my friends will never own a home. I chose not to have kids, and a big factor in that was because I could not afford it. My friend, we ARE suffering. We're just not suffering in the same way you did.","title":"Trump's win could spell the end of Biden's higher education policies"},{"text":"It would have been much worse without Taylor Swift.\\nWithout Taylor they might have won Cali as well.","title":"Kathy Griffin Blames Kamala Harris's Loss on Taylor Swift in Unhinged Rant"},{"text":"Thats a sane and normal reaction to not having to be president.

Even if he didnt actively encourage it ahead of time, which Trump most certainly did, any leader who puts the democratic institutions of this country before himself would be going out of his way to make it abundantly clear that they do not condone what happened and to call for the prosecution of those responsible.

He no longer has the popularity or reach he once had. Her Howard Stern interview only had about 2 million views (1.8 to be exact) while Trump's interview with Joe Rogan had 47 million views! That's a huge difference and if your running for office you cannot win without reaching people and making them feel they understand you and where you are coming from.

With all that being said, there are 22 million naturalized citizens in the U.S. The process of denaturalization takes about 3 years on average per case. Even at a turbocharged rate, denaturalizing 22 million is logistically impossible. Due process is still needed to apply laws, especially if theyre unconstitutional.

I was a Democrat as well and I started noticing lots of problems about 7 or 8 years ago. A lot of things just weren't adding up for me anymore. The day the Biden Administration, who I did not vote for, decided to fuck with people's right to earn a living and support their families was the day war was declared on the American people in a way like never before. The realization that my government had the power to meddle in my life and destroy my career if I did not obey terrified me and put me off the Democratic Party forever. It actually put me off politics which I was never really that into to begin with but that was it for me. I'm still bothered that no one mentioned this during this election cycle. You try to force unwanted injections on millions of people, threaten their livelihood, many lost their jobs and homes and their lives were completely decimated and we're going to pretend like this never happened? I don't think so!I don't have a TV and I haven't for well over 10 years but I am absolutely repulsed by the media, all media. I feel that they are directly responsible for melting people's brains and pitting people against one another. They should have their licenses removed for what they've done to the public. When I see public figures yapping on a television or even online whether it's a news personality or a celebrity I am absolutely disgusted. I now take in information in a completely different way. Like if I'm looking at a particular story I think to myself why am I seeing this? Why has it been planted here? How am I supposed to be feeling? How does whoever wrote this want me to act or behave after reading it? It's a radically different way of taking an information than what I used to do in the past and I will absolutely never go back to reading something and not asking myself several questions about what I've just read.","title":"The Conspiracy of the Democratic Party and How We Lost"},{"text":"Its about damn time.

(Think of all the buildings or products that bear the name Trump, or him standing in front of his name in giant letters on the RNC stage.)The Antichrist makes a covenant with many, in the Middle East, likely a sprawling ME peace deal. Trump (author of The Art of the Deal) prides himself on being the master of making big deals, and he insists he will be the one to achieve peace in the Middle East, calling it the biggest deal ever. His Abraham Accords appear to be an early hint at this.Then youve got stuff like this:Earlier this year the Israel Heritage Foundation gifted Trump a plaque calling him the Prince of Peace and quoting the Bible verse referring to the Messiah, and last year they gave him a silver crown.Trump is on video looking up at the sky and saying I am the Chosen One, and he has Retweeted people calling him Israels savior, savior of the world, likening him to the second coming of Christ, etc.Donald means World Ruler and Trump means Trumpet, AKA a Little Horn as the Bible refers to the AC.The Antichrist is referred to as the Beast from the Sea, that ends up in the Lake of Fire; Mar-a-Lago translates to Sea-to-Lake.And then on top of all that, the recent assassination attempt just adds to the list, as it eerily aligns with Revelation 13, where the AC receives a head wound that people at first think is fatal. In his RNC speech, Trump said that most in the crowd thought he was dead, and many commentators have been remarking that his survival was a miracle. But they of course attribute the miracle to God, even though the Bible says that in the end times evil spirits will do miracles and fool people.Thats not even to mention the fact that people who think Trump is the AC have long predicted that Elon Musk would be his right-hand man, the False Prophet; the Bible says that the FP will cause people to marvel by bringing fire down from the heavens (the sky).

The problem is this can be tricky, main reason for my argument is the subjectivity of perception. Brains all receive information slightly different based on past experiences, so people can walk away from one conversation with vastly different understandings. When you think about using a verbal agreement, no matter how formally verbal, you are in tricky waters because you have no original source to reference down the road to confirm what was actually agreed upon. Perception is one thing, and memory is another: our memory is fallible! Anecdotally, Im sure you can recount a handful of instances where a verbal contract between friends or family members went wrong. All this to say, theres a reason why people have written contracts.

Is it the official story or fake news? Facts or alternative facts.My opinion is that the whole system is fraud, and heres my reasoning:I aided a human trafficking victim some years ago, and since then my life has been methodically and systematically destroyed.I self-published two books, one that was distributed throughout the world in many bookstores (I never got a cent) and the second reaching #20 out of over 450,000 others in its genre (I never got more than $18). This may be due to having to switch phones, profiles, passwords several times because of my technology becoming compromised by hackers (one was a guy I knew) along with my data being compromised at least 7 other times. The publisher couldnt verify it was me and told me to just make a second profile (they also control the search results and algorithms). I have done industry estimates on what I could have made with my first two books and they range from $100 million to $1 billion, not a boast. The taxes alone from these books has affected the US government and every citizen. I have cried myself to sleep many nights during disasters around the world knowing I have nothing to donate to anyones aid but a paltry couple boxes of clothes. My livelihood was destroyed and I live on about $1000/month. Being alerted to the identity theft I worked with a government organization who very clearly told me my identity was stolen and used in multiple states, expedited my case to their special inter-agency group and assigned me an agent to help. The day after he was assigned to me he told me he was suddenly going on a 2-3 week vacation, and we never got to discuss my case. The case was resolved early with their finding that my identity was not stolen or used in multiple states even though I have clear evidence of such.Ive gone to the police, who either ping pong me to different points for a simple report or who do not take the harassment Ive endured seriously and write bogus reports. Upon having to call 911 about an immediate threat from a nearby neighbor, the police told me to just leave town. This is not possible due to my writing not being allowed to effectively be distributed and in-person work hard to come by because of resume/AI issues and harassment at workplaces.Ive endured malpractice, malfeasance, espionage, stalking, cybercrimes, breaking and entering, identity and intellectual property theft, among other crimes, but nothing I say or report goes anywhere. Even if I were to end up in a court it would likely be an Oppenheimer kangaroo court with fake juries, lawyers, and judges all paid off.All this is likely because I aided that human trafficking victim which pissed off some shadowy elite figure part of an international crime ring that has corrupted all systems that I am aware of.I even endured an assassination attempt that I survived, without the help of a hospital. My primary care doctor has even shrugged me off saying Im too complicated and he wants to retire. My dogs last vet was bought by a private equity company that was charging me hundreds of dollars for a visit and we had to part on bad terms.There is a lot more to this story. I have a large bag full of evidence that no one cares to look into. Every avenue I have gone to remedy this is met with a [yes and no] if I even get an answer. So was 2020 election fraud? Maybe! Everything else in this system seems to be.","title":"Democrats Hoped the Bros Wouldn't Show.

So being finished with the Dems means what exactly? This statement by Michael Kinnucan is appropriate in these conversations:Sometimes people talk as though there were a national organization called The Democratic Party that was tasked with winning races against Republicans and either was out there doing that (so the rest of us can go do other things) or is to be criticized for not doing that effectively. But this organization just does not exist, there is not The Democratic Party. There are a bunch of politicians of varying levels of talent and ambition and their constellation of donors and staffers and consultants who spend most of their time jockeying for power internally or plotting out their next career move or whatever. And sure, sometimes the ambitions of that big loose group of people overlap enough with the project of beating Republicans in general elections that if you squint you can sort of see something like a generalized effort to win elections happening for a few months, and other times... well, we all saw the debate.People on the left sometimes summarize this situation as \\"the Democrats don't even want to win,\\" and that certainly captures something, but we have to be very precise. There are millions of people across the country who identify strongly with the Democratic Party and who may not share our politics in every respect but who are absolutely desperate to protect abortion, civil rights, labor rights, the climate, etc. by beating Trump. Those people really do desperately want to win. But those people don't have a political organization through which they can pursue that desire to win; all they have is the Democratic Party, i.e. a ballot line monopoly plus a vague brand plus a constellation of dumb ambitions currently dominated by a vain old man who just doesn't want to retire.","title":"I am officially done with the Democratic party"},{"text":"This right here.

When there is no conversation, when policy is completely top-down, when it is dictated by a leader, well...you should be able to figure out what that is. It isn't democracy.I do think pressuring officials and committing elections fraud is wrong. Im just not arrogantly assuming thats the only interpretation of events.Again, you just sound ignorant of the basic facts.

That act in itself is a gross abuse of power. The fact that he urged them to not certify vote totals, to commit voter fraud, is very clearly undemocratic. He also called the Secretary of State of Georgia and pressured him to again to commit voter fraud based on zero evidence. Raffensperger repeatedly had to present Trump with actual evidence that the vote tallies were correct. Trump just asserted with no evidence that he had to have won Georgia, invoking conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines that even at the time had been debunked. You can read the whole conversation for yourself:[https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/02/15/read-full-transcript-donald-trumps-call-brad-raffensperger/](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/02/15/read-full-transcript-donald-trumps-call-brad-raffensperger/)This is NOT normal behavior for any president, and it is completely and utterly undemocratic under any interpretation.","title":"CMV: Voter Retaliation is Wrong"},{"text":"Interesting theory.

The filibuster for judicial appointments has been killed for years now. In other words, the main thing the Senate can do without House involvement is already a simple majority. Nothing changes.Why do I mention the House? Because it's going to be razor thin, and there's still a path for Dems to narrowly take it anyway. They currently have a razor thin majority in the House. You may notice that they're extremely dysfunctional and can rarely get things through with their thin margin. That's not going to change, and it's going to get even worse if they only have something like a 1 seat majority. In other words, either we control it and crazy stuff doesn't get through the House, or they narrowly control it and are too dysfunctional to get much through. Can't pass laws without both the House and the Senate, so just killing the filibuster doesn't do much if the House is either Dem controlled or can't get their shit together.So, yes, they can kill the filibuster.

They claim it would be beneficial if Democrats adopted some anti-trans policies that could appeal to moderates and social conservatives, and some \\"moderate\\" anti-trans policies would be a way for Democrats to distance themselves from the left.The current Democratic platform is to continue with the status quo for trans rights. The GOP is pushing to restrict trans civil rights, and the Democrats have opposed those changes.You're right in that the GOP's anti-trans push at the federal level has been mostly rhetoric, like Trump promising to \\"end the transgender insanity\\". However, Trump has a history of issuing anti-trans executive orders, including suspending anti-discrimination policies in public schools, banning transgender people from serving in the military, banning trans students from using the school bathroom that matches their gender, allowing health care workers to refuse to treat transgender patients if they have a religious objection, etc. All of those were challenged in court and caught up in the legal process, so they never went into effect, but it's likely that Trump will try again in 2025.Personally, I get my health insurance through a federal job, and Trump promised on the campaign trail that he will issue an executive order that removes federal employee insurance coverage for trans-related health care. Trump wants to redefine gender at the federal level to always match the birth sex, which would impact things like passports. Trump also promised to bar public schools from affirming the gender of trans students and employees, which would include pronouns and bathroom use, at the threat of losing federal funding.There's also very likely to be federal anti-trans legislation given the GOP trifecta. The GOP [introduced 53 federal anti-trans bills in the 2023 legislative session](https://translegislation.com/bills/2023/US). Trump said \\"The left-wing gender insanity being pushed on our children is an act of child abuse,\\" and GOP legislators have said they want to criminalize the parents of trans minors as child abusers. They want to ban any hospital or clinic that accepts Medicaid or Medicare dollars from offering trans-related health care, which would be catastrophic for trans health care access. Some want to end discrimination protections in employment and housing.Who knows how much of that comes to fruition, but it's likely to be bad news.","title":"4,000 word post about r slash neoliberal needs to abandon trans people"},{"text":"That is how the US becomes some weird spinoff of the EU.

In particular, from the testimony of many, there seems to be a belief that any biologically-born male could simply say he was transgender and begin participating in womens sports. This is incorrect. For many years now, the UHSAA has had in place a rule that only allows male-to-female transgender participation in womens sports after a full year of difficult transition hormone therapy and in consultation with a health care professional. This has likely prevented some participation and helped to even the playing field. As a representative of the UHSAA stated: As we read the science right now, we like our policy. This year we have four students who have gone through our paperwork and we have not had any complaints from any other students or families or school administrators. I should note that while I have some reservations about a policy that requires or incentivizes these transitions, it is the policy in place.Finally, there is one more important reason for this veto. I must admit, I am not an expert on transgenderism. I struggle to understand so much of it and the science is conflicting. When in doubt however, I always try to err on the side of kindness, mercy and compassion. I also try to get proximate and I am learning so much from our transgender community. They are great kids who face enormous struggles. Here are the numbers that have most impacted my decision: 75,000, 4, 1, 86 and 56.75,000 high school kids participating in high school sports in Utah.\\n4 transgender kids playing high school sports in Utah.\\n1 transgender student playing girls sports.\\n86% of trans youth reporting suicidality.\\n56% of trans youth having attempted suicide.\\nFour kids and only one of them playing girls sports. Thats what all of this is about. Four kids who arent dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are a part of something. Four kids trying to get through each day. Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I dont understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live. And all the research shows that even a little acceptance and connection can reduce suicidality significantly. For that reason, as much as any other, I have taken this action in the hope that we can continue to work together and find a better way. If a veto override occurs, I hope we can work to find ways to show these four kids that we love them and they have a place in our state.\\"       \\n         \\nKeep reading...","title":"Seth Moultons comments on trans athletes spark criticism as Democrats play blame game over loss"},{"text":"It's words that are tried and tested.

This should have been started the month he took office, but solidifying wins for their base is a no go for them. On the local front for me, Sherrod Brown of Ohio refused to support the weed legalization bill until the day he voted because of his friendships with special interest groups.

If Biden had stepped down sooner, Harris would have had more time to campaign, and this would improve her odds of winning (polls showed that a major reason people were hesitant to vote for her was because they felt they didn't know enough about her).The results of this election don't look too pretty at first glance, but in reality Harris managed to get within a margin where she was only 2 points behind in 4/7 of the swing states after only campaigning for 3 months (which is the shortest presidential campaign in history). And this is when the national environment was 6 points redder compared to 2020, which means she beat the national environment by 4 points in the states that mattered. If Biden had dropped out sooner and she had a more normal period of time to campaign, then I think it's very plausible that Harris could have squeaked out a win.At the end of the day, it was just plain stubborn for Biden to refuse to drop out sooner, even when plenty of polls and other data indicated he had no chance to win against Trump.Also, I find it weird that you question whether Harris was qualified to be VP, when she was a DA, an AG, and a US senator prior to being selected.

Biden, who had long stood roughly in the ideological middle of his party, won the Democratic nomination in 2020 over more liberal challengers, including Harris.\\nBut the Biden presidency moved to the left pretty quickly, says Kessler. They got a lot of things accomplished, and a lot of centrist things accomplished too. But ultimately I think they were listening to interest groups, not voters. They forgot about the border until it was too late. They funded the police but didnt really talk about some of the progressive excesses that were happening in the cities. They didnt aggressively address inflation, at least in terms of talking about it.To pull the country out of the Covid slump, Biden pushed for an economic stimulus package so large it added to inflation. He also aggressively supported forgiveness of federal college loans, a position with great appeal to college-educated Democrats but one that rankles many in the working class. Basically theyre asking people who dont go to college to pay for forgiving the loans of the people who do, says From.\\nThe changing demographics of the Democratic Party has also affected its approach to cultural issues. Issues that are important to better-educated urbanitespolice brutality, racial equality, gay and transgender rightshave risen in prominence and priority. Those issues simply dont have the same resonance for many parts of the old Democratic coalitionincluding some Black and Latino voters, as this years vote showed.Immigration is a similarly divisive issue. Highly educated voters tend to view immigrants as an asset to the country, while many in the working class view them more as a threat to the economy and to public order.Vice President Harris sought to pivot toward the center on some of these charged issues. discarding her previous opposition to fracking and support for decriminalizing border crossings. But that didnt stop the Trump campaign from using cultural issues against her. Research by AdImpact, a firm that tracks ad campaigns and spending, found that the Trump campaign spent $11 million running and rerunning a single ad charging that Harris supported using taxpayer money to pay for sex-change operations for prisoners.When the Democrats were faced with a similar disconnect from working-class voters in the 1980s, they went through a long and sometimes painful reconsideration of their path. The partys liberals wanted to turn further leftward, defending government activism in defiance of Reagans conservative revolution.But others, led by the Democratic Leadership Council, thought the path to revival should be paved in the political center. Bill Clinton later wrote that the DLCs creation was a turning point in the Democratic Party. Clinton became the champion of economic policies that thrilled moderates but that liberals derided as Reagan lite: free trade, a balanced budget and economic globalization. In todays populist environment, few in either party would follow this path, but in the 1990s it helped to produce a long economic expansion and actual federal budget surpluses (briefly).At the same time, Clinton countered the idea that the Democratic Party had veered too far left on social issues. To rebut the idea that Democrats were weak on law and order, he pushed through a bill called Cops on the Beat that put 10,000 additional police officers on Americas streets. To show that Democrats didnt want an ever-expanding welfare state, he embraced a welfare-reform bill that tied benefits more closely to work. He backed immigration-reform legislation that cracked down on illegal border crossings.\\nOn every one of those thingshe knew how to talk to people and understand their emotions and provide solutions, says Rahm Emanuel, an aide in the Clinton White House who went on to serve as mayor of Chicago and is now Americas ambassador to Japan.Clinton also made calculated moves to directly challenge his partys left on cultural issues. During the 1992 campaign, while speaking to a predominantly Black audience at Jesse Jacksons Rainbow Coalition, he criticized a Black hip-hop artist for comments hostile toward whites, in what came to be known as his Sister Souljah moment.\\nBut it wasnt only his policy positions that enabled Clinton to connect with voters across the racial and educational spectrum. His folksy manner, Southern drawl and fondness for McDonalds runs gave him visceral appeal to what was known then as the Bubba votethe white, blue-collar men among whom Trump does so well today. Having grown up among working-class Blacks in Arkansas, he had a strong personal connection with Black voters. In 1998, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison referred to Clinton, half-jokingly, as the first Black president.It would be hard for a Democratic leader to replicate the Clinton formula today. The country is more polarized now, and moves toward the center certainly would be resisted by the partys progressive wing, which is more assertive and potent than it was in the 1990s. Still, after the gut punch of this election, simply maintaining the status quo doesnt seem to be an option for the Democrats. Democratic pollster?Celinda Lake calls for the emergence of a kind of liberal populism, and her plea for her party is simple: Have an economic plan and message that works for blue-collar people.Carville suggests reviving a party tradition by holding a midterm mini-convention in two years. Give people something to do, he says. Give people something to organize around. Because right now, the entire partyand when I say the entire party, I mean not just the leadership but the rank and fileis dazed, confused.Gerald F. Seib was the Journals executive Washington editor and Capital Journal columnist, and now serves as a visiting fellow at the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics.","title":"The Democrats Need Another Bill Clinton"},{"text":"To return from the political wilderness, the party must reconnect with working-class voters on both style and substance. Clintons success in the 1990s shows how.On Nov. 4, 1980, Democrats had a very bad night. Republican Ronald Reagan defeated the incumbent Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, who was bogged down by inflation and foreign crises. Reagansomeone Democratic leaders once thought would be seen by voters as too extreme and even dangerousdidnt merely win. He won decisively, carrying 44 states.Just as damaging for Democrats, the rout extended to Congress, where Republicans flipped an astonishing 12 Senate seats to take control for the first time in a quarter-century, while also gaining ground in the House.Flash forward 44 years, and the Democrats have?just suffered another stinging defeat, one with similar causes and with consequences potentially as far-reaching. Kamala Harris was defeated by Donald Trump, failing to carry any of the key swing states she was counting on. Democrats lost ground in some 90% of the counties across the country compared with the presidential vote four years ago, while also giving up control of the Senate and possibly failing in their hopes of taking over the House.What do Democrats do now?They might want to start by considering what their party did after that 1980 rebuke. It began a long and deep rethink of how it had lost its grip on a key element of its constituencyvoters who were called Reagan Democrats then and who today are known simply as working-class Americans. Then as now, Democrats found they had ceased communicating effectively with that broad swath of Americans on economic issues and, just as importantly, on cultural questions.That long rethink eventually led Democrats to reposition themselves more firmly in the countrys ideological center. It ultimately produced the candidacy and two-term presidency of Bill Clinton, a politician with a gift for listening and talking to working-class Americans.The parallels between then and now arent perfect, and the economic prescription Clinton brought to his party would likely fall flat with todays electorate. Still, a similar call for a re-evaluation is arising already among Democrats. The first thing youve got to do is what I called reality therapy, says Al From, a Democratic Party operative who launched the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist think tank that became the wellspring of the Clinton philosophy. Reality therapy is youve got to be honest about what has happened and why you are losing.James Carville, who was Clintons political guru, believes that Democrats need to erase the perception they have been pulled too far left on cultural issues, crime and immigration.?What killed the Democratswas a sense of disorder,?he said this week on Politics War Room, a podcast he hosts with journalist Al Hunt. And part of the sense of disorder was the unfortunate events of what I would refer to as the woke erathe image stuck in peoples minds that people wanted to defund the police, that they wanted to empty the prisons.Its impossible to analyze the Democrats struggles today, and the potential paths forward, without understanding how the party has changed shape in recent years. A party once closely identified with trade unionists and rural Americans has come to be dominated more and more by college-educated urbanites. That demographic evolution has exacerbated the loss of contact with working-class voters, who experience an economy quite different from the one felt by the elites.During the Covid pandemic, for example, the college-educated by and large could keep working comfortably from home, while many who earned a living with their hands had no such luxury. During the recovery from Covid, the paths separated further. To a large degree, those with financial advantages?were protected from the effects of the post-pandemic inflation and may even have benefited from it. The stock market in which their 401(k) accounts were invested rose dramatically. Meantime, inflation?was traumatizing those who lived paycheck to paycheck.Similarly, technology has been a boon for many college-educated Americans, opening up opportunities and making their work more efficient. For many blue-collar Americans, technology has simply been a job killer.The growing economic gap between top and bottom has opened up a hole in the middle of the Democratic Party. We have a strange coalition: suburban and higher-educated people and poor minorities, says Jim Kessler, executive vice president of Third Way, a think tank of centrist Democrats. These are not people who talk to each other much.The effect was seen in this years vote. The Associated Presss VoteCast,?a survey of over 120,000 registered voters,?found that Harris won a majority of voters with incomes below $25,000 and above $100,000, while Trump won every income bracket in between.There were other indicators of a fading attachment to the working class. Trump won 64% of whites without a college degree, including 68% of men in that category. Among households with a union member, Trump essentially tied with Harris, the nominee of a Democratic Party that once proudly wore a union label. ?","title":"The Democrats Need Another Bill Clinton"},{"text":"For sure.

Fundamental rights are specified by the Constitution (\\"C\\"), and can only be changed by amendments to it. For example, the right to drink alcohol was removed by one amendment, and restored by another. Presidents can rail one way or another, but they can't actually change your rights. B - One of the unfortunate growths in government has been Executive Orders. All Presidents use them, and Trump and Biden were not exceptions. Kamala would have used them too. There are limits to what can be asked, but I am not too sure what they are. C - No it hasn't changed but courts have increasingly empowered other agencies to enact \\"regulations\\" which have the same force as law but aren't subject to the same scrutiny. You could look up \\"Chevron deference\\" for more on this matter. D - Neither could change abortion law if they wanted to. The Supreme Court has correctly applied the Tenth Amendment, and referred the matter back to the \\"several states\\".  Since abortion is not mentioned in the C, there is no 'right' to it at the federal level. It is up to each state to decide what its limits on abortion are. E - The so-called \\"constitutional right to abortion\\" is a legal fiction, invented by sophists to satisfy the college-aged baby boomers who wanted easy, consequence free sex.

They didn't even care about dumbed down \\"layman hype\\" campaign rhetoric and whether or not she did it.This was purely 1 thing: \\"I was doing better in the precious presidency so I'll go with whoever was doing that\\".A completely ignorant, fact-less, vibe-fueled vote that is profoundly detached from any other aspects such as morality or quality of the candidate, selfishly conditioned upon one single thing: how they felt during the previous administration financially.I already kinda knew in my heart that \\"most people are stupid\\". Heck, I could be one of those people. However this has been pretty eye opening in a sense that  Trump has helped demonstrate that we are gonna have to navigate pretty much all future elections as if the politician is a monkey performing for a bunch of brain dead morons. There's no use giving every campaign gaffs and misspeak any air time because it doesn't matter, Trump proves that too.All that matters is getting the mindless crowd to feel better than how they feel about the other based on nothing but vibes.Its a shame that this whole ordeal is likely to drastically reduce the quality of candidates on *both* sides, because what gives? Democrats pass a ton of legislation that helps the middle class, works his ass off to do it, and how is it repaid? They tell him he's not doing enough for the middle class.Like, what are Dems supposed to actually learn here? Because as far as I can tell, all this election tells me is that good quality legislation that benefits the vast majority of people isn't worth the effort, as you will never be acknowledged for it rightly and it wont even help you in your re-election efforts.Best thing we can do is basically start hiring fucking *actors* to play the democratic nominee, because it certainly doesn't fucking matter what they actually *do* as president, if Trump is where we're looking for advice on how to win.","title":"Kamala Harris campaign didnt ignore working class voters"},{"text":"I was watching AOCs Instagram live the other day and she had like 50k people when I just so happened to look at the #s.

It's not like we need to have it at a federal scale for it to be successful. Sweden only has a population of 10 million. If they can accomplish great social programs at that scale, states can get it done themselves if they have more control over tax dollars. US basically becomes the EU.

CA allocated the money to do this. It did not get done, most of the money went back to the state and the housing was not built. Why you ask? Because people want this in principal till its in their area.2. Housing for homeless with taxes is a bad solution when people are pissed about food prices. 3. A policy that is unequal will be unpopular: pay off student loans, 25k new house credit, child tax credit.... What happens when these dont apply to me, Or I get one of them and bill next door gets two. or all of them. FUck bill why did he get more. There is a great coverage of the model that Houston uses to deal with homelessness. It is very housing first and FORCES a lot of agencys and groups to cooperate if they want founding. Those principals applied to ca would have been a better use of money. That housing first model tends to see people get back on their feet (and making that house available for the next person).

The reason that bill was so close to a Republican dream bill is... get this... because Democrats actually want to secure the border, too. Illegal crossings have been dropping consistently since the initial spike that happened when Biden took office. That spike that happened when he took office was in part because Republicans kept lying, and continue to lie, that the borders are \\"open\\" under Democrats, so a huge wave of border-crossers waited until Biden took office to make the trip.

Populism is not about finding a Democratic Trump. It won't work. Cuban won't even make it through a primary.

Ultimately, the leaders of the current party need to dislike the candidate, and the candidate needs to embrace their disdain.

Similar figures like Stone Cold from the WWE. They could be dumb as rocks as long as Warren is behind them writing their policy plans. The point is that this is a populist era.

Voters don't know what they want or what they are voting for they only know what they don't want. You need someone who can tell a story, joke around, talk to average people, and pick a villain and direct their rage. Populism may be a stinky and low IQ ideology, but it is currently what voters are looking for. We must adapt to that. We need to appeal to their feelings.

Have some policies that appeal to the centre right. Its literally a 2 party system, whoever occupies the middle ground will win. Btw, the voters decide what the middle ground is.

Trump had no issue doing what was asked of him, whereas Harris was apparently above such a low brow medium. Its a perfect example of Trump wanting to expand his reach and Harris refusing to engage. It should be the easiest thing in the world to beat Trump, but the ridiculously incompetent nature of the Democrats has allowed him to win TWICE. Allowing a senile old man to dither about and publicly humiliate himself over and over again is pathetic. To have the audacity to blame the public for not picking an ineffective husk of a politician parading as some driver of change despite managing a steady decline of living standards and putting forwards next to no ideas, is ludicrous.","title":"Pelosi says Biden should have dropped out earlier so there could be a primary: 'It would have been different'"},{"text":"Yes we are.","title":"Janelle Bynum wins race for Congress, flipping U.S. House seat from GOP to Democratic control"},{"text":"Sorry, but I think that's way too reductive. This analysis lacks a lot of context; specifically who were the beneficiaries of economic growth. While Reagan set neoliberalism into motion in the US, the effects were only just brewing until the 1991 recession. Yes, the economy sucked in 1992, but Bush 1 lost because he betrayed his base by increasing taxes during a recession, implementing austerity that effected the working class, and there was a third party candidate that took 15% of the vote.It's important to remember all these things happening, because *Clinton didn't win in 1992*; Bush 1 lost. Clinton's politics were nearly identical to Bush 1, and he never won more than 50% of the popular vote - neither in 1992 nor in 1996.The economy was barely an issue in the media in 2000, but the election was absolutely a referendum on neoliberalism. America's secondary cities and downtowns were being gutted by offshoring manufacturing and capital consolidation such as \\"the Walmart effect.\\" While the press (like Tom Friedman) may have been downplaying the devastating effects of working class abandonment and scolding laborers to join \\"the information economy,\\" I definitely remember that election clearly and the amount of working class rage at the time.Bush 2 won in 2004 because he was a wartime president, and because he enabled the wave of racism that Trumpers currently pattern after. Kerry was also a completely unlikeable candidate and the epitome of coastal elites. I know people who worked at high levels in DNC presidential campaigns at the time, and they still hate him.Everything after that is self-evident. Obama ran a more populist campaign, followed by deep economic betrayal that almost cost him 2012. Had Romney not been so entirely forgettable, Obama probably would have lost. We were still in recession at the time.TBH, 2000 and onwards is really is the only thing that matters currently, because things have largely stayed the same. The Republicans run on racism and \\"the two Santa Clauses.\\" When the Democrats run coastal elites that are hand-picked by party insiders, they lose. When they run more populist, they win; but when they betray that populism, the lose - if not the presidency, Congress. In 2016 and 2024, they combined both their losing strategies, while Trump has been running Bush 2's playbook, with the only difference saying the quite part out loud.Yes, the economy is important, but since all but a brief few years after 2001, the economy has become progressively worse for working and \\"middle class\\" people, to the point where the \\"middle class\\" no longer realistically exists. It's not enough to have a good economy; people's material conditions have to improve. Yes, improving people's material conditions takes more than four years, but the solution isn't dumbing down that we're doing that. It's taking on the root causes of the issue in first place - capitalism and wealth inequality, racist and sexist opportunity inequality, and dismantling both the prison industrial complex and military industrial complex. When people see that we are acting consistent with our other policies and experience the effects of that consistency, they will be relieved of stressors that prevent them from seeing short term material improvements. And yes, Democrats need to get acquainted with honesty and communicate their successes and failures in a way that shows they're learning from them. (This is another thing that the Republicans have been surprisingly good at)But we cannot get there if Democrats keep betraying working people and grass roots activists. And we certainly can't get there if Democrats keep sticking their fingers in their ears and supporting capital over the viability of our nation and our survival as a species.","title":"Dems need to be bold and offer solutions to help people!"},{"text":"I can imagine their next move is to push for any celebrity to run for President.

There was to be clear some degree of recovery after that.

That in and of itself should quite frankly be disqualifying, given that public expectations for POTUS are Trumans the buck stops here, and handling / doing something about the southern immigration crisis (ie working with congress, state govts, et al) was very obviously done and seen as a trial run by the Biden administration.No, its a legitimate criticism. Harris was Bidens first and most important hire, how she was utilized effectively is ultimately on him. Something youre very much missing is how so many people around Biden and in his inner circle didnt like Kamala from the beginning and undermined her throughout the Biden presidency. Jill Biden was down talking Kamala with donors from San Francisco (by pivoting to praising Ketanji Brown Jackson to avoid complementing Kamala *in 2022*, weird how she chose to bring up another black woman to throw shade on Kamala but thats in line with other vaguely racist things Jill Biden has done). Biden was saying he was the only one who could beat Trump for weeks after it was obvious he needed to be replaced, as if Kamala didnt exist and hadnt been loyal to her for years.  Harris was a CA AG turned junior senator. Who had, quite frankly, nearly nonexistent experience, and above all actual policy and legislative and/or executive achievements outside of that. She ranked 12th or something in the 2020 primary, and had both opportunistically attacked Biden - very very poorly - and subsequently got wrecked by Haley.Well one, Nikki Haley isnt a Democrat and didnt run for president in 2020, Tulsi Gabbard did. Her attack on Biden didnt go very poorly considering it impressed Biden enough to make her the VP  She was picked by Biden as basically one of only two or three black women who was remotely quialified for that. Which was an explicit requirement asked for by the southern black caucus of Biden, which netted him an early victory and ergo the nomination.She was picked by Biden because she was legitimately qualified. I love when the people who clearly dont like Kamala lean into the she was a diversity hire line when Biden never promised to pick a black woman to be his VP. I challenge you to find when Biden promised to make a black woman his VP (it never happened, he promised to appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court, he promised to appoint a woman as his VP). Kamala was all Bidens decision, he wasnt forced by the CBC or anyone else Very long rant aside, my point is that Harris very obviously put Biden in a very difficult situation.Kamala Harris was not the brainchild of Bidenomics, nor did she have a number of Democratic mayors and governors pleading with her to be more responsive and helpful regarding immigration","title":"Pelosi Laments Bidens Late Exit and the Lack of an Open Primary"},{"text":"He's not washed-up, but I nominate Jon Stewart.","title":"Anyone know of a washed up reality TV star who could run for the democrats?"},{"text":"Most Indians voted for Trump lmao","title":"The digital divide for Indian Country got better under Bidenwill that progress go away?"},{"text":"Yeah there are a ton more details but I thought if I made it too long of a post people wouldn't read it, it was pretty long as it is.

The difference between top podcasts and good podcasts is just popularity with the audience.  One thing that makes the current crop of right-wing populism more appealing is that they're not constrained by honesty.  They can just lie and say what they think people want to hear without worrying about whether it's true.  They can also scapegoat minorities, which turns out to be broadly popular but isn't really something that left leaning podcasts can emulate and still be left leaning.During Trump's first term, there were some \\"dirtbag left\\" that experimented with indulging in some of the same tactics as right-wing podcasts, but it didn't have as much appeal.  And some of those hosts were extremely disingenuous about their politics as some of them have come full circle and are now pro-Trump.  They may have even been plants intending to bring their audience on that same journey from left-wing to right-wing, but even the most charitable interpretation is that their politics were very superficial to begin with.I don't listen to a lot of podcasts, but one that I like is Behind the Bastards.  It has a very distinct left leaning viewpoint and is entertaining, doesn't pull its punches, and offers opinions backed by factual research.  It's not exactly small and obscure, but nowhere in the same league as something like Joe Rogan.  It's something like around the 150th podcast in number of listeners.  But I don't think the main difference between it and something in the top 20 is necessarily quality.

The visuals of doing things working class people do and like, along with some lip service to their profession and some light fearmongering, matter more than quietly doing things that actually benefit them.In an election decided by the economy, conservatives have convinced blue collar workers that record profits will result in higher wages for them, even as the things that result in record profits put their benefits, jobs, and even lives at risk, while the vast majority of increased profits go to management and the C-suite. Pepper that with the secret spice of being against whatever the current social issues are, and you have a winning formula for making the workers and their employers happy.Prices went up because corporations in every industry realized they could raise prices to recover from economic losses during the pandemic and never lower them for record profits, and there's nothing the consumer can do about it. But because one side did not hammer that point hard enough, the strategy that won the people over was something that will only raise prices further, but was presented like it would punish other countries instead.","title":"Kamala Harris campaign didnt ignore working class voters"},{"text":"Oh look, something the President can do without Congress to help Ukraine.

That view does not change even slightly if 20% or 80% of Jews support Israel's actions.Trying to conflate that with antisemitism is honestly just cowardice. It's simply saying \\"if you oppose Israel, regardless of your reason why, you are the same as a Nazi\\".

Pointing out that Israel is committing atrocities in Gaza? That Israel's actions can be justifiably described as ethnic cleansing or genocide? I'm not advocating for anyone to target anyone, ever.

I would say yes, if the poor voted against their own interests. There are two things: 1. What is the outcome you wish to achieve? 2. How do you achieve it? I think the ally part is aligning on #1, so agreeing on what is a \\"good\\" outcome, eg improving quality of life for the group in question. But you may have different ideas than many of them about what is the best way to achieve the outcome. It's certainly important to listen to people in the marginalized group to hear their opinion on achieving said outcome. But no one can predict the future, and not everyone in the group possesses equal expertise to say what is the best policy. Some members of the group have more expertise about the issue, so their opinions on policies should be weighted higher. I argue that POC progressives and academics have more expertise to say what policies will help their own racial group and improve their group's quality of life. Even then, there is a lot of variation and disagreement.

Yes, the overall economy is healthier (gdp, stock). Life necessities for households on the lower end of the spectrum, not so much. Too much of let them eat cake in the way her plan was presented. Totally understand it's not what she actually said, but it was extremely easy to interpret it to that.2. She could not distance herself from Biden.  And while she may have been an active VP, it did not show. All the way back to the 90s, we heard about Gore visiting schools (and misspelling potato). We heard about Cheney and his hunting incident (let's not ever do that again). We often saw Biden interacting with Obama. We heard more than enough out of Pence about morals and dating and good grief go away. Kamala did not have the same presence. 3. While she had well written plans that could have been executed with at least some success, she did not do well getting this across when she spoke in public. This goes back to not being able to fully separate from Biden. 4. The second attempt by the DNC to force a  female candidate backfired. There are many women in the party who could win a primary, but they aren't being granted that chance because leadership wants a specific ideal. She did not do well in the primary she participated in and the DNC ignored that.5. And the final major, though the smallest major as a catalyst, the misogyny and racism. Yes they caused the loss of at least a portion. They were not the main reason, but they certainly are one of many reasons. There are many smaller reasons I probably just don't think about. But this is my perspective as someone who has not voted for the orange in any of the 3 he's been in.","title":"Pelosi blames Harris' loss on Biden's late exit and no open Democratic primary"},{"text":"Looking for hope in the future of the Democratic Party ?This guy is amazing !","title":"Rep.

I  have been trying to read up more, and have been reading a lot of articles posted on r/conservative but many of those top articles are not super policy discussion heavy (though maybe that was just a pre-election thing!) do you have a favored news site? Id definitely be happy to add it to my list of sources! \\n  What? So you unironically believe that            conservatives just want people to be poor?   That just seems to be the most   disingenuous take you could get.No, I was more under the belief that conservatives believed that free markets allowed for class-mobility and therefore being poor in a free market was a sign of personal failing. It sounds like maybe that is only true with the caveat being that the economy should have enough jobs to allow for this social mobility? \\nRegulation, to a certain extent, is good. Like saying companies cant dump waste into rivers.Again surprising take for me! Is there a reason then that conservatives seem ok with the rollback of emissions regulations? Emissions in the air seems very similar to waste in rivers. Is it that you believe those two things to be very different? Or that the economic impact of the regulations are worse then the impact of emissions? \\nOr when the IRS targeted Christian under the Obama administration.Reading the report from the irs inspector general on this incident (I believe this is the one your talking about?) https://www.tigta.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2022-02/201710054fr.pdfIt does seem like there was some mis-conduct in how tax-exempt statuses were audited but it doesnt seem clear to me that it was biased in any specific direction? And I see nothing about Christians, but you might be talking about something else! Yeah, its almost like relying almost entirely on other countries to produce essential goods like medicine and medical supplies wasnt actually a good idea, who coulda knownTo me this falls under the over-reliance on other countries I mentioned in my post which again was not the reasoning I was talking about, this one feels consistent to me! What is the source of our wealth? What do we produce that the rest of the world wants so much? What do we produce here at all? What would we have without the reliance on other countries?We are world leaders in scientific and technological advances! And thats part of the reason that I think wanting to bring manufacturing jobs back instead of investing in education seems counter intuitive.  Though besides that we are already (without the additional tariffs) the second largest manufacturers in the world only behind China! This is on a downward trend given the cost savings of other countries labor, but again if we can pivot that into cheaper prices while fueling more scientific and technological advances Im not sure its a bad thing!","title":"Why so much pro market-distorting sentiment?

I'm not so certain the outcome would have been different.In my assessment, the election came down to abortion, immigration, and economics.Any nominee would have held the same abortion stance as Harris, and made it front and center given the Dobbs decision and the recent state ballot intuitives. However, many women are pro-life and we now see how many supported Trump.Any nominee would have held the same immigration stance as Harris. The part line seems to have been to say that Biden and congressional Democrats had a plan that Republicans and Trump torpedoed. So no nominee would have had a comprehensive plan other than to blame the other side.Lastly, \\"inflation\\", shrinkflation, and tipflation are issues that Harris should have addressed more aggressively. All I remember is some tax credit for buying a new home (which people still wouldn't be able to afford). Trump's tariffs won't work, but to a 5 year old, it sounds like something.So unless another nominee would have addressed these issues differently, the outcome would be the same.","title":"Kamala Harris Was A Terrible Candidate, And Democrats Need To Be Honest About That"},{"text":"Update 4:50 pm the gap has closed to 973 votes apart.
