In early 2022, when Russia withdrew from Kiev, the terms Russia and Ukraine discussed in Turkey were better than anything Ukraine could walk away with now, and they still had most of their country / population/army at that point. In late 2022, Ukraine had just pushed Russia out of two major regions and held practically all the marbles but didnt push for peace talks. This was also when Russia had 180,000 men in country to Ukraines 1,000,000 and hadnt fully committed. You know who encouraged Ukraine to keep fighting? We (NATO and the U.S.) did. And for what at that point? If our politicians comments on the matter are any indication, its all to make a buck.?Now, Ukraine has suffered at bare minimum 400,000 casualties, the average age of their soldiers are almost 50, mass desertions are being reported, theyre pulling old men off the streets to fight, almost 1/3 of the countrys population has fled never to return, and now Russia is dismantling their infrastructure. At this rate, there wont be an Ukraine to rearm in the future.?We shouldnt support it because the U.S. and NATO dont give a flying f*ck about Ukraine and see this as a money making adventure.

Lets try an imagination exercise.You are very poor and you have a very modest kitchen. You dont have any appliances, you dont have a fridge, and you barely have a source of fire to cook something. But you can still eat whatever you want within the limitation of your means Now if I come into your home and renovate the entire kitchen: I buy you the most modern appliances, the best and biggest fridge, the best stove available and lots of delicious food. But youre not allowed to eat anything you want. I will use the newly renovated kitchen for myself to cook myself the best meals available and I will only give you bread and water an occasionally a piece of chocolate.  Should you be grateful because I renovated your kitchen? But say, if I leave in 20 years, you are finally free, you can still use all of the appliances. But you have no idea how to, because you were never taught. It will take you 2-3 months to learn how to use all of them. But at least you are grateful for having them, I guess?The only reason we can talk about the good impact of the empires on the colonized lands is because **the empires are gone**C) I think youre forgetting about Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini, Ceau?escu, Pinochet, Mao Zedong, Kim Sung and so one. Opinion on dictators is not skewed by Hitler. It is skewed by the big number of modern dictators who committed crimes against humanity on their own people and installed a cult of personality presenting themselves as gods. D) I dont see how thats in any way relevant to the thesis dictatorship good \\nE) Discourse on specific dictatorships also tends to be extremely imbalanced. From 1990 to 2015, more people were lifted out of poverty than in any 25 year period in recorded history. A large proportion of this stemmed from China. And you think under a democracy China wouldnt be lifted out of poverty? This sounds like a moot argument. China also has very low crime rates, and you can be safe at night in a major Chinese city and it would be hard to say the same for San Francisco or London. How do you know that pray tell? China has not freedom of press. The crimes simply arent reported, just swept under the rug in hidden by the Gouvernment. China also does a much more effective job of public transport than, say, the UK where I live. See the argument above.China also has consistently strong economic growth rates, even in 2023 when the news was filled with talk of China's supposed economic disaster the GDP grew by 5%. Forced economy grown rates where the population are estially modern slaves. I wouldnt call that positive. \\nF)But the sacrifice isnt worth it.

All of that natural gas that Russia is so famous for exporting has been sent eastward instead of westward. It is not really possible for them to replace the European natural gas market with China, or anyone else for that matter. They CAN sell it to other countries, but they will never make the same amount of money they did selling it to Europe - not close.They are getting closer and more cozy with China. We have pushed them into Chinas arms.Unless you want to ignore every year after 1991 of them getting closer and closer to China, this is true. In actuality, this relationship already existed and would continue to exist regardless of anything. We are providing China with a cheap source of fuel that was once destined for Europe.The Chinese do not and have never desperately needed that gas and they would have just bought it anyways if they did- it's not like Russian gas supplies are known for their small quantities. They could and did easily sell gas to Europe and China at the same time. Russian gas is entirely replaceable as well and people just kept buying it because they were lazy + they'd NEVER start a war while we were buying their gas, right?It has been American policy since the Cold War to keep Russia and China separated, as an alliance between them is the only one that has the potential to overthrow an American-led world order. Thats why Nixon went to China, and why every successor of his continued that policy. Now weve united them against us to help Ukraine fight a war that it is unable to win.China does not actually give a single shit if Russia conquers Ukraine or not. They're just doing it to spite the west and entrap the Russians deeper into their own pocket (which was happening anyways)- make no mistake, the Chinese are the dominant partners in the relationship.I fail to see how letting Russia conquer Ukraine improves our geopolitical standing whatsoever. Russian propagandists and even Russians I loosely know or see talking would not be satiated with just Ukraine. Many consider the Soviet Union to have been basically stolen from them and recently-ish there's been a small but existant revival of Russian claims to ALASKA, of all places. Will they follow through?

Let's look at why:First, your own point about succession actually argues FOR democracy. You mention how the Roman Empire suffered from terrible rulers just because of bloodline. That's exactly what democracy solves - we don't have to roll the dice on whether the next leader will be Marcus Aurelius or Commodus. We can choose competent leaders and remove incompetent ones.The examples you cite of \\"successful\\" dictatorships are cherry-picked moments in time. For every Emperor Wu, there are dozens of corrupt dictators who drove their countries into the ground. For every Paul Kagame, there's a Robert Mugabe. China also has very low crime rates, and you can be safe at night in a major Chinese cityThis safety comes at the cost of massive surveillance, social credit systems, and brutal police repression. I'd rather deal with some crime than live in a digital prison.The economic success you mention in China isn't because of dictatorship - it's because they adopted market reforms. South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan achieved similar or better results while transitioning to democracy. Western attempts to export democracy to other countries have been calamitous (Iraq)Iraq failed because of poor implementation, not because democracy itself doesn't work. Look at post-WW2 Germany and Japan - both successful transitions from dictatorships to democracies.The fundamental problem with dictatorship is that power corrupts. Even if you get a \\"good\\" dictator, there's nothing stopping them from becoming bad - and then you're screwed. At least in a democracy, we have checks and balances and can vote out bad leaders before they do too much damage.The real question isn't whether democracy is perfect (it's not), but whether it's better than the alternatives.

You should listen to Jeffrey Sachs and John Mearsheimer. John in particular is a renown scholar and advisor to the US and his political theories are required reading in many ivy league programs.?\\nI'll try to condense their agreements here though:\\n1. You have to understand what the war was about to begin with. In the west, we're told Putin is a war mongering dictator who's deeply interested in expanding his empire and recreating the Soviet Union. This is just not true and there's no evidence for that. Every recent war Russia has engaged in on it's own borders has been reactionary. Reactionary of course, to NATO expansion. This is a really important point to understand. If Putin was really interested in expanding he should have been systemically conquering nations long before NATO expanded to his own border he has yet to conquer a single nation.?\\n2. The United states WANTS this war. They're interested in shoving NATO down Russia's throat. NATO does the US's bidding as the largest funder with no close second. The United States profits from wars and strategically leans towards keeping adversaries engaged in proxy wars. The US has no loss here. Most of the aid will be paid back, no us? citizens or soldiers are at risk and they have first dibs on the rebuilding contacts which will certainly be lucrative and in favor of the US.\\n3. Russia DOESN'T want this war. They're rebuilding their economy and a war would tear away at that. They don't want their population to decline. Putin reached out to NATO PRIOR to attacking Ukraine with a no-NATO treaty to avoid the war. NATO refused saying it has to be an open door policy. This shows Putin was more interested in not having Ukraine join NATO than acquiring Ukrainians territory.?\\n4. The war doesn't benefit PEOPLE. Ukrainian people are dying in droves and losing the war and their territory. Russian people are dying in droves and they are losing their economy and standard of life. The American people are struggling with basic healthcare while the government and military industrial complex gets fat off this war. The average American gets nothing from this war expect a bigger budget deficit and another reason not get healthcare.\\nAll that being said, it's a no brainer that the war should not have started to begin with. Russia was always willing to negotiate but the US wanted the war. Now that Trump is in office, there's a chance to finally end the war.

This doesn't mean scissors are \\"the future of lawn care technology.\\"  It just means I'm an eccentric who wants to use a backwards tool to do something for which everybody else has far superior tools available.   The operative issue isn't whether crypto &amp; blockchain can be \\"used\\" here-or-there.  The issue is: *Is there a good reason?  Does this tech actually do anything better than what we have already been using?*  And the answer to that is, [No.](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/) 2.  Most of the time, adoption claims are outright wrong. Just because you read some press release from a dubious source does not mean any major government, corporation or other entity is embracing crypto.  It usually means someone asked them about crypto and they said, \\"We'll look into it\\" and that got interpreted as \\"adoption imminent!\\"\\n 3.  In cases where companies did launch crypto/blockchain projects they usually fall into one of these categories:\\n  * Some company or supplier put out a press release advertising some \\"crypto project\\" involving a well known entity that never got off the ground, or was tried and failed miserably (such as [IBM/Maersk's Tradelens](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/11/29/maersk-and-ibm-to-discontinue-tradelens), [Australia's stock exchange](https://www.reuters.com/markets/australian-stock-exchanges-blockchain-failure-burns-market-trust-2022-12-20/), etc.)  See also [dead blockchain projects](https://weh.wtf/34-blockchain-projects.html).\\n  * Companies (like VISA, Fidelity or Robin Hood) **are not embracing crypto directly**.  Instead they are *partnering with a crypto exchange* (such as BitPay) that will either handle all the crypto transactions and they're merely licensing their network, or they're a third party payment gateway that pays the big companies in fiat.  There's no evidence any major company is actually switching over to crypto, or that any of these major companies are even touching crypto.  It's a huge liability they let newbie third parties deal with so they have plausible deniability for liabilities due to money laundering and sanctions laws.\\n  * What some companies are calling \\"blockchain\\" is not in any meaningful way actually using 'blockchain' tech. For example, IBM's \\"Hyperledger\\" claims to have \\"[blockchain design philosophy](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/Hyperledger/Offers/Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf)\\" but in reality, it is not decentralized and has no core architecture that's anything like crypto blockchain systems. Also note that IBM has their own trademarked phrase, \\"IBM Blockchain?\\" - their version of \\"blockchain\\" is neither decentralized, nor permissionless. It does not in any way resemble a crypto blockchain. It also remains to be seen, the degree to which anybody is actually using their \\"IBM Food Trust\\" supply chain tracking system, which we've [proven cannot really benefit from blockchain technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&amp;t=2108s).\\n  \\n 4.  Sometimes, politicians who are into crypto take advantage of their power and influence to force some crypto adoption on the community they serve -- [this almost always fails](https://truthout.org/articles/miamis-mayor-went-all-in-on-cryptocurrency-his-constituents-suffered/), but again, crypto people will promote the press release announcing the deal, while ignoring any follow-up materials that say such a proposal was rejected. 5.  Just because some company has jumped on the crypto bandwagon doesn't mean, \\"It's the future.\\"  McDonald's bundled [Beanie Babies](https://i.imgur.com/McdwlxA.jpg) with their Happy Meals for a time, when those collectable plush toys were being billed as the next big investment scheme.  Corporations have a duty to exploit any goofy fad available if it can help them make money, and the moment these fads fade, they drop any association and pretend it never happened.  This has already occurred with many tech companies from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613) to [Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/microsoft-is-shutting-down-its-azure-blockchain-service/), to [a major consortium of European corporations who pulled the plug on their blockchain projects](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/major-insurers-pull-the-plug-on-b3i-insurance-blockchain-consortium/).  Even though these companies discontinued any association with crypto years ago, proponents still hype the projects as if they're still active.\\n 6. Crypto ETFs are not an endorsement of crypto. (In fact part of the US SEC [was vehemently against approving ETFs - it was not a unanimous decision](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023))  They're simply ways for traditional companies to exploit crypto enthusiasts.  These entities do not care at all about the future of crypto.  It's just a way for them to make more money with fees, and just like in #4, the moment it becomes unprofitable for them to run the scheme, they'll drop it.  It's simply businesses taking advantage of a fad.  Crypto ETFs though are actually worse, because they're a vehicle to siphon money into the crypto market -- if crypto was a viable *alternative* to TradFi, then these gimmicky things wouldn't be desirable. 7. Countries like El Salvador who claim to have adopted bitcoin really [haven't in any meaningful way.](https://reason.com/2024/10/31/a-week-of-failing-to-pay-with-bitcoin-in-el-salvador/)  El Salvador's endorsement of bitcoin is tied to a proprietary exchange with their own non-transparent software, \\"Chivo\\" that is not on bitcoin's main blockchain - and as such isn't really bitcoin adoption as much as it's bitcoin exploitation.  Plus, USD is the real legal tender in El Salvador and since BTC's adoption, [use of crypto has stagnated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-04/el-salvador-s-bitcoin-revolution-is-failing-badly).  In two years, the country's investment in BTC has yielded lower returns than one would find in a standard fiat savings account.  Also note [Venezuela has now scrapped its state-sanctioned cryptocurrency](https://www.foreignbrief.com/venezuela-to-scrap-state-cryptocurrency/)So, whenever you hear \\"so-and-so company is using crypto\\" always be suspect.  What you'll find is either that's not totally true, or if they are, they're partnering with a crypto company who is paying them for the association, not unlike an advertiser/licensing relationship.   **Not** adoption.  Exploitation.   And temporary at that.We've seen absolutely no increase in crypto adoption - in fact quite the contrary.  More and more people in every industry from [gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust) to [banking](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-federal-reserve-rejects-crypto-focused-banks-application-be-supervised-by-2023-01-27/), are rejecting deals with crypto companies.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Agree absolutely.","title":"Biden to deliver two major speeches in his final days in office"},{"text":"What about the moral right of citizens to have a say in how their country should be run?

This is what's known as an \\"Unstated Major Premise\\" fallacy.  A Naked Assertion.  Often employed as a begging-the-question fallacy.  Just because you say \\"Bitcoin is different\\" doesn't mean it is.\\n \\n 2.  There's absolutely no functional/material difference between BTC and thousands of other crypto-currencies, including versions using the exact same codebase.\\n \\n 3.  The *only* distinction BTC (currently) holds is that according to various shady, unregulated exchanges, it seems to be trading at the highest price point.  But even those figures are dubious due to the lack of transparency and oversight in the industry.  Just because one crypto is more popular, doesn't mean it's fundamentally different than others.  BTC shares 99.9% of its DNA with many cryptos including BCH, BSV and thousands of others.\\n \\n 4.  Crypto evangelists try to move the goalposts between bitcoin (the technology) and bitcoin (the \\"investment\\").   When you note that [bitcoin and most cryptos depending upon the context can pass the Howey test and be classified as securities](https://www.investopedia.com/does-crypto-pass-the-howey-test-8385183), they will reference bitcoin as a \\"technology\\" and not an investment.  And it's true, the tech itself isn't packaged as an investment, **but** various others do package crypto as an investment, and it's a pretty well established underlying concept throughout all of crypto (buy, hold, you will make money) - and those tenets are principals in the Howey test indicating there's an \\"investment contract\\" being promoted.  For example, right now the SEC may not consider BTC itself a security, but the process of staking BTC (and other cryptos) and offering a return, **[that is absolutely considered a security](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/exercise-caution-crypto-asset-securities-investor-alert)**. 5.  The **only** \\"gray area\\" when it comes to whether bitcoin is a security rests on tier 4 of the Howey Test which suggests \\"a security has to be dependent on the work of others for returns to be generated.\\"  People argue over whether bitcoin fits this description.  **BUT**, the same dynamic applies to all other cryptos as well, so there's nothing special about bitcoin in that respect.  It can also be argued that \\"the work of others\\" can be the constant recruitment of \\"greater fools\\" to buy in later, which is the dynamic of a classic [ponzi scheme](https://ioradio.org/i/ponzi/). 6.  Just because some people at the SEC, early on, said \\"bitcoin is a commodity\\" doesn't mean it will always stay classified as that way.  As we've already stated, because of the decentralized nature of these schemes, there is no one instance of \\"bitcoin\\" - depending upon how you use the crypto, you can be serving it as a security/investment, or not.  And we are seeing more and more, the SEC, the CFTC, the NYAG and other legal entities cracking down on [the use of illegal/unlicensed securities](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/sec-crypto-gemini-genesis.html).\\n \\n So anybody making blanket statements about Bitcoin being immune from securities laws is lying.  And by the way, one of the prongs of the Howey Test (as well as the identification of Ponzi Schemes) is making promises about returns, and/or misleading people as to the true nature of the risks involved.

Crypto's \\"value\\" is unreliable and highly subjective.  It cannot be used as a currency or to pay for almost anything in any major country.  It has high requirements and risk to even be traded. At best it's a speculative commodity that a very small set of people attribute value to.  That attribution is more based on emotion and indoctrination than logic, reason, evidence, and utility. 2.  Crypto is too chaotic to be any sort of reliable store of value over time.  Its price can fluctuate wildly based on everything from [market manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10984) to [random tweets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162522006333).  No reliable store of value should vary in \\"value\\" 10-30% in a single day, yet many cryptos do. 3.  Crypto's value is *extrinsic*.  Any \\"value\\" associated with crypto is based on popularity and not any material or intrinsic use.  See this [detailed video debunking crypto as 'digital gold'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&amp;t=4446s) 4.  Even gold, while being a lousy investment and also an undesirable store of value in the modern age, at least has material use and utility.  Crypto does not.  And whether you think gold's price is not consistent with its material utility, if that really were the case then gold would not be used industrially.  But it is. 5.  The supposed \\"value\\" of crypto is based on reports from unregulated exchanges, most of whom have been caught [manipulating the market](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21) and [inflation introduced by unsecured stablecoins](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21).  There's nothing \\"organic\\" or \\"natural\\" about it.  It's an illusion. 6.  The operation of crypto is a negative-sum-game, which means that in order for bitcoin/crypto to even exist, there must be a constant operation of third parties who must find it profitable to operate the blockchain, which requires the price to constantly rise, which is mathematically impossible, and the moment this doesn't happen, the network will collapse, at which point crypto will cease to exist, much less hold any value.  This has already happened to tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies. 7. Many of the most trusted, most successful entities in the world of finance do not consider crypto/bitcoin to be a reliable store of value.  Crypto is [prohibited from being used as collateral by the DTC](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2024/4/26/B20002-24.pdf) and respectable institutions such as Vanguard [do not believe crypto belongs in their investment portfolio](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think). 8.  There is not a single example of anything like crypto, which has no material use and no intrinsic value, holding value over a long period of time across different cultures.  This is **not** because \\"crypto is different and unique.\\"  It's because attributing value to an utterly useless piece of digital data that wastes tons of energy and perpetuates tons of fraud,*makes no freaking sense* for ethical, empathetic, non-scamming, non-exploitative, non-criminal people.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"IB4 Trump takes credit","title":"Higher Social Security payments coming for millions of people from bill that Biden is signing"},{"text":" Bitcoin mining can help regulate &amp; balance energy grids, build out green infrastructure, and capture stranded or wasted or toxic energy and monetize it.\\n#Crypto Talking Point #32 (stranded energy)**\\"Crypto/Bitcoin promotes renewable energy development\\"** / **\\"Crypto mining helps the energy industry\\"**There are four fundamental problems with arguing that crypto helps with energy:1.  Bitcoin's energy usage produces *absolutely nothing useful in the real world* - it's just a number guessing game to determine who wins the next block reward. It's a very expensive, energy-intensive \\"lottery\\" that is needlessly inefficient.2.  Crypto (and everybody in crypto) has an exclusive motivation is to make money.  There is no mandate to facilitate clean/renewable energy. There is no mandate to do *anything* to help others or the world. As such, crypto entities will always seek the cheapest form of energy, and it's well established at this point that fossil fuels (or stealing energy) offer the best ROI.  3.  Crypto's energy usage, specifically with schemes like \\"Proof-of-work\\" **require** energy to be expensive.  If energy was cheap and ubiquitous, it would undermine the design of blockchain and the PoW model and render it useless.4.  Any energy grid that has excess (stranded) energy that is significantly more than is typically needed, is not a grid that needs something/someone to use that energy; it's a grid that is poorly designed.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Bitcoin has become a 2Trillion dollar asset \\n#Crypto Talking Point #12 (market cap)\\"**$$$$ 'Market Cap!'**\\" / \\"**There's $x million in this project!**\\"1.  The term \\"market cap\\" is one appropriated from the stock market and is misleading and erroneous to apply to crypto.2.  Traditional market capitalization translates to \\"the value of a company as a function of its share price.\\"   This figure only has meaning if the share price is properly valued based on the actual value of the company.  There are standard established formulas for determining what a company is worth by adding up its assets and income and subtracting its liabilities.  Then to determine whether a share price is over or under-inflated, you divide that figure by the number of outstanding shares.3.  Market capitalization when shares are not manipulated, should settle at the true value of the company.  In cases where shares are manipulated (TSLA is a good example), its \\"market cap\\" is unrealistic.  In situations where insiders control a large portion of shares, they can easily manipulate the stock price, resulting in the appearance of a high net value that doesn't jive with reality.4.  Cryptocurrencies, by their nature, have no intrinsic value.  Crypto doesn't create income; it doesn't represent real-world assets.  So it has absolutely no base value in the first place by which to calculate valuation and market capitalization. 5.  In reality, nobody has any idea how much actual \\"market capitalization\\" there is in the world of crypto, since actual liquidity is obscured by phony stablecoins and shady exchanges that are neither regulated, nor transparent. In crypto, people simply multiply the coin price x the number of coins minted and declare that's the value of the crypto industry.  It's completely misleading and deceptive and in no way indicates any realistic level of capital value.For additional details see [Why Market Cap is a Meaningless &amp; Dangerous Valuation Metric in Crypto Markets](https://medium.com/blockchain-review/why-market-cap-is-a-meaningless-dangerous-valuation-metric-in-crypto-markets-8deb78c50995)","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 2:  **Don't be rude or hostile to other users.** Your comment will be removed even if most of it is solid, another user was rude to you first, or you feel your remark was justified.

Thats why Bitcoin is categorically a savings technology. \\n#Crypto Talking Point #21 (risk)\\"**Crypto has no 'Counterparty Risk'**\\" / \\"**Crypto gives you 'financial sovereignty'**\\" / \\"**Crypto has no 'middlemen'**\\"1.  \\"Counterparty Risk\\" is defined as the potential for one party in a transaction to default/fail to follow through on the transaction, and is measured in the amount of financial loss/damage that could be caused as a result.\\n2.  Satoshi claimed in his Bitcoin White Paper that one of the motivations behind creating crypto/blockchain was to eliminate counterparty risk by removing \\"middlemen\\" from the transaction, specifically financial institutions, which crypto people argue can fail and cause counterparty risk.\\n3.  Unfortunately, bitcoin/crypto/blockchain does **not** eliminate counterparty risk.  Even in situations where it's strictly a peer-to-peer digital crypto transaction, there are numerous ways in which that transaction can fail and cause counterparty risk.  Here are some examples:\\n * Lack of access to hardware necessary to process crypto (smartphones, computers, etc.)\\n * Lack of access to electricity (note that electricity is not needed to engage in a P2P fiat transaction)\\n * Lack of access to specific wallet/transactional software\\n * Lack of access to the Internet (or limited internet access due to firewalls and municipal restrictions)\\n * Faulty smart contracts\\n * Vulnerabilities or back doors in any of the software being used\\n * Not having access to the necessary private keys to execute a transaction\\n * Having the system/software/bridge you're using hacked\\n * Lack of adequate funding for transaction fees\\n * blockchain processing consortium blacklists\\n * developments in quantum computing that undermine crypto's encryption schemes\\n4.  People argue \\"holding bitcoin\\" has no counterparty risk.  This is also a lie.  Just because your wallet is secure, doesn't mean your bitcoin is secure.  Here's why:\\n * In order to even *exist* crypto is dependent upon an elaborate network of computers running 24/7 - these systems are *not* paid by crypto holders - their participation is totally voluntary.  \\n * The moment a node/mining operator doesn't find it economically viable to operate, they can cease operations, and if enough of these people do so, the operation of the blockchain ceases, and nobody will be able to access their wallets and engage in transactions\\n * In the case of bitcoin, its proof-of-work mechanism requires a lot of energy and resources to operate. If the price of BTC drops below a certain level, it no longer becomes economically viable to operate the network and **all bitcoin disappears**.\\n * Yes, bitcoin's mining difficulty will adjust to address people leaving the industry and become more modest over time, but since the primary motivation for even participating in the network is the attempt to make exponential profit, the moment BTC stops consistently moving up, is the beginning of its demise.  There's no other reason to operate the network if there isn't growth.  And BTC's growth model is 100% mathematically un-sustainable.\\n * In short: **There is no guarantee blockchain will operate forever**.  There's already 30,000+ dead cryptocurrencies that are no longer in existence.\\n5.  In reality, Bitcoin and crypto doesn't eliminate counterparty risk or middlemen.  It simply changes one set of middlemen (traditional, accountable, well-regulated financial institutions) for another set of middlemen (random, anonymous crypto operators and the software and intermediate systems they use, as well as various other local and international communication services).  Anywhere in this chain of necessary resources things can fail, either by intention, negligence, legal mandate, acts of god, or randomly, and it can cause a crypto transaction to not go through.Some people claim that crypto has less counterparty risk than traditional fiat.  This is a lie.  And they cherry-pick specific \\"perfect\\" scenarios where there's minimal counterparty risk in crypto *provided* all of the above conditions aren't a problem.  If we're going to fabricate a \\"nirvana fallacy\\" you can also have the same conditions apply to any alternate system and it too, will have \\"no counterparty risk\\" so this is a deceptive, disingenuous claim.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Hold strong, youre not alone!","title":"In His Latest Presidential Act, Biden Again Attacks Religion"},{"text":"Actions speak louder than words but actions without words are manipulatableThe messaging around his accomplishments has diminished his achievements.

While we generally believe the market will have a more permanent \\"crash\\" to significantly less than its current value, we have *no idea* when that might happen.

They offer virtually nonexistent consumer protections, and most of them have been caught manipulating the market. 3. **The crypto market is artificially inflated by unsecured stablecoins** - The basis for the majority of value attributed to crypto is primarily a function of trades with stablecoins like USDT which have never been properly audited, so there's no way to know how much actual liquidity is in the market, but also no way to stop stablecoins from being constantly printed and pumping the market. It's too manipulated to predict. 4. **Betting against the market still promotes criminal activity** - Any liquidity put into the crypto market, for or against, still benefits money laundering, cyber terrorism, human trafficking, drug cartels, sanctioned terrorist countries and numerous other types of fraud.  It's not ethical playing in the crypto market *at all*. 5. **Not everything is about making money** - Our opposition to crypto has more to do with wanting to reduce fraud and criminal activity, than it is to make money.

This is what's known as an \\"Unstated Major Premise\\" fallacy.  A Naked Assertion.  Often employed as a begging-the-question fallacy.  Just because you say \\"Bitcoin is different\\" doesn't mean it is.\\n \\n 2.  There's absolutely no functional/material difference between BTC and thousands of other crypto-currencies, including versions using the exact same codebase.\\n \\n 3.  The *only* distinction BTC (currently) holds is that according to various shady, unregulated exchanges, it seems to be trading at the highest price point.  But even those figures are dubious due to the lack of transparency and oversight in the industry.  Just because one crypto is more popular, doesn't mean it's fundamentally different than others.  BTC shares 99.9% of its DNA with many cryptos including BCH, BSV and thousands of others.\\n \\n 4.  Crypto evangelists try to move the goalposts between bitcoin (the technology) and bitcoin (the \\"investment\\").   When you note that [bitcoin and most cryptos depending upon the context can pass the Howey test and be classified as securities](https://www.investopedia.com/does-crypto-pass-the-howey-test-8385183), they will reference bitcoin as a \\"technology\\" and not an investment.  And it's true, the tech itself isn't packaged as an investment, **but** various others do package crypto as an investment, and it's a pretty well established underlying concept throughout all of crypto (buy, hold, you will make money) - and those tenets are principals in the Howey test indicating there's an \\"investment contract\\" being promoted.  For example, right now the SEC may not consider BTC itself a security, but the process of staking BTC (and other cryptos) and offering a return, **[that is absolutely considered a security](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/exercise-caution-crypto-asset-securities-investor-alert)**. 5.  The **only** \\"gray area\\" when it comes to whether bitcoin is a security rests on tier 4 of the Howey Test which suggests \\"a security has to be dependent on the work of others for returns to be generated.\\"  People argue over whether bitcoin fits this description.  **BUT**, the same dynamic applies to all other cryptos as well, so there's nothing special about bitcoin in that respect.  It can also be argued that \\"the work of others\\" can be the constant recruitment of \\"greater fools\\" to buy in later, which is the dynamic of a classic [ponzi scheme](https://ioradio.org/i/ponzi/). 6.  Just because some people at the SEC, early on, said \\"bitcoin is a commodity\\" doesn't mean it will always stay classified as that way.  As we've already stated, because of the decentralized nature of these schemes, there is no one instance of \\"bitcoin\\" - depending upon how you use the crypto, you can be serving it as a security/investment, or not.  And we are seeing more and more, the SEC, the CFTC, the NYAG and other legal entities cracking down on [the use of illegal/unlicensed securities](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/sec-crypto-gemini-genesis.html).\\n \\n So anybody making blanket statements about Bitcoin being immune from securities laws is lying.  And by the way, one of the prongs of the Howey Test (as well as the identification of Ponzi Schemes) is making promises about returns, and/or misleading people as to the true nature of the risks involved.  This is common practice with bitcoin.Bitcoin, however, is a legitimate financial innovation. All of the rules are pre-written. All of the rules are essentially immutable.

And any attempt to put more money in circulation [requires an Act of Congress to increase the debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) - it's neither arbitrary, nor easy to do.2. [Currency is meant to be *spent*, not hoarded](https://medium.com/change-your-mind/money-is-meant-to-be-spent-not-saved-9618edec676f).  A dollar today will buy what it buys.

You put it into something that can *create value* like stocks that pay dividends, real estate, etc.  Crypto creates no value and makes a lousy \\"investment.\\"  It also hasn't proven to be a hedge against anything, least of all monetary inflation.4. Over time more money is put in circulation - you pretend like this is a bad thing, but it's not done in a vacuum.  The average annual wage in 1900 was less than $4000.  In 2023 [it's more than $70,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200838/median-household-income-in-the-united-states/)!  There's more people out there and the monetary supply grows appropriately, as does wages.  You can't take one element of the monetary system completely out of context and ignore everything else.5. The causes of inflation are **many**, and the amount of money in circulation is one of the least significant factors in causing the prices of things to rise.  More prominent inflationary causes are things like: [fuel prices](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-inflation-high-causes-gas-price-outlook-forecast-2022-7), [supply chain issues](https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/supply-chain-issues-contribution-to-inflation.html), [war](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-effect-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-global-activity-and-inflation-20220527.html), environmental disasters, pandemics, and even [car dealerships](https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-dealer-markups-helped-drive-inflation-study-finds-7c1d5a2d). 6.  Sure there may be some nations that have caused out of control inflation as a result of their monetary policy (such as Zimbabwe) but comparing modern nations to third-world dictatorships is beyond absurd.7.  If bitcoin and crypto was an actually disruptive, stable, useful technology, you wouldn't need to promote lies and scare people over the existing system. The *real* reason you do this is [because nobody can find any legitimate reason to use crypto in the first place](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/).8.  Crypto ironically has more inflation in its ecosystem that is even more out of control, than in any traditional fiat system.  At least with the US Dollar, money is accounted for and fully audited and it takes an Act of Congress to increase the debt.  In crypto, all it takes is a dude printing USDT, USDC, BUSD or any of the other unsecured stablecoins to just print more out of thin air, and crypto-morons assume they're worth $1 of value.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Ofc and best of luck out there.

Whether the \\"price of crypto\\" goes up, has absolutely no bearing on whether it's.. a) A long term store of value b) Holds any intrinsic value or utility c) Or will return any value in the future\\n \\n One of the most important tenets of investing is the simple principal: Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.  People in crypto seem willfully ignorant of this basic concept.\\n \\n2.  At best, the price of crypto is a function of *popularity*, not actual value or material utility.  For more on how and why crypto makes a much worse investment than almost anything else, see this [article](https://ioradio.org/i/value/). 3.  The \\"price of crypto\\" is a heavily manipulated figure published by shady, [unregulated crypto exchanges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apklQgMauK4) that have systematically been caught [manipulating the market](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3D0dmTUCxLuQEJ39uyMFOP) from [then](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bots-drove-bitcoins-150to1000-rise-2013-paper/) to [now](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21).4.  Crypto bros love to harp about \\"inflation\\" in the fiat system, yet ironically they measure the \\"value\\" of their \\"fiat alternative\\" in fiat?  It makes absolutely no sense, unless you assume they haven't thought 2 seconds ahead from what comes out of their mouths.5.  It's the height of hypocrisy for crypto people to champion token deflation (and increased prices) while ignoring that there's over $160+ Billion in unsecured stablecoins being used to [**inflate** the value of their tokens in the crypto marketplace](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066). The \\"code is law\\" and \\"don't trust - verify\\" people seem perfectly willing to take companies like [Tether](https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-bitfinex-tether-cryptocurrency-market-manipulation-historic-value-fraud-1469640) and Circle, at face value, that they're telling the truth about asset reserves [when there's very little actual evidence](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21).6.  Not Your Fiat, Not Your Value - Just because you think the \\"value of your crypto portfolio\\" is worth $$$ *does not make that true.*  It's well known there's inadequate liquidity in this market, and most people will never be able to get their money out.  So UNLESS/UNTIL you can actually liquidate your crypto for actual real money, you have no idea what you have. You're \\"down\\" until you cash out.  Bernie Madoff's clients got monthly statements saying they were \\"making money\\" too.7.  Just because it's possible (though highly improbable) to make money speculating on crypto, this doesn't mean it's an **ethical** or reliable technique to amass wealth.  At its core, the notion that buying and holding crypto will generate reliable returns is [a de-facto ponzi scheme](https://ioradio.org/i/ponzi/).  **It's mathematically impossible for even a stastically-significant percentage of crypto holders to have any notable ROI.**  The rare exception of those who might profit in this market, do so while providing cover for everything from [cyber terrorism](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3026.html) to [human trafficking](https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/1/4/23539528/andrew-tate-arrest-jail-rape-human-trafficking).8.  It's also not true that anybody who bought crypto when it was low is guaranteed to make a lot of money.  There are thousands of ways people can lose their crypto or be defrauded along the way. And there's no guarantee just because your portfolio is \\"up\\", that you could easily cash out.9.  Want to see a better asset (that actually has utility) that's consistently out-performed Bitcoin?  [Here you go](https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22253079/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price-2021).  However, this may be another [best performing asset](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/declaration-of-financial-independence/).  10. When crypto-critics make reference to, or mock crypto price predictions, it's not because we think price is a meaningful metric.  Instead, we are amused that to you, that's all that's important, and we can't help but note how often wrong you are in your predictions.  The intrinsic value of crypto basically never changes, but it is interesting to see how hype and propaganda affects the extrinsic value.  In a totally logical world, those would both be equalized to zero, but we're not there yet, and nobody knows when/if that will happen because it's an irrational market.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"I mean that doesnt make it any less weird that Biden gave a Medal of Freedom to a billionaire mega donor, even if theyre a philanthropist","title":"GOP lawmakers hit Biden for awarding Medal of Freedom to Soros, Clinton"},{"text":"Soros is one of the worst people worldwide and from what I understand his son is even more evil.","title":"HOT TAKES: Internet Reacts to Biden's Despicable Move to Give Soros, Hillary Presidential Freedom Awards"},{"text":" The way I understand it, they are not killing the aid.

Its more likely youre actually lying about your crypto gains, or theyre trivial. 2. Whatever you can buy with crypto is extremely limited and is usually dark-market related (like drugs, gambling or shady hosting) or trivial (like coffee and t-shirts). *And* you're paying a premium making such sales over comparable sites paying in fiat. 3. If you do hold crypto that you bought for less than current market price, its more likely you think youre rich but havent actually cashed out, which remains to be seen if you actually ever will be able to. 4. There are multiple fallacies involved in this claim: The[ Gamblers Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy) that suggests because something special happened once, it can likely happen again in a predictable way, and [Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) C the notion that many people fixate on positives while ignoring the more common negatives. 5. Even assuming you have made money in the past, its a well known fact that in these cases: Past performance is no guarantee of future returns, and since youre still holding crypto, its in your interests to promote such fallacies in order to drive up the price of your holdings. Since crypto is a negative-sum-game, its impossible for even a significant amount of people who play the market, to come out ahead without the vast majority losing. Therefore its mathematically impossible that this scheme will reliably produce positive returns. 5. You may not care that your profits come as a result of fraud and others losses, and promoting everything from money laundering to human trafficking, but other (moral, ethical, empathetic) people do.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Biden's America","title":"Michael Goodwin: Joe Biden has no legacy to leave behind"},{"text":" The stock market is also highly speculative and volatile - look at Tesla's wild swings or the 2022 tech crash. Yet people still consider stocks legitimate investments.#Crypto Talking Point #17 (stocks)\\"**Crypto is just like the stock market!**\\" , \\"**Comparing crypto to stocks**\\"\\n1.  Crypto tokens are absolutely NOT like stocks.  Unlike crypto, which is just a digital abstraction, stocks represent actual ownership in real-world entities, that own assets, provide useful products and services for mainstream society, generate revenue and can pay dividends to shareholders in real money.2.  The value of a stock, while it can be \\"speculative\\" based on popularity and hype, also is based on the intrinsic value of the company's assets and business performance.  Therefore you can perform actual research and due-diligence and come up with a practical value for the shares and the assets they represent.  Crypto has no such feature.3.  Because companies are valued based on actual real-world assets and income, there's a limit to how low their share price could fall, at which point it would be economically viable to buy the whole company and liquidate it for a profit.  Crypto has no such limitation. The inherent value of crypto tokens is based at *zero* because it neither creates, nor represents any minimum base, real-world value.4.  Unlike crypto, the stock market is heavily regulated and transparent.  There are entire industries and agencies that are tasked with making sure public companies operate legitimately and legally.  Crypto has no such oversight or regulations or transparency.5.  While there are some over-valued stocks that are hype driven, and some companies whose shares are extremely risky and speculative, and OTC and option markets that are more like gambling than investing, that's not the way the stock market system normally operates.  Those highly-speculative markets and penny stocks *are the exception; NOT the rule.*  In crypto, speculation is exclusively the rule.6.  Public companies are subject to great scrutiny, and must produce regular independent audits and quarterly reports on profit and loss.  They can also be sued by their shareholders or even be held criminally liable if they lie about their business model, or even the risk factors their investors face.  Again, there is no such function or protections in the world of crypto.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"I doubt when history looks back at Joe bidens term that anyone is going to give a shit about protectionist tendencies.","title":"Biden rejected appeals of several top advisors in blocking US steel bid"},{"text":"Bernie has been consistent on his view here though throughout his life, its just that Bernie bros don't like bringing it up.

Crypto's \\"value\\" is unreliable and highly subjective.  It cannot be used as a currency or to pay for almost anything in any major country.  It has high requirements and risk to even be traded. At best it's a speculative commodity that a very small set of people attribute value to.  That attribution is more based on emotion and indoctrination than logic, reason, evidence, and utility. 2.  Crypto is too chaotic to be any sort of reliable store of value over time.  Its price can fluctuate wildly based on everything from [market manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10984) to [random tweets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162522006333).  No reliable store of value should vary in \\"value\\" 10-30% in a single day, yet many cryptos do. 3.  Crypto's value is *extrinsic*.  Any \\"value\\" associated with crypto is based on popularity and not any material or intrinsic use.  See this [detailed video debunking crypto as 'digital gold'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&amp;t=4446s) 4.  Even gold, while being a lousy investment and also an undesirable store of value in the modern age, at least has material use and utility.  Crypto does not.  And whether you think gold's price is not consistent with its material utility, if that really were the case then gold would not be used industrially.  But it is. 5.  The supposed \\"value\\" of crypto is based on reports from unregulated exchanges, most of whom have been caught [manipulating the market](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21) and [inflation introduced by unsecured stablecoins](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21).  There's nothing \\"organic\\" or \\"natural\\" about it.  It's an illusion. 6.  The operation of crypto is a negative-sum-game, which means that in order for bitcoin/crypto to even exist, there must be a constant operation of third parties who must find it profitable to operate the blockchain, which requires the price to constantly rise, which is mathematically impossible, and the moment this doesn't happen, the network will collapse, at which point crypto will cease to exist, much less hold any value.  This has already happened to tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies. 7.  There is not a single example of anything like crypto, which has no material use and no intrinsic value, holding value over a long period of time across different cultures.  This is **not** because \\"crypto is different and unique.\\"  It's because attributing value to an utterly useless piece of digital data that wastes tons of energy and perpetuates tons of fraud,*makes no freaking sense* for ethical, empathetic, non-scamming, non-exploitative, non-criminal people.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Sure, but that doesn't mean they'd agree with literally any change you could make.

Im not a researcher but I know enough to know as we are learning more about our emotional struggles, patterns are emerging.A perspective to consider is that the parenting methods employed by baby boomers may have influenced the attachment styles observed in millennials. For instance, the concept of helicopter parenting, often associated with baby boomer parents, involves closely managing their childrens lives, potentially impacting the development of their childrens attachment styles. Additionally, some therapists and commentators have critiqued both millennial and boomer parenting styles, noting differences in openness to feedback and emotional responsiveness.

You say at least gold has some use, in additional to it's psychological status as a reserve asset, well so does bitcoin, you can reliably transact large volumes of it with low fees anywhere in the world.As a currency most are not stable, although nothing is, look at recent levels of inflation. Just holding lots of cash would have been unwise. Yes crypto volatility is on another level, but if you zoom out, the big crypto projects are trending up. The market just hasn't decided what the proper value is, but it may stabilise one day.Another poster mentioned how 'crypto' is like the Internet. You may not know which projects will win, but you know that blockchain and the tech in general is significant, so a lot of the investment is driven by that.You have to look beyond 1 or 5 or 10 years as a horizon. Zooming out a bit, it's obvious that money should go from metal to paper to digits, but who verifies in the digital world? To understand crypto you have to understand what it is trying to solve. When you transact national currencies, you transact something of no intrinsic value, backed by a promise of the state, the Fed or the BoE can print more and devalue your money. They can take it from you, the state can tell banks to cut off your account. To transact, you have to trust Banks (and Visa), who profit not only from transaction fees but from investing and lending your money by holding it in fractional reserve. Those investments didn't go so well in 2007, and what was the response? QE, i.e. printing money, same with the pandemic. Your cash is going to 0 when measured in houses and cars.So Bitcoin and crypto is an effort to create money that cannot be inflated away, cannot be cut off, cannot be taken away (if you memorise your keys), where transactions are validated trustlessly, eliminating the need for banks, visa, etc., the transactions can travel anywhere and don't recognise borders. Now it's true ultimate success in this is someway off as people are still wary and trust traditional finance more. It's also true it's a wild west full of scams. But the investment is driven by the promise of this new, superior financial technology.Today the banks verify your transactions, the government records who owns property. Neither might be true in the future.

Quantitative easing (printing money) causes inflation because a greater money supply devalues the existing money supply.

Similarly, many securities (stocks and bonds) also have to be regulated.

Were looking at a pattern  not an anomalous event. It seems his selling out of his own people (and the glee with which he did it  he wasnt just dragged along) was very much part of his character from an early age; his actions were not a momentary diversion from morality  the actions of a soft-brained, manipulated child  but rather a harbinger of what was to come. Soros international business practices (the crashing of nations currencies, the undermining of borders and national sovereignty in the U.S. and in Europe, Soros DAs deployed throughout the U.S., the funding of Social Justice organizations through the Open Society Foundations causing enormous cultural and political upheaval, and the reveling in all the suffering caused by the aforementioned while basking in the personal monetary gain). Worth noting, the age of reason in the US (the ability to tell right from wrong) is generally regarded as 7 with a rebuttable presumption for all kids of being able to distinguish right from wrong at below the age of 14. Every US state has provisions to charge a child as an adult, especially in a capital crime, and its generally 14 or 15. A school shooter in Georgia was just charged as an adult  14 years old.US law isnt controlling in European countries, but it sheds light on just how much latitude we should be giving young Soros for doing something that was morally contemptible.  Further, Soros doesnt look back on what he did with enormous regret; he attempts to justify it and admits that he quite enjoyed that period of his life, thereby lending credence to the notion that he was an evil seed and sociopath from the beginning.","title":"JOE BIDEN JUST GAVE A PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM TO GEORGE SOROS!"},{"text":"Inflation is low and we have the best economy in the world.","title":"Biden rejected appeals of several top advisers in blocking U.S. Steel bid"},{"text":"Cements?

Big names like Tesla and Square have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon, viewing it as a shield against inflation. Plus, adding cryptocurrencies to an investment mix can spice things up, especially in unpredictable economic climates.2. **More Than Just Currency**  \\nYou mentioned that cryptocurrencies dont have much practical use, but theres a lot happening in that space! For example:  \\n- **Smart Contracts:** With platforms like Ethereum, you can set up automated contracts that kick in when certain conditions are met. Its a game-changer for a ton of industries.\\n- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** This exciting area is shaking up traditional finance. Imagine lending and borrowing money without any middlemen involved!  \\n- **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):** These digital gems are opening new doors for artists, musicians, and collectors alike, creating vibrant new markets.3. **The Possibility of Regulations**  \\nIts true that the crypto world has had its share of scams and wild swings, but the good news is that theres growing attention on regulation. Many countries are working on establishing clear rules for cryptocurrencies, which can bring more stability and enhance protection for investors.4. **Looking Back**  \\nYou compared crypto to the tulip craze of the 1600s, but its key to remember that cryptocurrency is constantly evolving! Unlike tulips, these digital currencies are rooted in solid technology and a big, growing user base. Just as people were skeptical about the internet at first, cryptocurrency is getting its fair share of scrutiny before it potentially becomes a household name.5. **Greener Energy Solutions**  \\nI totally understand your concerns about energy use, but the industry is making strides towards sustainability. A lot of cryptocurrencies are shifting from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake models, which can drastically cut down their energy consumption. For instance, Ethereum's move to Ethereum 2.0 is all about lowering its carbon footprint. 6. **Thinking Long-Term**  \\nWhen it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, keeping a long-term outlook is key. Sure, early investors in Bitcoin saw some significant ups and downs, but many ended up enjoying impressive gains over time. Like with any investment, trying to guess the perfect timing is tough; however, those who held onto their assets during the rough patches often saw great rewards when the market bounced back.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"The nonsense as you call it is from Soros himself.","title":"JOE BIDEN JUST GAVE A PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM TO GEORGE SOROS!"},{"text":"Or written another way: George Soros gave a presidential medal of freedom to George Soros.People like to speculate who Bidens puppet masters have been, since everyone with half a brain knew from 2019 that he was slipping into dementia.

Greiz is the only plant of the paper manufacturer where high-quality recycled paper is produced.

About half of the Americans killed in that war died on Nixon. For that, Nixon was rewarded with his 1972 landslide.Republicans in general complained in 1998 when Bill Clinton bombed Iraq for violating WMD terms around the time of the impeachment that Clinton was using war against Iraq to wag the dog. Once in power two years later, Republicans implemented the now-infamous PNAC agenda of attacking seven Mideast nations in five years. Republicans were stopped from attacking Iran by Democrats who took a strong stand against it in February 2007 after they won Congress. Once Barack Obama got into office, he worked tirelessly to bring peace to the situation with Iran. Years later, there was a peace deal.Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 on being an outsider and antiwar. Once in office, Trump broke the Iran deal and declared Jerusalem the capitol of Israel, setting the stage for things that have happened since. Trump also created the Space Force--straight of of the old PNAC agenda and boasted about 'rebuilding the military'--the very buzzwords of PNAC.The 'parties shifted' thing is Republican propaganda.","title":"Scoop: Biden discussed plans to strike Iran nuclear sites if Tehran speeds toward bomb"},{"text":"Like half the the points this sub actively criticizes the left over frequently, Contra has brought up in a video somewhere (as criticism).

Given how the rest of the world has reacted to the war in Ukraine I fear the global south would be against us or at best remain neutral.Also I'm not sure it would be a one front war, Russia would have to join China.

Also, given how much the US is struggling with warship production at a time where we already need to modernize our fleet, I'm terribly uncertain war time would change that quickly.All of this is assuming we aren't betrayed by ethno-nationalist governments in Europe who're mostly pro-Russia and anti-America, with populations that are being brain-washed as we speak through Russian and Chinese influence campaigns. Go look at polling for these pro-Putin parties in France and Germany if you don't believe me. That would leave us all alone with our \\"special relationship\\" allies like the UK, Poland, Israel, Japan, SK, Taiwan, Canada and Australia. We let Russia and China dig themselves into Africa basically unchallenged, most of LATAM is aligned with Russia or China already, Europe has already started falling (Hungary, Slovakia, Romania) to Russian influence and Asia is too afraid of being left out in the cold with China to do anything.I'm fairly certain that if WW3 were to break out within the next few years, the free world would lose.","title":"Biden rejected appeals of several top advisors in blocking US steel bid"},{"text":"On moving out he tried to withhold the security deposit because I fixed the washing machine that wasn't working when I moved in","title":"Whats the weirdest or most unreasonable demand a landlord has ever made?"},{"text":"Im not sure, I havent seen them in 2 months.

Let's imagine this scenario unfolding:**The Setting:**  \\nPicture a bustling marketplace along the banks of the Nile River during the New Kingdom period (circa 1550C1077 BCE). Stalls are laden with goods like grains, spices, textiles, pottery, and ornate jewelry. The air is filled with the aromas of roasting meats, fresh bread, and fragrant oils.**The Encounter:**  \\nYou, a time traveler from the 21st century, find yourself amidst this vibrant scene. Curiously, you present a Honey Nut Cheerioa small, golden, honey-flavored oat cereal ringto a local Egyptian artisan.**The Ancient Egyptian's Reaction:**1. **Visual Perception:** The Cheerio's circular shape and shiny surface might catch the artisan's eye, perhaps reminiscent of common items like coins or decorative jewelry. The bright honey hue could be associated with gold or amber-colored ornaments.2. **Texture and Taste:**  \\n   - **Texture:** The cereal's crunch would be a novel sensation. Ancient Egyptians were accustomed to different textures in their foods, such as the softness of bread or the chewiness of dates and figs. The Cheerio's crispness might intrigue or surprise them.\\n   - **Taste:** Honey was a valued sweetener in ancient Egypt, often used in cooking, preservation, and as offerings to deities. The honey flavor of the Cheerio could be familiar and appealing, evoking pleasant associations.3. **Cultural Interpretation:**  \\n   - **Symbolism:** The circular shape might be interpreted symbolically. Circles often represented eternity or the sun in Egyptian iconography. The artisan might wonder if the Cheerio had any ritualistic or symbolic significance.\\n   - **Practical Use:** Curious about its purpose, the artisan might consider whether the Cheerio was a form of currency, a decorative item, or perhaps a type of preserved food.4. **Conversation and Exchange:**  \\n   - **Communication Barriers:** Assuming a language barrier, non-verbal cues would be essential. Gestures of offering and tasting could bridge the communication gap.\\n   - **Curiosity and Sharing:** If the artisan tastes the Cheerio, they might compare it to local foods like granola-like mixtures or sweetened bread. Mutual curiosity could lead to an exchange of culinary knowledge, with you perhaps sharing insights about oats and modern food processing techniques.**Broader Implications:**  \\nThis encounter highlights the vast differences and surprising similarities between ancient and modern societies. While the Honey Nut Cheerio is a mass-produced, processed cereal designed for convenience and nutrition in today's fast-paced world, the ancient Egyptian's food sources were primarily based on agriculture, with a strong emphasis on grains like barley and emmer wheat.Moreover, this scenario underscores the enduring human appreciation for sweet flavors and crunchy textures, suggesting that despite the passage of time, certain tastes and sensory experiences remain universally appealing.**Reflection:**  \\nSuch a moment would be a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of human culture and the enduring nature of culinary traditions. It emphasizes how objects, no matter how seemingly mundane, carry with them stories of their origins, purposes, and the people who created and used them.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I honestly don't recall the exact time but ye it was summer so around that time. \\nWhy?","title":"Health &amp; EMFs / 5G"},{"text":"Corrupt police in America?

That is the fucking difference. Clinton was negligent, Trump was willful. The accusation against clinton, verbatim from James Comey is:Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a persons actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.They didn't bring a case because she did not willfully mishandle the documents. Full stop, end of discussion. She was negligent, but as odd it seems, negligence is not a crime when it comes to classified material for civilians.This is not true of Trump.

Please think through this logically.They find a document at biden's old office. What does he do? He *immediately allows them to search everywhere*. He doesn't hide anything, they find other documents. Does that sound willful? Does it sound like he's trying to keep the US government from having those documents? Or does it sound like, at worst, he was negligent?But the hypocrisy didnt start there. Youre putting a lot of emphasis on subpoenas and ignoring them.Hillary received a subpoena. Did she ignore it?

The staff there didn't do it in Dec 2014 as was requested. On March 2nd clinton was subpoena'd by the house. One of her staffers e-mailed PRN mentioning their request. The staffer at PRN then panicked because he hadn't wiped the server, and wiped the server. 'She' didn't do anything. She followed normal procedures for dealing with an e-mail server (you wipe it because otherwise weirdos start thinking your pizza orders are part of a pedo cabal) and someone didn't do their job when they were supposed to.This has been public information for a decade at this point. Did you not know this? If so, does it bother you that you don't know basic facts about something you feel so strongly about?And my main point, do I think Trump didnt take documents?

Omg, what is this private email server doing in my basement?!?!

You obviously forgot the pandemic happened. Trump supporters say that you can't blame him for that, but he mismanaged it right from the start. Trump actively downplayed the danger (saying that it would just blow over) and undermined the advice from medical experts during their press conferences. He had been explicitly warned of the predictions of a pandemic emanating from Asia during the handover from the Obama administration, and yet the first thing he did was disband the group that was supposed to plan for a pandemic response. This resulted in the impact being worse than it could have been. But hey, we can't blame Trump rightHowever, Trump supporters have no problems at all in blaming Biden for the economic aftermath of the pandemic on top of the worldwide inflation in energy prices that happened after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He had to restart the economy and fix the massive unemployment. The US did much better at this compared to pretty much all other countries in the world (although I think a lot of that is because the economy dropped harder during the pandemic than other countries so it had to bounce back further to get back to normal).

Its most recent appraisal puts it at $33 million. Trump valued it at $426-612 million.The reason why it is worth so little is because back in 1995 Trump  signed a deed of conservation and a preservation easment. He ceded the right to use the property for anything other than a social club. If you look at the other properties deed and restricted in such a fashion in Palm Beach, all are valued in the same manner.The thing is, Trump **agreed** with the lower valuation in 2020, because it is the correct valuation. Trump's absurd (and illegal) 400+ million numbers were based on what the property could be worth if he here to subdivide it up for construction. He **cannot legally do that** so valuing it as if he can is fraud. It's just fraud.Bank testified that they agreed with the valuation and were paid the loan back in full plus interest and would do business with them again.For a guy who was 'totally' a democrat you sure speak pretty much entirely in republican talking points.Just to be clear, this doesn't matter. If I lie on a bank form to get them to give me money and I pay back the loan, its still fraud.This is important because one of the reasons we criminalize fraud is that it hurts everyone who does things fairly.

Did he go rouge against Biden, or were these specific charges only brought so the Dems could parade around see, no bias in charging people here in order to undermine claims of a two tiered justice system? Clearly Biden knew that even if the sweetheart plea deal fell through due to a pesky judge, that he could always pardon him on the backend regardless.Because he didn't?Hunter was investigated by Weiss, the AG of Delaware appointed by Trump specifically to target Hunter. Weiss was kept on by Biden (when typically all AG's are canned in each admin) and later given Special Counsel status by Garland after republican whinging.Weiss has repeatedly stated that he had total prosecutorial discression in the case and answered to no one in the biden administration before or after he was nominated SC.And to be clear, the 'sweetheart plea deal' fell through well before that.What actually happened was that Biden made a deal with AG Weiss' office to please guilty to one specific charge. The office agreed to defer prosecution on the remaining investigations. Republicans found out about this, and started with the aformentioned whinging, including threatening to bring AG Weiss before congress to answer questions.Then they got two 'whistleblowers' who claimed that no actually, the whole investigation was being controlled by Merrick Garland. These whistleblowers flatly lied about Weiss (claiming he had asked for and been refused SC status).As a result of political pressure, Weiss reneged on his deferred prosecution agreement, but did not make that clear before they got to court. So Biden went in thinking \\"I have an agreement for X,Y,Z\\" and the prosecution believed it was only for \\"X\\". As a result the judge had to trash the agreement because you can't approve a plea agreement where the two sides don't agree on what the plea deal actually means.Oh &amp; in the DOJ investigation report it clearly states that it was found that Hunter acted as an unregistered foreign agent, which is a FARA violation, yet no charges were brought against him for a clear violation of federal law. If its the political witch hunt you claim it is, then why not? Who could that possibly implicate? Hmmm I wonder.Can you link me to this 'DOJ report'? To my knowledge no such report exists, nor would it make sense for one to exist. DOJ policy is not to accuse someone of crimes that they are not charged with (a policy they broke with Clinton, of course) because that would deny the person the right to face the accusation in court.You may be mistaking it for the [House Oversight Report](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Joint-Report.pdf), but I find that particularly low quality toilet paper entirely unconvincing given the numerous factual errors riddled throughout it up to and including the fact that it references 'witnesses' who have since been arrested for lying to the government about Hunter Biden.","title":"CMV: The actions of the democrats over the last 4-6 years, up against the rhetoric makes me question if I can ever vote/support a democrat again."},{"text":"Well, if you find it useful, keep reading the Free Beacon and its offerings of American Gas Association press releases thinly disguised as news.

Some of the hypocrisy almost made my head explode.People giving speeches at the Democrat convention saying If trump wins hell weaponize the justice system to go after political opponents while quite literally supporting the weaponization of the justice system to go after Trump.So I saw in your post history that you don't think that the classified documents case was a big deal and I'd like to change your mind on it.It seemed to me that your main issue with the classified documents stuff was the difference in treatment between Trump and Biden, so I'm going to hit that. Here is a quick breakdown:**Biden:**Classified documents were found at the Penn Biden center while lawyers were cleaning out the office. They alerted NARA who got the DOJ involved. Biden immediately consented to searches of all his properties. During these searches a few other documents were found.Biden sat and gave depositions regarding the documents and allowed full access to anyone in his inner circle for the purposes of the investigation. In the end the issue boiled down to two things, the loose docs, and Biden's journals.The loose documents were 100% negligent. If Biden were in the military, this would have been a violation of the UCMJ and he'd have gone to jail. However, the civilian laws on state secrets basically don't criminalize negligence. One of them makes mention of gross negligence, but if you dig into the history, it is like the logan act, it never gets charged and probably isn't constitutional. As such, all the loose documents are a wash. You need to *intend* to withhold them, and Biden clearly didn't.The journals are a different matter. Biden knew he had them (he mentioned 'all the classified stuff is downstairs' to his autobiographer) and intended to keep them. But the critical thing here is that there is a precedent dating back to Reagan saying that things like private journals can be kept by the office holder after leaving office, even if they may contain classified material. It has never been tested for the VP, but it is reasonable to believe that Biden believed he had authorization to have those documents. No intent, no crime.**Trump**:Trump took a bunch of documents home from the white house. These included dozens of classified documents. This is not in dispute.NARA noticed a bunch of presidential records were missing, such as the letter Trump got from Kim Jong Un and demanded them back. Trump dicked around for a year and then finally returned documents he was legally required to return. During their review of these boxes, NARA found classified documents. They freaked out and called the DOJ. The FBI opened an investigation.The DOJ demanded trump immediately return all classified material as he was not authorized to have it. He dicked around for a couple of months and refused to authorize a search (the way biden did). The DOJ brought together a grand jury and received a subpoena **legally requiring** Trump to turn over all documents marked with classification markings. This means even if he psychically declassified them (which he did not) it doens't matter, the subpoena is for documents with classified markings.Trump did not respond to the subpoena for nearly a month. Eventually he convened with his lawyers and talked about how they should just hide the documents and say they had none. His lawyers adivsed against this. As trump was asking for advice on how to do a crime, this breached the attorney client privilege, which is how we know about this.Trump has his stooge Walt Nauta move the documents to his residence. Trump took some of them and sent the rest back. Trump then sent his lawyer to 'get the documents' and returned a small envelope (double wrapped because they were classified, again defeating the 'I totally declassified them' argument) full of documents to the government.The government knew that Trump had not abided by the subpoena and conducted a search of Mar-a-Lago seizing more than a hundred additional documents.So what is the difference? Intent. Trump had classified material, he did not return it, even in face of a subpoena. He obstructed justice in order to illegally retain documents he was not allowed to have (including nuclear secrets that are covered by statute which he could not have declassified).With Trump the intent is crystal clear. That is why he was charged and Biden was not. Because the charge is **willful retention** not **being a messy fuck**.","title":"CMV: The actions of the democrats over the last 4-6 years, up against the rhetoric makes me question if I can ever vote/support a democrat again."},{"text":"Because it was a partisan bill and the bill Op is discussing was bipartisan.","title":"CMV: Conservatives should be mad at Trump for killing the border bill."},{"text":"Reminder: Michael J Fox was bullied by fucking Rush Limbaugh in the same exact way Trump bullied the reporter who was physically challenged.

He got more votes, but there was no one else to get any.  you seem to be misinformed- there were other people in those primaries. millions of votes went to those other people. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Results     Lying about his mental state and propping him up as a candidate is subterfuge. Would you be annoyed if you voted for a candidate and later found out they were unfit for the job? Especially after any time their fitness was questioned you were labeled a fascist?  again, what on earth does this have to do with democracy? lying is not antidemocratic. biden's old age was readily apparent. he's the president, it's not like nobody ever saw him. people gave their opinions that his old age, as everyone could freely perceive, wasn't a big deal. you can believe that they were being genuine in those opinions or not (you don't have any evidence that they weren't), but it's not antidemocratic to lie about your opinion regarding observable facts.  \\nalso, i don't think anyone called anyone a fascist for questioning his fitness unless you did so as to argue for Trump as an alternative. and if you did that then yeah, you are a fascist. not antidemocratic to say that (nor would be false accusations of fascism).   The party always appoints the candidate. Thats how the primaries work. Voters pick some delegates and theres some superdelegates but the nominee is chosen by the party at the convention.  yes, if we're going to that level of analysis, that's true. it's also true about every single primary ever, so it's a complete moot point.   Lying about the wellness of a candidate to hand their delegates to someone else at the convention isnt necessarily democratic.  \\nwhat are you even alleging here, exactly? the point of \\"\\"lying\\"\\" about his wellness was to get him elected, not Harris.    It doesnt matter who Biden wants in his place, the people vote. He doesnt get to choose his successor.  uh, yeah, he does and he did. i'm not sure if the delegates were required to listen to him, but he made his views known and they listened. what more democratic way to decide the successor other than to listen to the man chosen by the voters to be their representative? i'm guessing you'll say \\"have another primary\\", but there was absolutely no time. either that or \\"open convention where the delegates vote freely\\", which would be less democratic, nobody voted for the delegates as their representative, they voted for Joe Biden as their representative.   You are oblivious if you dont know Trump is going to focus on illegal immigration and the border, that hes looking to get rid of bureaucrats in the DOGE initiative, and hes going to take a more US-centric foreign policy especially toward conflicts in Ukraine or Israel.  those aren't policies. the fact that that's as specific as you can get proves my point.   Your last paragraphs are exactly what makes the democrats look bad. They cant point to their own records. Its all histrionics about Trump being trillions of times worse and other nonsense. Claiming that the boogeyman is coming and giving the middle finger to the majority of people isnt a winning strategy.  campaigns are all about comparisons.  \\ni'm not really interested in your opinion on 'winning strategies' - did I say anything that was actually *false*?","title":"CMV: The actions of the democrats over the last 4-6 years, up against the rhetoric makes me question if I can ever vote/support a democrat again."},{"text":"Then go to the fact that senator Joe Biden wrote the Crime Bill and you can watch videos of him talking so poorly of people who use crack, bragging that he passed laws that will make it so people caught with a crack rack will be sentenced to 30+ years in prison.

Poverty stricken African American trying to make a buck? Sorry, dirty drug addict, 30 years in a cage, no parole.Joe Bidens son, smoking 100s of thousand worth of crack, breaking federal law by lying on a gun form and evading millions in taxes? 11 year blanket pardon! No repercussion, he just fell victim to addiction, dont you have a family member with addiction problems? Cmon give the kid a break.Do you think it might be possible that Joe Biden had a change of heart in the three decades since that bill? [In 2020](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/521326-biden-says-1994-crime-bill-was-a-mistake-during-abc-town-hall/) he admitted as much, saying that the crime bill was a mistake.Isn't this exactly what you'd want to see a person do? They get information that a policy they supported is bad and they revise their stance on said policy?As for the specifics of Hunter Biden, keep in mind some important facts.1. Hunter didn't evade taxes, he failed to report and pay them. This sounds the same, but it isn't. Evasion is when you attempt to hide income. What Hunter did was be a crackhead who didn't pay his taxes. Then, when confronted, he paid his taxes. This is almost never punishable, as seen by Steve Bannon doing the same thing and not even facing charges.2. No one is ever arrested for videos of them smoking crack. The crime is possession, and by the time the videos were leaked about Biden he was already in rehab. 3. The gun charge in question is *never* charged by itself. It is only ever charged in connection with violent felonies. Something like 20 million americans have violated that exact same law.With all three in mind it is easy to see that the charges against Hunter Biden were political in nature, Republicans tried to hurt biden politically by harassing his sone through the legal system. That is fucked up and the exact reason the pardon exists.Issue with point 1: Ill caveat with if I was in Bidens position, theres no scenario in the universe where Im not getting my son out of prison time if I have the power and ability to do so. But they couldnt even do this right. Had they just been honest from the start, sure partisan right wingers would bitch moan but deep down wed know they understand. But lying for months that there is no pardon, we respect the justice system and sending out all the messengers, congressmen/senators, news anchors to harp on the fact oh look at this, such a contrast between Biden and Trump, Biden respects the rule of law All these news anchors look like absolute fools twisting themselves into pretzels to justify lying for months.For what it is worth, I genuinely believed that Biden meant it when he said it in June, because I think he assumed that America had moral decency and wouldn't re-elect trump.The simple reality is that Biden is staring down the barrel of leaving this world with his last remaining son in the crosshairs of a sociopath. Trump et al have bene explicit that they intended to target Hunter for further charges when they come into office as retribution for charges against Trump. When Biden said \\"I will not pardon my son\\" I think he meant it. But seeing a man literally threatening your son? Nah.And the kicker, the party of democracy, threw out 14 million primary votes and appointed there candidate by having Nancy pelosi and a few rich donors decide in a back room behind closed doors. No open primary, no voice for us democrats primary voters, essentially shut up, youll vote for who we tell you who to vote for, what are you gonna do, vote for trump?!You realize that by the point Biden dropped out the mechanism for replacing him was to hold an internal party vote. You can't rerun a massive primary weeks away from the convention, so your options are to hold a vote on the convention floor, or hold one in advance.They did the latter. The democratic party delegates voted for Kamala Harris, which is exactly what would have happened at the convention weeks later. It just would have wasted a lot of time that she could have been campaigning.Literally the same thing would have happened had Biden been struck by lightening.

Afghanistan withdrawal, inflation, progressive DAs letting criminals run a muck, the border being left open, which wasnt an accident. Biden rescinded many many EOs on day one on the border.

I say this because you went from Hillary and Bernie to Trump, so its a bit confusing. Nevertheless, I do want to address some of your points here because I think you might be a little biased as a recent Trump supporter. With regards to your first point that no ones above the law, This is not limited to a Democratic talking point. This was also a major GOP talking point up until the 2024 election when they had to pull it back for obvious reasons. If you remember, this was a major Republican talking point back in 2016 when the GOP tried to convince everyone that Hillary had broken the law with the storing of her emails and should be prosecuted. Of course we know that these accusations vanished after she lost the election, and President Trump and Republicans did not even bother try to pass an actual law that would have made storing classified emails on a private server a crime moving forward. With regards to the pardon of Bidens son, I agree with you that there shouldve been more transparency there. However, it wasnt until this summer that Biden would have known whether or not he needed to pardon his son. Remember, most people arent prosecuted on the gun charges that were brought against Hunter Biden, and of those who are, they dont typically get prison time. Similar for the tax issues. In fact, there was a plea deal for the tax issues that was overturned because the Republicans cried foul. (Lets not forget that Trump has now been convicted on tax fraud. And hell likely get away with it.) I truly believe that if Hunter Biden was not going to get prison time, his father would not have pardoned him. However, given the fact that he has been prosecuted in an attempt to hurt his father, I do think Biden had to pardon him. Obviously, when this decision was made this summer, Biden could not share his plans without her ruining the Democrats chances in the election. I think its disingenuous to say that the Republicans wouldve just moaned and grounded, but would eventually understand. They wouldve started a circus and tried to impeach Biden and wasted taxpayer dollars in an effort to paint him as a crook.Your point number two is more concerning to me. The United States is supposed to be a democracy. It shouldnt just be one party who is the party of democracy. So, if you believe that the Democrats are supposed to be the party of democracy then why would you support the Republicans at all? At the time Biden dropped out of the election. There was not enough time to have another primary so what would your solution be? Kamala was on the ticket that won the primary. No other candidate would have been. Additionally, RFK is not a Democrat. Hes a libertarian, which is closer on the political spectrum to the Republican Party.  Its disingenuous to say that RFK was locked out of the democratic primary. Neither he or your other mentioned candidate would have won. The only people complaining about the switch are Republicans who have no dog in this fight.","title":"CMV: The actions of the democrats over the last 4-6 years, up against the rhetoric makes me question if I can ever vote/support a democrat again."},{"text":"Yawn.Tell me why I should've voted Trump instead.","title":"Biden administration plans $8 billion weapons sale to Israel"},{"text":"Didnt they endorse Trump?","title":"CMV: Conservatives should be mad at Trump for killing the border bill."},{"text":"What far left policies terrify you?   \\n  \\nIt's going to get thrown out because he was elected President.

Bitcoin, with its high volatility, is obviously a risky asset on a standalone basis. However, most of the risk and potential return drivers bitcoin faces are fundamentally different from traditional risky assets, making it unfitting for most traditional finance frameworks C including the risk on vs. risk off framework employed by some macro commentators.  Bitcoins nature as a scarce, non-sovereign, decentralized global asset has caused some investors to consider it as a flight to safety option in times of fear and around certain geopolitically disruptive events. Over the long term, bitcoins adoption trajectory is likely to be driven by the intensity of concerns over global monetary stability, geopolitical stability, U.S. fiscal sustainability, and U.S. political stability. This is the inverse of the relationship that is generally attributed to traditional risk assets with respect to such forces.\\nSource and report: https://www.blackrock.com/us/financial-professionals/insights/bitcoin-unique-diversifier","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Low effort bait, still managed to catch a few.","title":"Democrats look for places to work with Trump 2.0"},{"text":"those are FUCKING SOLAR PANELS how is that degrowth you turds","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"He truly is a very stupid man","title":"Dementia Don is confused again"},{"text":"I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Weeds is like 15% of why I ended up in California.

As someone who follows the crypto space weekly and has a modest investment in it, I can see theres a real disconnect between the public perception and whats actually happening in the field. Its kind of like having an outsiders view of semiconductor manufacturing or quantum computing - if youre not deeply in it, you mainly see the headlines and hype.It think the word crypto has become this massive umbrella term that throws together everything from literal joke coins to serious technological platforms. Even within the crypto community, we literally call many of these shit coins because, yeah, theyre gambling vehicles. No argument there. The pump-and-dump schemes you mentioned with celebrities? Completely agree - its predatory and infuriating, and celebrities REALLY should know better. But theyre in it for themselves, not for the technology. AnywayConflating everything in crypto as one thing is like saying the internet is just for memes back in 2000. Some projects have full teams of developers building real solutions for things like decentralized computing, prediction markets, and cross-border payments. Ethereum alone has nearly 9000 developers who learned its programming language. These tokens are more like technology stocks - youre betting on the teams ability to solve real problems and create value.And look at whos actually investing in and building on blockchain technology now. Were talking about Visa and Mastercard developing blockchain-based payment solutions. JPMorgan, which famously criticized crypto, now has its own blockchain division. Microsoft is using Ethereum for verifiable credentials. Starbucks built an NFT loyalty program on Polygon (though Im not sold on NFTs but thats another discussion). These arent companies that can afford to gamble - they have shareholders, regulatory oversight, and reputations to protect.Theyre not jumping in blindly either - theyre waiting for regulatory clarity, building compliant solutions, and investing in the infrastructure, not speculating on tokens. BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager, didnt launch a Bitcoin ETF on a whim - they spent years studying the space and waiting for the right regulatory framework, and it took years of back and forth rejection after rejection for them to get approved.You make a good point about energy consumption - its a serious issue, especially for Bitcoin. But newer platforms like Ethereum have moved to proof-of-stake specifically to address this (it reduced its energy use by 99.98% between September 14 and September 15 2022). Many newer projects are being built with environmental concerns in mind from the start.The serious players are treating this like any other emerging technology sector - with due diligence, compliance teams, and long-term strategic planning. Thats a far cry from gambling on meme coins.I get the skepticism, especially given the media coverage, but theres a lot more happening under the surface than most people realize. Im happy to hold the conversation and answer any questions or objections!","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Totally agree.

As someone who has witnessed some horrendous crime in the few times I've visited places like SF, I cannot say that being more lenient on criminals is the answer. Moreover, as someone who studies psychology, leniency establishes more opportunity which results in more crime. The most frustrating thing to see is people who blame the victims when crime happens to them...

[interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/magazine/antony-blinken-interview.html) the Times conducted with Blinken, I have to ask: at what point does it go beyond merely asking tough questions of those in power, and baiting top government officials into threatening international diplomacy?I encourage reading the whole thing if you have half an hour, particularly for how Blinken publicly navigates answering questions that in some cases border on biased and/or unfair, which I think he does skillfully and professionally, and where he can, substantively. But the bottom line is that you can't directly answer a question like this.\\n The latest U.N. figures put the Palestinian death toll at 45,000. Over 90 percent of Gazas population is now displaced. The population is starving. All hospitals have been destroyed. In November, a U.N. committee released a report that found Israels warfare practices consistent with the characteristics of genocide. I know you dont agree with that estimation, but **do you believe that Israels actions have been consistent with the rules of war**?It reminds me of when a reporter asked Biden in the press conference right after his incredibly consequential (and politically sensitive) meeting with Xi if he still thought the latter was a dictator, to which Biden answered in the affirmative, and Blinken's horrified reaction was the subject of memes. \\"Getting a straight answer\\" from government officials  especially where the nuance means one often isn't appropriate  sometimes has to come second to national security and international diplomacy.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":" Exactly.

I was super disappointed to see a \\"bipartisan\\" bill not get passed myself.

This is pretty wild, and I don't know any other country that would allow this.Second, it would codify the idea that people could come and say, \\"NO, I'm no an illegal, I'm an asylum seeker\\", but because we have an insanely high backlog of asylum people, it would take years to properly vet and handle the case. So millions per year could come in under the premise of \\"asylum\\" outside the 2 million cap. Basically, the concept of any sort of border control would be ended.The reality is, it's actually better for Conservatives now, since they have a lot more pull and control over the narrative of how they want to handle the border.You can see more of Vance's opinion on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkBikwl1vEs).","title":"CMV: Conservatives should be mad at Trump for killing the border bill."},{"text":"If you care to look, do some research.

But Bitcoin is the best savings asset in existence. Its not even technically an investment because you could own it without a trusted third party. Thats why Bitcoin is categorically a savings technology. Bitcoin, unlike the other shitcoins &amp; memecoins, requires energy via proof of work to timestamp the blockchain. Thats a feature, not a bug. Money without energy is credit that can be printed ad infinitum with no limit. Bitcoin is a commodity asset where time is money is energy. Bitcoin is the only hard sound money that obeys the laws of thermodynamics. You say Bitcoin is like tulip mania but let me remind you that tulip mania lasted only 3 years (1634 - 1637) but Bitcoin has become a 2Trillion dollar asset over the last 16 YEARS which means Bitcoin (123,774 Active Trading Hours since Mar 17, 2010) has been in demand in the free marketplace for longer than the post-gold standard stock market (100,737 Active Trading Hours since the Nixon Shock on Aug 15, 1971) has. Bitcoin mining can help regulate &amp; balance energy grids, build out green infrastructure, and capture stranded or wasted or toxic energy and monetize it. There is no other eco technology in the world that is as useful or versatile as Bitcoin miners. Exxon has had one of the best ESG ratings in the past decade because they depend on Bitcoin miners to capture methane (80x worse for the environment than CO2) released by fracking.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"They know who buys those flags lol","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"[Biden_IRL](https://i.imgur.com/znTxSos.jpeg)","title":"Biden rejected appeals of several top advisors in blocking US steel bid"},{"text":"My newest delusion of grandeur is believing that I'm destined to restore the worship of Sol Invictus and lead a new [great awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Awakening).

I see it every day in this sub.??There is often a sense that our current politics is deeply unique while often looking back can get us to better understand our current era and see how maybe it isnt too unique.I mean, it is also possible for this to be true. I cant think of a single political/party implosion like this in Canadian political history. No pundit, analyst, journalist or political scientist Ive seen on CBC or CTV have been able to either. Here are some reasons why this is so unprecedented:?1. As I said in another comment, Chretiens approval rating was at -3 before he resigned. Harper was at -4 eight weeks before he lost the 2015 Election. Trudeau is at **-52.** I cant reasonably think of a more unpopular leader in Canadian history. For reference, his approval rating is 19% lower than George W. Bush in the 2008 Election.?2. It looks like the Liberal National Caucus is about to demand the immediate resignation of Justin Trudeau. That would require the party arrange for the Governor General to appoint an interim leader of the LPC to become the Prime Minister. That has never once happened before. Leaders always stay on in a caretaker role and allow a proper leadership race to replace them. If that doesnt happen, it will be a first in Canadian history.?3. AFAIK, if the LPC do not elect to hold a leadership race and appoint someone else, it will also be the first time they appoint a permanent leader without a proper convention/race.?4. The 2019 and 2021 Elections featured the Liberals making history for the wrong reasons. In 2019, the Liberals became the first ever party to lose the popular vote and win the subsequent election following a first-term majority. If they had lost the election outright, they would be the second party to lose following a first-term majority since RB Bennett failed to intervene in the Great Depression. In 2021, the Liberal Party set a record by forming a minority government with the lowest share of the popular vote in Canadian history.?5. There have been three elections in Canadian history where the governing party did not even achieve 35% of the national vote. Macdonald in 1867, Trudeau in 2019, and Trudeau in 2021.?6. The Liberals are currently poised to finish 3rd. Like you said, this happened in 2011. But it **only** happened in 2011. The second time isnt exactly a trend, its still an anomaly.?","title":"Freeland, Carney seen as best Liberal to deal with Trump"},{"text":"Tulip mania was predicated on the advent of commodities futures.

Context below.The US dollar and economy holds sway because it is the largest reserve currency in the world. In other words:  all of the superpowers and many other countries hold tons of US dollars in their reserve. For this reason it's in the interest of those countries that the US economy thrives and the dollar remains strong. They're essentially invested in the US dollar: they don't want to see that value go down any more than Bitcoin holders want to see the value of Bitcoin go down.This means sovereign nations may be obliged to operate against their own interests and those of others to preserve the value of their US dollar reserves.This gives the US a lot of leverage to assert in various trade agreements, political endeavors and other scenarios. The US dollar operates as the petro currency; that creates consistent global demand for the US dollar. The US can print dollars to settle international debts. The US and other superpowers can exert influence on the SWIFT money transfer system to disconnect other countries from SWIFT and starve them financially. In short, the US gets to shove others around.The extent to which the US shoves other economies and countries around naturally inspires resentment. BRICS countries are playing with exchanging oil in other currencies, for example. But to have the dollar replaced by the Yuan or the Euro creates the same problem under a different master.Decentralized cryptocurrencies reduce the need for a trusted third party (like a government or corporation) to control the currency, and their security and governance are spread across many participants, making them more resilient to manipulation and failures.By removing centralized control, the value of a fixed sum decentralized currency becomes driven by demand, innovation, and adoptionjust as gold has been over the centuries.In a world where a supply-capped decentralized cryptocurrency holds sway, governments can regulate, monitor, or ban crypto exchanges to restrict access to the broader crypto ecosystem. But unlike kicking countries out of SWIFT, they can't exert such pressure outside their jurisdiction.  They can also blacklist certain wallets or even seize them: but unlike the US dollar, for example, the US can legally do this only to the extent such wallets operate under US jurisdiction. Given the foregoing, it's easy to see why goverments are hostile to the notion of such cryptocurrencies gaining traction as consumer currencies. And it's well known that the US will aggressively attack any currency that threatens the global dominance of the US dollar (e.g., Trump's 100% tariff threats against countries that operate to undermine the US dollar).","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Oh yes, yes they did.

However, framing it entirely as our fault oversimplifies the issue. The idea of debt implies clear lines of accountability, but moral failings are more like a tangled web of systemic issues, individual actions, and historical inertia. While its valid to feel disheartened by the scale of our challenges, viewing one generations actions in isolation ignores how centuries of compounding choices have built our current reality. Even so, youre correct that systemic problems rely on individual complicity. The challenge lies in balancing these perspectivesacknowledging personal responsibility without overlooking structural forces that constrain and shape our actions.Yeah, very well put. I am curious as to how to view normal \\"good and bad\\" people within thus context, like statistically even a murderer is just a drop in the bucket compared to the complicity of average \\"good\\" people. I personally lean towards intentions being the defining factor here, as those people do the exact same things as the rest of us *plus* they have a level of blatant cruelty that's disgusting even to us. It's one thing to be complicit in a system like this, it's another entirely to go *out of your way* to cause harm, it's a special, sadistic brand awful. And yeah, at least we do make progress, we've come a long way honestly, and for as much as I criticize humans, animals are way worse though, even the highly empathetic ones (like wolves, no seriously, wolves). But I do think perhaps there was a layer I was ignoring before, and that is ignorance, as animals just don't know what's going on, yet I (and people in general) still value them more than they seem to be able to value each other, we know it's not their fault because they could never understand. Now, humans are a bit different as we're a \\"general intelligence\\" that can theoretically think about anything, coming up with new concepts as we build from generational knowledge, so we're a bit less innocent though we *do* have something to show for it, hence the progress you mentioned, and my own current dilemma over this, we're capable of being hypocrites but we're also capable of realizing that and lamenting the fact, doing what we can to push back against it. And you're right that the push for lab grown meat isn't purely out of convenience and laziness, and in fact it's the opposite, though it is sad that veganism doesn't seem to be enough to cut it (maybe it could've in the more long-term future a century or more from now depending on how it went, but lab meat should speed things up immensely). At the same time though, it is nice that we're so clever we came up with a solution that meets in the middle.Your critique that systemic problems are really individual failures in disguise is a valid but harsh assessment. Many people could care more, act more, or push harder for change, and cultural norms often provide convenient excuses for apathy. However, its important to recognize that these norms are deeply entrenched and difficult to overcome. People arent simply choosing not to care; theyre shaped by a lifetime of cultural conditioning, misinformation, and conflicting priorities. Your own reflection on your innate human bias speaks volumes. If someone as self-aware and reflective as you struggles to align philosophy with action, it highlights just how challenging it is to break free from these ingrained patterns. While its tempting to condemn others outright, its often more productive to focus criticism on the systems that perpetuate this apathy rather than the individuals caught within them.Fair once again, much like the aminals caught in the cycles of predation we definitely aren't entirely to blame, though for humans I think more blame is fair as we have more awareness, but more awareness also means we can actually *do* something about it, so greater *responsibility* but also greater *capability*. Maybe my emphasis on our personal blame is an extension of human negativity bias and self deprecation, which has its ups and downs as it proves we're definitely remorseful, but it also shows self doubt which can often be counterproductive, though it is important to be humble and take the precaution of *overestimating* your problems so that you have a greater chance at avoiding accidentally underestimating them.Your acknowledgment of progress is key, even if it comes with a degree of cynicism. You seem torn between frustration at humanitys flaws and hope for its capacity for change, and that tension is what fuels meaningful action. Recognizing our moral shortcomings and the systemic challenges we face doesnt negate the importance of optimism; it makes it more grounded. Progress is undeniably slow and often tied to convenience, but it is still progress. The moral arc of humanity doesnt bend as quickly or dramatically as we might wish, but it does bend. Believing in eventual redemption while confronting the messy reality of the present is a powerful stance. We dont need perfect empathy or morality to keep moving forward; we just need enough people, acting enough of the time, to keep pushing.Yeah, I honestly agree here. And additionally while progress may be born partially of convenience, once it's locked in as a societal ideal, it's genuine even if the founders of that movement were partially being pragmatic and a bit selfish. Slavery is another example here, and we've come a long way since then, and while outlawing it was controversial, pragmatic, and *definitely* not the end of racism and worker exploitation, it's become *unthinkable* over time to the point where no countries officially allow it, even if it does still happen and has spiritual successors.","title":"CMV: We're all way, way worse than we realize... and when we do we simply don't care..."},{"text":"They let in BrightShart articles too.","title":"Biden Bans Scores of Natural Gas Water Heaters, Driving Up Prices With Lame-Duck Regulations"},{"text":"Similar to ordering at a McDonald's kiosk: you feel like you have more ordering power with the equipment people give you, but it's the same menu","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 4, 2025"},{"text":"You were never the bigger person","title":"Biden honors Hillary Clinton, George Soros and Magic Johnson with Presidential Medal of Freedom"},{"text":"In case you havent noticed, its a crackhead world.

The philosopher and psychologist?[Karl Jaspers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Jaspers)?delivered lectures to students in 1946 which were published under the title?*The Question of German Guilt*.[^(\\\\[6\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_collective_guilt#cite_note-6)?In this published work, Jaspers describes how \\"an acknowledgment of national guilt was a necessary condition for the moral and political rebirth of Germany\\".[^(\\\\[7\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_collective_guilt#cite_note-7)?Additionally, Jaspers believed that no one could escape this collective guilt, and taking responsibility for it might enable the German people to transform their society from its state of collapse into a more highly developed and morally responsible democracy. He believed that those who committed war crimes were morally guilty, and those who tolerated them without resistance were politically guilty, leading to collective guilt for all.  \\nJung said collective guilt was \\"for psychologists a fact, and it will be one of the most important tasks of therapy to bring the Germans to recognize this guilt.\\"[^(\\\\[4\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_collective_guilt#cite_note-4)  \\nI...like Jung, am asking when will people wake up to their complicity rather than bury their head in the sand.

We are in an interglacial period of an ice age, there are two options for whats next the end of the ice age or a glacial period.  Both transitions lead to mass extinction however emissions of greenhouse gases actually delay the transition to a glacial period. Conversely, emissions speed up the transition to a hot house climate. So green house gas emissions are either delaying or accelerating our progress towards a mass extinction event. Also a lot of these green energy alternatives are proving to be very harmful for the environment, just in different ways. The materials and maintenance for wind farms leads to greenhouse gas emissions and they kill wildlife on top of that. Its a similar story for solar and hydro as well. Ultimately green energy is just turning out to be a money grab for the most part. We really just dont have a large enough sample size to understand climate change. Whos to say whats required.

I saw enough of the debate to say that even if he had the flu, as claimed, at the very minimum it says that I wouldnt bet on 4 more years.For standard gaffes, every person who spends as much time in front of cameras as our modern national politicians does can be made to look insane because everyone misspeaks occasionally. With enough talking you can cut things together to look terrible. So those things didnt bother me too much.The question was where he is between the two.From what I gather, his issues seem to be consistent with primarily age related decline. Trumps possibly more cognitive issues showing up in different ways.Sweet thats your opinion which some may agree with some may not. My point is that if hes clearly in cognitive decline than he shouldnt be President of the United States. However saying Trumps possibly (has) more cognitive issues showing in different ways is tangibly not true, and this statement is a nothing-burger anyway since my original point has nothing to do with Trump. I am in no way saying Trump good, Biden bad or agreeing with Trumps policy, Im saying its rather odd that most people would agree that Biden is not fit to be President, which is why he chose not to run again. Your argument is that he is fit right now to be president, but he wont be in a few years, which is why he stepped down my argument is he is not fit right now, which is why he didnt run again, and its rather odd that he is still president given how unfit he is mentally for the job. We have different opinions/perspective on his current capabilities, so we can agree to disagree on this. Then you said:Drones arent illegal just for flying around. If they are in restricted air space they would be. The military and/or law enforcement arent going to just go shooting down drones just for flying around. What goes up must come down, and you can imagine the repercussions of a big drone comes down or the ordinance comes down and ends up killing people or destroying homes, etc etc.For the ones in Europe that were violating airspace around US airbases, amp that up tenfold given how much damage the US has done to their reputation over the last decade.Given that so many of the video clips people have posted claiming to be drones turn out to be  planes, or sometimes just stars, it is pretty clear that a lot of it is overblown. You know that a lot of it is that some drone owners saw reports about people freaking out about drones and thought it would be fun to do a bit of night flying for their neighbors.Could there be some nefarious reason for people to be flying drones around with the intent of being seen?  Sure. But as they havent appeared to do anything, flying with all their lights on is a poor way to do anything like spying or gathering intel. So possibly some group trying to rile up the rubes.I have no idea who Steve Greer is, but showing off by blatantly flying drones around random areas seems like the opposite of what some secretive shadow government would want to do.Just out of curiosity, what makes this obviously a government project, and what would be the purpose?If you actually think that the drones flying around in New Jersey, spraying the air, shooting the ground, are just random drones which the government doesnt know where they came from but knows they arent a threat then I dont really know how to have a conversation about this subject, because I dont even know how to comprehend how someone could think like that, meaning I dont even know how to put myself in your shoes. Its insanely obvious the government knows what these drones are, they just arent telling the public. Like you cant honestly think they would just allow unknown drones invade New Jersey, spray the air with an unknown substance, and practice shooting drills? If you honestly think these drones are random and not government/deep-state related than I dont even know how to have a conversation about this subject because I cant put myself in the mindset of someone who would (without lying) come to that conclusion, and if you are lying than I dont know what your purpose is, to try to steer the subject in a certain direction? Anyways my bad if I sound condescending or rude but If you think these drones are random peoples drones when they are massive and spraying chemicals/doing shooting drills and the government is just looking the other way like we dont know what they are spraying or what they are shooting but we know its friendly Im sorry but you obviously have a way different perspective of what the government is compared to me so we are just on a completely different page. As far as what would be the purpose of the government drones there could be a million different purposes they could be testing out new technology, they could be using it as a scare tactic to pass new oppressive drone legislation, they could be practicing for future attacks, they could be spraying bio-weapons to start the next pandemic (I.E. toxic fog). Theres a million reasons for why they are doing what theyre doing. Governments have their own esoteric agendas, I.E. HAARP, cloud seeding, MK Ultra, operation sea-spray, DUMBs, etc.","title":"Due to Bidens age and mental decline, he was unfit to run for president.

By market manipulation and sheer luck, gasoline is one of the few fuels that has enjoyed a relatively stable and affordable price over the past 40 years.With climate change becoming a greater and nearer threat than ever before, gas prices *should* be going up. We, as a society and a world, should be discouraging fossil fuel demand and encouraging the adoption of public transportation and EVs. If anything, most people should be unhappy that gasoline is still relatively affordable. We should be discouraging unnecessary travel, and environmental pollution. In the same vein, we should be giving tax credits to companies who *create* WFH jobs; not giving them tax credits for filling buildings with people who dont even need to be there every day.Voting for anyone or anything to bring down gas prices is like voting for someone to bring back the telegraph or the horse and buggy.

All of these things poll well because they are broad and simple ideas that people can support. No one would be against eliminating corruption in the federal government, for example.The problem is that congress needs to get together to pass a law which nails down and concretely defines all of the things that you think have broad support with Americans. Once you sit down to do that, it becomes a lot harder to agree on everything.The country is massive and change is slow. What you are proposing will also take power away from congress and give even fewer checks on SCOTUS and the president. IMO this just drives us closer to fascism/totalitarianism fueled by populist ideas, and it doesn't seem like a liberal way of governing.","title":"CMV: Adding a constitutional amendment which allows for national referendums on key domestic issues would be an absolute game changer for the United States, and potentially could help restore democracy and heal this country."},{"text":"Loool got caught","title":"Biden administration plans $8 billion weapons sale to Israel"},{"text":"He should have charged Trump over January 620-21 and remember Trump's campaign platform is pardoning the J6ers.

The issue with these positions, of course, is that they all interact with each other that exacerbate problems.In addition, there's outright policy change \\"hallucinations\\" that happen, where a person polled says they want a given change, but the \\"change\\" already exists and the person is actually advocating for a reversal. Examples include, Republicans wanting to \\"raise\\" the military budget to a number that's lower than the current figure, Democrats wanting to \\"raise\\" the tax rate to lower than the current number, and others.I can quickly see one point you think might be \\"easy\\" that assuredly won't - $15 minimum wage. Over the past few years, a big wave of anger has been pointed at President Biden for inflation that ultimately speaking, was outmatched by real wage growth. That inflation was due, in large part, to rising wages for the lower classes. There's no chance that a national minimum wage would actually be popular. It just sounds popular because people don't seriously consider the trade-offs.  One last point: The positions you're posting about are largely left-leaning. It might be that you're not hearing from people who are more rightwing, or that you're basing \\"popular\\" based off some kind of assumption of the overall tilt of the global world, or European countries.

I'd have more respect for an argument that tries to justify the energy use, instead of denying that it exists. Bitcoin mining increasingly uses renewable energy...Everything is, BTC isn't special here. What makes BTC different is, its demand for energy is pretty much a direct function of the value of BTC itself and the price of energy. So if I were to introduce some magical new renewable source that was a tenth the price of anything else on the grid, without BTC and other PoW coins, I could expect this to replace some amount of existing dirty energy. With BTC, we can expect BTC to absorb 100% of that new capacity until prices rise to the level where it isn't profitable to add more miners.At least ETH did finally migrate to PoS, instead of trying to rationalize its insane energy consumption. ...helps stabilize power grids by providing flexible demand...The inflexible demand created by non-crypto sources is still there. Piling more energy demand *on top of* that may result in a more \\"stable\\" demand, but it's a higher demand overall, which is going to be *harder* for a grid to reliably supply, not easier. Traditional banking uses way more energy when you add up all their offices, servers, and infrastructure.I'm not convinced this is even true, but even if it is, there are three fundamental problems:First: This is only an estimate of mining. Where is the estimate for the amount of power needed to run the offices and servers for all of the crypto startups?Second: Most of this isn't something crypto can replace on its own. Raw BTC in a wallet that you own is the crypto equivalent of *cash,* and this gives it some inherent problems:* If that wallet is lost or stolen, you're just SOL, you can't get your money back. If you steal my *actual* wallet, you get a bunch of credit cards, and the credit card company is liable for any fraud.\\n* If someone steals the money out of a crypto exchange (which many people treat as a bank), like FTX or MtGox, you're not gonna be able to withdraw your money. Traditional banks insure their deposits, and governments can even step in if that fails (see: the FDIC covering *all* SVB deposits, even ones larger than the FDIC limit).So you're going to need to replicate all of those traditional institutions in order to make crypto a safe enough place for the average customer. So a crypto bank that you can actually trust would have all of the energy needs of a traditional bank (since it'd basically just *be* a traditional bank), *plus* all the extra power required to run the blockchain instead of a simple database.Third: Even in [this article about how much less BTC is using](https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2024/03/21/is-bitcoin-more-energy-intensive-than-mainstream-finance/), it's also exponentially increasing, while the power demands of finance remain stable. (And that's just BTC, it's not the only PoW network!) And that's despite crypto being responsible for far less financial activity.---And, just for fun: Bitcoin provides a censorship-resistant, permissionless payment network...To the extent that this works, it's not always a good thing. Those are the exact ingredients you need for ransomware, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime. Try sending $100k internationally through banks - it takes days and costs a fortune. With Bitcoin it's minutes and cents.How much will it cost you to *buy* that BTC? There's another reply suggesting this will actually end up costing you more. But also, hey, at least you picked a lower number than we usually see, but how many of us frequently need to send $100k internationally? ...imagine dismissing the internet in 1995 because websites kept crashing.You're a decade too late to make this argument.The Web was 5 years old in 1995. Bitcoin is 15 years old now. If the Web was still hot garbage in 2005, maybe we would've been justified writing it off and going back to Gopher.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"(1) Biden didn't refuse to retire.(2) Biden didn't die in office.(3) The republicans didn't hold up Joe's seat.There 0 the same.0.0000001% the same.","title":"The 10 best things Biden did in 2024"},{"text":"The first step to it getting on a ballot would be it would need to get a certain number of signatures.

Let me explain why:First, most voters simply don't have the expertise or time to understand complex legislation. Take healthcare reform - it's not just about voting \\"yes\\" to universal healthcare. It's thousands of pages of intricate policy details about coverage requirements, payment systems, and implementation. Even progressive policies can fail catastrophically if poorly designed.Remember when Brexit passed via referendum? That's exactly what happens when complex policy decisions are left to popular vote. People voted on vague promises without understanding the consequences, and now the UK is dealing with the fallout.Your examples actually prove this point. \\"$15 minimum wage\\" sounds nice, but what about regional cost of living differences? Small businesses vs large corporations? Phase-in periods? These details matter enormously for actual impact.Plus, referendums are easily manipulated by the same corporate interests you're trying to fight. Look at California's proposition system - corporations spend millions on misleading ad campaigns to confuse voters. Amazon and Uber literally wrote their own labor laws through Prop 22. A national referendum system would be that on steroids.The real solution is fixing our representative democracy - ranked choice voting, eliminating gerrymandering, and public campaign financing. These would actually force Congress to represent the people without creating an easily exploitable parallel system.Direct democracy would just replace corporate-owned politicians with corporate-owned referendums, while making our laws even more dysfunctional.

It would actually be hypocritical for you to like Bitcoin. Youd very clearly just be in it for the gains, or what you think will be gains, because there is no guarantee of that.But if I wanted to help you to deconstruct your ideology, Id probably direct you toward developing an appreciation for gold.A eureka moment for me was realizing how ridiculous it is that were forced to put everything into stocks and bonds just to keep up with inflation. Taking on that much risk just to preserve your savings feels wrong when you really think about it.Gold offers an alternative because its been a constant throughout history. Fiat currencies always end up going to zero eventually. Bonds might feel safe, but theyre tied to fiat, so theyre not immune either. Stocks are better because they are tied to the value of the companies, but entire markets have crashed to zero before. Relying entirely on them is far from risk-free.Gold stands apart. Governments still hold it in their treasuries, and for most of modern history, it backed global currencies. Its value has endured through wars, economic collapses, and complete financial resets. Nothing else has that kind of staying power.I used to buy into Warren Buffetts argument that gold is not a good investment (or not an investment at all) because it doesnt generate yield, unlike a farm or business. But not every part of your portfolio needs to generate yield (or even be an investment). Golds role is to protect wealth, especially when everything else falls apart.Now I see gold as something that balances out the risks of stocks, bonds, and real estate. Its the ultimate safety net. Once you start appreciating golds value, it becomes easier to understand Bitcoin. Bitcoin is essentially digital gold: hard supply, portable, divisible, and independent of any government. The use case is the same, but in a new digital medium.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"The first part suggests you live in alternative reality.Every 5 years, there is a new hot college student take about Israel.

That said, Im not sure if the point youre making is as positive for the Liberals as you suggest.?As an aside, the LPC is as old as Confederation. In the past 100 years, theyve governed for 75. Only **three** elected party leaders have not gone on to become Prime Minister. Two of them are Stephane Dion and Michael Ignatieff. If the Liberals are in fact due for a walloping at the ballot on a regular basis now, it is a reflection of Harper and Mackays successful attempt to create a right-wing movement that can regularly challenge the Liberals. Its not that the LPC wont eventually get back into power, its that theyre potentially going to be more vulnerable to the CPC on a regular basis than they were in the 20th Century.?The Liberals didnt just fall in 2011 and bounce back in 2015. They were in the wilderness from 2006 to the mere weeks leading up to November 2015.?In 2011, the Liberals fell to 3rd place amidst a shaky CPC majority that was already a 5 year incumbent. Harper didnt even increase his vote share in 2011 by 2%. He got his majority amidst both the Bloc and Liberals totally imploding in a simultaneous phenomenon. They also ran a disastrous candidate with a bad campaign, up against a Harper campaign that was extremely competent and effective against Ignatieff. The Liberals nowadays will have to first displace the Bloc in Quebec in the next 4 years before they can even be a federal contender for government.The Liberals are going into 2025 with Poilievre in supermajority territory of 232 seats. The CPC is polling at 47% according to the latest Nanos poll, which is an absurd number considering Harpers majority of 39%. Its even more outrageous when you consider Mulroney only hit 50%+ of the vote when there were only three viable federal parties. First term majorities also dont lose the subsequent election.Politicians are very aware of that trend. In the months leading up to and following the 2015 Election, senior Conservative politicians all stepped away from federal politics. They knew Mulcair or Trudeau would be around for a while. It took the CPC a long time before they reorganized behind a stable party leader. If Carney wants in, hes looking at 6 years in Opposition if were going off political norms. And 4 of those years will likely not even be in Official Opposition, lacking all the political perks that come with it. Im not sure if thats something he will sign on to.?Its way too early to tell who the next Liberal PM will be.

I really do think its the phone mast and phone demos, that do it.The new flagship stores have got rid of the smaller shops and Id bet staff members, as they dont need as many now and probably have a massive 5G box in them. Id imagine they have a few, as they need the PS5 and Xboxes, all the phones, tablets and PCs that have as demo devices to run at decent speeds, plus 10 plus staff and up to 50 customers on a Saturday afternoon or the summer months its more. All that radiation isnt good for you at all.","title":"Health &amp; EMFs / 5G"},{"text":"IN GOP pulling a LA GOP I see, LA just passed a very similar law last year.

The Indiana GOP has submitted House Bill 1029 to eliminate the open primary system in the state and establish a closed primary system. According to the bill a voter must register with their county clerk their party affiliation (Democrat, Republican, or Libertarian) by December 31 of the year before the primary. If a voter has not registered party affiliation by that date, then they are ineligible to cast a ballot in the primary election. This will certainly dampen voter turnout for primary elections, which is already abysmal in Indiana, as voters are used to declaring party affiliation when they receive their ballot on Election Day. Of other concern is the possible discrimination that could occur against voters who affiliate as a Democrat, since the GOP will have public access to party affiliation.House Bill 1029 was introduced in backlash to a push by IN Dems last May in which the IN Dems pushed Democrats and Independents to vote against Mike Braun in the GOP gubernatorial primary. The push was ultimately futile, but attracted the attention of now Gov Braun (R) who has openly vowed to eliminate the open primary system in the state, &amp; has the support in the House leadership to do so.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 4, 2025"},{"text":"He wont he will pretend he did it.","title":"Donald Trump Cant Torch All of Joe Bidens Legacy"},{"text":"Genocide deniers should be banned.","title":"The 10 best things Biden did in 2024"},{"text":"Republicans want to \\"fix\\" housing prices by kicking out a quarter of construction labourers and setting tariffs on countries we import materials from.

The truth is, the more freedom that people lose, then the more power that becomes available to the wealthy, and they will absolutely use their power to create more power for themselves. They will just create more and more pain for the average American. Eventually, civil war will occur, and many people will die, but it won't be the wealthy.

Not to mention the old maps that show North America completely littered with cities before European settlement had taken place. The evidence that this is true is irrefutable IMO if one looks hard enough. Our history is totally false.

Someone over 80, and I would be uncomfortable even if they seemed super sharp and clear eyed currently. I have seen enough of Bidens speeches to see that he is not always impaired. I saw enough of the debate to say that even if he had the flu, as claimed, at the very minimum it says that I wouldnt bet on 4 more years. For standard gaffes, every person who spends as much time in front of cameras as our modern national politicians does can be made to look insane because everyone misspeaks occasionally. With enough talking you can cut things together to look terrible. So those things didnt bother me too much. The question was where he is between the two. From what I gather, his issues seem to be consistent with primarily age related decline. Trumps possibly more cognitive issues showing up in different ways.Drones arent illegal just for flying around. If they are in restricted air space they would be. The military and/or law enforcement arent going to just go shooting down drones just for flying around. What goes up must come down, and you can imagine the repercussions of a big drone comes down or the ordinance comes down and ends up killing people or destroying homes, etc etc. For the ones in Europe that were violating airspace around US airbases, amp that up tenfold given how much damage the US has done to their reputation over the last decade. Given that so many of the video clips people have posted claiming to be drones turn out to be  planes, or sometimes just stars, it is pretty clear that a lot of it is overblown. You know that a lot of it is that some drone owners saw reports about people freaking out about drones and thought it would be fun to do a bit of night flying for their neighbors. Could there be some nefarious reason for people to be flying drones around with the intent of being seen?  Sure. But as they havent appeared to do anything, flying with all their lights on is a poor way to do anything like spying or gathering intel. So possibly some group trying to rile up the rubes. I have no idea who Steve Greer is, but showing off by blatantly flying drones around random areas seems like the opposite of what some secretive shadow government would want to do.

I dont have schizophrenia nor have I been diagnosed with anything that could cause hallucinations. But in 2024, there were a few months where this happened very frequently: I would be watching a youtube video and thinking, and then a couple seconds later I would hear the exact word or phrase that I just thought, in the video (even if my thoughts had nothing to do with the video, just mind wandering). The first couple times I thought it was a coincidence, but it started happening very frequently, maybe a couple times per week, and it seemed to me to be too far-fetched to always be a coincidence.After reading your post, I realized that this hasnt happened to me in about 3 months. I dont know why it happened or why it stopped, but at this point, I believe its possible it was due to spiritual warfare / demonic influence. Im Christian, and a few months ago I went through a period of a couple weeks where I began doubting the Bible for the first time in my life. Then I was talking to my grandfather who is also a Christian, and he tends to ramble and switch quickly between topics. He started talking about how Satan is real and hes out to get you (like tempt or influence you), even if you are (and especially if you are) a Christian. Then he said, For example, maybe you doubt? and he looked right at me when he said that. He had no idea that I had been doubting the Bible and I hadnt mentioned that I was struggling at all, but when he said that I realized that I was going through spiritual warfare. I went home and prayed to God and asked Him to deliver me from anything evil and to send away any demons that may be trying to influence me, and I prayed for protection from demonic influence, and I prayed those things through Christs name (since the Bible says to pray through Him). For the next couple months, I read the passage in the Bible about the Armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-17) every day as a reminder and as protection. Since then, I have grown in faith, and the experiences of thinking something and then hearing my thoughts seconds later in a video have stopped. So at this time, I believe that it was related to demonic influence or spiritual warfare. I apologize for the long comment, but I wanted to let you know that you are not alone and I believe you really are experiencing what you say you are. I hope what I wrote will be helpful to you. I still dont understand how it works, but God has granted me peace in this matter. May God bless you and keep you. Take care.","title":"Have you heard of a form of psychosis known for making the affected believe their thoughts are being made note of out loud?"},{"text":"The Democratic platform is excellent.no it isn't.  its been weak and deferential for a while now.","title":"How the Democrats Lost the Working Class"},{"text":"Everyone is pissed off and looking for something to point to.

That he didnt focus as highly on international trade as his predecessors does not put him anywhere near 50s-60s Democrats. He, &amp; the rest of the party are still, to the right of dems from over half a century ago.Made even more unlikely by the fact that anytime you criticize the Dems, the loyalists, themselves, will tell you compromise with the left comes secondary to victory as if the last fifty years of that exact philosophy did not lead directly to Trump.

Even if the project is open source.Obviously, if youre hiring for a senior level position, you will focus on previous work experience over a degree. Everyone does that. If youre ignoring actual work experience in favor of hobby projects, I dont know what to say. But if youre hiring for entry level, they wont have previous work experience (unless via internship). Here, the resume will consist of a degree and possibly some hobby projects. I would say its still a mistake to prioritize the hobby projects over the degree, most of the time.The reasoning is that for entry level, class performance is a closer proxy for work experience than hobby projects. To get good grades, classes have actual deadlines that have to be met, and student work is evaluated by experts. I know people who blew off their classes to work on hobby projects, and consequently didnt learn much. They worked on what they wanted to work on, rather than what they were supposed to work on. Does that sound like a good employeeAnd yes, you absolutely can ASK FOR GPA of applicants, for entry level. No rule says you cant. You can ask for transcripts as well. If you know how to read a transcript, its faster to do so than to dig into someones Github repository to figure out their real contributions.Im not saying ignore the hobby projects altogether. If you have two excellent applicants, hobby projects could be a tie breaker. And of course, there are projects so impressive they outshine everything else on the resume. But thats very rare.Dont pretend youre the expert at hiring, because I know for fact not everyone in IT is doing what youre doing.It sounds to me like you really dont know how to evaluate educational accomplishments and/or have a bias against education and/or want to filter out applicants who want work/life balance.","title":"Sen.

Youre familiar with the idea of no ethical consumption under capitalism? We are forced into a society that we cannot control. We are backed into corners where none of our decisions are blameless. And even if we dedicate every minute of our lives, and every cent we have, we are not in a position to change those things. That doesnt mean WE are inherently evil for participating. Were simply doing out best to survive. With your view here, the only ethical option would be to cease to exist, which brings along its own moral implications. Basically, this whole thing is what is discussed in the episode of The Good Place where The Judge goes down to earth to see what life is really like there.

They believe their holy book to be the infallible word of an infallible deity, and their holy book says the faithful will be persecuted. To not be means either their holy book is fallible, their god is fallible or lied, or nobody they know is truly faithful. If you take it as given that none of those can be true, it must be the case that the whole world is against them.Funny thing is, actually showing honest love and acceptance for people, not making a show of one's \\"devotion\\", you know, the general kind of thing their god did and preached in that holy book of theirs? It'd get you ostracized from these churches, in a twist of irony that's lost on them.","title":"GOP Cheers Hakeem Jeffries For Saying Trump Won  Until He Notes Which Party Is Home To Election Deniers"},{"text":"Israel declared new annexations while Biden was still president.
