That's one reason I think it was deeply wrong of Biden to pardon his son, who did in fact break the law and should face the consequences.

Here's one example:[America is becoming less woke](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/09/19/america-is-becoming-less-woke) ([non-paywall version](https://archive.ph/knWrN))Almost everywhere we looked a similar trend emerged: wokeness grew sharply in 2015, as Donald Trump appeared on the political scene, continued to spread during the subsequent efflorescence of #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, peaked in 2021-22 and has been declining ever since (see charts). The only exception is corporate wokeness, which took off only after Mr Floyds murder, but has also retreated in the past year or two.The simplest way to measure the spread of woke views is through polling. \\\\[...\\\\] Woke opinions on racial discrimination began to grow around 2015 and peaked around 2021. In the most recent Gallup \\\\[poll\\\\] 35% of people said they worried a great deal about race relations, down from a peak of 48% in 2021 \\\\[...\\\\] Polling about sexual discrimination reveals a similar pattern \\\\[...\\\\]Woke views on gender are also in decline. Pew finds that the share of people who believe someone can be a different sex from the one of their birth has fallen steadily since 2017, when it first asked the question. Opposition to trans students playing in sports teams that match their chosen gender rather than their biological sex has grown from 53% in 2022 to 61% in 2024, according to YouGov.And so on. The issue of trans rights, in particular, is not popular at all. A recent Gallup poll ranked it the least important issue for the voters, the very bottom of list. On other issues like Palestine, the public also disagrees: even though we became more critical of Israel, far more Americans are sympathetic to Israelis than Palestinians on the whole.So yeah, some ideas that are hugely popular with the far left are not at all popular with the rest of the public. Our personal views aside, the majority of Americans dislike or even downright hate some of them. Now, I'm not arguing that we should give up, embrace full-blown sexism and racism and forget about things like climate change for good, but we obviously need to address the issues most voters actually care about if we want a Democrat to win in 2028 and beyond.

Those on the left must confront the cultural elite that has pushed the party away from workers on all sorts of non-economic issues.

The Democrats captured by highly credentialed clerics has led them to embrace the cultural values of an aristocratic elite. From crime, to climate, to gender politics, and the border, mainstream liberal opinion is much further from the views of workers than many liberals are willing to admit.

The same hyper-targeting of \\"swing\\" locations was the crux of his 2016 ground game as well. Bombarding those locales with ads and propaganda endlessly. Geo-targeting digital ads showed the uneducated and ambivalent a curated message and idea targeted just for them. * Exhaustion from the \\"politics? Meh.\\" crowd that believe they have no skin in the game. People who legitimately believe that it doesn't matter who takes office - because they're all the same. And any arguments to the opposite are promptly tuned out. This American Life and several other podcasts/Public Radio programs spent 2-3 episodes (or more) covering the post-game. TAL episode \\"This is the Cake We Baked\\" is particularly poignant. Among the coverage, multiple voters who were completely detached from reality were profiled. It's impossible to adequately explain how goddamn dumb these \\"independent\\" voters were going into this. (Disclaimer: I'm an IND who is committed to Blue-alignment indefinitely barring any ethical or legal reasons to change that decision.)The scope of the problems is so vast that there's no simple explanation. Another teaser - among the podcast coverage, some voters criticized the outpouring of endorsements and advocacy from high profile celebrities backing Harris and/or opposing Trump. For some inexplicable reason, they viewed people like Kimmel pleading with voters to oppose Trump and yet had no comparable objections to a literal Reality Show grifter playing dress-up as a leader. Each podcast is up to an hour, and it really helped dissect and analyze just how many things were fucked up going into 2024 and throughout. There's no simple way to understand it other than listening (or reading transcripts if you prefer.)","title":"To those who did not vote for Harris &amp; Democrats: It's not that Dems didn't earn your Vote. Rather ask yourselves why Trump &amp; his GOP earned your COMPLICITY."},{"text":"As the Democratic party transformed itself from the party of the New Deal to the party of Nafta it embraced a new constituency: progressive professionals. Since Bill Clinton, liberals presided over the offshoring of high-wage blue-collar jobs in manufacturing. They watched as abandoned factories, and the towns that once relied on them, slowly oxidized. As the Rust belt stretched across the heartland, Democrats helped to subsidize the growth of a new elite primarily concentrated on the coasts. They pushed for policies that pulled the economy away from blue-collar industries and toward more dynamic sectors primarily in information technologies. They fashioned a new economy through public policy, and attracted a new constituency as a result. They hoped that as high-wage jobs disappeared, they would be replaced by new high-tech careers; as the party lost blue-collar voters, they invested in white-collar professionals. They got what they wished for.Today, working-class voters C as defined by income (less than $100k a year), occupation (manual work and service work) or education (less than a college education) C are more likely to vote for Republican candidates than for Democrats. Professionals, meanwhile, have successfully gentrified the Democratic party. Unfortunately for liberals, this group isnt nearly large enough to win elections. Worse, the folkways, mannerisms, and tastes of salaried high-income professionals have come to define the party, and now serve as a powerful repellent for working-class voters. Indeed, not only has the embrace of the knowledge class led to the economic neglect of the working class but the aggressive advocacy of professional class cultural values has played a major role in pushing working-class voters away.As a first-time voter in 1992 I have watched this transformation take place in real time over the past 32 years and this sums it up as well as I've seen.","title":"The lefts best defense against Trump?

Josephine Gray was never convicted of murder, she was convicted of insurance fraud. From a legal perspective, she's a serial killer in much the same way that Donald Trump is a rapist (i.e., there was a legal decision against her which implies her guilt, but she was never convicted beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury). That definitely *matters* -- I'm not saying she's innocent -- but it complicates the question of what legal consequences she should face for her crimes.Moreover, she didn't receive a pardon, as OP was advocating for Jan 6 defendants. She had her sentence commuted, 22 years in, at the age of 78, after already moving from prison to home arrest. A pardon says \\"you're not guilty of anything\\"; a commuted sentence says you're just as guilty but it reduces the time you spend incarcerated.I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with Biden commuting sentences of Jan 6 rioters who had already served a significant part of their sentences. I'd have a problem with him pardoning them as if they'd never done anything seriously wrong.

Instead of right vs. left, you're either on the \\"The system is broken, fuck this shit\\" team or the \\"The status quo is working just fine\\" team. I think that's a fundamental common ground that transcends partisan issues - whether or not one wants things to change, even if it entails dismantling and reconstructing a system that's largely obsolete and corrupt, and accepting the possibility that chaos may ensue during the process. Coming together toward the goal of systemic reformation is likely the best and only way for either side to achieve anything substantial policy-wise - those who benefit the most will resist and fight tooth and nail against any threats to the power and control they've managed to attain and edify. It's \\"us vs. the system\\" at this juncture.I'm not overly optimistic, but something's gotta give, and that requires a critical mass of citizens who agree that they are tired of the corruption, secrecy, and abuse that just keeps getting worse (unless you're ultra-wealthy).","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"*the ignorance of supremacy*","title":"Joe Bidens Bodyguard of Liars Betrayed American Democracy - Gerontocracy, pro-establishment politics and deception by Democratic Party insiders all helped elect Donald Trump."},{"text":"Not sure why, but I don't think folks are going to be blaming Biden for the Musk/Trump shutdown.","title":"Trump Demands Any Shutdown Start Now So Its a Biden Problem | \\nWith just hours left to find a resolution, the president-elect appeared to be mostly concerned with ensuring he isnt being blamed for the crisis he created."},{"text":"Looks like Democrats will vote yes on the new bill and avoid a shutdown.

Certainly not all men are bad people, I've had and still have men in my life that I do trust fully, but I've long had views you could probably call misandrist as I just do not trust the average man to be a good person and certainly not a redditor throwing himself into women orientated communities. And there are some trans women that I doubt the true intentions of. Even just in my very limited experience exposing myself to mixed cis-trans communities online the past few weeks, there are comments I can instantly discern as coming from those AMAB, and I especially feel ick when those reddit accounts have posted self images and it is often someone who has seemingly put very little effort into transitioning and ridding themselves of their masculine features and personality traits, as well as often being active in porn subreddits and posting very sexually aggressive comments that I struggle to believe a women would make. As far as experiencing gender dysphoria, a post-transition trans person might legitimately not experience gender dysphoria anymore, but they don't stop being trans.Of course, gender dysphoria is a condition and when successfully treated (by transitioning) the negative effects of the condition clear up. A trans person might experience gender dysphoria and not recognize it as dysphoria. Many trans people report experiencing gender euphoria, which is oftentimes the absense of dysphoria. If you've lived your whole life under a blanket of dysphoria, it's hard to recognize what that feeling is. Fish don't know what water feels like. A person doesn't turn cisgender just because they have difficulty recognizing gender dysphoria. It's much easier to recognize euphoria because it's new and different. It's also just not helpful for the community to gatekeep based on dysphoria, especially when so many questioning people have a difficult time recognizing dysphoria. It's almost a trope how many people post on trans subreddits \\"I don't have dysphoria, but &lt;lists 5 different forms of gender dysphoria\\". It's not helpful to tell those folks that they couldn't be trans. It's better to direct them to a gender therapist where it'll probably take a lot of time to unpack it all.This fits me perfectly so I don't have any issues here. If you find my \\"coming out\\" breakdown I posted to the DT about a month ago, I actually even stated that I didn't think I had gender dysphoria. All the while I had spent the last 7 years of my life pathologically avoiding mirrors and feeling some degree of discomfort every time I was forced to observe my face or body. It would get so severe sometimes I'd go days where I'd only brush my teeth in the dark to avoid my reflection in the medicine cabinet mirror.Especially now that I've accepted the gender identity I am working towards, my gender dysphoria has become so intense the past few weeks that the idea of posting an image of myself purporting to be a women where I'm very clearly not anywhere close to passing is awful enough to cause physical revulsion for me. So I struggle to understand someone that can throw on a pencil skirt and cheap wig and suddenly they are happy as can be while still \\"rocking\\" 5 o'clock shadow (not to degrade wigs as a whole, I have a type of alopecia so tragically I will probably never have naturally feminine hair).","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"People need to get un-fixated on this real quick and look at the horizon because chances are they're gonna find more surprising ways to fuck us over and being hyper vigilant about pandemics could easily make us miss the ball on their next disaster.","title":"Trump Demands Any Shutdown Start Now So Its a Biden Problem | \\nWith just hours left to find a resolution, the president-elect appeared to be mostly concerned with ensuring he isnt being blamed for the crisis he created."},{"text":"Which is why the dems will never let her get any power within the party, because their donors are terrified of people like her.

Since Confederation, Canada has depended on a counterbalance of two reasonable-ish parties who try to closely mirror the desires of current Canadian society: whatever the conservatives are called in that generation, and the Liberal Party of Canada. When one gets long in the tooth and loses the plot in government, or becomes too extreme or out of touch, a huge block of swing voters can go to the other and at least the sky won't fall.  Each has fringe to minor parties clawing at their flanks (CCF, NDP, SCP, UF, PPC etc.), but the main threat is always the other. For most voters, failure of a government of one party can be remedied by going to the other. The existence of a credible close-to-centre opponent also served as a moderating factor for each party, helping especially to curb the excesses of the conservatives.Losing the Liberal Party of Canada removes that credible restraint just as we move to elect our most populist and doctrinal PM in a couple of generations - at least since Diefenbaker. Poilievre will face an opposition that will likely include the Bloc and either the New Democrats or some NDP-Liberal grouping that brings socialists into the main federal opposition. This is going to give him the centre all to himself, and remove fear of a credible electoral threats as a motivation for honesty or caution. It also means that when he *does* lose one day, it will likely be to a party that brings socialism or at least social democracy into government. None of this is ideal from a liberal perspective. We need someone to at least \\"save the furniture\\" of the LPC.

Meanwhile, pharmacies are closing across the country in recent years, which their owners blame in part on a reimbursement squeeze from the PBMs that pay them.PBMs have come under fire in recent years as the public, taxpayers and Congress question whether they are passing along as much savings as they should to health plan enrollees. The noise about coming regulation of PBMs and the companies that own them got even louder when Trump earlier this week said, were going to knock out the middleman, in reference to these companies.  \\n...  \\nBut Democrats blamed Republicans and a cozy relationship they say they have with PBMs as well as health insurers as the reason the PBM reforms were taken out of the legislation. Three of the largest PBMs are owned by **UnitedHealth Group**, CVS Health and Cigna, which also operate health insurance companies.A CR that includes health provisions but excludes bipartisan PBM reform is an embarrassing capitulation to the health insurance lobby, U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a post on X Thursday afternoon.

That's basically how he described it, Musk went all in every hand and bought back in until he won, then he immediately quit and didn't play anymore.  Silver's point I think was that the Uber rich aren't playing the same game as us.  They can take what we would consider to be big risks and eventually they will hit it big.  It's how venture capital just keeps making money.  All their bets don't all have to be winners when the actual winners are such hits.  He described a few simple betting strategies related to this. I'm going to describe this badly, just as a warning.  Say you were at a casino.  If you wanted to have the most possible money out of a limited series of bets, you would go all in every time. That a more conservative betting strategy may have higher expected value (average outcome).  However, the bigger bets would mean you would either bust (no money left) or hit it big with a much lower probability.  So the higher variability outcome would give you a small chance of striking it big in a way that smaller bets would not achieve.  All of this is a long winded way of saying that the people who have \\"won\\" in our capitalist system are those who have gotten phenomenally lucky, and we generally just don't hear about the 'losers' whose big bets didn't work out.  And obviously that poorer people just can't afford to make those same big bets that those born rich can keep making.I stopped reading his book right about where he stopped describing poker/game theory and started talking with Sam Bankman, and have since soured on him for a lot of his more recent election commentary.","title":"Elon Musk Suddenly Realizes He Has No Clue How to Govern.

If there had been a more pragmatic and strategic handling of the carbon tax, then it may have lasted beyond the lifespan of the Trudeau government.??severely cutting immigrationThe LPC and CPC are historically on the same page with immigration. Canada had the highest per capita immigration rate in the world under Stephen Harper. Immigration is being severely cut **currently** because, again, of a disastrous policy decision by the federal government that ruined a broad pro-immigration consensus in Canada. There would have been no cuts to immigration under the Conservatives (and Liberals; theyre cutting right now) if the 500K/yr policy which was deeply unpopular hadnt been introduced.??and trying to cut what they can from recent welfare expansionsLets be clear here. The federal government is on track to hit $560B in expenditures this fiscal year. Thats **double** the $280B projected under Joe Oliver. Also, there was no Throne Speech that granted mandates for national Pharmacare, dental care, or the school food program. Nor did the Liberals win a mandate to introduce those programs during the 2021 Election.

It was after the 1992 election that Newt Gingrich started to employ an obstructionist strategy in the House which resulted in Federal Employees getting an extra two weeks of paid leave in November 1995 when he decided to block a vote on the budget.Founding fathers gave the Congress the power of the purse as a check and balance over the Executive Branch under the President which actually runs the country. Each year the President proposes a budget the House and Senate committees debate and amend it and it would in years past get approved in a series of appropriations bills by September 30th, the end of the FY as part of regular order since it was the primary function of the Congress: funding and oversight.When a budget bill wasnt passed by Sept 30 the standard practice became to pass a straight continuing resolution which would allow all the Departments and Agencies of the Govt. to keep running based on a proration of the previous FYs budget, i.e., a one month CR would allow a spending 1/12th of the previous years budget, giving the appropriation committees in House and Senate to gain support from those objecting via a process of pork barrel earmarks; add ons to the budget that would benefit the state of a hold-out Senator or district of a single house member.  Not surprisingly once legislators realized they stood to gain pork by becoming obstructionists there were more and more earmarks added to the budget bills to get them past.Now its progressed to point that what used to be a simple CR process of kicking the budget can down the road at previous FY spending levels gets bogged down by using the CY as a vehicle to fund pet projects and issues which is why 37 fiscally conservative Republicans voted to block the CR to send a shot over the bow of the Majority Leader.","title":"Trump Demands Any Shutdown Start Now So Its a Biden Problem | \\nWith just hours left to find a resolution, the president-elect appeared to be mostly concerned with ensuring he isnt being blamed for the crisis he created."},{"text":"I like to think the phone calls also included the sharing of Trump blackmail.

About 32 million people across the country are served by community health centers, regardless of their ability to pay.Federally funded community health centers are non-profit clinics that receive grants from the Health Center Program of the Health Resources and Services Administration. If the grants end, the centers will have no funding for employees or medical care. The Community Health Center Fund provides about 70% of federal money for health centers.Community Health Centers represent the largest primary care network in the U.S. Health centers have been in existence for nearly 60 years and care for 31.5 million patients nationwide, the vast majority of whom are low-income and need a place to go for affordable care.In August of this year the DHHS celebrated a milestone achieved with HRSA-funded community health centers:[New Data Show Highest Number of Health Center Patients in Nearly 60 Year History of the Program | HRSA-Funded Health Centers Served 2.7 Million More Patients Over Past Four Years, Reaching High of More than 31 Million Patients](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/05/new-data-show-highest-number-health-center-patients-nearly-60-year-history-program.html)Community health centers play a pivotal, and growing, role in Americas health care system. They are especially important in our effort to reduce health care disparities in underserved communities, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. More than 31 million people across the country - in every U.S. state, territory, and the District of Columbia - depend on health centers, making them a vital resource. The Biden-Harris Administration wants all Americans to have access to high-quality primary health care services, regardless of a patients ability to pay, and community health centers help make that possible.Under the Biden-Harris Admin they were being [expanded into every underserved community:](https://www.hrsa.gov/about/news/press-releases) rural, low-income neighborhoods, etc.; red or blue, it didn't matter.

His statement might be illegal, at any rate it is very likely fascist and certainly **it is beyond the pale for an American to voice an opinion about German politics. Germans absolutely never, ever, utter the slightest word about American politics and certainly would never advance negative opinions about the American president in the middle of an election campaign.

In my opinion both reflection and praxis are necessary. Marx himself said that the means through which class consciousness of the working class would be achieved would grow over time. I dont think going back in time to when society was more insular is a good way of achieving the goals OP stated. This care ethos you speak of is important, but I disagree that conservatives would gainfully participate in the practice of this ethos without interacting with \\"others\\" even if they agreed in principle, which is the whole problem. Most conservatives I know will preach about caring about the random acts of violence they see carried out on the nightly news, but do nothing to support something small like school lunch and after school programs that would change lives in the communities the conservative sees on TV. I believe that conservative, who in principle wants to see a more caring world with less violence, will only match their thought to action if scared, loved, or saddened by an experience with another person.

Look at how many celebrities would have just coasted by as being charming, wonderful people into perpetuity in the age before the internet. Now we're finally seeing so many rich assholes who thought they could get away with terrible things actually being called out for it, sometimes even jailed.It's not a stretch to imagine how much of this would apply to politics and news outlets too. How much was hidden before the internet by way of the wealthy having nearly complete control of all media outlets? There was a much stronger sense of national unity, but would it have existed if the Internet was around to highlight all its problems? The consensus of truth was much stronger, but how much was the truth and how much was hidden? How many scary-sounding narratives were swept away by that consensus as being \\"conspiracy theories\\" when they were actually true?For better or worse, one could look at things now in a sense that the rich have had to sweat and scramble to maintain a narrative consensus they've had a firm grasp on for decades. They have largely adapted now, but it wasn't before a lot of light was shown behind the curtain. As bad as things are, and as bad as they will likely become soon, there has possibly been more accountability for them than there ever has in our lifetime - even if it's mostly in the form of public shaming.","title":"Are we still a democracy or have we already moved to oligarchy and authoritarianism?"},{"text":"No matter how you slice it, Biden is a lame duck President with just weeks left in his term.

If they went on a forebearance for instance, it severed the consecutive portion of the payments. It's also the same reason why there wasn't a massive lawsuit about failure to forgive them. Legally they had not complied with the program. What Biden is doing in forgiving those loans is saying that the people made the required 120 payments therefore the minituia of noncompliance shouldn't matter. If you're 9 years into your PLSF and have consistently made the payments without pause I don't think there's anything that Trump will be able to do to stop your loans from being forgiven.

During some very lean employment years I was struggling to cover payments across all of the loans and I didn't even know that I had options to try to knock out the high-interest ones first or consider consolidation. The federal loan servicers certainly create the impression that you either do it the way they tell you or you're in a world of trouble (looking at you, Mohela, you absolute bastards).I was very fortunate to eventually become well-employed and get them all paid off, but even so, about a third of what I eventually paid was interest. I know people who have been dutifully paying for years and owe more than they borrowed. I am fully, fully in support of any and all forgiveness programs and think we should cap federal loan interest at the cost of administering the program, but since that's probably not happening any time soon I am also extremely glad to see folks like you helping young people attain some financial literacy about what they're in for.","title":"Biden forgives $4.28 billion in student debt for 54,900 borrowers"},{"text":"Yep.

Victims included the parents of a leukemia patient who were trying to pay for their daughters hospital visits. And while some of the money was recovered, people in towns like Lexington, North Carolina, where ZeekRewards had its office, are still suffering.  Zeeks victims were working class people who didnt understand what they were getting into.Zeek CEO Paul Burks, who made millions from the scheme, was convicted of wire and mail fraud and sentenced to 14 years in prison in the first year of the Trump administration. Burks (pictured above) filed multiple appeals, claiming that COVID poses a risk to his health (he contracted a mild case) that were rejected by the court. And that was that until Biden commuted his sentence.The Zeek CEO was one of a number of major fraudsters who were liberated by Biden in his rash of pardons and commutations. While Biden had long claimed that no one is above the law, beginning with his corrupt pardon of his son, the outgoing president has set out to demonstrate that the law is worthless for some of the worst convicted crooks in the country.Biden commuted the sentence of James Fry, a hedge fund manager convicted in the Petters Group $1.9 billion Ponzi scheme described as one of the largest and most complex Ponzi schemes in U.S. history and was accused of having raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors while working alongside a convicted criminal. He also commuted the sentence of Timothy McGinn, one half of a pair of brokers accused of defrauding 900 investors of $136 million, who had been sentenced to 15 years in prison. Victims included a father of two wounded veterans who had been putting aside the money for their expenses.Former CEO Eric Bloom, who got 14 years in prison, after being accused of committing the biggest fraud in Chicago court history in what was described as a $665 million fraud scheme also got a pass from Biden. So did former CEO Gregory J. Podlucky, who ran a bottled water company and had been accused of a $685 million pyramid fraud loan scheme in which the money was spent on jewels and toy trains, and had been sentenced to 20 years in prison.Gregory McKnight, who ran a $72 million Ponzi scheme that targeted at least 3,000 investors in every state in the country, had been sentenced to 15 years in prison before Biden stepped in.Marc Dreier, had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for a $740 million Ponzi scheme with losses to investors estimated at $400 million, also got a helping hand from the White House.Biden seemed to have a soft spot for Ponzi fraudsters and his commutations included Nevin Shapiro, sentenced to 20 years in prison for a $930 million Ponzi scheme that made headlines because of its Miami connection, Brian Callahan, sentenced to 12 years in prison for a $96 million Ponzi scheme that caused some to lose their life savings, and Joseph Shereshevsky, sentenced to 22 years in prison for a $255 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded 1,200 investors.Other smaller time fraudsters freed by Biden included Gary McDuff, sentenced to 25 years, for an $11 million investment fraud scheme, Gordon Driver, sentenced to 12 years in prison for a $17 Ponzi scheme with around 150 victims, Christopher Swartz who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison after defrauding over 150 investors out of $21 million, and Andrew Mackey, sentenced to 27 years in prison for a $12 million Ponzi scheme with 150 victims.Biden also intervened on behalf of Henry Ramer, sentenced to 13 years in prison for defrauding over 200 investors out of over $3 million, Rodney Phelps, who had been sentenced to 9 years in prison for defrauding victims out of $2.4 million in a Ponzi scheme, Leslie John Hamilton Jr who had been sentenced to 25 years in prison for ripping off over 400 investors of $14 million in a pyramid scheme, and James Turek, sentenced to 18 years in prison for defrauding 8,500 investors out of over 18 million.Biden also extended his hand to fellow corrupt government officials including Rita Crundwell, the former comptroller of Dixon, Illinois, who had embezzled over $53 million to fund her horse breeding business in what was described as the largest theft of public funds in state history, Cuyahoga County county commissioner and county Democratic Party chairman Jimmy Dimora who had been sentenced to 28 years in prison, and Judge Michael Conahan, who became notorious as the kids-for-cash judge for a scheme that involved sending kids to prison in exchange for kickbacks. The judges actions have been blamed for at least one suicide.After giving his son a blanket pardon that would potentially cover legal issues emerging from his tax problems, Biden chose to also intervene on behalf of Paul Daugerdas: a lawyer who had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for manufacturing $7 billion fake tax deductions in what was described as the biggest tax fraud prosecution ever.Health care fraud was also a popular theme in Bidens commutations including James Burkhart, a former CEO of the American Senior Communities nursing home chain who abused his official position of trust to steal tax payer dollars intended to benefit this communitys sick, elderly and mentally challenged,  Elaine Lovett, the owner of a medical billing company involved in a $26 Medicare fraud case, Millicent Traylor, accused of taking part in an $8.9 million Medicare fraud scheme and Babubhai Patel, who controlled 26 pharmacies in Detroit, and provided kickbacks to doctors to prescribe expensive drugs, and numerous other health care fraudsters as well.As well as the more serious case of Dr. Meera Sachdeva, a former Misssissipi oncologist who was accused of using expired and diluted chemotherapy medications and whose clinic reused needles resulting in possible infections and deaths.Considering the involvement of James Biden and Joe Bidens own physician in the Americore scandal, that may be a prelude for pardons coming in for Biden family members and associates.While Biden is not the first president to pardon and commute sentences for fraudsters, both the dollar amounts and the number of victims in these cases are staggering. Due to complicated recovery processes it is difficult to estimate the total amount of losses for victims, but the total amounts of money involved in these cases approaches $5 billion with over 1 million victims.No president has ever left office bailing out individuals who did so much harm to so many.","title":"Biden Frees Men Who Scammed $5 Billion With Over 1 Million Victims, among dozens of other Ponzi scheme fraudsters"},{"text":"Honestly, I would love to get rid of it and CRs in place of actually doing their jobs and setting an annual budget.

Trump wants it suspended until he is out of office which means he's going to use it to blow up the debt.To anyone saying, \\"but he ran on lowering the debt.\\"  If he was honest, keeping the limit or lowering it wouldn't be a problem for him.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh dropped a letter(opens in a new tab) declaring his party will be moving a motion of non-confidence in the new year. [...]Ontario MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith becomes Canada's next housing, infrastructure and communities minister, taking over for Sean Fraser, who announced on Monday that he wouldn't be running again.**And, taking over the public safety portfolio from Finance and Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc C who took on the top economic post on Monday after Chrystia Freeland's stunning resignation C is Ontario MP and current chair of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) David McGuinty.**The other Liberal MPs who will be joining cabinet are:* Quebec MP Rachel Bendayan, becoming Canada's official languages minister and associate minister of public safety.\\n* Quebec MP lisabeth Brire, becoming the minister of national revenue, taking over for Marie-Claude Bibeau who isn't running again.\\n* Manitoba MP Terry Duguid, who becomes minister of sport and the minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada.\\n* Nova Scotia MP Darren Fisher, who is Canada's new minister of veterans affairs and associate defence minister.\\n* Newfoundland and Labrador MP Joanne Thompson, taking on the minister of seniors title, which was a role handed off, after Seamus O'Regan left cabinet, and\\n* Ontario MP and outgoing whip Ruby Sahota who picks up the democratic institutions portfolio and becomes the minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, a role outgoing minister Filomena Tassi held.The current cabinet ministers moving into new, or amended positions are:* **Anita Anand, who had been doing double duty as Treasury Board president and transport minister, is now the minister of transport and internal trade.**\\n* Gary Anandasangaree, who maintains his role as minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, picks up the northern affairs and Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency positions from Dan Vandal who isn't running again.\\n* Steven MacKinnon, who keeps his job as labour minister but is also taking on the employment, workforce development and official languages role from Randy Boissonnault, who left cabinet last month to focus on clearing the allegations against him.\\n* And, Ginette Petitpas Taylor becomes Canada's next Treasury Board president.As anticipated, based on comments LeBlanc made yesterday, Mark Carney has not been appointed a cabinet position in this shuffle after Trudeau assured LeBlanc he'd be staying in his current role until the next election.Throughout his shuffles, Trudeau has sought to uphold gender parity and balance regional representation as best as possible. His current front bench does maintain an equal number of men and women: 19, when not counting the prime minister, for a total of 38 ministers.Sources have indicated that while Trudeau is ready to make changes to his inner circle, it's not to be interpreted as the prime minister being ready to declare his next steps, and it remains to be seen if he takes questions following the shuffle.\\nTrudeau though, has called a cabinet meeting for 3 p.m. EST.**Asked Thursday whether Trudeau still has the full support of his cabinet to stay on as prime minister, LeBlanc said \\"yes.\\"**!ping Can","title":"4 ministers get new portfolios, 8 Liberal MPs promoted in Trudeau cabinet shuffle"},{"text":" Biden-Harris was the most pro-union administration in US history.They literally strike busted union workers, forcing them accept 1 day of paid sick leave when they were striking for 15I get that MSNBC spent a lot of hours repackaging this is as some worker win, but it wasnt.

A subset of Democrats were more excited about Bernie than Hillary or Biden, but he still lost both times. It's about what gets the marginal voter off their couch and to the polls, not the \\"blue no matter who\\" folks who would've voted for Biden's corpse if they needed to. Those people drive the election narrative about vibes and excitement and all that stuff but it takes more than that to win elections. My theory on what they were  selling Kamala hard is because 1) they were screwed with Biden so genuinely excited to at least have a chance 2) they knew her coronation was unusual, so they had to rally around her hard in hopes those marginal voters would accept her as legitimate.Candidates do matter, but politics are often thermostatic: when things aren't going well, people want change and punish the incumbent party. Things weren't going well in 2020, so people voted against Trump. Things still aren't going well in 2024, so people punished Democrats. Sometimes a really popular candidate is enough to overcome this (e.g. Obama in 2012), but it's an uphill battle. Biden was a weak candidate but had this advantage. Kamala was a weak candidate but had this disadvantage.I don't think people \\"enjoy\\" voting from home, it just creates more opportunities to do it vs. not.

Along with a Cold War with China, proxy war with Russia, the world is certainly not in a place where peace is on the horizon.","title":"'Slap in the Face to Working-Class Families': Senate Sends Biden $895 Billion Military Bill | \\n\\"We do not need to spend almost a trillion dollars on the military, while half a million Americans are homeless and children go hungry,\\" said Sen.

They don't just jump to bombing people or locking people up.  They make themselves the canter of the moment and make it the focus they want right in front of people while they are in a position to do so.  That is exactly what abusing power looks like, and they did it to everyone. They had fences around the white house before any riots had even occurred.  They had prices raising before trucks and the forst time in history that a ship blocked the Suez Canal...what an insane abuse of power! They raised prices and made things the most difficult for the people at the lowest and didnt raise even a single finger to help them, that is abuse of power.  They passed laws passing trillions and trillions of dollars to companies while giving less than 3% to the actual people, and raised inflation so much that the people with the most debt actually made money during the pandemic (gee, who own the biggest debts in the world, that would be the people with the most assets already, and rich people were made even more insanely rich), which is such an insane abuse of power and quite literally making the rest of the world poorer while making the rich get richer, and never raising even a finger to help those who were hit the hardest like the homeless who were asking for money (which was also made worse with the laws from covid and so many places going cashless).  They cost the lowest people to lose some lives with the problems they created, and yet they got even richer... all right i  front of our faces and all moving forward no matter what was said, on their timeline without even a care about our opinion or arguments against it, right in front of our faces...that is a terrible terrible abuse of power.  What's sad is that the entirety of covid waa written about in a Blackrock document talking about the \\"upcoming economic downturn\\", and writing all the things that would need to happen that were policies that would be hard to pull off including helicoptoring money directly to businesses (which ended up being the PPP loans), and some 50 plus pages about all the policies that would have to take place all written after the Jackson Hole meeting in 2019, and it all came true.  But all it said about poor people was that it was going to be a hard time...they dont care about it except for the mob focusing on them, so they had us focused on tearing each other apart while they robbed us.  They had riots focused on dividing each other and culture apart (culture is how we all agree on solving problems, attacking culture is about attacking accountability). It was the largest scale abuse of power to ever take place when things are all said and done, and they didnt raise even a finger to help those hit worst by it.  How we all take accountability for that is going to be wild, but it saddens me how many homeless people I stopped seeing at some corners on my drives, because I imagine the worst happened to many people.  They were all in it together and got insanely rich together.  All those debts got turned into being worth less actual money as inflation skyrocketed and their assets gained more money and their debt became worth less.  It was giving money straight to the people that already had it, and they pulled it off without ever having to face a single one of the people that didnt make it because of the greed.  It's so sad, but there was nothing that could be done and all warnings I or others tried to make fell on deaf ears.  An abuse of power all the way from the top down...I would love a simple infographic of all the Presidents (because Trump passed the first bill worth tens of trillions, and Biden passed them too), to Senators (Pelosi made a ridiculous amount off of options bought before bills were passed of companies that were getting some of the most money), to chairs at the FED and SEC...I would simply love a list of who bought new houses during covid while the homeless literally died in the street and were told that the cerveza sickness meant they couldnt even sleep in public spaces like being protected under a bridge.  Cops defended the policy and had displays of abuse of power right in front of people (remember even the insanity of the cops in Minnesota?!), this whole thing was one of the saddest displays of abuse of power, and yet it continues.  And yet people still somehow arent fighting to make the Smith-Mundt Act even stronger to ban Propaganda, and it continues to get worse.  I dont know what the answer is, but they have shown that they will continue abusing power no matter what people are saying and do not care about the people who are destroyed or lost while it happens.  And if we do not care about our lowest citizens losing their lives, then I do not know what causes can rally people together, but it will definitely get crazier before everything is said and done.  People abusing power dont abuse it less when they get away with it without facing justice...it's like a drink of alcohol, they just want more and have already shown they cant handle it.  It's going to get much worse before it gets better.","title":"another illustration of the \\"all in it together\\" globalist takeover"},{"text":"Think of those numbers. $4.28 billion divided by some 53,000 plus people.

Student loans allow deferment for time spent earning another degree or financial hardship, but since the interest is still being charged so the amount of debt rises. You can also apply for income-based payments which basically means they will allow you a lower payment than what is necessary to pay down the loan- again the deficit between actual payment and the appropriate one adds more to the total debt. When people are young they like the cash in their pockets but when they need to start making home purchases, save for retirement, or up their investing, they realize all that leniency has left them with more debt.

It gives us ownership of our own destiny together. He emphasizes the idea of the Whole People and Whole Education. This would include preschool and anything after high school, not necessarily just college, but also trade schools, etc.The rest of the letter John Adams wrote to John Jeb is absolutely fantastic. He goes on to discuss why it's important to create a system that makes people like Martin Luther King jr, Susan B Anthony, Carl Sagan, and Mr Rogers, and Washington. Good leaders should not be a product of the time, but of the educational system and culture of the people. If a country doesn't make good leaders then when that leader is gone there's no one to replace them and that culture and movement dies with them.Instead of Adoring a Washington, Mankind Should applaud the Nation which Educated him. If Thebes owes its Liberty and Glory to Epaminondas, She will loose both when he dies, and it would have been as well if She had never enjoyed a taste of either: but if the Knowledge the Principles the Virtues and Capacities of the Theban Nation produced an Epaminondas, her Liberties and Glory will remain when he is no more: and if an analogous system of Education is Established and Enjoyed by the Whole Nation, it will produce a succession of Epaminandass.In another short work by John Adams, [Thoughts on Government](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Government), [YouTube Reading](https://youtu.be/XIw_BItRLfs), he wrote about the importance of a liberal education for everyone, spared no expense.\\nLaws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower class of people, are so extremely wise and useful, that, to a humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant.One hundred years ago we built in mass the first major wave of highschools in the United States.[In](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_movement) 1910 18% of 15- to 18-year-olds were enrolled in a high school; barely 9% of all American 18-year-olds graduated. By 1940, 73% of American youths were enrolled in high school and the median American youth had a high school diploma.This was a dramatic shift in education and economic gain for the United States. Not all of our grandparents went to highschool until the public saw it necessary to build them. The future is going to need more local experts than ever and an education that was good 100 years ago just isn't going to cut it on a global scale. People will need to change careers in the future and probably more than once. We will need continuing education as a society so that people can adapt and change with the coming times. This includes ensuring that after graduating high school people are able to attend and easily afford the education they need to participate in their community.As long as a person puts in their work to learn and change themselves, our citizens shouldn't be overly burdened with expenses for attending a public education program.It's not that citizens shouldn't pay anything, but it shouldn't be so much as to keep them from working and meaningfully participating in the economy. Not as indentured servants, but free citizens.","title":"Biden Cancels Nearly $4.3 Billion in Public Worker Student Debt"},{"text":"Aye, but there's the rub.

Gray was?resentenced to the same amount of time again in 2006 following a series of appeals.\\nGray, who collected $165,000 from the three insurance settlements, was charged with murder by Maryland state authorities but ultimately convicted in federal court in 2002 for insurance fraud for violating whats known as the slayers rule, which prohibits killers from receiving inheritance and insurance proceeds from their victims death. Witnesses at Grays various trials accused her of using intimidation tacticsincluding threats of voodooto coerce them into remaining silent. It was the witchcraft, mostly, Lenron Goode, the brother of Grays third victim, told the?Washington Post?in 2002.Gray did not face a murder trial in state court after Marylands state attorney said her hefty federal sentence ensures she will die in prison.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic allowed Grayand the rest of Bidens clemency recipientsto serve out their sentences in home confinement. Now, Biden has freed Gray altogether in what the White House called the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history. Biden, in order to correct historical injustices, granted clemency to those convicted of non-violent crimes who were sentenced under outdated laws, policies, and practices that left them with longer sentences than if the individuals were sentenced today, the White House said.But Grays body count puts the lie to [Bidens claim that] these are non-violent offenders, according to a former federal prosecutor who handled her case.It pisses me off, as you can imagine, James Trusty, who prosecuted Gray as assistant U.S. attorney in Greenbelt, Md., told the Washington Free Beacon.This doesnt feel like a rule of law moment for the Biden administration, said Trusty, who said he learned of Grays commuted sentence after receiving a notification of Bidens action through an alert on the court docket for Grays case.Indeed, Biden has faced intense blowback over his selection of pardon and clemency recipients over the past few weeks. Biden pardoned his son Hunter on Dec. 2 ahead of his sentencing for tax evasion and felony gun charges, reneging on his repeated promises not to do so.In his mass-clemency spree, Biden commuted the 17.5-year prison sentence of William Conahan, a former Pennsylvania judge who sent more than 2,000 juveniles to prison as part of whats been called the Kids for Cash kickback scheme. Gov. Josh Shapiro (D.) said Biden was absolutely wrong to commute Conahans sentence given the shocking nature of his crimes. The mother of one of Conahans victims has blamed the judge for her sons suicide.?\\nBiden also commuted prison sentences for a Mississippi cancer doctor who diluted \\nchemotherapy drugs as part of a Medicare fraud scheme, an Illinois comptroller who embezzled $53 million in the biggest municipal fraud case in the nations history, and the 15-year sentence of Wendy Hechtman, a former journalist convicted of manufacturing and selling a drug considered more potent than fentanyl. An Omaha police detective who investigated Hechtman said her drug operation was suspected in at least six overdose deaths. That investigation now feels wasted, Chris Perna, the Omaha investigator, told the Free Beacon.Gray, now 78 years old, is the first Biden clemency recipient found so far to have been directly involved in murder or any other violent criminal activity.According to prosecutors, Gray admitted to a friend in 2000 that she had killed both her husbands and another gentleman. Gray told her friend that she shot her first husband, Norman Stribbling, and left his body on the side of a road to make it look like a robbery. Gray confessed that she killed her second husband, Robert Gray, with help from her boyfriend. That man, Clarence Goode, would be the Black Widows third victim. Gray told her friend she had to get rid of Goode because he threatened to blackmail her over Robert Grays murder.Police found Goodes blood stains at Grays house and a 9mm bullet casing that matched the one used in the murder.According to prosecutors, Gray schemed to have all three of her victims designate her as the beneficiary of their life insurance policies and then murdered them to receive benefits after their deaths. Gray tried to take out an insurance policy on a fourth man, Andre Savoy, whom she promised to buy a Mustang GT with proceeds from the Goode insurance settlement. Savoy testified at Grays trial that she admitted to murdering Robert Gray, her second husband, after sneaking into his house dressed as a man.For Trusty, the former Gray prosecutor, questions remain about Bidens process for granting relief to a career criminal whose life story hes said was written in the blood of three men who loved Josephine Gray.

Hell, just scrolling through this comment section yields quite a few redditors who have no idea if their loans qualify for PSLF.

I'm probably most displeased with the absence of abortion and trans issues in their considerations, though I'm not surprised. I've always wanted to see more contributions from libertarian feminists in Cato. I think that would be a positive influence for how those issues are mulled over there. Maybe someday.https://preview.redd.it/5i4ihu76018e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca50d14e4c9aaba53711335418a7fbb59ef4924dThey're right. Price gouging is good in those scenarios, public opinion be damned. Now Cato probably isn't so hot about addressing those who miss out on affording those resources, but it's addressable within this sub's approach. Bans on gouging or not, we would want a govt emergency service that gets necessities to those who can't obtain them in a disaster scenario.I say it's better to let prices do their thing because it leads to allocative efficiency, since suppliers will work to provide more goods to take advantage of the higher price in that scenario. Yes, that means that those who can't afford that price will not be able to buy, but we can then cover the gaps with FEMA and the like. In the opposite scenario, a price ceiling that kicks in for emergencies will lead to perhaps a more \\"fair\\" distribution of goods based on who gets in line first instead of who is able to pay, but it still ends with a shortage of goods. We still have to use emergency services to get food and water to people in that case, and will likely have to spend even more money on them to make up for the slack left by constrained market supply.Just some food for thought.
