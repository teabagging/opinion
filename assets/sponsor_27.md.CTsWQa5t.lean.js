So how does \\"Vote for me and I'll give everyone $25k/$50k of tax payer money\\" pass your ethical filter, but \\"Sign a petition and you could win $1M\\" doesn't? Seems like the former is far more blatant of a \\"bribe\\" masquerading as a \\"policy proposal\\". At what point would a policy proposal ever amount to a \\"bribe\\" to you?

In the early 20th century in Egypt there was a feminist movement that sought enabling education for girls. In my generation, the 10 first best grades were mostly taken by girls every year, and most females got education just like males, but many get married and don't work, but still there's a big workforce by women in Egypt. It's more common among females to not complete higher education or work than males, but it's more cultural (even if influenced by religion) than a new religious tendency.Also the same about hijab and niqab. In the last century no one wore hijab in formal settings in education or work. Even in normal settings in villages and cities women in pictures were more chill about showing arms, neck and upper chest or part of the hair and in weddings no way they'll wear hijab. Until the nineties when Saudi started funding Salafism like crazy selling cheap books in every country and having religious centers etc. It's known as the \\"Islamic awakening\\". And also there were a lot of people who went to work in the gulf from Egypt and they came back more religious, I've personally seen that growing up and remember 2 of them right now. One came back from Saudi supporting the Muslim brotherhood (that was originally created in Egypt, but it's an Islamist movement in general). The other came back having a salafi beard and wearing weird male Salafi clothes, but now he stopped doing that after years in Egypt but obviously still religious just like everyone else.The same with niqab it's still rare but visible. I've seen people starting to wear it and take it off after some period. And see very few Niqabis in university. By far most other girls wear hijab except a minority that includes Christians and maybe a few Muslims. Slightly more Niqabis on the street, but most beggars wear niqab so they make a good percentage.I'll end with a kind of funny story, told by former president Gamal Abdelnasser 1952-1969 (who I don't like) He was telling this story in some sort of a rally, that the leader of the Muslim brotherhood was telling him that they need to make hijab mandatory  so Abdelnasser told him make your daughter wear one first. Everyone in the rally was laughing like that Muslim brotherhood guy is crazy. That's how impractical that was. Now the normal is wearing hijab. This is the video translated to English: https://youtu.be/_ZIqdrFeFBkWe can see very conservative traditions and clothes regarding women in the last century as well, but it seemed based on class or setting, more like societal conservatism and more natural slowly developed culture even if influenced by religion long ago, not the stressed obsessed religious awareness today. And I agree with you the internet is increasing religiosity by its nature not just because of Islamist funding, at least in the short term. If not for the internet, I would have probably not changed my mind about Islam.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"Biden has mistakenly assumed that Netanyahu wants the best for his people.

It is worth looking at both sides with an open mind, to make your own decision on what you think him without listening to the media and the masses to make that decision for you.

If housing prices werent a problem. This subreddit would all be cheering for CEQA and NEPA as practical evidence based policy which is not how libertarians think at all. When another one of democrats bad regulations turns out to harm people in significant ways, you will just pretend that you never supported it, and that evidence based policy makers never supported it. Libertarians do not support such policies a priori, which means before some policy expert they all like tells them its evidence based policy.An example of this is trade. Democrats all believed that evidence based practical policy told us that trade barriers harm our country. When their favorite policy providers suddenly switched up and decided that now trade barriers are evidence based practical policy, the democrats even in this sub turned on the idea at once, and now pretend that it always evidence based practical policy to put up giant tariffs on foreign competition.The reality of Evidence based practical policy is that it just so happens that the evidence always vindicates everything democrats currently believe even if they pull a complete 180 on an issue. You can guarantee your next policy is evidence based, because democrats have little no actual values unlike libertarians. The moment their mind changes, they find new evidence to support whatever populist nonsense is popular in the zeitgeist at that moment.How much do you want to bet, that restricting immigration is actually evidence based practical policy tomorrow?Do some Democrats regret soft on crime policies, dont worry the new evidence has come to your rescue. It was always bad policy, and the evidence always showed it, just like it showed the opposite 6 years ago.The ACA is the opposite of libertarian policy because it expands the government spending toward increasingly paying for peoples healthcare instead of private individuals paying for their own healthcare like libertarians would want.Not banning fracking is kind of libertarian, but there was never really a big push outside very far left circles to do that. The US became the largest oil exporter under the Obama administration when fracking really got going. I wouldnt really say not doing something really bad makes someone a libertarian. Not supporting the legalization of murder could also be libertarian, but its not exclusive to libertarians at all, and calling it libertarian would be dishonest at best.The final point about being socially liberal is just about tolerance. Most conservatives and all liberals agree about supporting same sex marriage, however conservatives are still very anti-trans which puts the libertarians closer to democrats in that one case.Most democrats still dont support things like legalizing gambling and cocaine.Its a matter of paternalism. The Democratic Party politicians are the mothers and fathers of all Americans who they see as children, and therefore just know better than to allow Americans to decide those risks for themselves. Being slightly more liberal on a few issues, and barely at that does not make a libertarian in my personal opinion.I guess weed is one issue, but I think I remember recently reading that conservatives are starting to slip on that issue too.Im sure plenty libertarians appreciate that Kamala Harris is not the most left leaning person in the Democratic Party, but that does not make her even close being the most libertarian democrat.","title":"I am a former Libertarian voting for Harris.

If someone was a trump supporter, they likely already planned to vote.Calling a group of people and their homeland a floating piece of garbage ls a lot more personal. Trump supporters aren't a race. It's kinda like the ACAB thing, agree or disagree with it you can't justifiably liken it to racism cause cops aren't a race.

He said and I quote \\"The only garbage I see is his supporters\\" when referencing the comedian. Ultimately that's still within the realm of positive pr I think.

Hes in it for the status, the money, the ego. And thats one of the reasons hes dangerous, in my opinion. Hes perfectly happy to leave the decisions that affect you and me to the people around him. And because he doesnt have a policy agenda of his own, he isnt very concerned with who those people are. During his last term, he hired people who were loyal, whether or not they were actually qualified to do the work. I mean, he hired his daughter and his son-in-law to senior advisor positions. To the president.The reason the department of education might be under threat (I dont know for a fact that it is, mind you) is that some extremely ideological conservatives have long wanted to get rid of a lot  of the federal governments core features. And, many of those people seem to believe they have a good chance of getting that done under Trump. Because he doesnt really care either way.I know what you mean about the apparently overblown claims that hes going to kill or imprison his political opponents. For what its worth, I dont think he really wants to do that. However, I think its possible that he hires people who do. And, his messaging is pretty unsettling. He recently used the phrase enemies within to describe radical left lunatics, and then suggested that the military could easily handle them (interview was with Maria Bartiromo if you want to check it out). He likes to talk about how great the Bible is, but cant quote it to save his life. He consciously undermined the integrity of our elections because it was convenient to do so. And hes talked many times about revoking the broadcast privileges of news networks who are unfriendly to him. All of this is incredibly unserious at best, and deeply authoritarian at worst.I early voted for Kamala yesterday. I thought about leaving it blank because Im deeply concerned, even borderline obsessed, with Americas continued funding and arming of Israel under Joe Biden, and shes given no sign that anything will change with her. I wont get into that issue here, but it is eating away at me every day, and it made it very hard to vote for her.For the record, I dont think Kamala is particularly interested in policy either, but I do believe that the countrys norms and institutions will be safe with the Democrats for four years. Im not so sure about the Republicans.Last thing, I wanted to recommend two podcasts to you. The first, Breaking Points, is about news and policy. It offers analysis from both sides of the political spectrum, and is a highly reliable source of information in my estimation.The second is called Knowledge Fight. Its hosted by two leftist comedians. It is not about news or policy, but rather the talk show host Alex Jones (primarily). The format involves one host, Dan, describing and playing clips from episodes of Alex Jones show, Infowars, for the other host, who reacts to the content. The reason Im recommending it to you is that Dan does an unbelievable job breaking down how Jones and other pundits mislead their viewers, omit relevant information, and spin the news of the day in the service of their agenda. It is remarkable how clearly and rationally he explains everything. All you have to do is tolerate the other hosts excessive goofiness. But seriously, if you want to get better at learning how to discern good information from bad, you could do a lot worse than listening to a bunch of great examples of bad information designed to misinform you.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is currently the best choice for President."},{"text":"Theyre making it look like deplorable quote.","title":"Joe Biden calls Donald Trump voters garbage"},{"text":"Trump absolutely had control over who appeared and spoke at his rally.

Yeah, the pressure is so strong, and many people don't appreciate how much internal conflict and unnecessary societal decline in everything a very conservative religious culture causes. Sometimes a person might seem to agree with you on the surface, but both of you put completely different weights on the problem which is equivalent to completely different opinions.A steady increase of Muslims in the west will lead to a gradual irreversible change of the culture, limits on freedom, and conflict with others in the same country. Hoping their culture will definitely change just because they immigrated is like getting into a relationship with a partner not because of what they are right now but what you're hoping they'll be in your mind. Countries are like people in this sense and can or can't afford certain things, they're not charity organizations. Even charity organizations have limits to be able to continue to support people in most need, just like countries should do.By the way, the word Jihad has always historically had \\"fighting for God/Islam\\" as a main meaning, and that's definitely the main most frequent meaning in the Quran and Hadiths. And that concept is so emphasized, but modern Muslims are just better than the Quran. The concept of Jihad is so frequent and important in the Quran that it sometimes gets ridiculous.. this is a verse of the Quran \\"God bought from the believers (Muslims) their selves (lives) and their money, in exchange for paradise\\". That sounds like a bad deal, but that's how you make a terrorist. The word Jihad wasn't mentioned here but it's mentioned in many other verses or its verb in the imperative \\"Jahidu\\". Other verses use \\"fight\\" in the imperative as well.This is the verse I mentioned complete and an official translation:\\n\\"Surely, Allah has bought their lives and their wealth from the believers, in exchange of (a promise) that Paradise shall be theirs. They fight in the way of Allah, and kill and are killed, on which there is a true promise (as made) in the Torah and the Injl and the Qurn. And who can be more faithful to his covenant than Allah?

As much as personal liberty is good, at the end of the day the state has to exist in order to enforce those rights, as imperfect as that enforcement often is.

We have relatively well-functioning institutions. E.g., in our elections, our institutions tend to deliver the actual result of the vote. Courts tend to make decisions according to the facts and the law. Most institutions do not take bribes or bow to political pressure in doing their jobs. We have norms whereby, e.g., leaders voluntarily leave when their term is over. Many societies descend into violence when there is to be a transfer of power. Everything else in those societies goes much worse because they can only have evil, violent people in charge, because those are the only people who win in such a system. We built all this up over generations, but we dont exactly know how. If we lose it, no one knows how to get it back.I can't even imagine caring about policy in presidential elections anymore.

If Kamala Harris inspired you switch, then I dont really think you were ever very libertarian to begin with.To summarize your journey, Kamala Harris talked about freedom, which you consider important, talked about building more housing, and then she came out in support of legalizing weed. Tbh, I could imagine an honest to god socialist with those views, and I dont think they would be very far off from most other socialists.Saying Kamala Harris is the most libertarian leaning candidate in your lifetime is really what surprised me the most. Kamala Harris is almost the exact opposite of what I think a libertarian is.From my perspective Kamala Harris is a tough on crime fiscally expansionary democrat who wants to increase regulations on the economy, and blames rich people and utilizes class resentment to find her scapegoats for whats wrong with the economy not unlike most other democrats.Libertarians on the other hand are minarchists, people who support trying to make the government as small as possible because libertarians view the government as harmful to people. They dont like the paternalistic social policies of conservatives, and paternalistic fiscal policies of democrats. They also support a smaller less interventionist military unlike most democrats and republicans. Libertarians want people to be personally responsible for themselves, which pits them against most progressive social and fiscal policies.If you want a taste of what most libertarians are actually like, I would talk to someone on r/libertarian\\nNot everyone on their agrees about everything, but in general almost all libertarians agree that the government should be much smaller than it is today.I applaud your political journey from libertarian to democrat, but I dont think your post accurately describes what libertarians believe, or how they tend to think about the government or its policy.","title":"I am a former Libertarian voting for Harris.

But as for the current foreign interference we have, outside of charging people criminally I dont think any further action should be taken.

We're all either 28 or 29yo and I've known them since high school, about 11 or 12 years. They were all either solidly Dem-leaning or apolitical at the time, and that stuck even post-2016 election, where I was pretty sure we all agreed Trump sucked. Something about 2020 and the pandemic changed them though, because ever since then most of them have gone crazy far-right Trumpist. What's even stranger is they haven't all gone the same way. One ended up that way after meeting this girl, who he ended up marrying and having a daughter with within a year of meeting her, and she's an extremely religious Latina.

I define hallucinations as sensory experiences that seem very real, but aren't actually happening. These can be experienced in any of the 5 traditional senses, in my interpretation of it. It's a bit difficult to explain why I believe this experience was a hallucination, but I'll go into depth on one of my personal experiences so you have a better idea of what I mean. This happened about 3 years ago. I live in southern Mexico, and the culture here is very spiritual. Sleep paralysis is commonly referred to as \\"the dead man got on you\\", so sleep paralysis is always associated with something spiritual. I used to live in an apartment with very bad vibes. I can't describe it, but every guest that slept there would talk about hearing/seeing things when all the lights turned off. My sister-in-law had lived there before us (my girlfriend and I), and she would describe seeing the silhouette of a tall man in the kitchen at night. I would often be there alone at night, and it always felt like I wasn't truly alone.The layout of the apartment was pretty linear. So if you kept the bedroom door open at night, you could see directly into the kitchen. We positioned the bed so that the door was to our right, and we kept the door open so that we didn't feel too closed off from the rest of the apartment. So if you laid on the bed, turned your head right, and opened your eyes, you were staring directly into the kitchen. My girlfriend often had nightmares about a man staring at her from the kitchen, so we decided to move the bed to the opposite wall. Now, you couldn't see anything, except a bit into the living room. Well, one night, I woke up and couldn't move my body at all. I started panicking, and I remember opening my eyes and seeing the dark room. It was slightly illuminated by the moonlight, but it felt weird since I didn't feel my eyelids open. I could just see suddenly without opening my eyes, if that makes any sense. All of a sudden, I see a very tall, completely dark silhouette of a man floating into the room from the door. In Mexican culture, when you encounter any evil spirit, you're taught that making fun of it or saying vulgar words will make it go away.Well, I started laughing and telling the figure that it knew damn well who was in charge in this house, and that it was Jesus Christ. I started saying it couldn't do anything to me, and that it didn't intimidate me in the slightest. In reality, I was scared shitless, unable to move. All of a sudden, I felt like I couldn't speak. I couldn't form a sentence at all. That's when I truly felt terrified of the thing. In my mind, it somehow stopped me from speaking to it, as if it were telling me who was actually in charge of that place. I started trying to move my body as much as I could, and that's when my girlfriend started moving me. I \\"woke up\\" and the figure was gone, but I know it wasn't a dream. It was so vivid and real that it's burned into my mind. If I had artistic talent, I could paint it exactly as I saw it. We stayed at that apartment for a couple more years, and my girlfriend had similar experiences with sleep paralysis, and other apparitions we saw individually. We moved out a little over a year ago, and haven't had an experience even remotely close to that since.","title":"Is sleep paralysis really a demonic attack?

Trump has a few set ideas (Donalds always liked tariffs, for example), other issues, hes flexible. The deep state is a whole ass machine. An invisible hand. Did trump mess around with the deep state? Almost undoubtedly. Does trump represent a threat to the deep state? Also yes, trump is very unpredictable. Trump might decide the bio-digital convergence is too scary. We really dont know where his head is at, and Trump actually seems flexible on topics having to do with the human body. Trump doesnt seem to fully support vaccine mandates, hes really prefer a holistic approach. Kamala is all vaccine, all the way. Kamala got her start in the democratic machine (verified) and willie browns juice clients (perhaps). Doug Emhoff is 100% Hollywood juice clientele. (Im only using juice because apparently thats a thing? I think word games are silly.)Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Zuckerberg want the bio-digital convergence to come as fast as possible. This makes musk, gates, zuck friends of the deep state. I like bringing Grimes (Claire Boucher) into this because shes a big Reddit girly.  Grimes (Claire) is a disclosure girl, 100%. So if shes pro-disclosure, I wouldnt really call Claire/Grimes deep state. Elon seems to be a fan of disclosure but his economic interests are paramount. Both Elon and grimes are nepo babies, Im not some grimes or Elon shill. Just trying to give everyone an honest assessment here. If anything, Claire/Grimes would probably be anti-deep state.Why do you think musks neural link is a privacy invasion? If someone wants to chip their brain, shouldnt they be allowed to consent to that? If musk is selling the data, thats a major issue, but the technology itself isnt the problem.","title":"Lightly redacted screenshots: Kamala Harris volunteer campaign runs sophisticated network of Reddit manipulation to flood the entire site with pro-Harris messaging (#2)"},{"text":"Does Breitbart know Biden isnt running anymore?

DEC 30th 2019 Abbott Rapid Diagnostics International Subsidiary Unlimited Company  a company incorporated on February 18th 2019 (here: https://opencorporates.com/companies/ie/643942 )\\nfiled for the assignment of PANBIO?? Trademark logo for Control preparations for in vitro diagnostic testing, screening, confirmation and analysis; diagnostic reagents and chemical reagentshttps://www.trademarkelite.com/europe/trademark/trademark-detail/018172966/PANBIOFor those wondering, this basically means that the PANBIO lettering is a logo much like Mcdonalds uses the golden arched MNOW, If we scroll the bottom of the following link here:https://www.trademarkelite.com/europe/trademark/trademark-owner/Abbott%20Rapid%20Diagnostics%20International%20Subsidiary%20Unlimited%20Company/1055749it leads to Abbott Rapid Diagnostics International Subsidiary Unlimited Companies where we can see a previous filed 2 previous Trademarks, the first on Mar 20, 1998 under their original name of ALERE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED (ill get to how i found that out next) that is basically the same logo, and the 2nd Was DETERMINE?? under the Abbott Rapid Diagnostics International Subsidiary Unlimited Company  on DEC 23, 2019!\\nSorry for the dashes but I want to break this up a bit so its not as chaotic.Out of curiosity i searched for ALERE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED on google and the VERY FIRST LINK says: Abbott Rapid Diagnostics International Subsidiary Unlimited Companies (FORMERLY ALERE)  The first link on google is hyper linked Alere WEIRD LOOKING GLOBALIST PAGE with our all to familiar neighborhoods company ABBOTTs logo at the top of the page: https://www.globalpointofcare.abbott/en/index.htmlHmm, brings us to a page full  items that are all used by our healthcare professionals are using in hospitals and laboratories  worldwide to detect, test, track and trace the infamous SARS-COV-2 virus in patients. Like this guy here eerily named ID NOW?? https://www.globalpointofcare.abbott/en/product-details/id-now.htmlNow with everything Ive said if youve read everything and followed; look back you will  remember that ABBOTTs subsidiary company (Abbott Rapid Diagnostics International Subsidiary Unlimited Company) \\nfiled for PANBIO?? tests that had their trademarked THE DAY BEFORE THE WUHANIC PLAGUE WAS EVEN MENTIONED.  Theses are also the tests they plan on charging you and i for if you refuse the vaccine as they are already doing in Israel \\nOH BTW IN ISREAL YOU ARENT FULLY VAXXED with 2 doses anymore, meaning unless you take every jab you follow the same rules as someone who takes none. \\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/in-israel-being-fully-vaccinated-now-means-three-shots-11630426257\\nBUT JUST WHO IS ABBOTT EXACTLYAccording to wikipedia Abbott Laboratories is an American multinational medical devices and healthcare company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, United States. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products. \\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_LaboratoriesTheir ownership as stated on WIKIPEDIA: Asof 2017, Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, Blackrock, State street corporation and others)\\nPretty familiar names to anyone whose done a a little research as they have a share in literally EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIFE https://youtu.be/D2t4u_tEefM\\n-SO LETS CLARIFY EVERYTHING, Abbott Rapid Diagnostics International Subsidiary Unlimited Company Which we now know is a subsidiary to ABBOTT: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1800/000110465920023904/ex-21.htm the company thats made and sold medical devices and other pharmaceutical products and medicine since 1888; \\nwhose main shareholders AS OF 2017 are the same BIG BANKS/INVESTMENT GROUPS that have stake in literally EVERY FACET OF LIFE on this planet,Files for trademarks on Both Dec 23rd and Dec 30th for antigen test kits,\\nTHEN A DAY LATER THE CASE OF PNEUMONIA THAT STARTED IT ALL! Everything that happens is by design and there is no coincidences. These rich, corporate, cocksuckers planned all of this and knew we would mass hysteria ourselves to this point YEARS AGO so they patented EVERYTHING before the market even existed And it can be proven by the dates of certain  endeavours. They all play the same game as us but hide it through subsidiary companies. COVID-19? is nothing more than a corporate Fugazi  being pulled off by people hiding behind Investments groups to amass huge amounts of wealth and push an agenda that the mega rich have had in store for a long time.Edit: this was a post from my old Reddit account.

I'm not trying to offend anybody with what I'm about to say, but I would argue that most people get no fulfillment from their job whatsoever. If they didn't need it for money they wouldn't do it. Why is that a bad thing? Can't we put people to better use than like sorting packages at Amazon?

If Trump wins, he terms out. Then it's an open field. If Harris wins, she will likely get the nomination again in 2028. Then if the GOP takes the White House again for 8 more years, with or without a Harris reelection, can Whitmer last 12-16 more years for her shot?  ( Nikki Haley's entire political career was shaped for this one shot this year, and now it's over. Permanently. It happens just like that, here and gone)For Whitmer, Newsom, Josh Shapiro, Andy Beshear and Wes Moore, their window needs to be 2028. That makes more sense with four more years of Trump first, than Harris. But yes, I suspect many who enabled the left for the past 8 years are trying to flee off of a sinking ship. Not just Bezos but also people like Zuckerberg. They don't want to face Trump's wrath if he gets back into office. In terms of the polling drops, my guess is they were always negative, just shielded by some outlets. Less on Trump vs Democrats and more about the public school lockdowns during COVID19.

Clauses like that are expected to take the singular in English, because \\"garbage\\" is normally uncountable and thus when it is the subject, the verb is normally singular.An example from the chapter:  Some students arrange food into the shape of a face.  The kiwi is the nose.  The berries are the eyes. The banana is the eyebrows. You wouldn't say, \\"The banana are the eyebrows\\".Imagine if someone else were to refer to some supporters as garbage and as bad.

I think if the method we were currently using were effective, it would make convicted people LESS likely than the average population to reoffend, but they are still way more likely.again, this is just ONE study that coroberates this statistic, and i cant even confirm if its peer reviewed or not, but either way, yes, half of all offenders re offending after 25 YEARS is fucking astounding, you do realise 25 years is 36% of an average person's lifetime right?? most offenders are adults so lets assume 18, the MINIMUM sentence for rape where i live is like 15 years in prison, 18 + 15 = 33, now add 25 years and the offender is now 58 and has 12 years left in their lifetime, this is assuming they are all 18 which obviously they arent but even at 18, most of their lifetime has already passed by the time they re offend, if they get sent to prison again then they'll literaly die in their cell from old age, again this is just ONE STUDY amongst a PLETHERA of other studies that say MUCH lower rates, and again just because our solution isnt perfect doesnt mean we will stop studying, thats not how science worksThe 35-40x offense rate is in the middle of paragraph two in the source you cited.still cant find it but im looking, and even then we are strictly talking about sexual crimes, not other crimesAgain, if our system were working it would make people who go through it less likely to commit a new crime than the average person, otherwise all you're doing is sequestering people predisposed to violence in a system for years that rewards them for that aggressive mindset and then releasing them back into the general population. youre making so many assumptions its insane, you do realise we can learn to PREVENT it by studying the offenders? if we kill them off then research will be next to impossible which will make prevention next to impossible, also next to no one is 'predisposed to violence', almost no one is 'born violent', almost all cases of crime have a history behind them, there is a history that lead to the crime, almost no one just wakes up and decides to rape someone, its a long sequence of events that eventually lead up to it, and no it doesnt reward them for it? being locked up doesnt sound like a reward to me, and lastly you do realise a big amount of prisoners get forced to be rehabilitated right? and the criminal record exists for a reason, to warn the public when an offender is released1) the current system distills sexual violence rather than suppressing ityeah cus the world isnt perfect, so we are trying to reduce crime as much as possible and prevent re offending, though i know for a fact killing them will only teach criminals to hide better and make them resistant to getting help and as a result encourage them to commit more crime AND kill the victims to hide the evidence2) that people convicted of sexual crimes are more likely than almost any other population to commit a future sexual assault and thus that the death penaltywell i just proved to you why thats not true (oh btw you didnt even mention my criticisms to the 2 other studies), but you can just ignore what i said i guess, you are just letting your feelings control what you believe (which i dont blame you, this topic is very emotional obviously)eradicate these recidivism crimes and by even just that metric would reduce sexual assaults overallyeah it would reduce statistics because the criminals will be better suited to hide evidence and make the criminals even more violent and okay with killing their victims","title":"CMV: Death sentence is the single worst way to deal with sexual offenders"},{"text":"I haven't heard any logical statements come out of her mouth?","title":"Lightly redacted screenshots: Kamala Harris volunteer campaign runs sophisticated network of Reddit manipulation to flood the entire site with pro-Harris messaging"},{"text":"I was offended when Trump called our beautiful country of America a garbage can and I can't believe his supporters didn't boo him for disrespecting the land that they love.","title":"Biden Appears to Insult Trump Supporters as Garbage, but Quickly Tries to Clarify"},{"text":"Would that make a JD Vance couch hybrid?\\nLike a couch made out of bones and skin, and it's hairy and has a beard and mustache and beady little soulless eyes with eyeliner?","title":"Biden refers to Trump supporters as 'garbage' in interview"},{"text":"I mean, it doesnt matter now since Biden dialed it to 11 with a response that entailed calling half of Americans garbage.

Things rarely go the worst that they can possibly go.If Trump loses but a Republican-controlled House attempts to hand the election to him. . . Well for one, we've been here before and in 2021 Congress did pass a law to say, basically, \\"Certification is a ceremony, not a decision. You can't just decide not to do your job.\\" Therefore, no matter how much the Republicans threaten otherwise, their legal power to interfere is curtailed and they know it.Now, what if they try anyway? Well, Biden has control of the military, the Secret Services, and a fairly strong version of near-immunity to act. So, what's to stop Biden for just ordering that Congress be locked in the building until their work is done? He would even be able to say he is doing it in the name of ensuring that the Constitution is protected and adhered to - which is basically his entire job.  Dude'll only have like 2 weeks left anyway, so what are they gonna do - impeach him in two weeks when they couldn't pass a Save Congress from a Fire Act?Trust me, the situation as described is not at all desirable. Yes, faith in US institutions and stability would be shaken, there would be aftershocks, and Putin and Xiping would get to spend an afternoon filling their pants with jizz as it went down. However, realistically, that is more likely that the full chaos situation you are concerned about.As a bonus: Republicans talking about how they can just give themselves a W is (I think) a tactically bad decision on three levels: it communicates to Republicans that their vote isn't as necessary and breeds complacency; it scares Democrats and scarred Democrats tend to vote and win; and it warns an entire nation of lawyers, judges, prosecutors, and even groups like the Secret Services and the military to be prepared for shenanigans.","title":"CMV: the U.S. political system is on the verge of complete collapse"},{"text":"Good thing Im not voting for Biden.?","title":"Biden Appears to Insult Trump Supporters as Garbage, but Quickly Tries to Clarify"},{"text":"That could still lead to a Trump victory.

I think if the method we were currently using were effective, it would make convicted people LESS likely than the average population to reoffend, but they are still way more likely. You're fully ignoring the fact that whether the number is 10% or 25% or 75% the general rate for the average person to commit sexual assault is significantly less than 1% so all of these numbers mean previously convicted sexual offenders are an extremely high risk population.The 35-40x offense rate is in the middle of paragraph two in the source you cited. Again, if our system were working it would make people who go through it less likely to commit a new crime than the average person, otherwise all you're doing is sequestering people predisposed to violence in a system for years that rewards them for that aggressive mindset and then releasing them back into the general population. And no, I must deeply, stridently argue against the point you've just made. You know the main difference between previously convicted sexual offenders and victims of sexual assault (even if them being assaulted affects their own likelihood of future crimes)? One has actually committed a violent crime. None of my argument is saying that we should guess who from a random population should be punished, I'm arguing that 1) the current system distills sexual violence rather than suppressing it and 2) that people convicted of sexual crimes are more likely than almost any other population to commit a future sexual assault and thus that the death penalty, while harsher than our current system, would eradicate these recidivism crimes and by even just that metric would reduce sexual assaults overall","title":"CMV: Death sentence is the single worst way to deal with sexual offenders"},{"text":"Likewise with my dog.

A friend was brought up from a very young age to believe that all nightmares and bad dreams are demons and the devil attacking your mind, trying to break in, possess you, to take over your whole mind.  As an adult, one day his doctor changed a prescription from one type of medicine to another. That night he had a bad reaction to that prescription change.  He hallucinated demons attacking him, trying to drag him to Hell. It was so real to him that he had a major panic attack and went into shock!  It took a very long time, many *weeks* not days, for him to even start to get over that massive shock.  So I implore people to please be careful what they teach other people. All it takes is one incident like that to cause significant shock in a person that won't leave them for a very long time.

And the unfortunate fact is that there isn't any uninhabited land to just set up a state on where Jews are the majority, without expelling whoever lived there before. So the Nakba wasn't an unfortunate accident, it was the inevitable consequences of the Zionist demand for Jewish self determination on a land that had a large existing non-Jewish population. So any state you set up like that is going to be at war from the beginning, because of the atrocities it had to commit to get set up, and is not going to be a safe refuge anyway.If people live there, and their family have lived there for generations, they belong. You can't say 'well Egypt is also Arab so you can just move their so we can take your land and set up our state here'. Egypt isn't where their home or their family or their community is. So yes, Palestinians had very good reason to want to stay put where they are, and to resist Zionists trying to force them out of their homeland. The conflict isn't about abstract ideas of belonging, it's about the fact that 750,000 people had homes and futures until Zionist militias came and took them away. And that Israel has continued aggression towards Palestinians from that point, and rejected a Palestinian state. I don't think it's true that there was no distinct Palestinian culture before Zionism, but it doesn't really matter.As a queer person, I understand the appeal of a state where you would be a majority, safe from discrimination, but I also understand that that doesn't actually keep everyone safe, and there is no alternative to fighting for freedom from discrimination where you are- even though you're in the minority. And the world is a very different place from 100 or even 50 years ago- where previously minority rights would fluctuate over time, in modern times they seem have a consistent trend towards improvement- albeit with periods of backsliding. But fundamentally, there are over 4000 ethnic groups in the world, and only 193 countries, so not every group can have a state where they're the majority. And nothing can justify the mass forced displacement of whoever already lives where you're trying to set up your state.","title":"CMV: Israel is a colonial state"},{"text":"I vote based on policy, and which policies will leave a better world for my kids.","title":"Voters what are your own personal reasons for voting for either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump?"},{"text":"We may not look it, but we are in fact *woke*","title":"Majority of marijuana consumers plan to vote for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump"},{"text":"I live in Scott Perrys district.

I've been following this campaign closely since November 2023, and it has been very disturbing to see Trump's plans and hear his fascist rhetoric.Many Australians stupidly think we won't be affected by the outcome of your election, and our media has created a false equivalence between Trump and Harris, causing many Aussies to view Trump in a positive light.Even my students seem to think that Trump is a novelty, and someone that is \\"funny\\". In a way, many of them adore him, which I also find disturbing. I spend time pointing out objective reasons as to why Trump is a terrible person, and can usually change their minds about it.The lies and conspiracy theories have even infected balmy close family and friends, causing a lot of heated debate and division between myself and them.When I visited the US in 2018, I was taken aback by the sincerity and kindness of Americans, and found them to be much kinder and more helpful than the average Aussie.I believe strongly that Americans are going to reject Trump next week, and hoping beyond hope that the US sends this Orange trashbag to the dustbin of history, so that you, and we, can all move on with life.I grew up viewing the USA as a beacon of hope, kindness, and democracy.Fight for it like your lives depend on it. ? ??","title":"Kamala Harris' crowd size crushes previous record with Ellipse speech"},{"text":"The game is rigged.

I haven't lived like that since I was in my younger 20s. It's quite simply American culture in general that has this problem. The ability to \\"ignore\\" politics is pure privilege to begin with. All my life it's been very fashionable for people to treat politics as this icky topic that you don't bring up, and if you do then you're just being dramatic or rocking the boat. It's a distinctly *white male* privilege as well. It's become a taboo to acknowledge that as well, especially online. But it's true: BIPOC and women across this country have never had the same privilege to be able to ignore politics when powerful institutions continually subjugate them.It's no wonder so much of American society still treats politics this way. We're still mostly white, and many societal norms serve to uphold that status quo. It's popular and rewarding in so many places to play the \\"both sides\\" angle and act like we're above it all.  *Anyone* can be aware of all this and try to make things better for everyone. I'll never buy the excuse that Americans at-large are \\"too tired\\" or \\"don't have enough time\\" to tune into this shit when they seem to b have plenty of time to stare at the TV or their cell phones.
