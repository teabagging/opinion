His dad ended up getting lucky and before long they were living a cozy life in a rich neighborhood in a different city in PA.  He went to private school and played football and got a full scholarship to play D II football at a college in PA. All of this is fine and dandy. Some lucky breaks, couldve been poor as hell or adopted and luckily his parents are staunch conservatives so abortion wasnt an option. Dude was good at a sport and got a free ride to college for it. He graduated with a bachelors in something and then got an MBA. But heres where falling up begins. So, the dude was a rich kid born into a small town rich family so to zero debt. He didnt have to work. So he didnt. He volunteers full time for Big Brother Big zsister for two years. Then volunteered full time for Americorps for two years. After 4 years of full time volunteering he enrolled in Harvards MPP program. After this he continued volunteer work helping poor kids earn GEDs. In 2006 he finally got his first paying job. Mayor of a small city named Braddock. At 37 years old John Fetterman finally got his first job and it was as an elected official. And it only paid $150/month. His dad paid him a salary so he could focus on being mayor of a 1600 person town full time. He held this position from 2006 until 2019   He was elected in 2006 in an uncontested race. He was selected as the Democrat nominee and no other parties entered the race. So from 37 years old until 50 years old he took a part time role and made it his full time job while his dad paid him a salary and paid his bills. This man at 50 years old still never had a full time job. Somehow, the great citizens of Pennsylvania, saw this and decided to elect this man (with 38% of the vote) to be the states lieutenant governor in 2019. In 2023 Fetterman then announced he would be running for a now vacant US Senate position in PA.  Against Dr. fucking Oz. Thats the best the republicans could throw up. Dr. Oz wasnt even a resident of Pennsylvania and should not legally have been allowed to run. And, naturally fucking Fetterman won While campaign he had a stroke and could not campaign. His campaign hid the health condition from the voters. When he finally had a public appearance he could not talk or think. He still won. A few weeks after being sworn in as a US Senator he has to take a leave of absence. For depression. This turned into being admitted to Walter Reed hospital for a few months where his staffers covered down for him. He has been hospitalized a handful of times since, tho none as long as that few months span in 2023. As it stands, no senator in history has spent less percentage of time served in his state or the capital. He has only sponsored two bills since being elected. Written/proposed none. This is a man who has literally done absolutely nothing with his life yet someone is one of 100 US Senators in this country. If thats not falling up I dont know what is.","title":"No, Kamala Harris Did Not Earn The Democrat Nomination"},{"text":"[https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-times-criticized-for-headline-sanewashing-donald-trump-on-immigrants-bad-genes](https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-times-criticized-for-headline-sanewashing-donald-trump-on-immigrants-bad-genes)  \\ni am absolutely not joking.","title":"Why Call Her Daddy got more time with Kamala Harris than CNN"},{"text":"Ideally, all left-leaning individuals worldwide would mass abandon Twitter, so that lingering sponsors would also quit the platform and leave Musk and his right-wing fans all alone.

This assumes that all registered Dems are voting for Harris. That is likely not the case. However, there are likely by the same token some registered Republicans who have sent in their ballots who are not voting for Trump. My guess is that they are more likely to be mail in voters, since moderate/concerned Republicans are also those who are less likely to believe Trump's claims that mail-in is somehow bad. But given that there's now an ideological divide about whether mail-in ballots are good, reading much into that difference seems not great. It is likely that a lot of Republican voters are just making a conscious decision to wait until election day proper. That said, having a lot of early voting for Democrats and Harris supporters makes it easier for the Democrats on election day, since they will then have fewer people they need to focus on getting out.","title":"Kamala Harris is losing ground in must-win state"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/w9hzo03406ud1.jpeg?width=360&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfcbe1691fd16c9aadd987b861db2f3358cb09d3","title":"Alleged Blacks for Trump member is very upset that Obama, who is only half black, is encouraging black men to vote."},{"text":"!delta  for providing a motivation the republican officials would be motivated to contradict Trump on this.","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"The OPs name  DrDoombot  checks out","title":"The left is losing its grip on ethnic minority voters"},{"text":"You people will believe anything.","title":"YouTube's \\"before\\" search filter doesn't work correctly with controversial topics.

Thank you, President Obama"},{"text":"\\"If you judge solely by the behaviour of the two campaigns, if the election were held today, former President Donald Trump would return to the White House next year.Vice President Kamala Harris has abandoned a seemingly successful strategy of limiting her media exposure to highly scripted events,?[turning instead to a series of interviews.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/09/cbs-kamala-harris-giving-two-different-answers-question/)To some degree, Harris is imitating Trump by going on podcasts and friendly niche programmes. Even so, she has turned in some shaky performances C how can she not have a more compelling answer for how she will differentiate herself from President Joe Biden, the man she replaced atop the Democratic ticket? C and appears less confident than in August. The joy is gone?By contrast, Trump is beginning to campaign in blue states that dont appear likely to go his way in the presidential contest. Most notably, he will campaign in California near Coachella and in New York City at Madison Square Garden. No Republican presidential candidate has won either state since the 1980s.There are, however, competitive congressional races in both states.?[The Republicans slim House majority](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/11/17/republicans-win-us-house-majority/)?runs through California and New York, two states along with Florida where there actually was a bit of a red wave in 2022. Narrowing the Democrats margins in California and New York would also improve Trumps chances of winning the popular vote. Biden and Hillary Clinton ran up the score in these two gigantic states in 2020 and 2016, respectively.Its possible that Trump is massively miscalculating in a manner reminiscent of Clintons hubristic failure to visit Wisconsin eight years ago. Theres a similar chance that Harris is simply overreacting to the vice presidential debate, when JD Vance?[beat her running mate Tim Walz](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/02/who-won-vance-walz-vice-presidential-debate/)?in no small part because the former was doing a lot more challenging interviews than the latter. The reason for Walzs relative absence from television studios was that he couldnt upstage Harris, who was avoiding the spotlight.The polls certainly tell a more complicated story, with the battleground states more or less tied and Harris narrowly ahead, albeit within the margin of error, nationally. A Cook Political Report poll of the top swing states paints the picture well: Harris leads 51 per cent to 47 per cent among the voters who most reliably turn out, but Trump is up 52 per cent to 45 per cent among the low-to-mid-propensity voters who failed Republicans in the last two elections.But Biden didnt drop out based just on the public polls. Democratic internal polls were more dire, showing Biden in danger of losing states like Minnesota, which hadnt voted Republican at the presidential level since Richard Nixons 49-state landslide in 1972. It was the only state that didnt vote for Ronald Reagans reelection in 1984.Presidential candidates time is finite and we are now less than a month out from election day. You have to imagine the campaigns are basing how the candidates are spending their time on some kind of data. Trumps behaviour signals confidence that could eventually prove to be foolhardiness. Harriss activities suggest a certain nervousness. Her leads, where they exist, are behind those of Biden and Clinton. Trump outperformed his poll numbers in each of the last two presidential elections.This could all prove to be a misreading of the public mood. Or perhaps Trump will be unable to turn out his lower-propensity voters, repeating the disappointment of the midterm elections for Republicans.Yet this has for weeks been an election about vibes, often to Harriss benefit. The vibes feel like they have shifted back in Trumps favour.\\"**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/10/10/kamala-harris-may-be-panicking-she-knows-donald-trump-is-wi/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/10/10/kamala-harris-may-be-panicking-she-knows-donald-trump-is-wi/)","title":"The telltale signs that Kamala Harris knows shes losing"},{"text":"so whats that invisible accordion and erratic hand gestures that im seeing all these republicans use these days ??.","title":"Highlights of the Shapiro/Obama rally for Kamala Harris! ??"},{"text":"Two reasons:1.

That answer answers here:**All I want is any justification**What you should be grappling with is *how do we know we know something*. That basic exercise is called \\"epistemology\\" by the egg heads.

There's a bigger schism between Senators and House members for starters. That's in part because Senators are elected every 6 years and from statewide races. House members, since 2012, have come from heavily safe districts and they're closer to Trump politically than they are to the Senate.If you want to take an example, to the outsiders, for the immigration deal, people thought, \\"Well if Oklahoma Republican Senator thought it was fine, it should be good enough\\" without even considering the House has been more extreme and have killed similar bills since 2013. This is why.For the better part of several decades, the conservative information sphere have attempted to create conservative alternatives to the knowledge institutions (e.g., government, academia, science, media) - and little by little they've succeeded. It starts with talk radio, then talk radio on TV (fox news), then talk radio on TV, the internet, podcasts, etc. and so on. It also is abolishing the Office of Technology Assesment, and so on.What we have is a complete epistemological divide where Trump supporters live in a different reality. What is true is what's good for Trump, and what's good for Trump is true. This is called tribal epistemology and that's their governing star.It's why a plurality of Republican voters think 2020 was stolen. When the \\"media\\" says \\"there's no evidence of voter fraud\\" the conservatives, whether they phrase it this way or not, are thinking \\"absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.\\"So what the last step of the logical chain is going to be, \\"Well X, not being loyal to Trump, was not a Republican anyway, they were a RINO.\\" It has been said for various people who even served in Trump's cabinets, to Liz Cheney, to Jeff Flake, and can and will be said about DeSantis, or whoever else stands in Trump's way.The House members are going to be the closest to ultra true believers than even Senators can be. And it'll get worse over time as Liz Cheney-types are replaced every 2 years for Lauren Boebert/Marjorie Taylor Greene types.","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"Im sure our extra special congressperson will get right on it after she blames the democrats for controlling the weather","title":"No, the government is not controlling the weather. \\"It's so stupid, it's got to stop,\\" Biden says"},{"text":"Obama is a very narcissistic guy who gets high thinking about his administration, part of his criticism against Harris was just stroking his own ego as well.","title":"Video: Obama Gets Real About Kamalas Big ProblemReveals Just How Desperate the Dems Are"},{"text":"Because the familys ( Rothschild, Rockefellers  etc ) were the 1st billionaires in America due to Castro oil.

For many measures*, *including real GDP growth* (*our focus*), *the performance gap is large and significant. This paper asks why. The answer is not found in technical time series matters nor in systematically more expansionary monetary or fiscal policy under Democrats. Rather*, *it appears that the Democratic edge stems mainly from more benign oil shocks*, *superior total factor productivity* (*TFP*) *performance*, *a more favorable international environment*, *and perhaps more optimistic consumer expectations about the near-term future.*[https://www.princeton.edu/\\\\~mwatson/papers/Presidents\\\\_Blinder\\\\_Watson\\\\_Nov2013.pdf](https://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/papers/Presidents_Blinder_Watson_Nov2013.pdf)During the 64 years that make up \\\\[the core modern Presidential\\\\] 16 terms \\\\[1948-2012\\\\], real GDP growth averaged 3.33 percent at an annual rate. But the average growth rates under \\\\[Dem &amp; GOP\\\\] presidents were starkly different: 4.33 percent and 2.54 percent, respectively. This 1.79 percentage point gap?(henceforth, the D-R gap)?is astoundingly large relative to the sample mean. It implies that over a typical four-year presidency the US economy grew by 18.5 percent when the president was a Democrat, but only by 10.6 percent when he was a Republican. And since the standard deviations of quarterly growth rates are roughly equal?(3.8 percent for Democrats, 3.9 percent for Republicans, annualized), Democratic presidents have presided over growth that was faster but not more volatile.-Blinder &amp; Watson, Presidents and the US EconomyAnd thats not even considering the FDR years, which would probably give the Dems a sizable GDP bump. Truth is the US hasnt done well under a Republican since TR - and he was a progressive (you could probably toss in Taft, though he was riding the wave of TRs economy).?

This led to Russia invading Crimea in order to protect their significant assets there.  There's lots of debate about how involved the US was in the Maidan uprising, but it's safe to say they were at least involved.  Their move towards NATO membership ultimately led to Russia feeling the need to invade.As for China and Russia having stronger military, that's not the issue.  The issue is which country is crazy enough to start WW3.

But that is not the reality. The reality is that 1/3 of adults will not vote.  They are fed up with politics and the nonsense that goes with it.   They do not want to wade through figuring out if D or R is telling the truth.   So they don't pick either and stay home.    And the truth is that candidate R cannot get elected if everyone votes.   They have no policy that appeals to people.  They do have a certain number who will vote no matter what.   So the goal is not to get more voters.   The goal becomes creating chaos and doubt.  When that happens more voters stay home.   And candidate R wins. Candidate D needs to have good policy and needs to work hard to get voters to come out to vote.   Their task is much harder to accomplish.   Quiet the lies of the right, and put forth solid proposals.  So when trump trashes Detroit when he is in Detroit, it stirs up conflict and arguments in Detroit.   It gets on the news and receives lots of attention.  That little ploy just convinced 500 voters to stay home on Election Day.    trump gains no votes for it.   He takes away votes for the opposition. Go look.   That is the strategy.   They are not looking for new voters.   They are looking for chaos and time on the news.  Make a shit show to convince those guys to stay home on Election Day.   Look at those states dumping people off the voter registration lists.    They know their own voters will go fix that quickly, and many in the middle will not.   Again, fewer voters.  That is why the best answer is to work like hell to get everyone out to vote.   If it works for them this year they will do it more next year.   So the answer is to figure it out and show them it does not work.   It does not work when a high number of voters make it to the polls anyway.   And when that happens, Democrats win.","title":"Why do Republicans get away with demonizing cities and blue states?"},{"text":"The US military was in Haiti less than 48 hours after a hurricane hit the country in 2012.

There have been 3-4 generations of matriarchy, and the outcomes have continuously declined.

One suspects this is why the Prime Minister was so reluctant to call it.Meanwhile in the House of Commons, MPs are again at loggerheads, for at least the fifth time in the last 15 years, over the governments refusal to turn over documents that Parliament or its committees have demanded.The issue that prompted the demand C allegations of conflict of interest and misappropriation of funds at a now-defunct federal agency, Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) C need not detain us here. The issue is the governments failure to hand over the documents.You will sometimes see this described as a dispute, as if it were a matter that was open to debate. It is not C any more than it is open to debate whether the government is accountable to Parliament. The right of Parliament to send for persons, papers and things is one of the most ancient and undoubted of parliamentary privileges. It is crucial to the Commons ability to act as a check on the executive.[...]So when the Commons passed a motion on June 10 demanding that the government hand over all documents related to SDTC within 30 days, that should have been the end of it. And when, in September, the Speaker of the House, Greg Fergus, ruled that the government had failed to produce all the documents C some were produced, but many were not, and many more were produced only in heavily redacted form C and that as such there was a prima facie breach of privilege, that should have been the governments cue to comply.Instead the government has continued to stall, insisting it has the right to decide for itself what documents Parliament may see, based on whatever grounds it thinks sound convincing: cabinet confidentiality, solicitor-client privilege, even the privacy laws, what have you. These are all interesting points. They may even be points Parliament might want to consider. But they are irrelevant to the core issue, which is that Parliament, in its wisdom, has demanded to see the documents. In law, that is all that matters.We have been here before. In 2009, the Harper government refused to accede to a parliamentary committees demand for documents related to the treatment of prisoners of war by our allies in the war in Afghanistan C a confrontation that was only resolved after the government prorogued Parliament. In 2011, the same government refused to hand over documents on government costs, notably for the F-35 fighter-jet contract, for which it was found in contempt of Parliament by a vote of the House C a first in Canadian and indeed Commonwealth history.And yet the Trudeau government, which came to power promising to reverse the Harper governments abuses (among them: Stephen Harper has used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.) soon followed in its anti-democratic footsteps. There was the WE Charity affair, where it not only refused for months to release the unredacted documents a parliamentary committee had demanded, but cut short its inquiries altogether by, you guessed it, proroguing.And of course there was the later matter of the two Chinese spies working in the Winnipeg infectious disease laboratory. Once again a Speaker ruled that a governments failure to hand over the documents was in breach of Parliamentary privilege. Once again a government was found in contempt of Parliament. And the governments response? First it sued the Speaker. Then it dissolved the House.[...]That is why the House is now in turmoil C why no business (other than Question Period) has been allowed to proceed for nearly two weeks. It is the motion to send the matter to committee that MPs are debating, but it is the governments breach of privilege they are protesting. As rightly they should.I dont doubt that there is also politics involved. Not only does it provide the Opposition with a chance to paint the government as high-handed and anti-democratic, but it raises the question of why they are so anxious to keep the documents C which remember have to do with allegations of government corruption C under lock and key. If nothing else, the mayhem in the House adds fuel to Conservative arguments that this government has reached the end of its useful life, and ought to be dismissed.But just because the Conservatives are saying it doesnt mean it isnt true. Yes, its theatre, yes its partisan C and yes, the Conservatives, given their own assaults on the same ancient and undoubted right, are flaming hypocrites, every bit as much as the Liberals C but there is still a deadly serious issue at stake. It may be a show, but it is in the service of saving Parliament from becoming nothing but a show.!ping Can","title":"Opinion: MPs are right to take a stand: the government must give Parliament the documents it demands"},{"text":"Forget stop and frisk, he said the police need a single really violent day to be able to show criminals what they are capable of or something sounds as close as it gets to an endorsement of police brutality to me.

The citizens will continue to function in pseudo dictatorships where rights dont really exist and fear is the norm.The US isnt seeking to destroy them, theyre seeking to halt their influence and combat their campaigns to become stronger world powers. Theyre essentially waiting them out until the dictator dies and a power vacuum occurs.Realistically, what changes when the 'supreme leader' of any of these countries dies? Russia and China aren't like the USA. They don't have open and free elections, and Putin sure as fuck doesn't mind completely changing their constitution to allow him to stay in office for the next decade. [Certain politicians in Russia seem to die a lot in weird circumstances, too](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/full-list-suspicious-russian-deaths/).

It aligns with the way they already view the world. They believe this message he is trying to convey is true, and whether the specifics of what he says is 100% accurate isn't relevant.Whereas many politicians have experience and backgrounds as lawyers, executives, and legislators, where precise language is part of the culture of the job, his supporters point to his nontraditional-for-a-politician background as a real estate developer and TV/tabloid personality, where the way of communicating is very different. Because of this, we can't interpret his use of language the same way we would a Yale educated lawyer who has been trained to use precise language.Whether they actually believe this, or are merely working backwards from trying to justify supporting him regardless of what he says or does, is up for debate.

The threat posed by Russia is comparatively easy to manage.\\nIran is not an existential threat to the world. If things go sideways, Iran gets glassed, and the world carries on. However, there would be a substantial investment involved with absolutely no gain, and nobody wants that. A war with Iran wouldn't end the world, but it would cause massive instability and potentially end the lives of millions. After Afghanistan and Iraq, the West has absolutely no appetite for war in the middle east.\\nHowever, Iran does NOT telegraph their intentions, and are unpredictable and borderline irrational, owing to their strong fundamentalist beliefs. Their beliefs are **complicated,** so to summarize:\\n* In Islam, there's a belief that Christ will return, but not until after a grand war occurs in the Holy Land that concludes with non-believing invaders being wiped out (if you want details, start with Mahdi and Magog)\\n* For most Muslims, this belief is basically myth,? like a Children's boogeyman story\\n* For Iran, this belief is not a myth and is seen as fact\\n* Iran believes that Christ is currently on Earth but will not reveal himself until aforementioned preconditions are met\\nSo, if you believe your religious deity is present in corporeal form, and has given you an edict to perform before he will reveal himself, what are you going to do?\\nTo summarize, Iran is irrational and unpredictable; basically the Muslim equivalent of Jehovas Witnesses with a religious edict to carry out the Apocalypse themselves. While they don't pose an existential threat, the threat they pose is of major instability and disruption to the World order.

Anyone who is genuinely anti-establishment but also polite and reconciliatory would not survive.

Redemption arc?!  You say, hell yes.  Obama was a mid tier president who has great oratory skills but when it came to actually governing had some really really shitty moments.He was ready to do his \\"grand bargain\\" with the Republicans that would have gutted Social Security, Medicare, and Medicate.  He killed a US citizen via a drone strike and his AG at the time said that:  Due process and judicial process are not one and the same, particularly when it comes to national security. The Constitution guarantees due process, not judicial process.  Fuck you Eric Holder for that really dangerous slippery slope you introduced into our legal cannon.As the leader of the party he lost so many government positions to Republicans due in large part IMO to him deferring party strategy to the legendary piece of shit Rahm Emanuel.  Who could never pass up an opportunity to tell progressives in the party to go fuck themselves.  There are a few more like the AP reporter spying, failing to close Guantanamo Bay, and some other ones but overall there were some big WTF moments.Was he as the 1st black president faced with an unprecedented set of obstacles?  Yes, and there is a lot to be said about all of that but the bottom line is that for someone who campaigned and still acts as if he is a progressive he was definitively not that.  But unlike a Republican he did not, thankfully since the \\"grand bargain\\" did not pass, do any real active damage and moved the ball forward at least a bit.  And as such his public perception is much greater than his actual record and for that...Now he has a chance to use that political and cultural cache to speak up against the fake populist right wing movement that has gripped a significant portion of our populace.  Obama understood correctly that our country is very willing to listen to populism as it has been being slowly eroded by the ruling class interests to enrich themselves with more and more money and power at the expense of the vast majority.  Hence why he campaigned as a progressive.And to be fair I'm sure in his mind, and others who share his worldview, they view themselves as pragmatic progressives.  Moving the country forward slowly but surely.  However I am not sure those in the elite understood how bad things are/were.  My hope is that after watching Trump get elected once and then come back having a real chance at getting elected again they finally understand that they can't just keep the ship just barely afloat.  They need to really really get on board with some serious change because the population at large needs it.","title":"Obama: \\"I spent eight years cleaning up the mess that the Republicans had left me\\""},{"text":"Yup, that sounds like Atlantic readers.","title":"The Case for Kamala Harris (The Atlantics endorsement)"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|Ni4AelcekTuhy|downsized)","title":"Kamala Harris built this: J.D.

So the rest of the world just kind of deals with ships getting attacked by Houthis now.The same thing happened with Hezbollah.

Being against arming Israel isn't a pro-hamas stance, it's a pro-life stance. Your inability to separate the two is shocking. Do you take Israeli leadership seriously when they talk about eradicating Palestinians in Gaza? When they say they will starve them and then do so? Does it even register with you that our government OKed the destruction of humanitarian convoys headed into the region?This has been from the start, a war against Palestinian existence. Netanyahu cynically propped up Hamas in order to create fertile ground for conflict and move away from any hope of peace, either two-state or otherwise. The same man called for the death of the Israeli PM that got close enough to such a peace, the same one who was also then subsequently assassinated by right wing Israelis. There is a plethora of media showing the intent of the Israeli government to use this conflict to at the very least \\"Mow the grass\\" -- a term they use for the systematic killing of Palestinians. There has been no real effort by that government to get their hostages back. The only real release happened because of third parties. There is credible evidence that Netanyahu's government knew from multiple sources that a large attack was inbound, and so rather than amping up security, they pulled security forces back. Estimated civilian casualties just in Gaza are now in the hundred thousands. You will likely fall back on a \\"War in an urban environment is just like that\\" excuse. But that doesn't excuse systematic starvation.  It doesn't excuse intentionally targeting groups of civilians under dubious pretext. It doesn't excuse snipers shooting fleeing children in the head. There is a damn lot you choose to ignore when you reduce me to a \\"supporter of jihadists\\" because I don't want my country and it's politicians supporting a country with such brazen goals and tactics.","title":"Highlights of the Shapiro/Obama rally for Kamala Harris! ??"},{"text":"I.e., they lie.","title":"Some top Dems won't commit to certifying a Trump win"},{"text":"Imagine Trump without money, trying to make it in this world through hard work and getting along with his neighbors.He wouldnt make it a day.","title":"Obama tells men that Trump doesnt represent 'real strength'"},{"text":"Obama is sick of his shit.","title":"Obama slams Trump for hurricane misinformation at campaign rally in Pennsylvania for Harris"},{"text":"That has been Trump's greatest trick, that he really does not care about his supporters and will be more interested in power, that the supporters refuse to see.","title":"\\"If Donald Trump doesnt care about his Vice President being hung by a mob, what makes you think he will care about you?\\" - Barack Obama"},{"text":"It's a cult.

They just leave a helpless baby sit alone with no care until it dies.For Walz, it wasn't the dead babies that were a problem. It was that is was **required to be reported.** So to fix the problem of neglecting babies and letting them die Walz had the law changed to **eliminate any reporting requirement** for botched abortions. Not to require the care of a human being who was actually born and is alive, but just making it so it doesn't need to be reported.

Additionally, Biden has not made a lot of public appearances since he dropped out, and Harris (or even Jill) has been seen at some of the appearances since then that, historically, the president has attended. Not only that, but Harris is talking about all the things that \\"we've done in office\\" which again, further reinforces that she had a much larger role in a lot of things than the VP historically does. So it's not \\"BS\\" to call it the Harris administration.

Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The sublation of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their **illusions about their condition** is to call on them to give up **a condition that requires illusions**. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.The failure of Western Marxists can probably be boiled down to the misinterpretation of a single word: Aufheben. They interpret it purely in the negative sense, that this or that needs to be got rid of. It leads them to silly conclusions like we should get rid of families (reeee muh patriarchy) or religion (it's heroin guys!).The conditions that give rise to religion in the first place (i.e., suffering) are still here and not going away any time soon.","title":"Liberal Establishment hackjob Keith Olbermann decides to go after reformed Ex-Hillary staffer Peter Daou after Daou said he wants Democrats to lose, but doesn't want Trump to win.

Biden even criticized Obama for some of his foreign policy decisions (this is documented btw). And there were rumors of some back and forth between them. In fact, there was a public address where Obama joked about Biden's arrogance. It was a joke-but I remember thinking-there was some battle of wills there. Kamala is not a child. Politics is not a children's game-I'm sure there were ego battles and some such other crap between Kamala and Biden, maybe even disagreements and who knows-they privately may even dislike each other. Any adult who has ever had a boss and works a difficult job knows the relationship can often be frayed and is not indicative of the performance of either boss or employee.Cough Pence Cough. But since they are not children and running the country is not a children's game, they have publically supported each other. Need anyone be reminded, much of Trump's administration officials have publicaly and vocally chided him and/or supported Biden and/or supported Harris and/or opposed his election. So there's that for how little any of this means. As long as Biden hasn't publically called Kamala shit or incompetent, this stupid gossip mongering and reading into every minute action of Biden is so dumb.P.S. Biden may \\"hate\\" Kamala but there is only one partner in crime who is expressing his criticism publically-and that just happens to be Pence.If someone wants a refresher on Biden and Obama's occasional tense relationship and personality battles, this is a good primer:[https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/07/11/obama-and-bidens-sometimes-tense-relationship-and-what-role-obama-may-be-playing-now/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/07/11/obama-and-bidens-sometimes-tense-relationship-and-what-role-obama-may-be-playing-now/)P.P.S: President and VP fraught relationships are not new.

Period. Thats a fact. Look it up if you dont believe it. The reason isnt well understood, but it might simply be that Democrats tend to raise the standard of living of the middle and lower classes - who then energize the economy by buying products. Republicans tend to do things that favor the wealthy, who gain wealth by purchasing and breaking up companies, laying people off and consolidating more wealth. Weve seen this over and over and over again. Ill never fathom how it is that the American public would think Republicans are better for the economy and the welfare of the middle and lower classes than Democrats are.  Look: I believe that we need healthy progressive and conservative parties so that America can be governed from the middle, but the conservative party right now - the GOP - is not healthy. It has a cancer - the Tea Party and Trumpism - that is killing America and turning it into a Russia-style kleptocracy with cynical and unhappy citizens.

The inverse is also true, if youre liberal and move to a conservative place, you probably realize these Republican voters arent monsters and have a good point about many thingsbut conservative areas are generally not highly populated areas, so that wont skew elections back towards the GOP.Frankly, the GOP wins when democrats outrace society with progressive agendas, even if the reality doesnt match the perception.

The problem is that the reference is incorrect. https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fundThey stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season, Trump said in Michigan last week.Non-citizens cannot vote in the election, and no disaster funds have been diverted. Instead, Trump and his allies are referring to the Shelter and Services Program that saw FEMA disseminate hundreds of millions in grants from Customs and Border Protection to municipalities that saw an influx of migrants.That program was a separate funding source with a separate purpose covering separate years C and not relevant to the current hurricane recovery efforts.Trump is making a specific claim here that the money was stolen. That is wrong. Hes also making the connection that this stolen money was used primarily for illegal immigrants that they want to vote this season. Thats wrong and has no evidence. The SSP funding is separate and a result of grants from CBP. https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/trumps-false-claim-of-stolen-disaster-relief-funds/The Shelter and Services Program was created by Congress in 2023 specifically to make payments to nonfederal entities that provide shelter and other eligible services to migrants encountered by and released from DHS custody, as a Congressional Research Service report published that year explained. Congress authorized about $364 million for the program for fiscal year 2023, and increased the programs appropriation to $650 million for fiscal year 2024.As FEMA has said, that money was not rerouted from FEMAs Disaster Relief Fund, which is funded by Congress separately. For fiscal year 2024, which ended Sept. 30, the Disaster Relief Fund had almost $57 billion in total budget resources, including about $20 billion in initial appropriations from Congress and more than $25 billion in supplemental appropriations.https://www.verifythis.com/article/news/verify/donald-trump/trump-administration-diverted-fema-disaster-funds-immigration-ice-fact-check/536-814bb634-4d14-4463-a77f-b2f304320d33The Disaster Relief Fund, which FEMA manages, and the money used to fund the Shelter and Services Program  a federal grant program administered by FEMA in partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that provides financial support to non-federal entities to help undocumented migrants  are appropriated through two entirely separate funding streams. Both are authorized and funded by Congress each year, and the money can only be used for their designated purposes.\\nNo money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMAs disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts, FEMA says on its website.Plenty of sources corroborate this. One thing you completely failed to notice is that the comment you responded to said **funds that have gone to migrants in lieu of Americans**. What do you think in lieu means? If you just actually read what the guy said he is correct. Trump has alleged not that funds from FEMA are technically going to migrants through a specific program supported by CBP, but that the funds are *actively being rerouted from hurricane relief to migrants*. This is false and you should delete your comment for being so fucking irresponsible.","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"Has Oklahoma had a state vote on it yet?

We're all going to be rich!\\"And a few months after he took office, he blew the budget surplus to give tax breaks to people who were already so wealthy they couldn't possibly spend all the money they already had.It was glaringly obvious that a major part of Clinton's ability to balance the budget was because he signed the bill that gutted Welfare. Turned it into Workfare. Put a bunch of limits on social spending. And then instead of working some Republican magic to share that wealth with everybody - so that, you know, people who actually needed a handup from time to time could get it - Bush was just giving the savings to his rich friends.And then by the end of Bush's term, the housing market had been inflated into a massive bubble, then burst, then instead of bailing out homeowners, we gave banks bailouts so that they could remain solvent long enough to foreclose on everybody. And all the money saved by pulling the rug out from under the poorest people in the country, was squandered. And the rich were richer than they'd ever been before.","title":"Dont be stupid....vote Democrat"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|3orieUTvtsjyWSE2pa)Hahaha damn liberal hippies.","title":"Poor liberal (??)"},{"text":"He would pick someone new to change it depending on who angered him?That seems maximally embarrassing to the wearer of the diaper as well as gross.","title":"Obama's Diapers Joke About Donald Trump Is a Hit With Kamala Harris Crowd"},{"text":"I think you are getting caught in the trap of thinking there is a system where it's possible for every person to have an exactly equal level of influence.

The US is aware that countries functioning as de facto dictatorships/theocracies (Russia, China, Iran) will likely not fall anytime soon due to outside or foreign pressure. You can do things to slow down their influence or sow internal discord, but as long as the supreme leader lives, the country will probably move forward. The citizens will continue to function in pseudo dictatorships where rights dont really exist and fear is the norm. The US isnt seeking to destroy them, theyre seeking to halt their influence and combat their campaigns to become stronger world powers. Theyre essentially waiting them out until the dictator dies and a power vacuum occurs. Therefore, Ukraine isnt about hurting Russia as much as possible, as we know historically Russia is willing to send as many men as possible to die for whatever cause. The point is to keep Ukraine sovereign.Allowing Ukraine to fall into Russian hands is a big blow to European democracies and their safety. Even if Ukraine cedes 1/3 of its territory (for peace), its at least still sovereign and a win for the US. The Russia/Ukraine border would then likely becomes some sort of demilitarized zone similar to North/South Korea.

Having left the military, and returned to the West, I am pretty shocked at how little people seem to be concerned about Iran.Iran's Ayatollah regime, which took over in 1978, has been very consistent in their goals. Other than severely oppressing their own people, the Iranian Islamic Republic has effectively revived the idea of Islamic Jihadism, which had been pretty dormant since the Reconquista.Iran has perfected the art of asymmetric warfare, and operates mainly through proxies. These include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is the largest terror organization on earth, Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other militant groups in Palestine, countless nameless militias in Syria and Iraq, the Houthis in Yemen, Al Shatah and other groups in Bahrain, Iraq, and more. This, on top of the fact that Iran has the 14th strongest conventional military in the world, advanced cyber capabilities, and a massive and well oiled propaganda machine.It's not an exaggeration to say that Iran has ruined Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Palestine, and Iraq, affecting hundreds of millions of people in the Middle East.From what I hear people say in Iran's defense, I can only imagine that it has become one of these topics that is politicized in the US. Perhaps its seen as right wing to be concerned about the Iranian threat. From my experience in the Middle East, I say it's essential that we learn to identify opportunities and threats regardless of what political label they may fall under.The Iranian regime needs to go, for the sake of the Iranian people, for the sake of the Middle East, and for the sake of the world.","title":"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country."},{"text":"I don't think it should be considered art because not every image that humans create is art.

People in support of the Ukraine war always say how it's, 'crippling Russia', but if this was the case, we wouldn't be approaching the three-year mark on the war. Russia clearly has no intent on stopping anytime soon, and if they were as crippled as Americans like to think they they are, then they would be attempting to negotiate, but they're not. They still continue the war effort.Additionally, there's no good method of measuring who is 'truly' winning the war. People will often cite body counts or destroyed equipment counts while also [neglecting the fact that these 'counts' are really just super estimations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10450422/) because casualty reports are either heavily exaggerated or just straight up lies, which is why they fluctuate so much. This same issue can be observed with Gaza. We won't know how bad the damage truly was in Ukraine or Russia until the war is over - and even then, the data could be incorrect.Finally, it's pretty hard to seriously suggest Ukraine is winning when [Russia occupies \\\\~20% of it's land, and counting](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine). The only real wins Ukraine has had is just re-capturing the land that Russia had.Russia does not appear weak right now, and I don't think they ever will be unless Ukraine launches serious counter-assaults into Russia. Ukraine's last counter-assault was a failure.Is there any particular reason you believe Russia is being *actually* crippled? Asking out of curiosity, because based on my research, this war has been a stalemate at the very best - at the worst, Ukraine is losing the war.","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"The method of representation matters more for party-system rather than type of government.

In Confucianism, for example, there are the concepts of [wen and wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen_and_wu) - an ideal man is supposed to balance both military expansive might and be a proper Confucian scholar and bureaucrat. In Ashkenazi Jewish culture where men were largely banned from the military and werent allowed to own or work land, the ideal man became a prosperous, wise, and gentle scholar, which is where you get the stereotype of the Nice Jewish Boy or the mensch and the expectation that men focus on academic success and careers that reward it, like being doctors and lawyers. In a post-capitalist world where frontier, American Dream, bootstraps masculinity is essentially being exposed as a lie and men are losing their role as the provider as it becomes increasingly more impossible to support a family on a single income, Trump is comforting. Hes a throwback to the gaudy prosperity of an earlier era of boys club capitalism, where the masculinity and wealth essentially look like living in The Wolf of Wall Street. Its audacious and in your face and its about winning through brute strength and crushing the weak. And so for men whose idea masculinity is also stuck in the early 1980s, hes appealing. For men who increasingly feel like they dont know what masculinity is or means because the cultural boundaries are shifting so rapidly, hes attractive because he gives them a definitive answer and because he seems rich and successful and powerful, it looks like the right answer. And its certainly more appealing than the actual answer of what it means to be strong, which usually involves a lot of tough emotional work on yourself to develop things like maturity and empathy and humility.","title":"Obama tells men that Trump doesnt represent 'real strength'"},{"text":"And lets end gerrymandering too.

But, given that your topic is about hurricane helene in North Carolina, Id be happy to at least share my first hand account as someone in western NC.?First thing that everyone should know is that probably 80-85% of relief, donations, and boots on the ground help has been from local volunteers, private companies, charities and churches. This isnt an overestimate, in fact this percentage may be even higher.?On the one hand, its incredibly encouraging because basically since Covid there has been this feeling in the air that everyone hates each other now. But during this cataclysm, its shown the opposite. People literally having nothing and giving someone else their last bottle of water, etc. so its been encouraging to see what people at the local level will do for one another.?On the other hand, its been eye opening to see simply this: after a decade and a half in the work force, well over $200k in taxes that Ive paid in my lifetime so far. This was the first time ever that I thought I would see my tax dollars meaningfully being used to help those in my local community - or myself. And instead all Ive seen is that when the chips are down, you cant expect the federal government to help you for shit.?Is fema up here and helping? Sure. When did they first meaningfully arrive? A week too late. Rescues, relief, and aid all happened by private citizens and organizations. Its just as simple as that.?So believe what you will, I just can tell you that all the horror stories youve read and the bad news youve heard - its actually worse.?","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"It's not a big state, though.

Majority rule, but layered.A constitutional republic is a similar system, but it's built on a constitution that enshrines rights, acting as a roadblock when the simple majority tries to establish something that contradicts it.Let's use the Second Amendment as an example. In our constitutional republic, establishing a law to ban gun ownership on a federal level would require a new Amendment to the Constitution that nullifies the Second. This would require a supermajority of 2/3 of either all of Congress, or 2/3 of all state legislatures just to *propose*. Then, it'd have to be ratified by an even larger supermajority of 3/4 of state legislatures (if proposed hy Congress) or 3/4 of consitutional conventions (if proposed by the state legislatures; none of the current 27 amendments were ratified via constitutional convention).*And then*, if the new amendment is ratified and it nullifies the Second, then the new law banning the ownership of firearms still has to go through both chambers of Congress separately. If it passes both chambers and goes to the president, then the president can still veto it for functionally any reason, which sends it back to Congress and requires 2/3 of both chambers to override the veto.In a straight democratic republic, the actual lawmaking would likely be similar, but wouldn't have the intentionally complex and eldritch process of creating a new amendment that nullifies an enshrined right.","title":"Liberty  Democracy"},{"text":"Michelle was amazing during the Democratic convention!","title":"Obama tells men that Trump doesnt represent 'real strength'"},{"text":"Grifter?

My understanding is that republican senators and democratic governors of NC has basically said that that is totally not true and they are getting what they need, basically fully approving of the recovery effort.1) Hey OP, you make some decent comments, but what's missing from your post is specific quotes. It's very easy for people or media in these kinds of situations to mischaracterize what has been said. Phrases like \\"basically said that that is totally not true and they are getting what they need, basically fully approving of the recovery effort\\" don't inspire me with a lot of confidence that some nuance isn't lost in the post. That's a lot of \\"basically\\"s and a Valley-girl-esque \\"totally\\" that I doubt exists.2) Lost in this is a specific commentary about human motivations. Politicians sometimes lie to achieve their goals. For instance, maybe these Republicans are saying nice things about the disaster relief, even if it's not actually optimal, because they know that Biden/Kamala will be vindictive if they say nasty things about their activity weeks before the election? Or maybe they're currently running for reelection, and if they criticize the disaster relief, they fear their own constituents will blame them for not getting the relief funds? 3) Maybe the truth of the disaster relief is somewhere in the middle? Maybe it's decent enough to the point where some people are satisfied, but it could theoretically be even better? In that case, nobody is really lying.","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"They are feverishly trying to polish a turd.","title":"Democrats Perplexed Why Candidate Nobody Ever Voted For Is Slipping In The Polls"},{"text":"How.

One in two recorded racist incidents is an antisemitic one, despite the Jewish community representing 0.8% of the population. Antisemitic acts are more likely to be directed towards individuals (rather than buildings or belongings) compared to other racist acts, and they are committed by increasingly younger perpetrators, with reported antisemitic incidents in schools having doubled over the last year.As you may also know, this alarming increase is being denied on parts of the political spectrum, most vocally on the far-left. Not just by random activists, but structurally, consistently, and by the top brass of the parties - Jean-Luc Mlenchon, the leader of the third-largest party in the lower chamber of Parliament, wrote in May that \\"*contrary to the propaganda of officiality, antisemitism remains residual in France. It is in any way totally absent from popular gatherings*\\", adding with glee that \\"*the paralyzing ray of the accusation of antisemitism is now without effect*\\".Much has been said already about the left and antisemitism, but from my interactions with leftists deep into the I/P hole, I have noticed something I haven't seen brought up yet: an eery similarity between this denial of the increase of antisemitism on the left and the denial of systemic, widespread sexual violence within society among masculinists and other incels.The broad, staunch denial there's even a problem to begin with. The dismissal of the magnitude of the problem by whatabouting on other heinous acts. The kneejerk reaction that those accusations are necessarily misleading, false, and purely used for nefarious purposes. The accusations that the issue is being weaponized against their own group for political goals. The dismissal of the victims' expression. The presumption of good faith repeated like a mantra for the perpetrators despite the accumulation of evidence, often invoking the lack of sentencing as a proof they're innocent, willingly ignoring how protective the law is for them. The hyperfocus on the handful of false accusations to dismiss the thousands and thousands of actual victims.It strikes me because I was a young adult in college during the MeToo wave, and graduated as our university was hit by a sexual violence scandal involving mutltiple students, and I feel like I had then about sexism the conversation I have now about antisemitism. The same whiplash sensation of hearing people I thought pretty woke on subjects of systemic violence and bigotry suddenly both-sides the issue and dismiss reports of this systemic issue. The same realization that the task ahead is Herculean and will be constantly resisted by folks you thought to be allies. And the uncomfortable uncertainty on whether it will get better.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"So remind me again, who is saving democracy from whom?I can't keep track of the stuff without a scorecard.","title":"Leading Dems Wont Confirm If Theyll Certify Trump Victory: Report"},{"text":"The response to your specific critique is thst your argument is not grounded in reality (according to the Trump supporter).

The weighting of adversaries has nothing to do with government types, or else the other greatest adversary of the US would be Saudi Arabia, another theocratic monarchy, whom we are close allies with. To OPs point, Russia and China pose greater political and economic threats to the United States given Russias relationships with different governments and groups opposed to the US throughout the world, and Chinas growing economic influence. I think where OP misses some of the point is that Russia and China are not really adversaries because of their military and espionage capabilities. They pose the biggest military threat if it comes to war, sure, but the greatest threats they pose are economic. Ukraine is a vital grain supplier for Europe, and the war forces the EU to import food from other usually more volatile and less friendly places, and both China and Russia are making a lot of headway in shifting favorable economic relationships - particularly in Africa - away from US and EU interests. West Africa for example is a vital economic provider to the west because of their stores of precious metals used in electronics and nuclear power, which the US and EU have been able to exploit through neocolonial business deals that make their purchase extremely cheap (an argument for another day) and see European companies controlling much of the mining in that region. Youre already seeing that with the Sahel states starting to nationalize mining industries and building more favorable economic ties with Russia in return for the political support to the recent coup governments, with Burkina Faso being the most quickly moving instance of this. In East Africa, China is building a ton of infrastructure on the cheap (although with crazy bad debt deals for those countries) and shifting influence in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania away from the west, not to mention Chinas influence in Asia. Those pose the greatest threat to the US because they can make the purchase of vital goods much harder and much more expensive, hurting the US buying power and influence in the rest of the world.","title":"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country."},{"text":"this is the future we could have had :\\\\ https://youtu.be/mAOLyi_4AbQ","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I shudder to think the deathtoll if we regularly got severe weather like USA in India.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Diddy aside","title":"A Stern Obama Tells Black Men to Drop Excuses and Support Harris"},{"text":"NPR: Nice Polite Republicans","title":"A Stern Obama Tells Black Men to Drop Excuses and Support Harris"},{"text":"Legit everyone needs to sit down and rethink the usefulness of polling after this.

I bought my house about five years ago. When its paid off and I only need to pay the taxes and insurance, that will be amazing. I imagine its kind of like paying off a car loan and then not having to pay that every month, which doing that with my car was huge for me and a big part of the reason I was able to buy my house. What will I be able to do when my house is paid off or paid down enough to borrow against it at low rates? I could sell it today for almost twice the price I bought it for, so even if I did that before paying it off, I could use just the profit as a down payment on a bigger home if I needed that, or I could invest it to retire early, pay for travel, or use it to buy experiences like concert tickets. It isnt just having a home, its having an asset that you can leverage to earn more passively. Id have to have an another job to make the profit Ive accrued thus far just by holding and living in it. That means instead of spending my time in a second job, I have time to do what I want to. It may feel far fetched, but thats why its a dream. Is it worth working for? Yeah, Id say so. Is it ok if you dont? Also yes. If a house is the dream, like being on a professional sports team, you can work your way up through the minor leagues before going to the majors. Most never ever get that far, but that doesnt mean its a stupid dream to have. If a house is too much, invest in an asset that isnt. Let it appreciate, sell it, do it again, and maybe that house isnt too far away and youd only use your wages from working on whatever you buy first.","title":"CMV: Referring to home ownership as a Dream is damaging and we should stop."},{"text":"The sanewashing of his comments of the genes of immigrants is really something.","title":"NYTs slogan is Democracy dies in Darkness, but they are turning out the lights (long, 7 pictures)"},{"text":"Thats plausible!

They need a clear and concise message about how their policies will affect the everyday person. People dont believe they will make effective change because they think they wont be able to get stuff passed in a divided house. Harris actually started to push in the right direction when pressed in her 60 minutes interview about this. She fumbled her words a bit but spoke of working with the other side and selling to them how these policies would help them and their constituents. THIS IS THE WAY.Sure repugs are going to obstruct, but if you can peel off a couple of repugs here and there and slowly get bits of your legislative agenda passed over time, thats better than only gunning for a big do all bill and getting nothing passed. One of the greatest achievements of the Biden era was Bidens ability to build consensus with the other side and  get bi-partisan legislation through, like the infrastructure act. I find it mad that somehow dems cant effectively message Bidens successes out the trail. Creating an effective clear message that as Bidens protege she would work to build consensus is a powerful message. While a great orator, Obama was largely an ineffective president who was unable to build consensus with the other side. He only got meaningful legislation passed when he had the numbers to do so.In fact I would go as far to say that Trump is the result of an ineffective Obama presidency that failed to deliver the change that was promised way back in 08.

Support your argument.) and I asked to read his paper. He had cited Shapiro and Rogan. I'm not joking.But even there, the professor had noted several proper sources he could turn to to support his argument. He was also open apparently when someone joked about \\"clowns\\" and said it would be a fascinating read, if a little challenging to persuade him. So clowns came up a lot in the course from students sharing facts... turns out... there's a lot of ways you can read into it once you know about clowns. So far as I know, nobody ever wrote a paper on them, but we all know too much about clowns now.(EG; Health practitioners in the UK are most likely to be asian. Asians are substantially more likely to have coulrophobia. This may limit the access of the clown to healthcare).","title":"I just attended a Marxist lecture for extra credit and had to sit there while the guest condoned not voting, claimed Obama didn't end the war, and called the 2009 loans bailouts.

He said that the government is doing a horrible job, but I've heard this sentiment echoed A LOT, by a lot of people. Mostly from first hand accounts shared on youtube etc., but my impression was that they were doing a bad job.I've heard literally the opposite, peoples expectations and what is physically possible is not political. You would likely have a worse response if Trump were in power as he has in the past blundered emergency response.While it's possible that this is just another Right vs Left thing, where more conservative leaning everything is attacking and blaming the Harris administration for letting things devolve into mad max down south, or it's the Democrats essentially accusing Trump of causing the hurricane using his evil Jan 6th magic.There is no Harris admin yet, Joe Biden is president. No reports of anything I've seen are mad max style, except the fact that hurricanes suck and destroy everything. These are all anecdotal nonsense with nothing but \\"I read it online\\" to back it up. Then to go to your first argument:I. Republican senators going against Trump proves he is lying / just saying stuff regardless of truth.Have you ever heard the joke \\"We've investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong\\"? I don't know why you would expect the government to sit there and nod along with Trump when he hits out at them just because they wear the same color ties. At the end of the day government incompetence is a bi-partisan stink.So either Republican governors suck or Trump sucks, or both. Again, not really an argument or counter argument of what actually isn't happening that should happen or how Trump would do any better. (See relief efforts for Puerto Rico and how mishandled they were by Trump). II. To lie so brazenly and so totally, it's not just a minor mischaracterization afterall, about natural disaster relief while it is happening is such a shameless act of dishonesty that it fully destroys Trumps creditability to the point where he, and everything he said, can no longer be thought of as being grounded in any sense of what is true. In short he just says whatever he wants either because he is a con man or because he is a delusional idealogue and is lying to himself just as much as he is lying to everyone else.You didn't say what he lied about, just that he said they are doing a terrible job, can you please clarify? There have been a number of claims but mostly I think it's these two: 1. that FEMA funds have been mismanaged and given to migrants. 2. That authorities are actively preventing individuals from helping clean up and help with search and rescue. Here's the problem the migrant thing is a fucking lie. That's the issue, no major amount of FEMA funds have gone to migrants in lieu of Americans. This is the fucking lies OP is talking about. The first, seems to actually be true. Google practically yells at you for looking up regarding FEMA spending money on migrants, is being reported by everyone as being debunked, however, if you actually look for what is being referred to by Trump and his surrogates, Apparently in 2023, FEMA allocated up to 300+ Million dollars for the [Shelter and Services Program](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023_1018_fema_shelter_and_services_program_fy23.pdf); a glance at what this program does and you'll find that it is indeed a program designed to provide support to non-citizen migrants in the United States, As you can see from the below excerpt:To provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to temporarily shelter noncitizens recently released from DHS custody, including renovations and modifications to existing facilities. Yes we have humanitarian aide to migrants as part of the border patrol process. This is literally what controlling the border looks like. You think they just pay border patrol agents in nothing? You think they house people outside while they're detained. This has nothing to do with hurricane assistance and they are two separately funded things. If you look at the Trump years they had similar funding. \\nI think there is a point to be made that it is humanitarian to assist migrants, specifically ones that are asylum seeking, and released by the DHS to await court hearings on their status, however, this has been a huge point of tension for the conservative anti-immigration crowd, who no doubt are offended by the idea that we would be spending that much on those trying to get into the country, while there are plenty of people suffering who are already here. I think Trump is not completely wrong to claim that either. It does seem to be at least a valid argument that 300 million dollars that FEMA already had, would be better spent toward relief effort.Regarding the blocking of relief efforts, again, google seems to not be doing many favors, but I found this on youtube which showed a couple of clips complaining about helicopter pilots and other aid workers venting frustrations about what they felt was a lack luster response. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56zG9owMQwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56zG9owMQwI) It's not doing any favors cause that shit is just made up. Even so, again, I think this shit always gets annoyingly partisan and maybe the Trump side is completely wrong but it doesn't sound like an outright lie.Either way it's hard to tell me that this \\"destroyed his credibility.\\" If Trump came out and said the sky is blue then CNN and MSNBC would run headlines all day that read \\"Trump pushes ages old debunked racist theory that sky is blue\\"  and Chris Hays would be smugly leaning out his window taking a selfie of himself under the night sky with the caption \\"does this look blue to you?\\" While the women on the view would chant how his dangerous sky-phobic rhetoric disqualified him from running for office, while a scared guest, I am imagining Jason Momoa, did his best to avoid questions.I'm joking of course but this is how a lot of Trump people feel. Every time Trump says anything, there are a bunch of people ready to jump down his throat and call everything lies, but he's getting these things from somewhere. So for his supporters, he didn't lose any credibility because they feel like the left is just going to point their fingers and call him a liar anyway. Because every time he says something it's either a lie, or a half truth designed to scare people and score political bullshit points.","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"Correct.

NOAA, with its diverse scientific expertise and long-standing leadership in product and service delivery, is well-equipped to support these information needs and help build the nations climate resilience.With this funding, NOAA will support multi-decadal climate projections to provide transparent climate information for users, addressing a wide array of risks like heavy precipitation, temperature extremes, drought and coastal flooding. This information will help users understand these risks and how they are expected to change in the future. Researchers will use NOAA's existing resources and new cloud-based computing platforms to co-develop and disseminate these climate projections to users with the goal of creating sustainable, clear, trustworthy products to help decision-makers plan for future climate conditions. As part of this effort, researchers will work closely with decision-makers, including  groups focused on western water resources, heat waves, coastal flood risk, wildfire risk and extreme wind events, to develop customized climate information. The American Society of Civil Engineers offsite link is a key initial partner in the co-development of this capability. NOAA will further its ability to move climate model data from its research enterprise into user-focused applications. This work will be based on the best available science and research, including the outcomes of 13 previously IRA-funded projects that are also designed to improve our understanding of how key phenomena in the climate system are changing.  \\n...Statement from U.S Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo:This investment, made possible thanks to President Bidens historic Inflation Reduction Act, will develop new information services to help communities better prepare for the impacts of extreme weather and climate disasters brought on by climate change  ensuring that families and communities across the country stay safe as we continue to mitigate the rising challenges from the climate crisis, said U.S Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.Statement from Jainey K. Bavishi:With this investment, NOAA and our partners are working directly with diverse end-user groups to co-develop climate services tailored to specific needs such as addressing coastal inundation, extreme heat, wildfires and other climate impacts, said Jainey K. Bavishi, assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and deputy NOAA administrator. The climate services that will be produced by this research are crucial for community resilience across the country.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration, NOAA announce $15.3 million to improve climate projections of extreme weather | Inflation Reduction Act to support NOAA, partner research for reliable, long-term climate projections"},{"text":"I knowHe's saying the excuses of not voting for her are dumb","title":"Obama: Black men have 'excuses' for not supporting Harris"},{"text":"Of the 300m or so that went to Ukraine aid, about half was paid to US entities to produce something or transport something, of the remaining half about 60-70% is weapons.

You either must concede that your argument is unfair or provide evidence of your claims. Point II and Point III of your post hinge on Point I being true, but your first point is based on assumption and a confirmation bias, with zero evidence. Unless you do that, no productive discussion could be had around your argument. Your entire discussion will boil down to, 'he said vs she said'. That's not productive.

Biden won GA by 12K, Trump won NC by roughly 80K, Biden won PA by roughly 70K. Those 2M votes could have been the difference, especially in NC and GA.
