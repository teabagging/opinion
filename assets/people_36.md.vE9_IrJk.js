Thanks for posting. To respond, two main trains of thought:First, I can envision scenarios in which politicians hold views so abhorrent the only reasonable response is to cut off people who support them. Reasonable people can differ over whether Trump falls into that camp. Historically people on the left have made similar claims about every R candidate in my lifetime, and it does ring a bit false to say, \\"Even though we said this about Reagan, Bush, W, McCain, Romney, etc, we really mean it this time.\\" That's not to say they're wrong, only that a good Bayesian will keep updating priors.Second, as a general rule in the US, to win elections you have to build a majority coalition. You do that by talking to people who disagree with you but can find common ground. If you cut them off, essentially you're forcing them to the other side, and unless one or the other extends the olive branch later, you've created a forever enemy. If you're on the losing side of an election in a democratic country and want to cut off the majority of people and shame them, it's very hard from a pragmatic sense to win elections going forward. For better or worse, Ds need to appeal to moderates who voted Trump. Writing them off forces them into the arms of Rs and only ensures that Ds lose elections going forward.So yes, I'll agree that some politicians are so bad that their followers should be cut off, but doing so creates stark consequences in a society that has elections, so you should only do so if the ideological purity is worth losing elections going forward.","title":"CMV: Cutting off family/friends over who they voted for is valid"},{"text":"If it had one, they would have been able to pull their head out and not vote for him..... eh, the analogy breaks down a bit, but you get it... something something stuck in their ways, something something not able/willing to get out...","title":"Trump voters are useful idiots who will be cast aside when he no longer needs them."},{"text":"Too fucking late now.","title":"Americans are desperate for change.

Why wouldnt they? If they know they can charge you $6 instead of $2.50 without pushback, why would they drop prices?

Trump gave him a glowing introduction, saying: Nobodys done a better job in sports. He gets these fighters and they really go at it, and its become one of the most successful sports enterprises anywhere.He then invited White to take the microphone C and he did, though he hardly needed the amplification. This is what happens when the machine comes after you! roared White. What youve seen over the last several years, this is what it looks like. Couldnt stop him, he keeps going forward, he doesnt quit. Hes the most resilient, hard-working man Ive ever met in my life, his family are incredible people. This is karma, ladies and gentlemen.Some Trump supporters have since called for him to be appointed as press secretary when the 78-year-old returns to the White House C in a role akin to something like Americas chief marketing officer.But how did Trump get the UFC chief in his corner in the first place?White was born into an Irish-American family in Connecticut in 1969. He had a troubled education, getting kicked out of catholic high school Bishop Gorman for bad behaviour. But boxing proved his salvation C although, after seeing the long-term damage that the sport can wreak, he decided to focus on the organisation side instead of being in the ring.That didnt stop him from taking a savage beating, though. When he was 21, he was attacked by a gang of youths. These dudes beat the living s--- out of me for a good 20 minutes, he recalled. At one point, I was on one knee and this f---ing guy must have punched me in this ear a thousand times. The attack left him with Mnires disease, which gives sufferers vertigo-like symptoms.White learnt his trade from former boxing champ Peter Welch, and soon set up his own boxercise business. But he couldnt seem to stay out of trouble. Local mobster?[James Whitey Bulger](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/30/notorious-boston-gangster-james-whitey-bulger-killed-jail/)?sent a heavy to his gym, demanding that White pay him $2,500 C or else.

It isn't going to send them back to 1990s prices without a serious disruption of the economy like a depression, but if they are priced more competitively and the economy is also doing better (particularly wages), then in effect they are cheaper for people to buy. Now, I don't see how Trump waves a wand and makes this happen as it is a complex issue that involves a lot of local policy, but people tend to think Presidents can do more than they really can and I don't see that changing any time soon.","title":"CMV: Housing prices can only drop substantially if we have a depression"},{"text":"He only did this so he can turn against Americans, especially women.... /s","title":"Trumps Not Even In Office Yet And Already Starting To End Wars"},{"text":"Don't be present at the inauguration.

This allows you to rearrange the outcomes more easily since people don't understand the \\"methods of action.\\"Then there's \\"Information destruction.\\" - Anything bad, you have to \\"cancel it out\\" with information that completely conflicts with other information.The third is: \\"Displacing bad information\\" - You want to make sure that bad information is as hard to get access to at all times. Preferably physically get people away from any sources of bad information. The more difficult finding bad information is, the less bad information people are going to get.From the perspective of information warfare, the truth is totally irrelevant. The goal here is to lay the ground work to totally manipulate the what the person thinks when considering a specific goal. If you understand a person's foundation of knowledge, you can predict what they think the truth is on a specific subject with a relatively high degree of confidence. So, they are manipulating the foundation to \\"put the pieces where they are suppose to be\\" to come to an outcome that they predetermined.The right wing is straight up carbon copying tactics that were used to manipulate people into going off to war and dying, so I assure you these tactics are super effective at manipulating people into doing relatively low effort things, like voting.","title":"Democrats need to understand: Americans think theyre worse| Blaming America for Donald Trumps success only guarantees more of it"},{"text":"You could get a dozen medium eggs at dollar tree for a dollar before Covid.","title":"'It's simple, really' - why Latinos flocked to Trump"},{"text":"I have gone in so many subs with the message of \\"become self reliant and live as much outside the system as possible, focus on your direct communities\\" and have been downvoted to hell.

Trump gave him a glowing introduction, saying: Nobodys done a better job in sports. He gets these fighters and they really go at it, and its become one of the most successful sports enterprises anywhere.He then invited White to take the microphone C and he did, though he hardly needed the amplification. This is what happens when the machine comes after you! roared White. What youve seen over the last several years, this is what it looks like. Couldnt stop him, he keeps going forward, he doesnt quit. Hes the most resilient, hard-working man Ive ever met in my life, his family are incredible people. This is karma, ladies and gentlemen.Some Trump supporters have since called for him to be appointed as press secretary when the 78-year-old returns to the White House C in a role akin to something like Americas chief marketing officer.But how did Trump get the UFC chief in his corner in the first place?White was born into an Irish-American family in Connecticut in 1969. He had a troubled education, getting kicked out of catholic high school Bishop Gorman for bad behaviour. But boxing proved his salvation C although, after seeing the long-term damage that the sport can wreak, he decided to focus on the organisation side instead of being in the ring.That didnt stop him from taking a savage beating, though. When he was 21, he was attacked by a gang of youths. These dudes beat the living s--- out of me for a good 20 minutes, he recalled. At one point, I was on one knee and this f---ing guy must have punched me in this ear a thousand times. The attack left him with Mnires disease, which gives sufferers vertigo-like symptoms.White learnt his trade from former boxing champ Peter Welch, and soon set up his own boxercise business. But he couldnt seem to stay out of trouble. Local mobster?[James Whitey Bulger](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/30/notorious-boston-gangster-james-whitey-bulger-killed-jail/)?sent a heavy to his gym, demanding that White pay him $2,500 C or else.

That does not automatically translate into a pandemic. It has to have an R0 of over 1 to actually be able to efficiently transmit and spread on its own. It has to be *well over 1* to be able to turn into a pandemic on par with Covid. Just to give an idea,  SARS had an R0 of *3.5* and we were able to contain it. No flu has ever even come close to 3.5. It is more likely that bird flu is going to become endemic in animals and spread to humans in clusters in poor agricultural regions where people work directly with animals a lot. You might hear on the news every once in a while \\"2,000 dead in bird flu outbreak in tanzania\\" or something along those lines. A combination of animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission will enable it to spread faster in those areas. But due to the relatively naturally low R0 threshold of influenza, it will likely not reach an R0 high enough to become a truly global pandemic. You might ask \\"but normal flu transmits just  fine at a low R0!\\", yes, because we take zero precautions against it. Even just very basic barebones precautions such as wearing a mask when you get a little sick or sanitizing public spaces can drop the R0 massively.Pandemic threat #1 is still coronaviruses.

Then she ran for AG when the incumbent didn't run with all the Dem establishment backing her and she beat a Republican state wide. Not hard in CA. Boxer retires and the Dem establishment backs Harris for senate and she takes it.People touched on her disastrous 2020 primary run so won't get into that but basically the only tough election she ever had was the SF DA race. She's never really had to court a diverse coalition of voters and certainly not anything remotely resembling the national electorate. People can point fingers and blame individual outside actions but bottom line is Harris basically lost every demographic (ethnicity, gender, age) in almost every state. Trump increased vote share in over 96% of counties nationally.

He has always been pro choice too but he sadly doesnt articulate this all that well.I saw him chatting away with a group of construction workers years ago on one of his campaign trips.  He was totally comfortable and understand them and what their issues were.  This is the person underneath the crazy statements and periodic bursts of anger.  Go below the obvious and look at the person.  Also know that the Biden admin sicced the Democratic legal machine against trump and his family in order to destroy them.  Trump will not turn around and do this to them even though joe and hunter biden and the Biden extended family are crooks who have been grifting the connections of Joe Biden for 50 years.

As a GenZ, POC seeking my STEM degree, unaffiliated and also living in a swing state, I voted for Harris. All of my friends and coworkers with similar backgrounds also voted Harris. Perception is really what has always been at play here and that is why Ive been so concerned. I get that the main memory people have from 2016-2020 was the price jump. I remember being able to fill up my beater for less than $15 during COVID, but again, that was during COVID. A global pandemic. Im concerned as it seems people have repressed the memory of it, and as such dont understand how that changed the economy. To put it simply, gas was cheap because nobody went anywhere. Groceries were cheap because everyone feared going to the grocery store. Transportation, entertainment, etc were cheap because everyone was staying within the confines of their home most of the time. Everyone got stimulus checks to stimulate the economy- not because of Donald Trumps administration. In fact I remember a delay on getting the stimulus checks out because he wanted to make sure his name was printed on it. Last I recall, everyone wanted him out because of how poorly he managed it. Its like everyone forgot the images of him golfing while being told hundreds of thousands of people were dying. Or when he told people NOT to get the vaccine and trying injecting bleach in their bodies instead. He just so happened to be there while this international crisis was taking place. America needed a president and we got Donald Trump. I remember prices for plane tickets being so much cheaper, I got on my first plane, and met my online friends for 10 years for the first time. We partied for two weeks and had a great time. But I also remember needing to console people whose parents died due to his lack of follow through. I hope this time is different, but I dont think it will be. I know prices are expensive. I personally went from barely affording my 1b 1ba apartment to living with three other people to make ends meet. I went from being able to eat out any day I want to just barely having enough to buy groceries without help. I know it is rough- but to say I trust Donald J Trump to make that better for me?

The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that was built with colonial concepts like race and slavery based on race at its foundation and its one of few countries that relied so heavily on these concepts and built its social core on these concepts. Most of the halt to progress over the last two centuries boils down to people wanting to make sure power stays in certain groups and not wanting things to change in a way that is more diverse. Its essentially been the driving thorn that has reared its head repeatedly since the Civil War. Theres so much of what we consider normal that was once controversial and usually it was the perceived threat to whiteness that made it controversial. Its time to get real about this conversation. Race isnt even a real concept but its been the bane of this country for a long time. Most people dont understand what whiteness and race really is and think its just some skin color classification. The concept of whiteness and race by skin color originate as functional parts of colonialism and slavery. The world didnt classify itself like this until colonialism which means that it was the colonizing countries that brought these concepts to the world in order to help their systems function. Whiteness isnt just skin color and its not just a particular group of people. Its also a social system originally intended to ensure the max benefits of the colonies goes to the descend of colonizing countries and to justify darker actions taken during this time. In its origin, it functioned as a way to establish those deemed superior within colonial systems and became the upheld ideal in many colonies and post colonial nations. None of it is real btw but our belief in race and its relationship to the formation of the country and the relationship of whiteness to all of that has been the biggest burden to progress that our country has and continues to face.","title":"I thought women would save us from another Trump presidency.

I was on the fence but ultimately I didnt vote for Trump mainly for a few reasons:- Im pro-choice and not happy with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Trumps commitment to veto a national abortion ban provided only some mitigation because theres still the risk he will appoint more conservative justices to the Supreme Court.- I had some economic concerns. For example the Trump tax cuts also included some changes to an esoteric corporate tax law called [Section 174](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/section-174/). The effect was delayed so we didnt feel it until the Biden administration, but it had major effects on R&amp;D investment and was a major contributor to layoffs in the tech and scientific industries which continue today. And of course Trumps tariff policy is concerning.- The most important reason is RFK Jr. I was still leaning towards Trump until he said a cabinet position in health would be made available for him. Many people dont know this but the guy is actually maliciously insane and dangerous. Being anti-vax is one thing, but hes actually a full on AIDS denialist, meaning he doesnt believe HIV causes AIDS. I shit you not, he pushes claims like its caused by gay men using poppers and hes against antiretrovirals (an idea that has killed an estimated 330,000 people in South Africa).

I am sorry to say in case you haven't noticed a woman sometimes is a woman's enemy. Men will normally stick together. Two is economy. Many people are struggling.. all things are getting expensive.. groceries, child care, housing etc. But people forget to turn around the Covid-hit economy is going to take time. It happened during Trump 1.0. Businesses were hit hard, jobs evaporated. With demand collapsing the entire supply chain also went down. Trump paid the price but so did Biden/Harris. The Feds threw down the interest rate to stimulate the economy. The government gave aid to the private sector. Sectors that benefited from Covid lockdown such as food delivery, entertainment like Netflix and K-pop, online shopping, Zoom etc. As the government finally started to control Covid, people could venture outside to buy things. Groceries.. as the supply chain had collapsed.. demand far outstripped supply.. prices skyrocketed. People were furious not at the supermarket chain like Walmart, Kroger and Costco but the government. Have you seen their profits? Kroger reported $736 million in Q4 2033 profits with annual profits of 2.1 billion. Walmart gross profit for 2024 was $157 billion an increase from gross profit $147 billion in 2023. Inflation rate at 2022 was 8%Jobs. The unemployment rate in April 2020 was 14.8% the highest ever since data collected in 1948. 20 million jobs lost. Leisure and hospitality. Restaurants. Latest unemployment rate is 4.1% for October 2024. A vast improvement but many people are still mad with their workplace. Americans will know how stressful it is. Can't take it out on the bosses. Who is the punching bag for the employed as well the unemployed? Inflation rate 2.4% in October 2024. But do people gave credit to Biden/Harris? No..they remember the high rate. Is the job of whom to control inflation? Federal Reserve. Of course it is more than that. The Fed conducts monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rate. It is independent from the government though subject to congressional oversight.","title":"I thought women would save us from another Trump presidency.

A lot of Trump voters who were interviewed admitted they don't personally like Trump or the stuff that comes out of his mouth (I believe there was a poll that showed most of his voters wouldn't trust him to babysit their children). But they do like his policies, which, when you boil it down, are not much different than your usual run-of-the-mill conservative policies. I'm no psychologist, but I do know Trump is a businessman and I wouldn't doubt that he goes outrageously far in the rhetoric as a negotiation tactic so he has room to walk back.

They also bought into the immigration topics - even though there are no actual illegal immigrants taking jobs away way from MI voters (I don't see any of them lining up to harvest produce, re-shingle roofs, or other labor intensive, seasonal outdoor jobs).

I think it's actually really simple when it comes down to it, voters aren't gonna care about abortion, Ukraine, or Gaza when the price of groceries is causing a severe dent in their monthly spending.FWIW, I voted for Harris, but I also recognize that I'm privileged enough that despite the extra hit to my wallet, I can still save enough money to be able to worry about something outside of my immediate concerns. I know that you can obviously argue that life-saving abortion measures are an immediate concern - I'm just trying to explain what most of the the rich asshole voters were probably thinking when they made their choice.But I honestly don't blame people for voting with their wallets, even if inflation isn't Biden's fault and they actually did a good job with curbing it. Unfortunately that doesn't mean decreased prices, and it doesn't mean most of the electorate actually is going to care about the how or why - if the prices are still high and their wages are still low, they're gonna vote for new leadership. I do really think that no matter who the Dems had running in this election (i.e. if we had a primary), they still would have had a real uphill fight on their hands. The situation was fucked from the get-go, and if you look at elections in the rest of the world, you'll see that incumbents all over (left or right) are losing due to inflation.Having said all that, to your point about high school, I would love for the next campaign to feature Republicans stuffing Democrats in lockers and beating us up for our lunch money.","title":"If You're Blaming Young Progressives for the Trump Win, You're Wrong"},{"text":"\\"Why won't they stop calling us Nazis?!\\"","title":"Trump Attorney General Hopeful Vows to Drag Bodies Through the Street - Potential Trump A.G.

And when the Democrat doesn't, they don't. This isn't because of Gaza.* Young voters, in general. Harris had a 6 percentage point advantage. Hillary had 18, Biden 25. Young people shifted to Trump. * Young women. Harris won then by 12 points, Biden won them by 24, twice the gap in 2020 vs. 2024.Trump is going to be worse for Gaza, so if anything, this result shows that young people didn't change their vote based on that, but rather that it didn't matter. And voter turnout was about the same for young voters (certainly the DNC expected it to surge).The rest of the reason why young progressives didn't swing this election:* Women in general. Trump won 42% of the women's vote in 2016, then 43% in 2020, increasing it again to 45% in 2024.* White women. They have only voted for the Democrat twice, in 1964 for Johnson and 1996 for Bill Clinton. Trump captured 52% of their vote. (Higher than that for older white women.)* White men. Trump won white men by 20 points, which is massive. However, he won white men by 24 points in 2020, so he lost some white male support. * Black men. Harris won 80% of Black men, when this whole election we were told black men wouldn't vote for her, and that they were [intellectually deficient](https://x.com/kbyrd2_/status/1853883382998204681?s=46) because of that.* Black women. Harris won 93% of their vote.* Trump has (somehow) diversified the GOP in ways the Democrats took for granted. The Harris vote was much less diverse (by half) than the Biden vote in 2020.* Hispanic women. Clinton won them by 44 points, Harris won them by 24 points. That's a massive shift of 20 points. * Hispanic men. In 2016, Clinton won Latino men by 31 points. In 2020, Biden won them by 23 points. In 2024, Trump won then by 10 points. That's a shift of 41 and 33 points. That's not just a slice of voters, that's a wholesale reversal. The DNC basically horribly misjudged this electorate. The Republican Party has had competitive primaries in 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2016. The Democratic Party hasn't had a competitive primary since 2008. The Democratic Party thinks it's a majority party, but it's not. America is high school. The Democrats are the theater kids, the AV club, the chess team, debate team, the kids taking AP classes, Tracy Flick and Mark Ratner. The Republican (voters) are the kids taking regular classes, playing sports, fixing cars, having keggers, Stacy and Brad Hamilton.

If history has shown us anything, its that we need to stay vigilant about our health system.Does anyone remember the chaos of the early days of the pandemic? Its impossible to forget the lives lost C lives that didnt have to be. There was a severe mishandling of resources, communication, and basic safety protocols that led to unnecessary deaths and trauma for so many families, including my own. Those in power knew what was coming but were more concerned about appearances than actually saving lives. Did the majority of voters have a memory lapse or did it not impact them? Now, as we enter a new phase of administration, its critical that we dont forget those lessons. If the past has taught us anything, its that we have to be proactive. We have to advocate for ourselves and each other, demand better healthcare, push for real policies, and make sure our voices are heard. So many of us lost friends, family members, coworkersthese werent just numbers on a screen; they were people with names and stories.So, heres my call to action for all of us: Get your healthcare in order. Get involved, make your concerns known, and dont let history repeat itself. Dont sit back and wait.

Those gals dont have to settle for scrubs and so they dont. There are also a fair number of conservative career women who just arent on the market.

Basically nuns who havent taken vows. Theyll never marry and theyll never have children. In the past, open-minded liberal and moderate women may have given these conservative rejects a shot and maybe even found love in unexpected places. Or even just a fuck before discovering they are incompatible. Now moderate and liberal women have grown self respect and are actively avoiding them and for good reason. So- you have a demand supply imbalance. More conservative men looking for companionship and sex and fewer women who are willing to deal with them. The men arent willing to improve themselves in any way or reduce their entitlement, so they want the government to basically force women to be so desperate they have no other choice to marry these rejects.

The people who sided with Trump 2016-2020 and only, had a splintering, when he attempted a coup.

They didnt push Biden out early enough. They had a huge push in the midterms and wasted that chance. They gave up ground on immigration. They turned their back on their voters time and time again.

However, the GOP will have the majority vote, which means they can pass budgetary things with majority vote. They will likely completely defund Planned Parenthood, and start putting anything out there to defund anything in any kind of public health Care for abortions and the rest of this stuff. They could go out of their way and see if they could try to change the regulations for Ob/Gyn where they won't know anything about abortions. I don't know how much of a vote they need for that. Now the only problem is that roe versus Wade is still overturned, which means your red State could go and pass some Draconian abortion ban law if they wanted to. Whatever law that the GOP wishes they could make Nationwide. They could also put bands on certain forms of birth control. My first thought to women who are concerned like you is to seriously consider relocation. Start turning red States into sausage fests where these guys are going to gripe and moan that they can't find a girlfriend because women want nothing to do with these men. Beyond that, consider getting your tubes tied if you are serious about never having children in your life. I want to try to be positive and believe that things are going to get crazy, and then the midterms will see another Blue Wave take back Congress when sensibility comes back into people's minds. However, with the state of things right now, you have more to worry about from your state and local governments, and that's where they can get all crazy if they know that the constituency will keep putting them back into office.","title":"Whats the new actual reality as a woman in her late twenties living in a red state?"},{"text":"Lets be real, this almost certainly will not actually happen.","title":"Trumps win puts militarized, mass deportations on the agenda"},{"text":"Once again Liberals learn nothing from a self-inflicted wound.

But unfortunately, we have work to do."},{"text":"I voted for Donald Trump. Im GenZ, immigrant, degree in STEM, non-republican, living in a swing state.??I had posted on Reddit about why Trump has so much support, but was always downvoted into the abyss.? About 90% of my friends, with similar backgrounds, also backed Trump. With a few exceptions, we dont post political things on social media, we dont wear MAGA hats, nor do we have signs in front of our house. Speaking for myself, I dont quite like Donald Trump - hes crass, vulgar and a little unhinged. So how does he gain my vote??The Democrat party has pushed identity politics for the past 10 years, if not more. They really made white men unwanted. They probably lost my vote the day they made me do a privilege walk in a college class to demonstrate how everything I had was due to my skin color, despite the fact my family couldnt afford a bus ticket and would walk miles to the nearest grocery store.? The Democrat party focused on niche social issues, such as transgenders in sports, that regular working class people simply do not care about. They pushed the climate change agenda so hard while their own elites were on private planes to climate change conferences. They rioted to defund the whole institution of police because a handful of police officers were racist murderers that abused their position. They made allusions to taxes on unrealized capital gains and wanted to use tax payer money to pay off peoples student loans. If they had their way, they would have come door to door and forced covid vaccines into every American. They called American parents domestic terrorists for having an interest as to what their kids learn in school. They built a straw man of the conservative argument against illegal in migration, pretending that republicans dislike immigrants. They demonized everyone that disagreed with them and labeled them as fascists, xenophobes, racists, homophobes etc.??Meanwhile Trump was essentially saying that he doesnt really care about your physical traits, he wants you to have more money in your pocket and essentially the freedom to do whatever you want with it. He wants there to be a border that prevents illegal immigrants from entering, abusing the social services that we have, and causing crime. Trump claimed he wanted to put American first and make sure its citizens are taken care of before we look outwards. He lowered taxes for corporations and small businesses while the Harris campaign was discussing unrealized capital gains tax. He strongly focused on energy production and deregulation during his first term and promised to do the same again - this does lead to cheaper energy and cheaper products (ignoring whatever price increases will be caused by his tariffs).?Will his policies actually improve our lives? Maybe in some aspects. The point is, it doesnt matter. People dont stay up late at night comparing policy details. Its all about perception.?The perception of trump is that he had a strong economy and a secure border (whatever that is actually true is irrelevant because people remember it being true; we all remember price of gas being $1.67 one year and $4.00 the next). The perception of the democrat party is that they cater to the crazies on the far left that want taxes at 55% to pay off their student loans and gender reassignment surgeries.??People with families that work 8-5, take care of their children, go camping on the weekends, and church on Sunday do not care about your social agenda. They want more money in their pockets, they want a safer country for their children, and they want government to leave them alone so they can live their lives. Whether Trump will provide that or not, it doesnt matter because hes at least identifying the issues that the populace is concerned about. The fact that he does it in such a boorish way is off putting to many people, including myself, but at the end of the day, Im not becoming his best friend. If my tax bill goes down, my retirement funds go up, and filling up my car costs me less, I can look beyond his antics and weird tweets","title":"What Trump Understood, and Harris Did Not"},{"text":"Get busy!

For instance, you can see [here](https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-median-annual-income-ratio/) that housing became dramatically more affordable in the 1950s (not shown in this chart is the fact that it had also become much more affordable in the 1920s), both times of economic booms. How was that accomplished?* More land was made into viable real estate for housing due to increased accessibility (in the 1920s from mass transit densification, and in the 1950s from the interstate highway system).\\n* A lot more housing was built on that real estate.\\n* The greatly increased inventory of housing reduced the price of housing.Local efforts (like capping rent, or ejecting \\"institutional investors\\" from the market, etc) are all very popular and deeply ineffective ... but big initiatives that accomplish the above do, reliably, decrease the cost of housing. So what would an effective federal policy look like? Well, it'd look like this:* Densify and improve mass transit networks around major metros, especially those with spiking housing prices. Expensive to do, but you light up a massive amount of land to become viable commutable suburbs.\\n* Require (as NJ does, successfully) that real estate developments above a certain dollar amount must build out a certain quantity of multi-dwelling-units offered at 1/3 the median income in the town they're being built in. This forces real estate developers to build entry level housing along with more-lucrative luxury housing.\\n* Offer extremely favorable tax incentives for real estate developers building or managing new affordable MDUsNow, why will Trump never do this?* It screws real estate moguls that hold expensive downtown properties on the assumption of indefinite price increases ... e.g., Donald Trump.\\n* It screws baby boomers who have deeply underinvested in their retirement on the assumption that indefinite value increases on their single family homes will save their bacon ... i.e., Trump's base.\\n* It benefits younger families living and working in denser areas (i.e., Democrats).","title":"CMV: Housing prices can only drop substantially if we have a depression"},{"text":"It's not that I trust him, but I trust him more than Kamalamadingdong.","title":"If Youre of a Conspiratorial Mindset, Why Trust Trump?"},{"text":"I think the truth is that its now meaningless how the media treats Trump, as most people get their news from TikTok and Joe Rogan.

She worked for 4 years trying to catch kids back up to where they need to be to have a foundation for Kindergarten.  Then for 3 years to present day she's been working in housing stability.

They aren't full, but we have all these people sitting on the streets and she's working with the county and nonprofits to figure out how to get a roof over their head.  The job isn't easy.  Her social worker degree cost about $60000.  She makes the payments but in her line of work that's never going away, it doesn't pay well enough.Project 2025 is cutting the silver lining.

People will be deported based on committing a crime, entering illegally, not ethnicity. 3. The GOP is now the party of the working class. Of course they have policy that benefits businesses, including corporations, but they appeal to blue collar workers as well. This is Trumps main base.

But white women, specifically, have never voted for the Democrat, except in 1964 and 1968. And today, many think that white women have [Stockholm Syndrome](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/11/07/harris-trump-white-women-voter-demographics-2024/76089457007/). I don't know about that. Whatever the case, the DNC butchered and squandered this opportunity. And the results were statistically epic.* Youth. Harris had a 6 percentage point advantage. Hillary had 18, Biden 25. Young people shifted to Trump.* Young women. Harris won then by 12 points, Biden won them by 24, twice the gap in 2020 vs. 2024.* Women in general. Trump won 42% of the women's vote in 2016, then 43% in 2020, increasing it again to 45% in 2024.* White women. They have only voted for the Democrat twice, in 1964 for Johnson and 1996 for Bill Clinton. Trump captured 52% of their vote. (Higher than that for older white women.)* White men. Trump won white men by 20 points, which is massive. However, he won white men by 24 points in 2020, so he lost some white male support. * Black men. Harris won 80% of Black men, when this whole election we were told black men wouldn't vote for her, and that they were [intellectually deficient](https://x.com/kbyrd2_/status/1853883382998204681?s=46) because of that.* Black women. Harris won 93% of their vote.* Trump has (somehow) diversified the GOP in ways the Democrats took for granted. The Harris vote was much less diverse (by half) than the Biden vote in 2020.* Hispanic women. Clinton won them by 44 points, Harris won them by 24 points. That's a massive shift of 20 points. * Hispanic men. In 2016, Clinton won Latino men by 31 points. In 2020, Biden won them by 23 points. In 2024, Trump won then by 10 points. That's a shift of 41 and 33 points. That's not just a slice of voters, that's a wholesale reversal. The DNC basically horribly misjudged this electorate. The Republican Party has had competitive primaries in 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2016. The Democratic Party hasn't had a competitive primary since 2008. The Democratic Party thinks it's a majority party, but it's not. America is high school. The Democrats are the theater kids, the AV club, the chess team, debate team, the kids taking AP classes, Tracy Flick and Mark Ratner. The Republican (voters) are the kids taking regular classes, playing sports, fixing cars, having keggers, Stacy and Brad Hamilton. The \\"regular kids\\" aren't going to follow the theater kids, unless someone comes along with super charisma like Bill Clinton or Obama. *And* speaks about the economy.  The Harris campaign tried, with good reason, to convince white women that their future was at stake. Trump is all but guaranteed to oversee a further rollback in reproductive rights, and the president-elect has also openly flirted with a federal ban on abortion. And yet that was not a winning message for white women, at 52%. A recent Times/Siena showed that the majority of white women, like their white male counterparts, saw inflation and the economy as their top voting issue. Abortion was second, and immigration was third. To be sure, there is a notable age split here: Gen Z women only went 36 percent for Trump, women aged 30 to 44 went 41 percent for Trump, women aged 45 to 64 went 48 percent for Trump, and women over 65 backed the former president 45 percent.","title":"I thought women would save us from another Trump presidency.

It just encapsulates the whole political content machine.It exploits the importance of politics, to present itself as something useful to do with your day. But its not. Its only slightly better than scrolling memes on TikTok.Go meet with friends. Read a novel. Read a scientific book. Watch a movie. Go for a walk. Draw. Play an instrument. Make a nice meal.

Harris struck a more positive tone, but her policy proposals  while more moderate than Trumps  still skewed to the right of the Democratic Partys traditional approach to immigration.Ahead of the election, The Marshall Project analyzed more than 12,000 of Trumps public statements about immigration available on?[Factba.se](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/search/?spage=1), a public database of presidential candidate statements.

We often see subtle hints that these groups want to identify with the majority, which is an empowering feeling for them.  Nobody wants to be a minority or feel marginalized.  So one seemingly more common approach by minority groups is to OVERCOMPENSATE for their otherwise second-class status among majority groups in social circles.  Make no mistake about it, this is a classic form of Stockholm Syndrome whereby the person with little to no power begins sympathizing and defending their oppressor.  The purpose being a survival mechanism that is profoundly rooted in a desire to empower the victim to a status equal to their master.When I saw Hispanics, women, and other minority groups vote in overwhelming numbers against past norms and for Trump - I began to realize the sickness was growing.

Hypothetically, if we could magically make 2x as many houses appear, the price per house would go down. That is basic economic theory. I am not arguing that fact.  What I am discussing is economic reality.  \\nHousing prices and commodity prices generally don't decline when trended over the long term. Over the short-term, that obviously happens all the time. Spot prices fluctuate up and down. But over the longer term, they tend to just go up. Why? Inflation.  \\nLet us say you built a 2000 sq foot home in 2010. It cost you $200k.  You needed $100k of supplies(land and material) and $100k of labor. If you go to build that same house in 2024, you will notice that the cost of both supplies and labor have gone up. So, you can't build that house for $200k. It is going to cost you $400k. Now, I did buy that house in $200k. I want to sell my house. As long as I get more than $200k,   \\nNow, the housing market may have driven those houses up to $800k. A lot of new construction MIGHT be able to pull those prices down, but if you live in an area where housing has gotten 4x more expensive in 14 years, I bet your labor is 4x more expensive.
