I'm basing this on the idea that people tend to reject criticism or bad news if its unfavorable for their \\"tribe\\", in this case political affiliation. Supposing you bury that part, maybe they become more receptive because it doesn't threaten their chosen identity.For example: instead of \\"Critics slam Trump for disastrous new transportation budget\\" lets do \\"What will tolls on interstate highways mean for Americans?\\". Or, if it's social media, let's do \\"This is American national parks right now\\" and show a video of a closed off gate or overflowing trash can\\", etc.The script needs to be flipped. Trump and Republicans need to be blamed for the upcoming malaise they are about to create.I think we could do the same for DOGE/Schedule F mess that's about to happen. I think Americans generally do believe in meritocracy, so if you emphasize stories about incompetent spoils system hires and leverage the age-old mistrust in government bureaucracy, you'll essentially turn the entire narrative the right is crafting upside down. Americans don't want corrupt billionaires and nepo babies in charge of things they were brought up to think were worthwhile.Finally, Trump is teflon, it's also known that's gross as a person, etc, so a million new headlines about something he did or said won't do much.

There are requirements that prevent blatant misuse of power.  And this is where what they say and what they can actually do falter.

And all the people he appoints can still do a lot.  With Republicans in control of Congress, they too can enable Trump by writing and passing legislation that bypasses control mechanisms.  This last part is the more dangerous part, BUT it's dangerous for all parties involved because it carries on for term after term after term.  What can be used by Republicans can be used by Democrats.  And there have been many times where Trump and Republicans were harmed by their own legislation and laws that were created and pushed through for, at the time, petty reasons.  Everything is a double-edged sword.  This is also why filibusters are still alive today despite there being an argument for removal for literal decades.  It's why the electoral college exists.  It's why a  lot of things still exist that seem out of place in a single context where it's impeding a desired result.  They have functions that don't always benefit every situation.

His weird combination of charisma and horrible politics allows him to juice rural turnout like crazy, which has been key to both of his wins but no other Republican has been able to replicate this to this point which is why many of his endorsed candidates (Lake, Mastriano, Robinson etc) end up going down in flames.

People overwhelmingly support things such as RCV and universal healthcare.  They just feel (often without thinking) that Dems (or frequently ANY politicians) aren't on their side because they don't talk like them or act like them.  This is why figures like AOC and Fetterman have achieved such success politically.But what I'm suggesting is that people need to make electoral reform their #1 issue when voting for *any candidate whatsoever* in a primary.  If we can do this one thing, there can be room for multiple parties and coalitions that can deliver the rest of our progressive agenda.We tend to scapegoat parties and politicians when the responsibility lies with the electorate.I strongly disagree.

The billionaires are the problem, plain and simple.  During Covid things were tight, people sick etc, so things were more expensive to import and make.  Fast forward to now and everything is basically back to normal, yet the prices havent been dropped since people are used to them.  These companies have posted record profit because theyre running like normal with inflated prices.  Even worse, even if they push back prices its still more than it should be.  This affects every smaller business in the chain who are just trying to keep their status quo to stay alive.  Keep in mind were still recovering from Covid and this is the fallout.  It wouldnt have mattered if it was Trump or Biden, the corporations dont care.  Their president is the share holders, plain and simple.Billionaires gotta go.  They are not needed, and even worse it gives them this inflated sense of power and that too is destroying the fabric of our society.  Theyre not super geniuses, theyre just lucky.  Odds are if each one of us started with their  inherited wealth or generous loans then we too would be just as rich with a good idea or two.  They need to be held accountable and taxed properly.  Were in the tale end of Trumps 2017 tax plan and its very favorable to the 1% and not us.  Basically in 2017 us poors saved a few dollars, but nobody decided to read what it would do down the road.  Our cuts are done and these companies are thriving.  Its greed, plain and simple.  Theres zero reason why so many billionaires should have positions of power in government, especially when most are pretty terrible business owners in general.  Somebody making $30k shouldnt be taxed more percentage wise than somebody who has more money than theyd need in 50 lifetimes.There should be income thresholds on our leadership.  You make too much then you cant run.  No trading as a member of the government either.  These people make decisions that they know about early, and can create laws just to get richer themselves.  Thats crazy.  The country is not a business and a person who treats their employees like crap shouldnt be making laws for the rest of us.  Clearly we have a free market, but there needs to be consequences for companies gouging people for necessary products like food, health care, shelter, water and electricity.  The wage disparity is bonkers too.  People are several times more efficient these days, yet theyre being paid worse than when productivity was far less.  Dont get mad at the burger flipper making $15 an hour, get mad at the fact you work a skilled labor job and get paid the same.  Demand more, get paid what youre worth!So policy you ask?  Maybe policy actually helping the 99%, not just the elite.  Want to beat the deep state and give people more power?  Then take care of them.  Healthcare helps keep a happy, healthy population for example.  Not sure why people are so opposed to national healthcare for everybody, when it would save billions in the long run.  Sad thing is we all could easily push for change and fix it, but were so broke and angry, we cant get a long to do something about it.  The politicians work for us, not the other way around.  Why shouldnt we use our tax dollars to better ourselves as opposed to blowing up people in other countries.  There are threats no doubt, but some poor country isnt invading the US and destroying it.  The two party system has got to go too.  It doesnt matter who is in control, nothing ever gets done because theyre constantly fighting.  Both sides have had pretty good policy ideas, but they never happen because if you have a D or R beside their name then itll be automatically opposed.  Its sickening.  Just watch.  The GOP controls all 3 branches, yet nothing positive will get done.  Just rage bait bullshit and useless laws that do nothing for us, just erode freedoms.Policy for the people, not just the rich donors.

While I absolutely respect the right of people in a democracy to vote for whomever they choose, I find the idealism of third-party advocates surprisingly na?ve. There is nothing preventing a progressive liberal candidate from seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party for any positionfrom school board to president. The American political system is open, and weve seen how a populist candidate like Donald Trump managed to seize control of the Republican Party, even against the wishes of its traditional leadership, simply because he won the votes. The same pathway is available to anyone, including progressive liberals, who believe their message can resonate with the electorate. That is the reality of the American system.The na?vet lies in believing that the American electorate is overwhelmingly amenable to democratic socialism or the broader progressive platform advocated by the liberal left. This simply does not reflect the current political reality. Recently, voters rejected one of the most labor-friendly administrations in decades, opting instead for a government that is openly hostile to workers rights. The gains unions and workers have made are now at risk of being rolled back, federal employees will likely face layoffs and weakened unions, and the ACA along with other social safety nets are poised to be undermined. The working class is on the brink of facing harsher conditions under these policies.This is not the behavior of an electorate that broadly supports democratic socialism. It reflects the complex and often contradictory priorities of the American voter, where progressive ideals struggle to gain widespread traction.We tend to scapegoat parties and politicians when the responsibility lies with the electorate. There is absolutely no barrier to any liberal progressive candidate seeking any position up for election, if they are not successful, it is the will of the people.","title":"A harsh reality about third parties and electoral reform"},{"text":"Yes never been censored any place but here .

However if he does there are options. The Democrats could focus on service workers (which would imply winning back the teamsters) and competitive businesses to peel those away from the Republican coalition.I think it's more likely that openness to trade and immigration defines the new coalitions though, which would imply that pro-labor stances won't be durable with the Republicans. Protectionists generally represent less successful industries that want to lower standards and get protection from foreign and domestic competition, they're not on board with people getting higher pay or better working conditions. The successful businesses that can afford to make concessions to labor are also exactly the ones who want access to foreign markets. I guess if you think realistically, the Republican's abuse of immigrants is actually an anti-labor stance since they do a lot of the work.","title":"Trump picks Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a pro-union Republican, to lead the Department of Labor"},{"text":"I think this idea could actually work if it was based on a sole purpose and done in a bipartisan manner.

Finding a balance and having rightwing candidates face off in red states would make it much more viable than just leftwing ones.Although, it would be hard to find trustworthy candidates and it's likely that some would just lie for the funding, but I think there are millions of people tired of the status quo politics and would be willing to attempt some change, especially after Trump was re-elected.If it's going to be done, now is the time.","title":"Bernie Sanders floats the idea of progressive grassroot campaigns electorally challenging both the Democratic and Republican parties."},{"text":"Turnout was absolutely awful.

COVID largely caused the inflation that likely was the main factor in the 2024 election loss for Harris, all other hand wringing aside.  Affordable college is a bit of a two edged sword. Only 37% of Americans over 25 have a college degree.  The other 2/3rds see loan forgiveness or college grants as an elitist give away.  All the people that paid off their college with hard work also feel cheated, regardless of how much more affordable it was years ago.  More training for high-tech, high-paying jobs?  Again, those 2/3 would rather have good pay for hard blue color labor that they see as a virtue.  Many at the bottom only a few dollars above minimum see hiking the minimum as lowering their status since their wage will stay the same.  They want to see LOTS of manufacturing jobs that don't require a college degree.  They think the knowledge economy is a sham and good jobs are purposefully being exported abroad (in that they may not be totally wrong).  Many have religious beliefs that conflict with the progressive agenda.  I myself am an agnostic, but many will vote knowingly for hypocrites on this issue, because at least their beliefs are getting lip service and aren't being told they are naive and ignorant or all religions are equal (yes, they want a special place for Christianity).   They see undocumented workers as stealing jobs and suppressing wages (surprise, it really does suppress wages).  They know the majority of the price for an apple in a store isn't the picker's salary.  They don't think Trans competing in women's sports is fair.  This is not a issue with a totally scientific answer (though I suspect many here will say it does). Our failure to see there may be legitimate objections on any of these issues paints as as believing we are better than them and will force a societal change on them given the opportunity.  Do I think we are better than them?  Well, lets just say my answer will not win us votes, but I also sympathise that people are use to living their lives a certain way and don't want to be told what is best for them.","title":"I Watched Orbn Destroy Hungarys Democracy.

Like how education is run in Nebraska is not gonna affect caliSure it does. It absolutely affects the ability of people to move between jobs in different states, and for kids to move between school systems in different states. Or to move to college in a different state. If you start having widely diverging curriculum such that people are coming out of high school with wildly different education levels, people won't be able to find jobs in other states without supplemental education. And people moving states, their kids might have to repeat grade years to get up to scratch, or just be left behind completely. And for companies, you might end up with a situation where in some states, a high school level education is acceptable to be hired for a given job, but in other states (due to lower standards of high school learning) you need some post-secondary education to get up to scratch. Managing all that if you end up with substantially varying education systems, adds complexity. You can argue **what specific curriculum items** are necessary for this, but some basic level of standardization across the country is absolutely a good thing.","title":"CMV: Blue states need to set up their own apparatuses to counteract the gutting of federal agencies by team MAGA"},{"text":"Weird.

I absolutely, 100% believe that the overwhelming majority of people in Washington will lie for any shred of personal gain. Maybe I'm wrong, but I assume that most, if not all, of the worst claims are either completely fabricated, or gross exaggerations. It's not exactly a secret that there are tons of journalists and political elites who *loathe* Trump, so I don't think it's unreasonable to conclude that a lot of these things are either lies, or ridiculously bad faith. For example, the claim about wanting to bomb Mexico I could see having actually happened, but as an offhanded joke, and it's just being played up as a serious idea from him.It's entirely possible that some of these things are true though; I don't know, and I've long since lost faith that the sources and journalists for *all* of that information are acting in good faith, so basically I feel like I'm forced to just throw out most of that information when forming my opinion. Some of it absolutely could be true, but I don't know what, or what the context was, so I can't really reliably use it to make my judgements. Instead I just look at the actual things I can verify for myself: things he's on video saying, the policy he's enacted, and how America has seemed to be fairing under him. And on those, I think it's overall a positive.There's *absolutely* been stuff that I can definitively confirm came from him which I dislike. One big example was in 2016 him talking about a Muslim ban. What he said sounded like a very clear violation of the First Amendment, and it was the moment I decided that there was zero chance of him getting my vote in the primary or general that year (although I was already not thrilled with him). I think some of his military actions were unnecessarily escalating wars in the middle east. I disliked the way he handled covid, and I don't like that he still holds it up as an achievement of his. I think he's far too heavy-handed with tariffs, although he's slowly winning me over a bit on that front.But overall, I know for a fact that my life personally was better when he was president, and from what I could tell so was life for the average American. He made a lot of mistakes, but overall I think America was a better place under his leadership, and a worse place under Biden's. To me, that trumps (no pun intended) all the stupid/vile things he's supposed to have done. Maybe he did say those things, maybe he didn't. I suspect he didn't for most of them, but even if he did I'm voting for someone to be president, not to be a champion of virtue and decorum. If America is better off under his leadership, which it seemed to be during his first term, that's ultimately what matters most. He lied about the election because he's a narc and couldn't accept the loss.This is the one I'm most willing to give ground on. Trump definitely is a narcissist. I don't think he *lied* with his claims, but I'm certainly open to the possibility that he was narcissistically unable to accept that he could lose, and it deluded him into believing untrue things. But there *were* certainly things that were definitely wrong in the 2020 election. Apologies, I don't remember which state this was, but I know there was one swing state (Pennsylvania maybe) that had a bipartisan law passed which allowed for mail in voting, but which violated the state constitution. I think things like that hurt Trump, and should not have been allowed to happen. The way the lockdowns were handled *at the very least* gave a massive bump to Democrats (since their voting base tends to overlap strongly with groups that are less likely to vote, and mail in voting made it trivial to vote), while also weakening the security around the election making it effectively impossible to know whether or not voter fraud had occurred.Did voter fraud change the results of the election? I don't know. I think the entire process was handled poorly (and I'll give Trump partial blame for that), and it fundamentally damaged trust in the entire process. I *don't* find it unreasonable for Trump to question the results though, and from what I saw he did it all through standard legal mechanisms. I don't really view it as any different from Al Gore fighting the results from Florida in 2000; it's infuriating and worrying when you're opposed to them, but if you support them you want them to exhaust every legal outlet they can to make sure they lost fairly. I don't like *everything* that was done in response to 2020, but in the end I just view it as someone who believes they were wronged doing everything they can to try to uncover the truth. Why was Donald, for example, phoning around asking for a specific number of extra votes?This one I think is overblown. I really think it's uncharitable to assume he was meaning he wanted votes manufactured to steal the election for him. I think it was someone who already didn't trust the process, and who is a narcissist incapable of accepting that he might have lost, saying \\"I know those votes that show I really won are out there. I need you to find them for me, because I know they exist and have slipped through the cracks.\\" Donald is many things. an honest person or a gracious loser he is not (for better or worse in the end).This I can mostly agree with. I don't really think he's that dishonest (he'll exaggerate things to make himself sound good absolutely, but from what I've seen he doesn't really lie about actual meaningful facts. Like, he'll say a big rally was the biggest in history, but he won't say Iraq has WMDs unless he has something that supports that). But yeah, he has an ego the size of the Sun, and does not take defeat graciously. But honestly, I just view that as being a natural consequence of him being a viable presidential candidate. No normal person will *ever* be able to reach that point. They're all sociopaths, narcissists, or have some other type of mental damage that drives them to reaching that point. Trump's has his issues, but I honestly prefer an egomaniac to our usual politicians, who will say whatever they can to get elected and then completely ignore all the promises they made. Trump wants to be loved, and he's realized that helping Americans gets him that. He cares about benefitting America, because that's how he gets crowds cheering for him, and chanting his name. I don't know exactly what drives other politicians, but I *do* know that they don't care at all about us once they have power.Also, sorry for the *very* long rambling response, but I really appreciate you having this polite disagreement. It's refreshing to have people who are actually willing to talk about things without assuming the absolute worst. And even if neither of us changes our minds on the issues, it's very healthy to at least understand *why* the people we disagree with came to the conclusions they did.","title":"You idiots make up constant shit about Trump, refuse to learn about him, and heavily defend overblown garbage.

It can also serve as a cautionary tail, while Trump and the republican party are laying down strikingly similar foundations for an authoritarian takeover. \\nBut the final part cannot be taken too seriously, because in fact nothing has proven to work to weaken Orbn yet. The leftist populist  agenda items in particular did not work because Orbn has hijacked those topics, but is also successfully re-framing the narrative. As an example inflation levels in Hungary have been some of the worst, but Orbn manages to tell the story that he is the one fighting inflation while the global powers are generating it by financing the war in Ukraine. The author's recommensations require that there's still a somewhat healthy democracy in place with a fair media and judicial system to support it, which is not the case. I also think it is naive to look at this as a left-right issue. The populace will have to recognize at some point that the authoritarian leader does not have its interests aligned with the rest of the country. The current opposition leader is running on this agenda and this is finally breaking the old-fashioned left-right party lines a little bit. However this is successful only because the economy and the public services are in shambles, so people can't easily close an eye even if they want to.

How bills did they propose that actually give Texans better affordable healthcare or access to healthier foods or affordable childcare or even limit the cost of eggs were told about One such measure, HB1123, would impose stricter laws on sports by requiring every athlete in the state to undergo a chromosome testan invasive and costly procedure that could wreak havoc on high school and college athletics. Many people are unaware they have atypical chromosomes, making this requirement particularly problematic. A similar guideline was used at the 1996 Olympics, where mandatory chromosomal testing of female athletes revealed that eight women had XY chromosomes without knowing it, due to unknown intersex conditions. The discovery led to widespread backlash as intersex athletes faced threats of removal and the emotional toll of learning their genetic status. Chromosomal testing was subsequently discontinued, deemed deeply violating, unfair, and unworkable as a standard.How much money and time is going to go into sending every student athlete to the doctor and forcing them to take a genetic test if there is any suspicion about their orientation? For fucks sakes there were probably more kids gunned down in Uvalde than there are trans athletes playing high school sports in all of Texas.","title":"TX Republicans Introduced 32 Anti-Trans Bills on First Day of Pre-Filing Period.

Apparently the dollar is doomed and crypto is the currency is the future. Cough:: bullshit:: cough cough.","title":"Elon wants to appoint cryto investors to Trump's cabinet"},{"text":"Absolutely.First, court cases take years.  If a judge stays a law from going into effect, it may not happen for ages.  That's huge for protecting peoples' rights.  (Though the real issue isn't Congress, with a close House and the filibuster still existing; it's Republican state governments).  So we want good people making these rulings, not MAGA stooges.Second, even if one judge doesn't give us the ruling we want, we can appeal it up to the next level.  That buys us even more time to change the situation in Washington/the states and overturn these laws while they're challenged.Third, I think this question comes from a big misconception about the Supreme Court.* Is the Supreme Court bad?  Yes, absolutely.* Do they have too much power?  Yep!* Are they a magic rubber stamp that lets Trump do what he wants and ignore the Constitution?  **Not even close!**If they were going to let Trump become a dictator, they would have done so in 2020 when he was an incumbent, had the Justice Department on his side, and was raising arguments that he should've been allowed to stay in power.  SCOTUS - with those same six conservative Justices we have now - said no to every one of his arguments.They also could've done it in 2023, with *Moore vs. Harper*.  Remember when Reddit was in a non-stop panic over that case?  It would've let state legislatures (largely run by Republicans) ignore the results of elections and choose their own Presidential electors.  Well, SCOTUS said no, quite decisively.This Court has a legal philosophy and a logic to its decisions.  It's a terrible, harmful logic, but it's not just \\"Republicans get to do whatever they want\\".  And that idea is not only false, it kills activism to make things better.  Why bother electing good leaders if there's a magic Court that will let Trump do everything?  Why volunteer when the Court will just snap their fingers and take it all away?  But that's not how it works.So to answer the original question...yes.  These judges will slow down a lot of the GOP's agenda, which is a bigger deal than Trump's vanity bullshit.  It's enormously important that these judges got confirmed, and I hope we fill as many seats as possible the next month and a bit.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 23, 2024"},{"text":"Front &amp; Centre.","title":"Law Enforcement and Leaders in Blue States Are Hatching Plans to Stop Trumps Mass Deportations"},{"text":"US Party","title":"Bernie Sanders floats the idea of progressive grassroot campaigns electorally challenging both the Democratic and Republican parties."},{"text":"if it distracts him and others for 4 years then go ahead","title":"Trump will fire Jack Smiths lawyers and use the DoJ to investigate the 2020 election"},{"text":"She was on farmers only dating site.","title":"Trump names Brooke Rollins as his pick for Agriculture secretary"},{"text":"Firearms are so ingrained into Republican politics, it'll be the last freedom they give up.No state that's ever gone authoritarian has ever had the level of fixation that the US has with firearms.","title":"Women and LGBTQ+ people take up guns after Trumps win: We need to protect ourselves"},{"text":" Is it a cheap point?

Candidate filing is on December 5th and 6th, the primary is January 28th, and the general is April Fools' Day.[Here's the field of battle, with the 2024 Presidential results.](https://twitter.com/MappingFL/status/18603922168305623660)  (Side note, I'm trying to find this user on Bluesky and coming up short; if anyone knows his handle please let me know).Big picture, it voted for Trump by 37.2 points, and hasn't elected a Dem since 1990 (and that particular Dem would *not* be at home in today's party).  However, there are some interesting things under the hood here.  Every district in Florida shifted right from 2020, unsurprisingly.  However, this district shifted the least.  It'll end up being pretty important in any future statewide wins.  This shift is largely being powered by Pensacola, the biggest city, and its suburbs.  Long a bastion of Christian conservatism, it's becoming more diverse and [actually voted for Biden in 2020.](https://urbanstats.org/article.html?longname=Pensacola+city%2C+Florida%2C+USA&amp;s=GctBPij4w9D5iFs)  But that's about it as far as Dem areas go here.  There's also a chance to make progress in Okaloosa County, where cities like Fort Walton Beach, Destin, and Crestview are actually shifting pretty nicely.  (One interesting trend from 2020 was vacation hotspots shifting blue rapidly; not sure if that continued in 2024 but it's worth noting).  Finally, that light-blue swoosh in Escambia County is a fun one - that area contains [the majority-Black small town of Century,](https://urbanstats.org/article.html?longname=Century+town%2C+Florida%2C+USA&amp;s=GctBPij4w9D5iFs) which may be small but it's the kind of place we can't forget about.  Rural Black areas had some rough shifts on November 5th, remember.This is a very red district, and I'm not gonna promise the moon.  Victory would involve literally everything going right and then some.  I'm not going to talk about what the ideal candidate or strategy would look like, because in a district like this it's a victory just to find a candidate.  But I hope we'll get out there and volunteer hard for any Dem that does run.  Not just in case the unthinkable happens, but so we can start building inroads that could lead to some wins in Florida.I know the road is hard, but we don't have the luxury of giving up anywhere.  I'll be watching this one with interest.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 23, 2024"},{"text":"We gave him a chance, he was impeached twice, incited an insurrection, and knowingly hid classified documents.

Debt and equity are not meant to be equally treated economically and for tax reasons. Interest is taxed as ordinary income while equity earnings are taxed much more favorably.

Kyoto agreements were signed three years later. Humanity decided that it needs to act. 3. In the next 30 years, until 2023, it was 900 billion tons. As much as in both previous periods combined.Half of everything that weve emitted was emitted in the last 30 years. The other half was emitted in the previous roughly 250 years. We dont have technology to solve the problem even using any dirty tricks if we wont lower our emissions at the same time.","title":"CMV: We should find short-term solutions to climate change and throw future generations under the bus so that current young generations get to live as good as the boomers did"},{"text":"I don't exactly disagree what you said, but spraying sulfates in the atmosphere would not disregard climate change.

You're blaming \\"fire-fighters\\" for the \\"fire\\", just because they are always popping up where there's fire.1. The DoEd doesn't legislate nor implement higher education tuition, and policies, Congress, States and universities do. The DoEd must however try to fix their blunders (e.g. financial aid for poor students)2. The DoEd doesn't set education curriculum, States do.3. The DoEd is certainly not responsible for States, Congress and corporations wanting more and more crazy capitalism dictate the education sector, which requires more and more expensive middlemen (just like the US healthcare sector, which btw is by far the most expensive in the world while delivering less than many European countries who spend only 1/2 of what America spends).

This has nothing to do with the DoEd. (Unless you think the DoEd conspires to sink all White people's IQ, which would be a crazy conspiracy theory)5. Blacks have been failing in almost everything and has nothing to do with the DoEd.

Dont Be So Sure"},{"text":"Okay, lets ignore the economic standard part here and focus on the environmental.In your premise, the word _should_ is doing most of the heavy lifting. Its a very loaded word, but in this context I'm gonna take it to mean \\"it is morally good, or at the very least morally neutral\\", since I believe we can both agree that we _should not_ knowingly do morally wrong things. To determine wether or not disregarding climate change is a morally good or bad action, we need to first establish a somewhat coherent logical framework. Since I'm not a philosophy PhD, I'm just gonna take the most famous ones.# Kanthian EthicsFirst, we're gonna go with Kanthian ethics. I'm gonna be _grossly_ over simplifying. The key concept is that of _the categorical imperative_. This can be formulated as this: Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.Given you think it was unfair when the boomers did it, then you probably don't want it to become the rule that the current generation burns everything to the ground with disregard for the next one. In fact, you'd probably like the inverse, for the current generation to work to provide better conditions for those that follow. So, in Kanthian ethics you'd be obliged to act in favor of the next generations. # UtilitarianismWhile Kant bases his ethics on the concept of having _a good will_, Utilitarianism is based on the consequences of our actions. There are several types of utilitarianism, but basically they all agree that \\"the more utility (or benefits) an action generates, the more morally good it is\\". Based on this, lets evaluate what would happen if we were to take each of the possible actions.If we choose to disregard climate change and just live out our best lives, we're gonna be generating some utility in the near future. The utility we're generating as a whole will peak in the short term, and then steadily drop off as time goes on._Best case scenario_, this drop off happens after you die. But it might not, the time we have to generate utility might be a lot less than you think. We also have to consider that while we currently think we have a chance of stopping climate change, there is a point of no return after which humanity is doomed.  If humanity is doomed, utility goes to zero. So this course of action does not maximize utility (neither average, total or maximum).On the other hand, keeping future generations in mind allows us to potentially solve the issues that would prevent them from generating utility themselves. As such, in the name of maximizing some form of utility we'd be obligated to act for the benefit of the future generations.# EgoismThis is the tough one. Here, we're looking at moral agents that act according to their own interest. As such, I need to argue here that it is against your own interests to burn it at both ends and destroy the planet.The only argument here is, that while you _hope_ it will be a problem your children or grand children will face, you don't really know. It is entirely possible that if we burn it at both ends, the consequences will become worse and worse _during your lifetime_.As such, it would be in your best interest to fihgt climate change, as to minimize the chances that you'll be forced to live through societal collapse and the consequences of climate change.Sure, you won't be born with 3 arms, but you might still develop nasty diseases during your lifeitme (along with even worse economic conditions due to the potential collapse of civilization).","title":"CMV: We should find short-term solutions to climate change and throw future generations under the bus so that current young generations get to live as good as the boomers did"},{"text":"- Uh, that all the Unions under this convicted rapist and felon will be totally screwed.!!","title":"What Trump's Labor Secretary Nominee Lori Chavez-DeRemer Signals to Unions"},{"text":"She is going to absolutely screw over American farmers by forcing them to only sell domestically and ban any activity with foreign markets where farmers can often get much better prices selling their crops.","title":"Trump taps Brooke Rollins of America First Policy Institute for agriculture secretary"},{"text":"And then what do you do when Republicans keep telling people that trans people are sexual predators and by you having one as a mascot, you are also the party of sexual predators?Refusing to fight and get your hands dirty, doesn't work.","title":"Democrats rally behind first out transgender member of Congress, decry Republican attacks"},{"text":"We need to ask: what will it take to achieve electoral reform??\\nWaiting for the Democratic party to do it is not a good strategy, they benefit from how things are and keep their cushy position despite running objectively bad campaigns and lying constantly.A workers movement is what it will take to overcome these barriers.

In 1971, the conclusion of a lawsuit in Japan drew international attention to the effects of decades of mercury poisoning on the people of Minamata.[35] [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement) And boomers in Europe had it great too.Dog, read some history of the post war situation.

What exactly Palestine's being considered a separate nation party to the Statute of Rome means as to ICC jurisdiction over Israel/Israelis perhaps is a separate issue.The ICC can issue all the warrants it want, but a warrant that is not enforced is potentally an embarrassment, but nothing more and Benny doesn't seem to embarrass easily. Only nations that have chosen to become parties to the Statute of Rome have any obligation to even attempt to enforce the warrant. Be all that as it may, the edit to my original post was not about the jurisdiction of the ICC in general or even the whole story as to Palestine and Israel. The point of the edit was only what I thought it clearly stated--that, FWIW, neither Israel nor the US is likely recognize any ICC ruling about Israel/Israeli (or about the US/any USian).

I think it brings up an important topic and it's a good explanation of what could happen. Some people may think \\"Oh of course that won't happen.\\" But you know what? Over the past eight years, thanks to Trump, **there have been way too many things I didn't think would happen, and they happened anyway.** So I can't really say things like \\"Oh of course that won't happen.\\"Being president protects Trump from any kind of accountability. So why would he want to leave his position of power? I think what might happen is that Trump will be Vance's VP and still have a major influence on him: Might Trump just do what Putin did: pretend to play the number-two role while retaining all the real power? Staying in the vice presidency might avoid criticism about an un-democratic thwarting of the spirit of the Twenty-second Amendment, but why would Trump care? A disciplined autocrat like Putin might care more about the exercise of power than its trappings, but its hard to see Trump even pretending not to be the alpha male. What about the kind of arrangement Ronald Reagan briefly considered proposing to Gerald Ford in 1980, in which Ford would have run as Reagans vice president and be given much more responsibility than most vice presidentsan arrangement dubbed by the press a co-presidency?I think this really could happen. Sure, Trump would rather be president than VP, but this way, he would avoid any constitutional questions and legal issues. Not that he cares what's legal and constitutional, but still, it's convenient to just avoid all that altogether. So he might do this. Even as VP, he'd still avoid accountability for anything, despite what this paragraph says:Whatever the packaging, the vice presidency wouldnt provide Trump the clear legal immunity of the presidency. In?[*Trump v. United States*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf), the Court held that a former presidents immunity must be absolute because of the nature of Presidential power. The Constitution vests all executive Power in the president and these duties are of unrivaled gravity and breadth. The Constitution gives the vice president just three roles: succeeding the president, counting the electoral votes, and breaking Senate ties as presiding officer. While vice presidential immunity remains murky, it cannot possibly be anything like presidential immunity.The Supreme Court can just decide to give vice presidents immunity.

These theories ?poison our children, who are being taught on the one hand to affirm that the color of their skin fundamentally determines their identity and even their moral status while on the other they are taught to deny the very creatureliness that inheres in being human and consists in accepting the givenness of our nature as men or women.They are basically saying \\"women and Men have a certain immutable nature, and that nature must be enforced, by law\\".Page 38: Conservatives should ardently pursue these pro-life and pro-family policies while recognizing the many women who find themselves in immensely difficult and often tragic situations and the hero- ism of every choice to become a mother.They are basically saying \\"women's nature is to be mothers and we should enforce laws that only recognize this lifepath as a valid lifepath for women, all others should not be supported, if not explicitly banned\\".Page 483: Families comprised of a married mother, father, and their children are the foundation of a well-ordered nation and healthy society.They are saying \\"a woman must be married to a man\\" to make a family, lesbian mothers, single straight mothers, divorced mothers, mothers that conceived through IVF and don't want to be married, all these mothers are invalid identities and are in fact, social ills. *A woman's place, is in effect, to be married to a man.*This further reinforced later in the document on...Page 493: Because the maleCfemale dyad is essential to human nature and because every child has a right to a mother and father, three-parent embryo cre- ation and human cloning research should be banned.IN other words... \\"the male-female\\" pairing is the only acceptable relationship in society. LGBTQ is unacceptable. Having two fathers or two mothers or only a mother or only a father, is unacceptable. It is a *personal failing* in fact. Specifically, on the woman, and we know this because of language elsewhere in the document.They also notably, want to end divorce.I could really really go on and pour over this document, but the broad strokes of it? Women should be subordinated to men, at a systemic and social level; and be legally inseparable from them. That's what this document is saying.","title":"Democrats rally behind first out transgender member of Congress, decry Republican attacks"},{"text":"May chaos be their food for every meal.

So maybe it is not a surprise that some of them are starting to advance an alternative theory of the case: that continuing existing tax cuts actually costs nothing.Senator Michael D. Crapo, an Idaho Republican who is expected to lead the Senate Finance Committee next year, took to Fox Business this week to make that argument.If youre just extending current law, were not raising taxes or lowering taxes, that is a $4 trillion deficit. Thats ridiculous, he said in an interview with Larry Kudlow, who helps advise President-elect Donald J. Trump. Mr. Crapo said later, Were going to have to take the bold steps of saying to the American people that we are not going to let $4 trillion of tax hikes happen and that its not going to increase the deficit.Mr. Crapo, who said he had discussed the idea with Mr. Trump, added that Republicans could try to officially change budget rules so that extending the tax cuts is not shown to cost anything. Other Republicans may be wary of going that far, and some budget experts are raising alarms about the possibility.Its clearly a budget gimmick and an end run around the needed efforts to make sure that, given our terrible fiscal situation, new policies dont make it worse, said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that seeks smaller deficits.It is a bipartisan tradition in Washington to work around (or just ignore) the findings of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the two bodies responsible for evaluating the cost of legislation.In 2012, Congress and President Barack Obama faced a situation very similar to what lawmakers are dealing with now. Sweeping tax cuts signed into law by President George W. Bush were set to expire at the end of 2012, creating an expensive fiscal cliff. The Obama White House made the same argument as Mr. Crapo: The cost of legislation should be measured against current policy, which assumed that the Bush tax cuts would continue, not current law, under which the cuts would expire.The thinking allowed the Obama White House to claim that the deal it made to extend many of the Bush tax cuts reduced the deficit by more than $700 billion over 10 years. The budget office, using the current law base line, said it actually increased deficits by roughly $4 trillion over that time frame.Adopting a current policy mind-set again could help Republicans out of the fiscal hole they dug in 2017. Members of the party are exploring cuts to clean energy and social welfare programs next year, but unifying enough of those cuts may ultimately prove difficult. And then there are other, potentially expensive policies they may also want to pass, including the list of additional tax cuts Mr. Trump proposed during the campaign.Making the math work will be easier if the party can look past roughly $4 trillion in expected deficits from extending the 2017 cuts. Republicans could simply argue that the estimated cost of the tax cuts is overblown or, as Mr. Crapo suggested, go beyond the rhetoric the Obama White House used and actually change the way budgets are measured.But deficit hawks in the party may be unsatisfied with just waving away such a huge cost. The debt is already expected to grow to levels economists find alarming, even assuming taxes go up because the 2017 cuts expire.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and an economic adviser to Senator John McCain, is no fan of how the budget office scores tax cuts. Changing budget rules to assume that continuing tax cuts has no cost may help win Republican votes in the short term, he said, but it would expose the party to steep criticism.Maybe this helps them get to 218 and 50, he said. On the other hand, there will be people who accuse them of changing them now because its convenient for them, he said. They will suffer the slings and arrows of attack if they go this route, theres no question about it.","title":"Republicans Ponder: What if the Trump Tax Cuts Cost Nothing?"},{"text":"Meh, I disagree. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard's personal feelings towards Japan, and perhaps I was wrong to say her comments were because of her \\"Hawaiian origin,\\" especially considering she was not born there. However, [it seems some of her comments were made in the context of the anniversary of Pearl Harbor,](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/11/15/japan/gabbard-japan-hostile-remark/) and considering she was elected to the House of Representatives from Hawaii I don't think it's crazy to reach that she could have been motivated by her political history in Hawaii.Also, plenty of American politicians distrusted the British Empire in the lead up to and even during World War II, not precisely because of the reasons you mentioned, but consider how reluctant many in the US were to get involved in Europe before Pearl Harbor. Then we made sure not to give them too much aid to ensure the US would be the dominant economic power because we don't like or trust empires, as we shouldn't.Edit: To clarify, I am not at all counting out the possibility that Gabbard simply waited for the anniversary of Pearl Harbor as an excuse to undermine US relations with Japan as a Russian \\"asset\\".

The June debate with Trump and Biden was the beginning of the end. By this time even I was starting to realize something was wrong Bidens cognitive abilities. I was doubtful before, but as Chris Wallace said in the immediate aftermath, he has sunk his campaign.That same night, Anderson Cooper spoke with Kamala on live tv. She could barely hold it together when Cooper pressed her, is this the President Biden you see every day? That might have been one of my favorite moments of the political year. I still think Cooper did a wonderful job that night. The other factor of that debate that worked in Trumps favor was that people werent just questioning Biden, or his administration, or the media, they started blaming the Democrat Party for deception. A few weeks later the assassination attempt happened. At the time I felt that would have sealed the election. But the democrats and media bet on the masses having short memories (which they do) and did their best to memory hole the attempt. It almost worked. What changed my mind was when the Harris campaigns plans for unrealized gains became public. I became a first time home owner three years ago. I am very proud of what we have done so far. This place is *mine.*The other nail in the Harris campaign coffin was Hurricanes Helene and Milton. I say this next part with the upmost sensitivity, but natural disasters are one of the best tests of any politicians capabilities. What is still happening in WNC is a disgrace.

And more importantly, Hunter Biden hasn't been convicted of any crime related to these actions.

It is a way to offset the ethnic demographic and social shifts that historically strengthen the Democratic vote.High School Education or Less: Approximately 50% of eligible voters with a high school diploma or less participated in the election. ?Some College or Associate Degree: Voter turnout in this group was around 60%. ?Bachelors Degree or Higher: About 75% of individuals with a bachelors degree or higher cast their ballots. However, the voting patterns were:High School Diploma or Less: Donald Trump secured a significant majority among voters with a high school education or less, obtaining approximately 60% of their votes, while Kamala Harris received about 35%. ?Some College or Associate Degree: Among voters with some college education or an associate degree, Trump garnered around 55% of the votes, with Harris receiving approximately 40%. ?Bachelors Degree: Voters holding a bachelors degree showed a preference for Harris, who received about 52% of their votes, compared to Trumps 46%. ?Postgraduate Degree: The most educated demographic, those with postgraduate degrees, favored Harris more strongly, with approximately 58% supporting her, while Trump received about 40% of their votes. So when you consider the economic, social, and educational factors, the ideal win against the republicans in 2028 would be a charismatic leader with a compelling vision to correct the inevitable shit show of Trumps second presidency, with a platform that emphasizes:1) Greater economic growth opportunities for the lower income earners with lower taxes2) Healthcare accessibility3) Educational cost reductions and accessibility for lower income and young people 4) An overhaul to immigration similar to Canadas points based system rather than the ludicrous lottery system, with a clear system for asylum based refugee claims, but allows for seasonal worker visas and visas for specific sectors that benefit from temporary foreign workers that stimulate the economy5) an overhaul of the justice and incarceration system that still supports public safety, that has to include mental health care, education, and income support systems that offer an alternative to crimes related to survival.Its a long term vision, but the right leader could sell the long term vision as a multi-decade overhaul to truly make America a place to be proud of, as it is currently not.","title":"Bernie Sanders floats the idea of progressive grassroot campaigns electorally challenging both the Democratic and Republican parties."},{"text":"That's the trashiest way you could have possibly responded.

What Trump might not know, is that these people also intend to use him.This is what we've been warned about, at least those of us who didn't just vote a demagogue back into office because...  *feelings*. This is the future that political junkies and analysts have been calling a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"Schedule F is an executive action that the Trump administration tried implementing towards the end of his previous term, It's also a major policy proposal included in Project 2025. It attempts to strip protections from civil servants whose government positions will depend largely on their allegiance to the president and his agenda. Schedule F, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities granted to the president, will afford Republicans the power to cripple the system of checks and balances holding our democracy together, helping them to consolidate power for the foreseeable future.Project 2025 laid it all out in their manifesto, while heritage foundation members and \\"America first\\" Trump allies have been preparing to implement this agenda in some variation or another.The Unitary executive Theory is another major goal of project 2025, and a proposal that's been floated before by Republicans. Bill Barr was a major proponent, and it's part of the reason why he shot down the Mueller investigations efforts to hold Trump accountable for obstruction. The UET proposes that the president has unchecked powers and complete control over the executive branch.The goal is to eliminate the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of the executive, crippling the separation of powers in the process and giving Trump unilateral authority over the administrative state. These actions will allow The Trump administration to then install loyalists into positions of power within these agencies, and positions that were formerly reserved for non-partisan civil servants, knowledgeable staff and experts in their field, whose job security didn't previously depend on their loyalty to the president. Schedule F and a unitary executive, along with a coalition of MAGA loyalists, a Republican majority in both houses, and a conservative SCOTUS makes this very likely to succeed.Yes, part of the goal is to \\"gut the administrative state,\\" which is also sometimes called the fourth branch of government, but the other part involves taking what's left, dismantling our democratic system of checks and balances, and creating a government that serves the Republican party, consolidates power for itself and installs Trump as king.Hence, a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"Trump's coalition will certainly use this opportunity to exploit him, the useful idiot he is, in order to build what can only be conceived of as a one-party state. \\"Limited government\\" my ass. More like government limited to the authority of Republicans.The next Trump administration is also preparing to create new agencies out of thin air, offering people like Elon Musk a top role in these agencies.From there, they will have the best opportunity they've had in decades to implement an extreme, far right agenda backed by special/rich interests, right wing think tanks, dark money groups, Christian nationalists, far right jingoists, corporate powers with the same rights as American citizens, foreign autocrats, right wing power brokers, billionaires, xenophobes, conspiracy theorists, and in some cases, white supremacists...This is an agenda that will also pave the way for future Republican administrations to continue building a one party system of government, while setting up roadblocks for any progressive, or even populist efforts or movements that may take hold in the future. Because make no mistake, this ain't populism, it more closely resembles an age of modern day robber barons working closely with politicians, or vice versa. Hell, in some cases, they're basically synonymous.","title":"Jon Stewart Knows Why Trump Is Picking All the Worst People for His Cabinet"},{"text":"Yes, but there's a difference of degree.Soldiers who get triggered tend to open fire on the crowd, like in [the Kent State shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings).Police who get triggered only tend to assassinate individual civilians, one at a time.

When asked directly how she would differ from Biden, she just didnt have a good answer. She would said say something vague about being similar in background but with different sensibilities, or point out a specific policy she would do differently. She admitted that she as VP wasnt critical. It was neither here nor there.When Harris ran in the 2020 primary, she got a debate bump that never translated into momentum because while people were interested in her, they never really got what she stood for once she had a voice. That was within her own party.The big picture here is that people have been asking for changes to feeling more empowered as a working and middle class since Obama who ran as a change candidate. He did a great job navigating the mess Bush gave him, but by the end, people didnt feel he changed their existential concerns. It was felt that major financial institutions still won the day. There is nothing about Hillary, Biden, or Harris that made people think that wouldnt be the case again. Another set of status quo policies that point at macro economic indicators of success and occasionally throw people a bone with social programs that barely work because of corruption and inefficiency.Trump is not a popular figure in general, but hes very clear about saying he wants to change everything with a fuck you to the system that taps into peoples reasonable anger and fear. Harris needed to tap into that, and her bump in numbers when Biden dropped out showed people were willing to hear her out. They just didnt hear anything new.

I have a CZ P01 that I absolutely love. I bought mine for \\\\~$550. Also their P09 Nocturne and their P10 are great options as well. If you want to go super fancy you can get a CZ Shadow Compact 2, but those are like $1k. I also have a Smith and Wesson M&amp;P Shield Plus that i like. I snagged it for about \\\\~$500 when they first came out, but I think they're cheaper now. I hear their new Bodyguard 2.0 is great as well. For long range/hunting rifles I really like Tikka (from Finland) and Howa (from Japan), both of which stay out of American politics. As for AR15s, that's hard because most American AR gun makers are right leaning, some very much so. I would go with Lead and Steel ( [https://leadandsteel.co](https://leadandsteel.co) ) or Amrika Armory ( [https://www.amrikaarmory.com](https://www.amrikaarmory.com) ) if I were going that route. Smith and Wesson makes ARs as well if you want to buy from a bigger manufacture. My #1 suggestions are if you buy a firearm that you should take a safety course, buy a lock box or safe so kids can't have access, and practice with it fairly regularly so you know how to shoot it. Another thing to know is if you buy online you'll need to have it shipped to a local gun store (or FFL) so they can process the background paperwork and then transfer it over to you. My local shop charges $30 to transfer/do a background check, but some charge more. If you want to buy directly from a gun store you can go that route too, but they usually mark their inventory up by a lot, so I mostly buy online. Also most private shooting ranges have guns you can rent, so If you're unsure on what to buy you can just rent a few and see what feels right in your hands. That way you'll get something that you really like. If you're looking for left leaning reddit communities to learn more about guns I would suggest you join r/liberalgunowners  or r/SocialistRA. Both communities are very helpful when it comes to firearm questions and suggestions.  If you intend to buy online, here are a few good dealers that I've bought pistols and gear from that usually have much cheaper prices. [https://www.familyfirearms.com/](https://www.familyfirearms.com/)[https://www.dahlonegaarmory.com/](https://www.dahlonegaarmory.com/)Also I look on this meta search website for deals sometimes.

I read it and looked into it. I did recognize some of the cases. Sorry about these other guys giving you a hard time. I dont agree with you but I wont demonize you for it even if you provide no evidence at all. (Controversial, I know). Im more concerned with your reasoning to be honest. As long as that is relatively sound, I dont care about how good Exhibit A is, to be frank. I just asked because people who have no evidence to back up their worldview often have poor arguments too. Im glad you do actually base your opinion on something tangible. Even if we disagree on how we interpret the information, I respect your opinion and will assume that you have good reasons and intentions behind your viewpoint, as I would hope you would continue to do for me. The only caveat I would put forward here is the following argument: it is actually fairly common for sex criminals to claim they belong to some victimized groups like gay or trans people to avoid facing the full accountability for their illegal behaviors. As such, Im not sure in how many of these cases it is fair to say that their identifying as trans (whether they really believe it or not) had a determinative impact on their behaviors. There is a strong case to be made for any of these that the people in question had other glaring mental health issues aside from or in addition to being trans/having gender dysphoria. In that sense, I personally still dont think there is enough evidence to support the idea that trans people are any more or less likely to commit these crimes than any other demographic. That means it can still happen of course, but given how few trans people there really are, Im not sure that forcing them to use the bathrooms of their biological gender makes a significant difference in how often this occurs or not, given that the vast majority of sex crimes (in bathrooms or elsewhere) are still being by cisgender heterosexuals. Edit for clarity: to be clear, on the section above, I wasnt implying you believe that at all! Just bringing it up to get it out of the way for by question below. So here we get to the meat of this particular controversy: will accepting trans people more broadly make it easier for those who would commit sex crimes (be they trans or not) to find opportunities to do so?","title":"Democrats rally behind first out transgender member of Congress, decry Republican attacks"},{"text":"Im a federal employee whos busted my ass for the American public for the past decade.

IN A 1999 LAW REVIEW ARTICLE, Bruce Peabody and Scott Gant concluded that a President nearing the end of his or her second term and determined to stay in office might run as Vice President with the idea that the President-elect would step aside, allowing the already twice-elected President (and Vice President-elect) to serve a third term. Critically, the Twenty-second Amendment only bars a person being elected to the office of the President more than twice.1 It doesnt prohibit serving or acting as president again, as proposed versions of the amendment would have done. The amendment was simplified before Congress sent it to the states for ratification to focus on avoiding a repeat of what President Franklin Roosevelt did: running for more than two terms. But would Trump be eligible to run for vice president? The Twelfth Amendment, ratified in 1804, says no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States. If the Twenty-second Amendment makes Trump ineligible for the presidency, why wouldnt he also be ineligible for the vice presidency? Of course, originally, the Twelfth Amendment could only have meant ineligible to refer to the three criteria spelled out in Article II (as noted above). But even if one assumed that the Twenty-second Amendment expanded the list of eligibility criteria, Peabody and Gant conclude, the Twelfth Amendment could be read as affecting only persons who would become President. This distinction is crucial. The Constitution originally provided that, upon the death or resignation of a president the Powers and Duties of the said Office . . . shall devolve on the Vice President. This ambiguous phrasing created great confusion the first time a president died in office. John Tyler succeeded to the presidency after the death of William Henry Harrison in 1841. Mocked as His Accidency, Tyler was plagued by legal doubts about his authority as a merely acting president. The Twenty-fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, ended such confusion by making clear that the the Vice President shall become President. Yet the amendment left untouched two provisions of the original Constitution by which someone may act as President: If both the president and vice president are unable to serve, succession would go to what Officer shall, according to legislation, act as President. Likewise, whenever an Electoral College deadlock sends an election to the House, if the House deadlocks, the vice president could act as President.  Thus, Peabody and Gant reason, even if the meaning of eligibility under the Twelfth Amendment was transformed with the adoption of the Twenty-Second Amendment, the Twenty-Second Amendment still does not render twice-elected Presidents constitutionally ineligible to the office of Presidentbecause they could, through these two extant provisions, become acting Presidentand it therefore cannot be said that the Twelfth Amendment prohibits a twice-elected President from serving as Vice President. Such close textual analysis is how the Supreme Court has reasoned for decades. But even those who might appeal to legislative history or the spirit of the Constitution would reach the same conclusion, Peabody and Gant explain. So its hard to see on what legal basis any judge, whatever their ideology, could object to Trump returning to the presidency immediately after being inaugurated as vice president","title":"Think Trump Cant Run Again in 2028?

That one event completely shattered whatever faith most people still had in the mainstream media to be remotely objective and to accurately report facts on the news. It opened a lot of people's eyes to the possibility that if the news media was lying about that, they were lying about other things too, including about Trump. That possibility turned into reality for a lot of people when Harris was nominated, and the media basically transformed her from a highly disliked, inept Vice President to a 'superstar' who is so incredible she was gonna save the world. The whole thing was so obviously fake that it made it obvious the media was carrying water for her and so, again, couldn't be trusted to be objective. So every time they called Trump a dictator, a fascist, a threat to democracy or literally Hitler, people just tuned it out and ignored them.

As much I think low interest rates are not good for the life of a currency its important for now. If you can promote lower interest rates, companies have easier access to capital to survive/expand. Trump hasnt talked about it but in the long-term getting the FED under control through audits and reintroducing Constitutional Money (or something else to limit money-printing) is crucial.Next level down is the cost of energy (petroleum). Expanding supply and domestic refining capacity will bring current/future prices down. Both interest rates and energy costs will help builders by reducing the cost to build new homes, which will bring overall prices over time. This applies for both mining and manufacturing.Next level down is overhauling the tax system to lower corporate taxes, reducing red-tape regulations, and creating more tax brackets is essential. As much as I hate the corporate-class Im not naive to think increasing taxes is going to help anyone in the short-term. Reducing red-tape will help new companies get started, grow, and compete with the big boys. Creating more tax bracket and reducing the tax rates at each level will help keep more money in peoples pocket. $250k in places like NYC is not the same as in rural KY.

Increasing corporate tax rates (multi-billion dollar corporations shouldn't be paying less in taxes than individuals) would help a lot and scrapping the cap on Social Security payments would fix any shortfalls with that program. The cap is currently $168,600 (increasing to $176,100 next year) and that is ridiculously low. There shouldn't be a cap on Social Security payments, the more you make the more you pay.

Otherwise maybe just do as much safety and shooting training for owning a basic rifle and again - only using it when theres no other option.People have a fantasy that theyll be able to be a cowboy and defend their home when need be.
