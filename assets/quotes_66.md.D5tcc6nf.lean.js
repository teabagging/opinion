The group was founded in 2012, by Abu Mohammad al-Julani, as Al-Qaeda's affiliate branch in Syria. They had initially been supported by the forces of the Islamic State of Iraq, lead Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. Over the next few years, ISI expanded it's influence into parts of Syria's territory and among jihadist fighters in Syria. Al-Baghdadi tried to merge ISI and the Al-Nusra Front into one group, but were opposed by Al-Qaeda and parts of Al-Nusra's leadership, including Al-Julani. As a result, Al-Bagdadi and the ISI cut ties with Al-Qaeda, took the part of the Al-Nusra front that wanted to merge with them, and formed the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in 2014. ISIS would go onto take over large parts of Iraq and Syria, attempted to build their own theocratic empire in the Middle East, and over the next several years was largely destroyed by coalition of opposition forces. Following the creation of ISIS, Al-Julani lead the remaining members of the Al-Nusra front, as they spent the next few years fighting on the side of Al-Qaeda in their rivalry against ISIS. In 2016, Al-Julani began to take his forces in a different direction. In 2016, they severed their alliance with Al-Qaeda. In 2017, the Nusra Front merged with several other groups to form a group called Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS). Al-Julani became the leader of HTS and spent the next several years building up the group. The HTS shifted away from the Nusra front's prior claimed goal of supporting global jihad, towards a more nationalist focus of fighting a national level jihad against the Assad regime. The group worked to build up its military forces, build up its own government apparatuses in areas it controlled, engage in diplomacy with other armed groups, and engage in diplomacy with various different local communities. The group in more recent years puts out messaging claiming that it is focused on liberating Syria from the Assad regime, that it now respects the ability of Christians and other non-Sunnis to live in Syria, and that it supports a decentralized system of governance for Syria post-Assad. Overall, HTS has tried to portray itself as more moderate Islamist nationalist group. HTS has played a major leading role in the recent offensive that has allowed resistance forces to push Assad's forces out of Aleppo, Hama, and are large swaths of Northwestern Syria. Given that HTS's leader and its predecessor organization used to be allied with Al-Qaeda, there are those who suspect that HTS isn't really as moderate as they now portray themselves to be, and might try to establish a more hardline theocratic government in all or parts of Syria once Assad is removed from power.","title":"CMV: Writing off the Syrian Rebels as 'Jihadist terrorists' plays into Russia's hands and will help whitewash retaliatory war crimes in the coming months as it did in 2016."},{"text":"It cited a Cochrane Collaboration study which has been widely questioned as finding that healthcare workers apparently do not need to wear masks to protect themselves from respiratory disease.

Then keep them in power for a few terms and transformation comes.","title":"House Democrat on Sanders saying Democrats abandoned working class: What a crock?"},{"text":"They approved it via emergency use authorization (EUA) so a full clinical trial wasnt required.","title":"On Joe Rogan : The House released a 500 page report on the Pandemic.

He [suggested in a Wall Street Journal op ed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464) in 2020 that only up to 40,000 Americans would be killed by the pandemic. More than 1.2 million people died.While he hasnt yet established how to measure academic freedom, he has been looking at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and the nonprofits scoring of universities and their rankings based on freedom of speech.The nonprofit bases its rankings on surveys of students views on whether they feel comfortable sharing ideas, with schools being negatively scored if their administrators punish faculty for opinions, or if they withdraw an invitation to a speaker following a possible controversy.Some of the schools that receive NIH grants but have bad rankings, according to the nonprofit, include the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, and the University of Southern California, The Journal noted.Those at the top of the rankings include the University of Virginia, Michigan Technological University, and Florida State University.Bhattacharya also has plans to fund studies that recreate the work of other scientists in an attempt to take on scientific fraud. There are also plans to create a scientific journal to publish studies with comments by named reviewers, to urge a more open discussion.He has also suggested limiting the amount of grant money that pays for publication in journals, and he would look eastablish a pause on research which creates new viruses for study purposes.In addition, Bhattacharya has a goal of enacting term limits for those in charge of the research institutes run by NIH. He would would review a congressional Republican proposal to slash the number of institutes and centers from 27 to 15, those with a view into his thinking told The Journal.Lizbet Boroughs, associate vice president of the Association of American Universities, told The Journal: Its not clear why wed roadblock the best chances of finding a cure for cystic fibrosis or cancer or Alzheimers by adding potentially political, nonresearch factors into medical-research grant decisions.Former director of the National Cancer Institute Ned Sharpless told the paper that Bhattacharya might find it hard to implement his changes. While he could change the rubric used to review grant applications, it may be difficult to get grant reviewers to follow his guidelines, Sharpless told the newspaper.Its much more complicated than it appears from the outside, he said of the top job at NIH.As many as 174 scientists on the NIH staff or who have received its funding have won a Nobel Prize, The Journal noted.NIH doles out as much as $25 billion in grants each year, which have led to major advances, including immunotherapy cancer treatments.","title":"Trumps Team Weighs Withholding Massive Research Grants From Universities That Are Too Woke: To take on what he views as academic conformity in science"},{"text":"There's this song song I found [Denzel Curry - Clout Cobain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKAv7eOK2dg&amp;rco=1) which has clowns and circuses, but it will not cheer you up.So [Carousel ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwOqolmgpvQ)by Mr. Bungle it is.

Biden handled the pandemic well and then navigated inflation well, but the price gouging hurt. Just like after 2008, the wealthy won again while the rest of us paid. Wrong or right, people are unhappy and they don't have time to understand the nuances of global inflation, soft landings, or even abortion. Look after the cheers following the CEO assassination.

Seems like they could have gotten something passed in one of the multiple times since then that theyve had full control of all branches. Unless there isnt actually the will because most of them are owned by the donors.  Same with that, theres been a number of bills from the Dems at both the state and federal level to address that. But also a lot of the housing issue can be boiled down to city/county level so thats more difficult for the national Congress to address.Totally wrong, democrats directly control all the cities and states with the worst housing crises and theyve done nothing about it for decades. Because the actual solution is to decrease the cost of housing, which donors dont want.  relief, how? How are they impacting the average american?Using up resources at local schools, local health clinics, local social services, local police. Bidding up housing. Bidding down wages. I have nothing against immigration but opinion polls for decades have shown large 60-70+% majorities of Americans want less of it, and I believe it has a lot to do with the direct negative impact that the immigrants have on their lives. And the immigrants do bring a lot of benefits, particularly to business owners who benefit from cheaper labor. But the business owners dont live in the same towns as the immigrants, they should at least share in the benefits of the immigrants by paying for the cost of all the education for the immigrant kids.","title":"House Democrat on Sanders saying Democrats abandoned working class: What a crock?"},{"text":"The last person Democratic primary voters chose won the election.

Go point by point through the plan:\\n(1) give an extra $25000 tax credit to developers when they sell a home to a first time homebuyer, (2) give $40 billion to local governments to then give to politically connected local developers to build housing, (3) give people $25,000 towards their down payment to help further drive up the price of housing. That is an abysmal housing plan that further inflates housing costs and puts billions more debt on future taxpayers. The reason the donors like it is the same reason the donors like Obamacare: it greatly expands services on the government (taxpayer) dime without involving any discounts or price cuts. The housing crisis can be solved for $0, just a few strokes of a pen. You simply need to pre-empt local regulations to allow developers to build more and denser housing. Removing tariffs on foreign wood and other construction supplies would also help. The donors dont want that because it would drive down the value of housing.

(Well you *can*, they're just not gonna do it). But you go to a doctor's office, or a therapist and it's common. Generally willingness to pay matches \\"need\\", this is part the argument we use against price gouging laws for instance. The price goes up and the people in more need will spend it while the people in less need won't.Yet everyone, including the providers, seem well aware that it's often the complete opposite in healthcare. If there's a single Miracle Cure pill that would fix all issues, the person in a coma with four broken limbs has no ability to pay compared to the guy who gets mild headaches and can work a full time job.Healthcare as a concept works differently than almost any other good or service out there. There are other necessities like food and water but those are universal needs. *Everyone* at all times needs at least some, and they're prone to hoarding behaviors. Much of healthcare is unique in that it's necessary for many to live or function *and* is a service.

I have seen people claim that Biden appeased Republicans too much and was naive, believing that he could have good faith negotiations with them. Supposedly this is because he was old and was used to politics of a different era. People then say he was Republican-lite. Meanwhile Obama was supposedly much better at dealing with Republicans and didn't give in to all their demands. This is so stupid because if anything the opposite is true. Obama tried way too hard to compromise with conniving partisan right wingers who don't give a shit about anyone other than themselves. As a result, there wasn't a whole lot of progressive legislation passed aside from a few notable exceptions. On the other hand Biden without a doubt ran the most progressive government in US History for a long time, maybe since LBJ. The first two years of Biden's presidency were arguably more productive than the first two years of Obama's presidency. If anything wasn't accomplished, you could almost certainly blame Manchin, Sinema, Republicans in the House, or right wing judges in the courts blocking his agenda.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 6, 2024"},{"text":"We wont.

He is trying desperately to walk the balance between denouncing the miscarriage of justice that has already been meted out to his son, due to brutal partisanship and ratfucking by the GOP, and the fundamental threat to democracy that Trump represents, whilst not interfering with the peaceful transition of power.Biden *is compelled* to issue a pardon here (and likely elsewhere) to protect Americans from literal tyranny, but without saying, \\"It's all going to shit with Trump,\\" even though it is extremely likely, and Trump keeps providing reminders of his corruption, cronyism, and vengeance on a daily basis.This is because Biden's exercise of the pardon power delegitimizes the incoming president, and his party the GOP, as incapable of being fair and upholding the rule of law. In this regard *they are illegitimate* as they have demonstrated an inability for fairness and upholding the rule of law. But he doesn't feel that he can say that without further wounding democracy, and he is too much of an institutionalist to do so. As a result, people are flipping the fuck out over Biden's exercise of restraint.And I should make it very clear, it's restraint *in messaging* as not to appear alarmist. The pardon is BROAD AS FUCK and gives away the underlying message, \\"I am taking this extraordinary step because the GOP is a danger to America, and they have chosen to manifest that threat by targeting Hunter, to get to me.\\"","title":"Of Course Joe Biden Was Right to Pardon His Son"},{"text":"Eh...

The era of Neoliberal civility, and kindly debates on policy is over. 2016 was the warning bell and the post COVID inflation and 2024 finally killed it.Populism is the name of the game now. The Neoliberal era and an era of institutionalism is over. Institutionalism worked post FDR because from FDR to Dubya the system seemed to work okay for average people. Not perfect but okay. However During the Reagan era, politicians on both sides began reducing public services and regulations in favor of free market solutions and privatization. Welcome to neoliberalism. It took time for the pain to really start being felt and it made a lot of people very rich, which is how Neoliberals were able to pull that trickle down trick, they did it slowly and deliberately. Until it all came to a head in 2008. Obama was a marvel. He was able to ride the line between populist and institutionalist. He is a once in a generation talent. He had charisma. Too bad he governed largely the same as other Neoliberals. He helped recover after 2008, and pushed the ACA through, but he failed to actually fix the rot in the system and reverse the neoliberal trend. The failures of the Obama era signaled the Second Guilded age. During the first Guilded Guilded age populist progressive movements took root resulting in the progressive era. Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson (well his wife was a populist), FDR, Eugene Debbs and Huey Long, some of the most important figures of the era were all populists because of the scale of inequality and corruption. You need to get used to populism. You may dislike it but that is the era we are in now and that is what it takes to win. Populism is flawed like all political movements have their flaws. They rise and fall as conditions change but failure to adapt to those changes is what kills political movements and parties. Dems must adapt to the second populist era. You must adapt. You may dislike it, but the rules of the game have changed. If you want to make the world a better place then you need power and to get power you must win. If you want to win that means being a populist. Power is all that matters. Conservatives know this. Dems must relearn this lesson. Ceding populism to the right means thar fascists will dominate the political landscape as fascists use populist rhetoric to gain power. We can't we need our own populist movement to counter. If the disdain toward the United Healthcare CEO after his murder wasn't enough of a signal that we live in an era of populism.","title":"Rep.

Origins of COVID-19:Evidence increasingly supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from a laboratory or research-related accident in Wuhan, China.U.S. funding supported gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Chinese and international entities attempted to cover up the virus's origins.2. Public Health Response:Operation Warp Speed was a success, rapidly delivering vaccines that significantly reduced severe illness and death.School closures during the pandemic have had enduring negative impacts on childrens education and well-being.Overly strict lockdowns caused preventable mental, economic, and social harm.3. Fraud and Mismanagement:Pandemic relief programs, including unemployment insurance and Paycheck Protection Program, suffered from extensive fraud, costing taxpayers billions.4. Misinformation and Transparency Failures:Misinformation by public health officials eroded trust, including overstating vaccine effectiveness and dismissing natural immunity.Dr. Fauci and others allegedly attempted to suppress the lab-leak theory.5. Failures in Oversight:Agencies like EcoHealth Alliance failed to report dangerous experiments and misled funding bodies.Federal agencies inadequately monitored pandemic relief funds, leading to large-scale fraud.6. Preparedness:The Strategic National Stockpile and reliance on global supply chains, especially China, left the U.S. vulnerable.WHO demonstrated a lack of independence and transparency in responding to the pandemic.\\nConclusions:A lab-leak origin remains the most plausible explanation for COVID-19.The U.S. response revealed systemic weaknesses in public health, governance, and crisis management.Future pandemic planning must emphasize transparency, decentralization of authority, and a \\"whole-of-America\\" approach.\\nRecommendations:Enhance domestic manufacturing of medical supplies to reduce dependence on foreign countries.Focus on data-driven, minimally disruptive measures during health crises.Rebuild public trust by prioritizing honesty, accountability, and scientific integrity.","title":"On Joe Rogan : The House released a 500 page report on the Pandemic.

It does not provide any evidence that policy P *does* cause outcome A, since many other things could have caused outcome A, and you have no reason to believe it is P without further data.?\\n2.

For that reason I've asked ChatGPT to give us a short summary.\\"The document is a detailed final report from the U.S. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. It offers an extensive after-action review of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on lessons learned, critical failures, successes, and paths for future preparedness. The report addresses several areas, including the origins of the virus, government response, societal impacts, and recommendations for improvement. Below is a longer summary organized by key themes:\\nOrigins of the PandemicThe report supports the lab-leak hypothesis, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 likely emerged from a laboratory or research-related accident, citing evidence from U.S. intelligence agencies and scientists.\\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) conducted gain-of-function research on coronaviruses, with U.S. taxpayer funding via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and EcoHealth Alliance.\\nThe Chinese government, some U.S. agencies, and parts of the scientific community allegedly engaged in covering up facts about the origins.\\nA lack of safety protocols at WIV and controversial collaborations with China's military are highlighted.Operation Warp Speed: Praised as a significant success that expedited vaccine development, saving millions of lives.\\nFailures in Relief Programs: The report highlights extensive fraud, waste, and abuse in relief initiatives like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and unemployment insurance, leading to billions of dollars lost.\\nSchool Closures: Pandemic-era school closures are criticized for causing long-term harm to children's education, mental health, and development.Lockdowns: Described as overly broad, unscientific, and causing significant economic, physical, and mental harm.\\nMask Mandates: Declared largely ineffective and inconsistently implemented, undermining public trust in health authorities.\\nVaccine Mandates: The report claims mandates were not supported by science, caused societal harm, and reduced military readiness.\\nNatural Immunity: Criticism is directed at public health officials for ignoring or downplaying the role of infection-acquired immunity in COVID-19 policy.The report accuses U.S. public health officials and the Biden administration of exaggerating vaccine efficacy, suppressing dissent, and promoting unscientific claims about treatments like ivermectin.\\nLab-leak theories were initially labeled conspiracy theories, undermining legitimate scientific debate.The pandemic's economic damage was exacerbated by government-imposed lockdowns and an overreliance on foreign supply chains, particularly with China.\\nSmall businesses, rural communities, and low-income sectors bore the brunt of economic disruptions.\\nThe Federal Reserve's early actions mitigated some impacts but contributed to inflation in subsequent years.\\nFederal agencies, including NIH and the CDC, are accused of obstructing congressional investigations, withholding documents, and evading accountability.\\nNotable public figures like former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo faced scrutiny for alleged malpractice and cover-ups regarding nursing home deaths.\\nThe report calls out global organizations like the WHO for being influenced by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) interests, failing to hold China accountable, and issuing misleading reports.Recommendations include improving global and domestic readiness, enhancing oversight of funding and research, and reducing reliance on foreign medical supplies.\\nGreater transparency, accountability, and reforms in global health organizations such as the WHO are advocated.\\nEmphasis is placed on restoring public trust by ensuring accountability, scientific integrity, and clear communication.The report underscores the need to learn from the failures and successes of the COVID-19 response to better prepare for future pandemics. It stresses that accountability, transparency, and evidence-based policies are critical for public trust and effective health responses.\\"","title":"On Joe Rogan : The House released a 500 page report on the Pandemic.

If someone gets a job and the job offers insurance through 1 or 2 companies and the non-job alternatives suck, which is frequently the case, then the market can't really correct itself because there's little competition for the consumer to choose between. The limited choices from employer plans, and the large number of Americans who get insurance through their employer, does a lot to prevent the market from working efficiently. The difficulty in assessing plan quality is also problem for health insurance. Consumers have difficulties assessing complicated systems, and insurance is complicated, so consumers don't make as good choices about it as they do about, say, sandwiches.This doesn't mean that health insurance can't be handled by private industry. If we eliminated the employer insurance paradigm, for example, the market would likely function a lot better. (Not that that's likely to happen.) Intelligent regulation can also make the industry more transparent and align with customers expectations better, making it easier for customers to make good choices.","title":"Is shareholder primacy in a health insurance company a de-facto market failure?"},{"text":"It's pretty much the norm.

Many of the hoax positions simply state that Trump gashed his ear with a razor blade, and blanks were fired into the crowd. Without a dead bystander, the conspiracy can begin and end with those two details alone. The dead bystander, plus the body of Crooks, simply add additional layers to the psy op. Nobody is arguing that the deep state would never kill an innocent civilian if the goal was to shoot at, or even simply shoot close to the POTUS. Riskier shots were taken on behalf of the deep state over a half century ago in Dallas.","title":"They tricked you"},{"text":"Your post implying that people that people who supported Elon Musk and Donald Trump were \\"tricked\\" because they are part of the visible 1%.You also are implying that they won't change the system which is only as yet to be proven as of today and would be invalid to say.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez launches bid to lead Democrats on House Oversight Committee"},{"text":"What's unnerving is that Trump and his supporters claim that this warrants even broader immunities for Trump.Hunter Biden was excoriated and dragged through the mud for 5 years as the target of relentless partisan inquiries and investigations, media smear campaigns, political scrutiny, public harassment, which all amounted to a waste of time, because in the end, He was prosecuted for a crime the tens of thousands of Americans get away with every year. If Trump were prosecuted for lying on a gun form, his supporters would be having a collective conniption fit. Even most authorities on the matter have called the prosecution highly unusual due to how infrequently it is prosecuted in the first place, let alone including the involvement of Congressional committees, special counsels, and the DOJ.And in regards to the tax evasion, we all know where Trump and his followers stand on that, considering Trump has made a career out of avoiding paying taxes after amassing unsustainable debts. While mind you, Hunter paid back *his* tax bill. Another case that prosecutors found highly unusual because of how difficult it is to convince a jury to convict someone of not paying their taxes, even though they've paid their taxes...Joe Biden's decision also protects his son from future punitive efforts and political scrutiny from a Republican party that has consolidated power and intends to abuse it. There is a massive difference between targeting the president's son in such a brazen manner and investigating a series of crimes committed by a former president and now president elect, who is a serial fraud and known notoriously for his criminal misconduct and abuse of the justice system. And crimes that are all far more grievous and damning than anything Republicans could even fantasize about implicating Hunter Biden for.Not only that, but by comparison, Trump has committed more crimes and subsequent investigations were backed by clearer and more incriminating evidence.Critics argue that if Hunter wasn't the president's son, then he wouldn't be receiving such preferential treatment, but you've got that backwards. If it were not for his social status, he would have likely never been prosecuted in the first place.This is not just a flagrant false equivalence, but also a double standard.If you compare the situations of Hunter Biden and Donald Trump side by side, you should be able to conclude that the differences are extensive. Thinking that Hunter's pardon justifies even more immunities for Trump is absurd.Hell, prior to this pardon, I wasn't trying to justify it by pointing to the rampant cronyism and favoritism that Trump legitimized after he pardoned several corrupt allies and co-conspirators, some of which he's welcomed back into his inner circle.Additionally, Hunter isn't being offered a pardon/impunity as a former president, nor as a president elect who can now feel exempt from the law and more comfortable knowing that he will likely not be held accountable for any future corruption and misconduct.Biden argued that raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice\\"But Trump uses this exact same language to describe the countless indictments, investigations, and lawsuits against *him*. All of which were warranted to some degree. Donald Trump has not only been exploiting his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system throughout his entire life, while evading accountability for his crimes and misconduct, but even as president, he used his executive privilege to avoid being incriminated for his blatant and frequent attempts to obstruct justice.Since then, he has been granted broad immunities by a kowtowing group of loyalists, immunities and privileges he has used to obstruct and delay the legal process.Trump has also made a number of unconstitutional threats against his political opponents and adversaries, warning them that he intends to abuse his power as president to seek retribution against them. This is a man who has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases as well, many of which illustrate his penchant for fraud, coercion, elusiveness and corruption.Trump has literally been charged with \\"defrauding the United States,\\" with conspiring to overturn an election, with disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans, with intimidating election officials into manipulating the vote for him, with attempting to install loyalists into positions of power within agencies like the DOJ, where they can help *him* steal the election. All of which Trump has been able to avoid convictions for due to his recent election win and his exploitation of the justice system. By contrast, Hunter was charged and actually convicted of lying on a gun form... He was also charged for not paying his taxes, while prosecutors thought it would be difficult to convict someone for tax evasion after they've already paid their taxes back.Trump has established himself as an infamous and serial cheater. He cheats on his wives, he cheats on his taxes, he lies about his wealth and the value of his properties, he even cheats at golf...And despite all this, when Joe Biden offers his son a pardon, after he was maligned for years, humiliated and scandalized, investigated by Congress, special counsel, and by the DOJ... after he became the target of relentless partisan inquiries and committee hearings, after the public harassment, the political scrutiny, the Media smear campaigns, all of which amounted to a waste of time, but eventually ended in him being prosecuted for a crime that most Americans get away with every year, a prosecution that even authorities on the matter have called highly unusual, after all of this, Donald Trump should be granted yet another immunity claim? Should be held to an even lower standard? Face less accountability?This is just like what happened during Harris's campaign. Because Donald Trump is a notorious and serial shitstirrer, because his absurdity has magically rendered him benign, because corruption, malfeasance, cronyism, obstruction of justice, the endless incoherent ramblings and emotional tirades at rallies, public events, during interviews, press conferences, via TruthSocial, etc, because his violent rhetoric and unconstitutional threats are just another day for Donald Trump, we've practically sane washed and normalized his misconduct.So the bar for Trump remains perpetually low, while his opponents are held to such a high standard that they're expected to be irreproachable by comparison.","title":"Of Course Joe Biden Was Right to Pardon His Son"},{"text":"The whole world is run by a network of NGOs, think-tanks, special interest groups, etc and most of these are controlled by wealthy oligarchs for the purposes of remaking society through propaganda, burdensome taxes, regime change wars, immigration, etc.Trying to unwind these nebulous web is nearly impossible for regular people.

You cited a study relating to white kids checking off their identity as Native American for college admission purposes at a rate of 34%. Are you trying to say this is emblematic of the population and college admissions at large? If you are, thats idiotic and the math doesnt support that at all. Native Americans make up roughly 1.2/1.3% of the population and according to the DOE and other non profits, are an under represented population in post-secondary education, with universities reporting that only .6% of college students nationally identified themselves as Native American during the admissions process (SOURCE: https://pnpi.org/factsheets/native-american-students/ ). If so many white kids are pretending to be native, that number would be bigger than their percent of the population, no?  That link, and your point, is wrong.

All this while thieves and violent criminals have lenient or little consequences. Still, I agree that insurance companies are scammy and are the reason rates are ridiculously so high due to price gouging. There's no reason a person in good health that never uses the insurance shouldn't get a portion of what they pay back as a refund and medical costs need to be more reasonable and possible to afford out of pocket, not put people further into debt. Another issue is that middle class always get screwed because their incomes are \\"too high\\" to qualify for affordable care and don't make enough to pay for the decent health care premiums. While the rich can afford to pay these premiums and the poor get it for free. This definitely needs to be addressed, but not by murdering someone.","title":"The Left's Ghoulish Death Cult Is Celebrating Murder of Health Care CEO, Calling for More Assassinations"},{"text":"Social engineering started in the late 70s","title":"Why does the left hate single family homes?"},{"text":"This jagoff crossed that line a long time ago.","title":"Obama, in 1st remarks since election, says 'a line has been crossed' if 'one side' makes certain moves"},{"text":"Or people are stocking up before the hammer falls this spring.","title":"Republican Consumers Absolutely Giddy About an Economy and Inflation That They Derided Just a Few Months Ago.

They have now removed any doubt: they are going after ALL firearms. I expect that sending people door to door, drastically increases the risk of violence. At this point, anyone going door to door must understand: they are taking their lives in their hands.I'm not saying I agree with this perspective. I am however saying that Canadians have a very long history of peaceful and quiet non-compliance with bad gun laws, and that given the current state of affairs, the economy, and the world attempting to physically remove firearms from Canadians will result in violence, in my opinion. The vast majority of course will simply bury them until better times; civil disobedience is a completely rational response to bad law.The thing about laws is this: when you use the law to punish peaceful, law abiding citizens for the crimes of violent criminals, it creates a wider disrespect for the law. When the most law abiding of all citizens lose any respect for the law, and there is no one left who respects the law, the law creates a society which widely respects the outlaw. The people will be very proud to resist and hide their property.Trudeau is the greatest gun salesman that Canada has ever seen, he is currently architecting the largest black market in firearms that Canada has ever seen. This is a simple fact. Every time he flaps his lips, guns fly off the shelves, Canadians have emptied every remaining gun store as we speak.Canadians are a quiet and gentle people, they are very slow to anger and even slower to act, but the anger in the community has been building and growing, slowly and quietly. Going door to door might be all it takes for that dam to burst.Again, I'm not saying I agree with it personally: but I totally understand it. It's not surprising; in fact, it's quite predictable.It almost seems as if this is what Trudeau wants.","title":"Liberals ban hundreds more types of firearms, look to send prohibited guns to Ukraine."},{"text":"Trudeau keeps it up, Trump just might ??","title":"Trudeau Liberals expand gun grab, adding 324 new models to ban list.

Things ARE good. We have great medicine, improved quality of life, extended life spans, crazy cool tech, etc. I was optimistic and always believed society would progress towards a star trek like egalitarian future free from restraints of resource limitations.

I fear we are at the beginning of the end now.We had a chance to do that. We were really close. People willingly chose destruction instead in hopes of their personal tribes being the leaders, they listened to the lies and manipulation of billionaires, corporations, religious leaders and dictators.With the second election of DJT, the widespread misinformation and intentional disinformation, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, AI finally getting legs we are seeing the global powerful taking actions that will suppress humanity in a one way path that will fracture us into the elect few in the ivory tower and the hoards with nothing but clinging to their caveman moralities forever until we die out.In the past the wealthy NEEDED the mass's labor to support the kings and queens and priests and gentry. Technology has broken that chain. They will have learned from their mistakes and will slowly convince the stupidest among us more and more convincingly that \\"others\\" are the problem and \\"they\\" are the chosen ones.

Insurance companies still need customers to pay premiums. If you deny too many claims, people don't buy your insurance policy.\\nThe wrinkle in the American Healthcare market is that most people have their insurance subsidized heavily *by their employer*. So you can either get the employer healthcare that costs $200 a month or get your own individual plan that costs $600 a month. And so people go with the employer plan. Which means that the customer the Insurance Company is catering to and selling their services to isn't the patient who actually uses the services. It's their employer.\\nThis changes the incentive structure quite a bit. Since they don't have to sell directly to individuals, they just have to sell to large organizations. Individuals have a much greater response to worst case scenarios than organizations do. If you tell an individual \\"you can get this insurance that costs $200 but if you get cancer, you're fucked. Or get this one that costs $300 and it'll cover cancer\\" they'll likely choose the?option that covers the expensive treatment theyre worried about. But if you tell an organization \\"if you spend $200 million a year on premiums, we'll cover 95% of your claims, or you can spend $300 million a year and we'll cover 96% of your claims\\" they'll likely choose the cheaper option.\\nNote, even with that, if the insurance paid 0 claims even the most penny pinching organization would tell them to go fuck themselves and find a different health insurer.\\nSo they aren't incentivized to pay zero claims. They are incentivized to pay just enough claims so that corporate beancounters feel like the service is worth the premiums being paid.","title":"Is shareholder primacy in a health insurance company a de-facto market failure?"},{"text":"Yes.

Not credible and likely biased.Your second link is article one of a two article series. Your fouth link is part two.Your third link doesn't seem to cite Biden-era policies as a source of inflation: As the labor market tightened during 2021 and 2022, core inflation rose as the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment increased. This ratio is used to measure wage pressures that then pass through to the prices for goods and services. As workers bargain for better pay, firms begin to increase prices. So, from this research, the authors find that three main components explain the rise in inflation since 2020: volatility of energy prices, backlogs of work orders for goods and service caused by supply chain issues due to COVID-19, and price changes in the auto-related industries.It's worth noting, however, that [during Biden's presidency, the federal reserve made specific moves to handle the labor market](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/27/1113494056/fed-interest-rate-hike-july-meeting): \\"The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high,\\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference, where he explained the \\"unusually large\\" move up in rates.\\n \\n He and his colleagues are trying to fight inflation by tackling demand. They are pushing up the cost of of credit  what consumers and companies pay to borrow money  and they are trying to deal with a jobs market the Fed chair has called \\"unsustainably hot,\\" where wages are rising fast because many businesses are paying more to find workers.Your fourth link seems to indicate *Trump*-era policies as a source of inflation while indicating Biden-era policies were a correction of course: At the onset of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve adopted an accommodative policy stance to support the economy. Notably, the Federal Reserve dropped the target for the federal funds rate to near zero, opened a series of temporary liquidity facilities and resumed its program of large-asset purchases. As high inflation proved persistent over 2021, the Federal Reserve switched to a contractionary monetary policy designed to bring inflation down to its target. The process of tapering asset purchases started in September 2021, and the federal funds rate was raised off zero in March 2022.Save for a presumably biased paper, none of your evidence seems to support your claim. In fact, it seems to support the point you're arguing against and further suggest Trump-era policy contributed to inflation.Edit: Aaand they immediately blocked and downvoted me.

White platoons were often sent into combat first, because they were viewed as superior to the colored platoons.","title":"Judge upholds U.S. Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions program"},{"text":"DJT?\\nyou harm a single hair on an American soldier in Afghanistan before the withdraw date,? deal is off?\\nlays a picture of the Taliban leader's home on the table and walks away after saying that.?","title":"Obama, in 1st remarks since election, says 'a line has been crossed' if 'one side' makes certain moves"},{"text":" As of May 13, 2021, there were 55,012 confirmed COVID-19 related deaths reported in South Africa.In a population of 60 million.

As far as flirting with the desk clerk?  Yes, I absolutely can see that.  i left home at 18 to travel around, and worked temp jobs at a number of hotels, and hostelsespecially overseas, where I was able to work 2-3 hours for a free bed for the night.  Sometimes I did office work or cleaning, but most often worked the front desk, where I was hit on at least 10-20 times per shift, at minimum.  And thats pretty normal.  After all, when guys are away from home, by themselves, a lot of them are looking for go out with.  Its also how I first met my husband.  Considering that what he was planning on doing would probably not end well, why not have one last fling first?  I would. \\n \\nStory time:\\n  \\nOne day, I was doing office work at a hotel, where I also worked the front desk to relieve the clerks when they went on lunch, and checked in a couple of nice young guys who were flirting me up like crazy, asking when I got off work, and show them around.  They were nice, and looking fine.  I was considering it.  Then I went out to lunch, but when I tried to come back, I couldnt get into my office, because it had been invaded by an entire SWAT team.  So I went over to housekeeping, where they told me there had been a bank robbery 50 miles away.  But the cops had been able to obtain a photo of the getaway vehicle with the license plate number, which they out in the news on local TV, and someone had spotted that car in the parking lot of our hotel.   To get away from all that, I decided to play a few games in the video gaming room, where I ran into those same 2 nice young guys I had checked in and challenged them to a game.  I was deep in concentration mode, when the SWAT team burst in and threw all 3 of us up against the wall.  Even worse, they had to drag me off that gaming machine, kicking and screaming at them for ruining my game.  Fortunately though, some of the local cops were there.  They knew who I was and that I worked there (yeah, cops like to hit on desk clerks too), and along with the fact I had been working during the time the robbery had taken place, they released me.  i was pretty upset, so the manager let me take the rest of the day off.  I walked out the door of that hotel, right into all the news cameras and reporters!  They already knew I was one who checked in those bank robbers, and was with them during the arrest.  Worse yet, I was still basically in shock, and instead of keeping my mouth shut, I was dumb enough to make a complete fool of myself, ranting and raving about how SWAT had ruined my game, right in the middle of achieving my highest score everwhile I still had all my lives! So I got to relive my humiliation, on the local news, every day, for the rest of the week, and Im just glad that story didnt make it into national news.

In fact, it makes it easier to bring those individuals to testify under oath because they are no longer protected by their 5th amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.  If they do not cooperate, they can be held in contempt of court or Congress.This is hardly a \\"mercy pardon\\" so that these individuals are no longer targeted for investigation.  All it gives them is a free pass if Congress or the DOJ turn up evidence of a crime.  So, in order for this pardon to have any value, it must be connected with actions that could, reasonably, be the basis for a criminal prosecution.So, maybe Biden should disclose what he thinks would be the basis of a criminal prosecution for this very unique group of individuals.  What could General Milley have done during his tenure that would have resulted in a criminal prosecution?  Lie under oath?  Give a foreign government classified information? Did Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney violate the law during their January 6th investigations?  For the life of me, I can't think why they would be included.  They were sitting members of Congress during that investigation and protected by their own immunity from prosecution for official acts.  In fact, floating these pardons almost guarantees Congressional investigations, internal auditor investigations, and probably DOJ investigations for anyone you may have participated but are not given the benefit of a presidential pardon.  My guess is they either made a mistake discussing this and are now hoping it all goes away if they stay silent, or they are aware of serious crimes committed and feel the actual need to protect these people.  If the pardons are made, my money is on the existence of some serious crimes.","title":"Trumps F.B.I. Pick Has an Enemies List.

The left-right political spectrum isn't exactly a new or a niche concept.Also \\"liberal\\" is incorrectly used in the context you are describing. American conservatives are also liberal.They're not though. In the US, the left-wing is liberal, the right-wing is conservative.Both sides arose from classical liberalism (individual liberty, limited government, free markets, rule of law), but have since evolved in their own directions. Modern American conservatism goes in the direction of limited government influence (ironic, given the state of affairs) and a highly individualistic approach to everything. It focuses a lot more on traditional social values. Socially they're not liberal at all.Modern American liberalism dials it back a little and focuses more on the rights of the individual. In general it's a lot more progressive and socially liberal.In the context of American politics, 'liberal' doesn't point to classical liberalism but rather modern/social liberalism.

Now this is stupid and completely false, but that's how the public sees modern American politics.

Like, my country is currently run by what is considered a far right party. They're called that because they heavily oppose (muslim) immigration. However, if you look at their domestic policies, they have a lot of similarities with our left wing parties but apparently in this case that doesn't matter for their designation.But using your ideologies: are they authoritarian or not? Depends on the subject, they're very authoritarian on some issues (most notably on how to handle immigration) and not at all for others. I really wouldn't be able to say where on that axis they would land. And that's using my personal definition of 'authoritarian' which might not be the same as yours. You could argue that there's some textbook definition of what 'authoritarian' means, but if people don't know/use that specific definition and instead use their own, which many do, the vagueness of the term isn't solved. And even when using the same definition, you still can't really quantify 'how authoritarian' a party/person is. At best you can compare them to others, but that will always be relative. This goes for the other ideologies as well.If you really wanted some accurate political party graph, you'd need many more axes other than the two or at best three that most people seem to use. That would be pretty hard to draw though, since we only have three visible dimensions.The same goes for people. Even if we say that parties exist on some axis, people are not their political party. I've yet to find any person who completely agrees on everything with the party that they vote for. For example, two people who consider themselves 'liberals' might still not agree at all on a whole range of subjects. That gets even worse when you start comparing liberals across countries.In conclusion, I don't believe that 'centrist' is inherently more vague than the other designations. For me, centrists are parties/people who align with the left on some issues, and with the right on others (whatever that means).","title":"CMV: \\"Centrist\\" is a meaningless political label"},{"text":"No, he sure didnt.

The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice; at the most, an occasional whispered word.

Its not just mistakes or nitpicks.  Americans vote Republican, or choose not to vote at all. Because they want change. Theyve seen for decades that their cost of living is going up without seeing an increase in their share of the wealth. The status quo is a bigger perceived threat to them because theyve been concretely and observably harmed by it and been unable to find either side willing to do much about it. So if theyre dissatisfied with the status quo, regardless of party, they tend to switch to the other. Also, Democrats have a harder job because theyre trying to say that government can work.

If your core beliefs generally include things like civil liberties, individual rights, free enterprise, etc, then you are a liberal end up with some views shared with the Democrats, some views shared with the RepublicansOk so then they are a liberal. The Democrats are neoliberals and classic Republicans are basically classical liberals. Although the MAGA party is maybe a bit different, although it seems like most of their voters don't actually support the specific things that makes Trump illiberal (e.g. his autocratic tendencies)ultimately I think \\"centrists are low information voters\\" is a bizarre conclusionThat's not what I actually said. I said that it can be hard to define what low information voters are because they are so ignorant about politics, so \\"centrist\\" is an easy label to apply to them in practical terms. I also said that if you actually grilled them on what they believed in then you could determine their actual ideology, but for practical purposes it's convenient to just call them \\"centrist\\"Anyway, based on your comment it seems like you don't have that much understanding of political ideologies and you view everything purely based on the platforms of American political parties. I can just tell you that both parties in the US are liberals, and your definition of a \\"centrist\\" is basically just a neoliberal","title":"CMV: \\"Centrist\\" is a meaningless political label"},{"text":"This doesnt get to the heart of the issue though. I dont think many people are saying just those in Dem cities are mad about Dem governance, but that *everyone* perceives Dem cities to be poorly run and that in influence the vote (i.e, even rural voters perceive Dem cities to be poorly run so they dont trust Dem leadership; they dont have to actually live in the city to have this perception). The article seems to be ignoring this argument and is instead framing it as if only those that live in Dem cities are able to be frustrated with Dem leadership, when its just not the case.Their dismissal of analyzing crime is similarly bunk in my opinion; it shouldnt just be comparing crime data vs voting, it should be comparing *the perception of crime* with voting (i.e., if people perceive Dem policies to lead to more crime in Dem cities (which it has), then they wont trust Dem leadership). You dont need to have complete data on crime statistics to get a gauge of peoples perception, and those perceptions ultimately matter more than the actual statistics.","title":"Is the Urban Shift Toward Trump Really About Democratic Cities in Disarray?"},{"text":"Yes comrade we must only consume our government approved memes and joke skits ??.

Those voters truly reliably show up and vote. Then there's a segment of the GOP voting base who just believe in the GOP.  They probably watch fox news, but they're not reliable voters like the motivated ones.   But fox news has told them Trump just isn't really a threat.   And fox news is something the democrats don't have.  Fox news successfully changes people's opinions at a rate none of the other news sources do.  And Trump shows them he will fight for what he wants; no convention or rule will constrain him.  That makes them believe in him.Democrats don't have a large enough motivated segment like the GOP has.   The fears Trump speaks to are primal.  Without becoming Trump to MOVE voters, and having a Fox news, it's really difficult to defeat Trump.   No one *loves* the government \\"machine\\".  We accept it, because it's a product of compromise and because it's what the rules we agreed to produced.    And no one on the democratic side is saying they'll tear the machine asunder to achieve their goals, so Democratic candidates do not inspire voters like the ones taken in by Trump's demagoguery.   He's selling lies to his voters, but he's made a great show of it.I'm really not sure how we fight it.  The best I hope for is that Trump doesn't manage to do TOO much damage in the coming term and the GOP then cannot dig up another candidate who can replicate Trump's appeal, at which point we can win against candidates who are more conventional.","title":"Do Democrats need to moderate to win  or would that be a terrible mistake?"},{"text":"He dropped out after the Uncommitted campaign had significant numbers in multiple primaries, and his disaster of a debate performance made it clear he was too old for the damn job.

Centrists tend to be more pragmatic and have opinions that change based on the actual details of the problem.Which is irrelevant, they still fall into the category of some ideology depending what culture they are from. If they are from the US, they are still most likely within the category of liberalism (i.e. they generally believe in things like civil liberties, individual rights, free enterprise, etc). That's all part of an ideology. People who think they don't have an ideology are just ignorant as to what in ideology is.","title":"CMV: \\"Centrist\\" is a meaningless political label"},{"text":"This is a great list:- Appoint key regulatory heads (some of whom have statutory anti-removal protections)- Confirm Biden's nominees (75 awaiting that right now)- Fill judicial vacancies (dozens of federal judges are needed, Biden's close to confirming as many as Trump did in his first term, Trump confirmed a lot of them during the lame-duck period)- Disclose key information (like FOIAs that are outstanding, since Trump will likely make government less transparent, as with his first term)It's a thoughtful article that I hope we'll see mirrored in the work of the Senate in particular, which is still in Democratic control until Jan. 3.

Don't know know [how the Syrian Civil War started](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/15/middleeast/daraa-syria-seven-years-on-intl/index.html), do you?  Instead of flooding a drought stricken nation with food and water, Obama flooded it with guns, knowing full well they would end up in the hands of groups such as ISIS and Al Queda Affiliated who would make his demand of Assad stepping down in reality a call for essentially an ISIS takeover of Syria. The 2011 FSA wasn't ISIS nor was affiliated with Al Quida. The YPG/SDF folks that we actually armed were certainly not ISIS.What do you think the effect of Assad turning loose all radical Islamists in his prison had on the war?  Whats happening now isnt a new war. Its more of the same wara different phase and you may be right about the groups being more moderate but from what Ive read Im not optimistic about that. Seems to me its give or take going to Obamas planarm a bunch of guys he wouldnt actually let defeat Assad cause hed consider them worse and then create a bloody mess through those guys fighting AssadI'd argue it's quite the opposite. The 2011 FSA was far more moderate than today's HTF. But Obama was tired any US involvement in the region and decided to do more or less nothing to back the FSA. To the extent we were involved in the conflict, we were largely backing kurdish groups that were fighting ISIS and Obama's successor later pulled that support after the defeat of ISIS as its own entity.  Ultimately though its all Obamas choice (and plan) in flooding the country with guns and bombs rather than food and water after a drought. He saw thirsty kids and started a war rather than give them water. Thats Obama. Now? I dunno what to do other than scream cease fire at these violent armed child hating losers over thereUltimately Obama didn't do shit about Assad. He laid out a red line, and then ignored it. Perhaps in that way you're right, it is Obama's fault. You got your wish, the millions displaced and hundreds of thousands killed are the indirect result of your deserted isolationist policy regarding Assad. Had we had President McCain and a full support of the FSA in 2011 it would have turned out differently.","title":"CMV: Writing off the Syrian Rebels as 'Jihadist terrorists' plays into Russia's hands and will help whitewash retaliatory war crimes in the coming months as it did in 2016."},{"text":"At the risk of getting down voted to oblivion, Im one of a few that thinks he probably shouldnt issue any preemptive pardons.

Theyve managed to align user trust with user engagement, and in turn reward that trust by producing more well-researched and high-quality content.People will seek out and engage with serious, reputable sources, even when its all free, as long as those sources prove themselves reliable.

I know several billionaires but most of the people I deal with are in the 9 figure range of monetary portfolios.Becoming a billionaire is something someone has to want to achieve.  It's not a simple biproduct of investment and return.  Very few billionaires are so without their absolute willingness and desire to be.  Why?That level of wealth has circles.  You absolutely cannot become a billionaire without being in a circle.  That is a political circle, an investment circle or a wealth circle.  A political circle is where lobbying occurs and business is given.  An investment circle is like the incubators in silicone valley or the insider trading that happens in conjunction with political circles.  Wealth circles are just that and how I managed to get my foot in the door to making my own success. Someone has to let you in first.  This is true in every single environment.  Mark Zuckerberg wasn't self made.  Peter Thiel invested in him to promote Facebook.  That is an investment circle.  Without him and his network it wouldn't exist.     So why are billionaires bad?The entire system is an engine.  The middle class are the fuel and the upper/elite class are the engine itself and have access to all of that power.  This power permeates through every single level of our world.  Media creates the idea to the middle class of scarcity when in reality there's so much money in the world you can't even fathom it.  Politicians pass bills and rig systems where they're paid through lobbies and after service speaking fees that can be 7 figures for a 30 minute speech.  The system is designed to manipulate, control and maintain that power struggle and wealth gap.  The greatest example of this is corporate welfare where billionaires are given fuel (tax payer funds) for performing poorly and pay out their shareholders and executives bonuses while limiting their restructuring.  Billionaires have 100 ways to never pay taxes and live a life you cannot imagine by simply borrowing against their arguably corrupt ascending assets.  The old addage of pay an artist $100,000.00 for a painting and then sell it for $10,000,000.00 to your portfolio and borrow against eliminating cap gains creates an artificial demand and desire for something common.  Donating to a charity who lobbies government for your interests due to their access via \\"charitable status\\" is something we like to joke about.  Start a company and nobody cares to talk to you.  Start at charity and you can speak to the CEO of any company quite quickly if you have the right connections.The primary toxin as you can see in all of this is: Government.  It's not for the people.  It creates legislature to further enslave and promote the wealth gap and takes power from personal autonomy giving it to those who have the privilege of being able to afford the work arounds.TLDR: Billionaires are chosen by a corrupt system that utilizes questionably earned government funds and illicit insider trading derived income sources initially to promote those inside of private exclusionary hierarchies they deem worthy of the title.  Billionaires must \\"play ball\\" to maintain their status.","title":"Why are billionaires bad?"},{"text":"Yeah, they do. Because either rule of law is respected or it isn't.

Theres something structural happening to the electorate that I think makes Democratic moderation less and less effective.  Thats not to say that I think that if you ran a DSA [Democratic Socialists of America] candidate in a congressional district in Nebraska  on economic populism  that that candidate would do better than moderate candidates. Its not what Im saying at all.  But I do think that the electoral record of the past, lets say, 20 or so years of running disciplined moderates in places that are tough for Democrats seems to be less and less effective. And I think overall, when we look at this presidential campaign, I mean, there was this extraordinarily disciplined tack to the center by Harris. She did, I think, all of the right things that you would expect or want a candidate to do running for a general election if you are a kind of mainstream political consultant.  She took the anxieties that people had about social progressivism after 2020 seriously, and shaped her campaign in a way that they thought would circumvent some of the impact of those positions.  And it didnt really work.Really good article. Its one of the more nuanced and level-headed takes on what went wrong.TL;DR Dems losing the working class narrative has been a process that went on for decades, and all factions of the party have to reconsider their approach to building broad appeal.

Right now, projections are red states gaining 11 to 12 seats and blue states losing 11-12 seats. Let's assume some will have to come from currently red areas and some will move to mostly blue parts of states and be conservative with our numbers to get R+12 in every HoR going forward (on average).If they somehow manage to remove non-citizens from the count nationwide via Supreme Court decision (it will ultimately come down to this), it's going to make the democrat party a minority party going forward that will probably *only* be capable of winning the senate and never the HoR or presidency. And no, I'm not exaggerating here. Look at the data:[https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R41636.pdf](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R41636.pdf)I didn't find anything more recent, but if you scroll down to pages 17 and beyond, you will see charts on how many seats would be lost if non-citizens were counted based on 2013 numbers (which had less non-citizens in our nation than we do now). It shows:California - 4  \\nFlorida - 1  \\nLouisiana +1  \\nMissouri +1  \\nMontana +1  \\nNew York -1  \\nNorth Carolina +1  \\nOhio +1  \\nOklahoma +1  \\nTexas -1  \\nVirginia +1So red states get +4 and blue states get -4 with that, or a net difference of 8.Combine both things for the 2030 Census and you've got republicans roughly +30 to +34 net gains in both HoR and Electoral Votes. This would essentially guarantee either permanent republican control of the HoR or a razor thin democrat margin dominated by moderates.

If pre-pardons are actually a thing that can protect these people, who cares what MAGA thinks? If Biden doesnt pre-pardon, it should be because he cant, not because the optics will look bad. Realistically, I think Trump will order his political enemies arrested and jailed regardless, so pardons are probably a moot point. It will come down to whether the people below Trump will follow unlawful orders or not. I fear the SCOTUS ruling that presidents have immunity for all official acts will allow Trump to order illegal arrests (officially, so hes immune), then pardon those below him who carry them out.

Biden Should Pardon Everyone on It. (Gift Article)"},{"text":"I disagree, as much as I wish it was that simple.Firstly, I think the practice of paywalling has come to create the *illusion* of quality being hidden, rather than actual quality. Many of the \\"respectable\\" outlets we think of as traditional news sources all have, if you look back far enough, numerous cases in which they willfully and knowingly violated the standards of journalistic integrity to either sell more, get better ratings, or please their owners and their friends. In fact, the term, \\"Yellow Journalism\\", which would now be referred to as \\"clickbait\\", was coined back in the 1800s. Many would argue that it contributed to the Spanish- American War happening and severely distorted the average American's understanding of the war and the circumstances surrounding it. And, don't forget that before the term \\"clickbait\\" was even invented, tabloids like *The National Enquirer* or shows like *TMZ* regularly promoted overblown drama or outright falsehoods for the exact same reason.Secondly, I'm not so sure people would just jump on higher- quality content even if it was free. Thoughtful, carefully- written articles are not usually \\"sexy.\\" **Scientists discover that chocolate can cure cancer** is much \\"punchier\\" than **New study on antioxidants present in cacao shows slightly reduced incidence of intestinal cancer**. More than that, these articles require you to take time to read and comprehend them, rather than letting you quickly fly through them in five minutes and then write a 150- character Tweet about it. Just look at Youtube; you have hundreds, if not thousands, of channels with thoughtful, well- researched informative content, but the most \\"liked\\" and most- viewed videos are still going to be clips of SSSSniperwolf staring slack- jawed at someone else's content or a tabloid- esque \\"breaking news\\" video on Youtube Shorts.I would argue that if anything, the current trends you brought up are a product of companies recognizing this and then splitting up their customers into two group: the \\"clickbait\\" crowd that brings them loads of advertising money by gobbling up and sharing shitty \\"free\\" articles, and those more interested in actual news, who they squeeze as much as they possibly can by turning their \\"quality\\" articles into paid subscriptions.","title":"CMV: Paywalls are destroying the web and fueling misinformation."},{"text":"Yeah, which would mean if it was an inside job, they must have had a HUGE reason to want him taken out if they are willing to risk more violence being committed against them.","title":"The shooter of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson wrote deny defend depose on the shell casings left at the scene, ABC News reports."},{"text":"Its not whataboutism.

If she did message on those at some point, it did not stick with her overall campaign message. What I saw from Kamala was running on tax incentives and credits for the middle class, families, and small businesses. Housing purchase assistance, building new homes, and going after corporations buying up all houses. Restoration of Roe v Wade. And somewhat but less to her core message going after price gougers and corporate greed. Now all of this is great! Dont get me wrong, I think economists are right that these initiatives would all help grow the economy and help the middle class. I just dont think these speak to most Americans working paycheck to paycheck. With the exception of returning Roe, none of these are simple solutions. None of these are tag lines. Even if I know progressive Dems keep submitting a bill to raise the minimum wage, most dont know that or that republicans have blocked it for the last 4 years. Thats why its an important campaign message. Kamala also turned heel on the border messaging, fracking and oil production, and guns (less so this last one, but the I have a Glock is memorable) - but these seem antithetical to overall Dem messaging and actions. Even if Biden did tighten the border in the last year or has had the highest oil production under him, those are key to Dems messaging the last 8 years so it looks disingenuous at best and flip flopping at worst.","title":"Democrats need to take the working class seriously and literally"},{"text":"Love Bernie!!

The left doesn't hate single family homes, they hate the *requirement* for single family homes. You seem to have a misunderstanding regarding the goals to allow for more multi-family housing, and even who is preventing it from happening. I'm not a leftist, but I am a transportation planner, so many of these issues overlap with the work I do. I'm also a libertarian, so very free market oriented but live in a big city that has lots of zoning restrictions and red tape when it comes to building new homes. I, and the leftists that agree with me on this issue, could broadly be called YIMBYs (Yes, in my back yard) as opposed to NIMBYs (Not in my backyard). Robert Reich is an example of the latter, which I'll describe below.Current housing policy restricts multi family housing in many large cities. For example, in San Francisco there are neighborhoods next to transit stations where there SHOULD be apartments, but regulations make it next to impossible to build them. Many of these areas are zoned for single family homes only or there are other minimum lot requirements, parking minimums, etc. that make it so you can't build housing as densely as the market demands. Or using historic preservation or excessive environmental review are used as an excuse to block new construction or make it prohibitively expensive. YIMBYs want to get rid of these regulations to allow for increased density. Building new homes, even smaller homes, means housing becomes more affordable which is one of the key goals. However, if you live in an outer lying area of a city or a rural area, yeah, makes sense to have a SFH and no one wants to take that away from you.Also note, that this isn't as much of a left-right battle as it is left vs. left. Who are the people that live in these expensive single family homes in big blue cities? Typically entrenched, wealthy leftists who and can afford the status quo. So they use their political power to keep the regulations in place. [For example, leftist blowhard Robert Reich, who lobbied the landmarks commission to protect a dilapidated building in his Berkeley neighborhood in hopes of preventing high density housing from being built.](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2020/08/07/landmarking-fails-for-130-year-old-berkeley-house-in-passionate-debate-over-housing-and-history)","title":"Why does the left hate single family homes?"},{"text":"Maybe if he actually drained the swamp instead of filling it with mosquitoes.... we'd be cheering for him instead.

You may be confusing future *acts*, which cannot be pardoned, with future *prosecutions*, which can. In fact, the most famous pardon in US history -- Ford's pardon of Nixon -- was for all offenses he \\"has committed or may have committed\\" during his presidency, even though Nixon had not been formally charged with any crimes. Here's the pertinent text of Nixon's pardon:\\"Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, *has committed or may have committed or taken part in* during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974.\\" (Emphasis added).The text of Hunter Biden's pardon is similar:*For those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in* during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024, including but not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David C. Weiss in Docket No. 1:23-cr-00061-MN in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Docket No. 2:23-CR-00599-MCS-1 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. (Emphasis added).If there is binding legal authority to the contrary, I'm unaware of it. So, if the Biden and Nixon pardons are any indication, individuals can be pardoned for uncharged or even unknown crimes, as long as they occurred or were alleged to have occurred in the past.","title":"Trumps F.B.I.
