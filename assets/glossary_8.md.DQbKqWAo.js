And let's be real, the current system mainly benefits those already in power.Think about it like this: If your neighbor's house is on fire, and you say \\"I don't want to get involved, I'm neutral about fires,\\" you're not actually being neutral. You're passively letting the fire spread. Politics affects everything - from your student loans to healthcare costs to whether we'll have a habitable planet in 30 years.The \\"not voting for X is voting for Y\\" logic actually makes mathematical sense. In a two-party system, each vote for one candidate effectively cancels out a vote for the other. If you don't vote, you're reducing the total number of votes needed for either candidate to win by one. That's why not voting helps whoever ends up winning.I've seen what \\"staying out of politics\\" looks like in Seattle and Portland - it just lets extremists on both sides dominate the conversation while normal people check out. But guess what? Those extremists still end up making decisions that affect your life whether you participate or not.You wouldn't skip a jury duty summons just because both the prosecution and defense seem equally annoying, right?

However, I do think there is a kernel of truth in the idea that being apolitical is at least a little bit conservative, or at least privileges conservative political issues.Conservativism, broadly, is the preservation of the status quo. Liberal, progressive and left wing politics aim to change the status quo, which isn't going to just change by itself. Being apolitical (as in, not caring about politics and presumably not voting) certainly doesn't challenge the status quo in any way, and I'd wager that someone who doesn't care about or pay attention to politics is more or less accommodated to the status quo. By not voting and going along to get along without trying to change anything, the conservative status quo gets that much harder to change. For this reason, traditionally, lower-turnout elections have favored conservative parties and higher turnout favors liberals and progressives. (This is not necessarily true since the last few election cycles.) saying \\"not voting for Harris is basically voting for Trump\\" is flawed because someone else could just as easily say \\"not voting for Trump is basically voting for Harris\\".That doesn't seem flawed to me at all. It's a two-way race with each campaign competing for votes from a single pool of voters. Not voting for one candidate gives the other candidate some small mathematical advantage; multiply that by millions of votes and it adds up.","title":"CMV: Apolitical does not mean conservative"},{"text":"\\"Appears to.\\" A-fucking-ppears to?

It opposed antisemitism but also other forms of bigotry and discrimination. It's focus was more on opposing fascist thinking than lobbying for just Jewish interests.

In the midst of a heated political climate in which Jews split on both sides of support for current Israeli actions, it supports criminalization of protests against Israeli war strategy. That was bad enough.To that it's now added that we live in heated political times, so we should be reluctant to criticize the fascist symbolism of a powerful man who promotes actually antisemitic expression. It denies the obvious, that repeated fascist solutes are fascist. Why? Because it wants to keep support for Israeli policy and is willing to cozy up to Nazis to do it.I used to wonder why there were Jews who supported the Nazis in Germany.

Not caring about politics tends to cause someone to be conservative, because if you don't care about politics you won't think much about politics and won't learn much about politics. You'll tend to have a lot of unexamined biases and unpacked subconscious bigotry. And this tends to lead to conservatism, in the way that less educated people tend to be more conservative.A second is an analytic sense. Someone who doesn't care about politics generally does not care to act to change the status quo, which acts to conserve the status quo. If everyone didn't care about democratic politics, conservatives would basically get what they want. So being apolitical is conservative in this sense.A third sense is euphemistic. Many people who are conservatives and know they are conservatives claim to be apolitical and adopt a veneer of apoliticality to avoid having to reveal and defend their views. When a person who claims to be political eventually is revealed to have a political leaning, it's almost always a right-wing leaning.Put together, these things create a strong association between the apolitical and the right.","title":"CMV: Apolitical does not mean conservative"},{"text":"Also not who you asked, but for me it crystallized around the Iraq war.

You could very well end up in a situation where a radical and a somewhat-left candidate split much of that side's vote, but a less-popular-overall candidate on the Right unify his side and win the election. It's stupid, but let's say Trump really is the \\"cult leader\\" reddit says he is. So the system you want would have pretty much every Republican (what few never-Trumpers remain are mostly just grifters at this point, or certifiable) uniting in their vote for Trump but then Kamala and Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders and whoever else splitting the vote amongst themselves?This also enables parties to somewhat rig the vote like in France where the less-popular-overall side agrees to run only one candidate in a race against the other side which still splits their vote and you end up with the less-popular half winning all the seats in government.candidates such as Jill Stein and Chase Oliver would have had more chanceThey haven't effected policy at all nor even pushed a more-popular candidate to their views at all.","title":"Cmv: that USA should adopt preferential voting"},{"text":"The renaming stuff is hilarious LMFAO.

He was already pretty disliked due to his views on vaccines, so I don't think he would have won anyway. But that leads to my third point.The whole idea is to do away with the binary results. You can't say the winner won with a minority of the votes, because votes aren't counted as \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\".

Trump spent his cultural credibility to activate a siege on the Capitol. While there was an actual plan with lawyers (Kenneth Cheesebro) in which Vice President Mike Pence would use an alternate slate of electors to make Trump the President, it had been made clear that Mike Pence would not participate in the plan despite being crucial to it. So the logistics of it were doomed and yet the crowd was still unleashed. With what? Trump's cultural credibility, packed with emotional appeals. Had the crowd been properly informed that Pence, essential to the plan working, was unwilling to participate in it, how many would be willing to brawl with police like they did? It was not about logic, it was about that emotional cultural credibility.The thing about cultural credibility is if you misuse it then you need to rebuild it.

They were soldiers fighting for the New Model Army (the pro-Parliament army) against the Royalists army. They were the first faction in the War of the Three Kingdoms to propose killing King Charles I, and also plotted to assassinate him. In 1647, they published their vision for how England should be governed in a manifesto called The Agreement of the People.*The Agreement of the People* called for the vote to be given to almost all adult men, freedom of speech, religious liberty, protection against arbitrary imprisonment, for all people to be seen as equal in the eyes of the law, and for the law to enforce the prevention of centralised power. This document is the first time democracy in its current form was ever proposed.Their leaders included Thomas Rainborough; John Lilburne, who is frequently cited in US Supreme Court debates; Richard Overton; and William Walwyn.Its funny to note that one other group, called the Diggers, split off from them. The Diggers supported common ownership of the means of production and are now viewed as one of the first, if not the first, socialist movements.This manifesto was presented to the victorious Parliament after the First English Civil War was over. Debate raged about where England should go. It was eventually agreed that England would adopt the Agreement of the People manifesto as the basis of its new constitution.What actually ended up happening was that Thomas Rainborough was kidnapped and killed, allegedly - according to John Lilburne - by the Council of Officers, the commanders of the New Model Army, selected for being subservient to Oliver Cromwell. The Council of Officers then instructed the New Model Army to take part in a coup detat that allowed Oliver Cromwell to execute King Charles I and create a Puritan military junta with him as the Lord Protector of the Commonwealths of England, Scotland, and Ireland for life. The Agreement of the People did not become this Commonwealths constitution. Cromwell got his soldiers to round up and kill the Levellers more outspoken members (those who wouldve actually took part in a revolution), and John Lilburne, William Walwyn, and Richard Overton were imprisoned. John Locke, the father of liberalism whose ideas are what the Bill of Rights (1689) is based on, was strongly influenced by the Agreement of the People and the Levellers. A lot of the Levellers ideas, such as elected judiciaries, are also part of the Bill of Rights. Their ideas for democracy, particularly universal (male) suffrage, would find themselves influencing, if not outright becoming a part of, the USAs Bill of Rights a century later.","title":"Presidents Cant End Birthright Citizenship | President Trumps executive order is almost certain to be struck down."},{"text":"\\"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\\"Blackmarkets will always be with us.

But it still isn't obvious to me what problem this solves. I think that most people have the very understandable intuition that more parties means more choice and, thus, a healthier democracy. But I think that's something of an illusion. When you look at other FPTP systems that support more than two electoral viable parties, it's almost invariably the case that only two or three are politically potent. The rest exist on the political periphery, even if they're moderate in many respects. When you look at PR systems, they typically have many meaningful parties. But these parties don't rule alone. They enter coalitions to form governments. Many of these coalitions are very long-standing. In some cases, coaliton members may even have agreements to reduce electoral competition between them. A communist might prefer to vote for a communist candidate from a communist party. But, ultimately, his vote still probably just helps prop up a centre-left government.Republicans and Democrats aren't homogenous groups. They're each very broad coalitions that have unified their branding as a matter of practicality. I many US states, the real election is the party primary, not the general election. There may be structural reasons to dislike this arrangement, but I think that to a significant extent, the duopoly parties just internalize the interparty politics found elsewhere as factional politics within the party.","title":"Cmv: that USA should adopt preferential voting"},{"text":"Wait what ?!?

Ulbricht received a full and unconditional pardon by United States president Donald Trump on January 21, 2025.The site operated as a hidden service on the Tor network and facilitated the sale of narcotics and other illegal products and services. Ulbricht ran the site under the pseudonym \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\", after the fictional character from The Princess Bride.In October 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Ulbricht and took Silk Road offline. In 2015, he was convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the internet, conspiracy to distribute narcotics, conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to commit computer hacking. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Evidence that Ulbricht had commissioned murder-for-hire deals for at least five people was considered at his sentencing hearing, though he was not charged with this crime. Ulbricht's appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2017 and the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 were unsuccessful.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht","title":"Trump pardons Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht"},{"text":"The dildo of karma is rarely lubed.","title":"Trump revokes John Bolton's Secret Service detail amid Iranian death threats: former national security advisor"},{"text":"Couple things:In the context of what Trump and his dudes are trying to get rid of \\"birthright citizenship\\" is referring to jus soli citizenship which is based on the physical location of the birth.

After some \\"questioning\\" he admitted he was intending on moving to a different country and setting up a new seller account on this site. We don't take too kindly to thieves. He's gone.**Dread Pirate Roberts (Ross Ulbricht)**: Hi again R&amp;W, I hate to come to you with a problem when we are just starting to get to know one another, but Blake (FriendlyChemist) is causing me problems. Are you still looking for him or now that you've found Xin have you given up? I would like to put a bounty on his head if it's not too much trouble for you. What would be an adequate amount to motivate you to find him? Necessities like this do happen from time to time for a person in my position. I have others I can turn to, but it is always good to have options and you are close to the case right now. Hopefully this is something you are open to and can be another aspect of our business relationship. Regards, DPR**redandwhite:** \\"If I find his location, and you use it against him to scare him, there is a chance he will switch locations again. Speaking from experience, it will become a lot more difficult to find him again after that once he knows there are people capable of finding, him looking for him. Further, the people we use to do the recon are the hitter themselves. I don't think they will be interested in continuing looking for him if there will be a small sum to be split between them just to find his address. If you have your mind set on just finding his location, I can talk to them and get them to get it for you for a fee (not sure what amount as usually when we hunt someone, there is more involved after we find them). If you want to deal with him the other way, we can talk about that too, but price varies on the situation. If you want it to look like an accident, it would cost a lot more. It wouldn't be suspicious. He would just leave home one day and not return. If you don't care what it looks like, it would be cheaper than the accident. We use professionals and not street level hoodlums who always end up fucking things up. How much does he owe you and how much are you willing to pay? If there are funds retrieved, how much would we keep from what he has when we get him(if he has anything) ?\\"**Dread Pirate Roberts**: He doesn't owe me anything, but he is threatening to expose the identities of thousands of my clients that he was able to acquire working with Xin if I don't pay him off. As you don't take kindly to thieves, this kind of behavior is unforgivable to me. Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct. It doesn't have to be clean, and I don't think there are any funds to be retrieved.**redandwhite**: Price for clean is 300k+ USD Price for non-clean is 150-200k USD depending on how you want it done. These prices pay for 2 professional hitters including their travel expenses and work they put in. We can use out of town hitters if you want as well, but I would not suggest them because they come with an extra cost and you don't seem to care how he is taken care of. When would you like this done?**Dread Pirate Roberts**: Don't want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k. Are the prices you quoted the best you can do? I would like this done asap as he is talking about releasing the info on Monday....**redandwhite:** I received the payment. I appreciate the offer if bitcoins lower in value. We know where he is. He'll be grabbed tonight. I'll update you.**redandwhite:** Your problem has been taken care of. They seized a bunch of stuff he had with him at the time as well. They said he had a couple laptops and a bunch of usb sticks. Is there anything of that, that belongs to you? They questioned him and he spilled everything he knew. He said that he and Xin were actually working together on this scheme to blackmail you and that they were brought in by a 3rd guy who has been selling on here for a couple years who is a scam artist. Apparently he makes selling accounts, sells for a while and then pulls a big scam and he just keeps creating new accounts after he does his scams. They got that guys name also , I will give that to you free of charge when I meet them to get the picture and computer hardware they got. Rest easy though, because he won't be blackmailing anyone again. Ever.**Dread Pirate Roberts**: Excellent work. Please send any info you can get on this third party along with the picture.

(the only exception are two states, Maine and Nebraska, which split their votes as close to the popular vote in their state as possible, rounding in favor of the winner of the popular vote in their state) Then, whoever wins a simple majority (50%) of the *electoral* votes takes all.It's just a two-tiered winner takes all system that ends up being mathematically *less* democratic than a simple winner takes all system, as it allows for the minority candidate to win notably often, and (in theory) by ridiculous margins too.Preferential vote *is* more democratic because the more desirable candidate *overall* wins more often than in simple winner takes all. Sure, you may not get your *first* choice as often, but it's also far less likely you'll get your *last* choice. This also mitigates the *spoiler effect;* this effect is the reason why we only have two relevant parties (not because of lack of political literacy, nor because of third-party extremism, (which for the record gets moderated out by preferential voting) nor anything else) at a national level.In a winner takes all system, if you have two equally viable candidates on one side (let's say the Democrats split into parties A and B, and both parties ran a candidate) then that diminishes the odds of *both candidates*, since people who would be united behind the Democrat candidate otherwise are now divided among the two parties' candidates. Worst case, this leads to the vote having no clear winner and it going to a fallback. (which can either be 'another vote' or some other fallback method, like a vote in the legislature or something.) Best case, both A and B are likely to lose.In a preferential voting system, what would be the *worst case* under winner takes all becomes a win for either A or B, as B's voters likely prefer A to the alternatives and A's voters likely prefer B to the alternatives, as a general rule. This results in more people coming away from the vote happy with the outcome.That said, even preferential voting is not perfect, because a perfect democracy where the population's preferences are perfectly respected is [mathematically impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7ws2DF-zk).

Just look at RFK this election cycle. It's pretty clear that if RFK Jr. Had stayed in the race than Donald Trump would've lost. Donald Trump knew this and therefore had reason to negotiate a sort of peace agreement where RFK drops out of the race in return for Donald Trump giving him a cabient position. But RFK just wouldn't have been in a position to negotiate if the election used preferential voting, because then their'd be no way that him staying in the race would've effected the outcome. The libertarian party did a similar thing in 2022 where they agreed to not run canidates in congressional districts where a canidate from the Republican party agreed to endorse key parts of the Libertarian party agenda. So while ranked choice voting would empower more people to vote third party, it would do so at the expanse of completely defanging third parties.

If there's nobody to show them theyve been lied to, if theres nobody to teach them not to be assholes, there's just gonna be more assholes. Because lord knows i'd love to imagine i woulda snapped outta my upbringing by myself, but the reality is i did not. Friends walked me through it. My wife walked me through it. They took the time with me, i would be less of a man if i didn't at least attempt the same.","title":"Breaking Down Trumps Terrifying Flurry of Executive Orders"},{"text":"The audacity of them to just lie straight to our face about what we saw with our own eyes.

This process repeats until there's only a certain number of winners (usually one) remaining.It's mathematically more democratic than what we have right now.

It seems like the outcomes of the change would be to increase the likelihood of third-party candidates winning and, more significantly, to increase the value of the votes of third-party voters. Are either of these things actually desirable?My general experience is that third-party candidates are typically more likely to be extremists or weirdos, and their voters are skewed even harder in those directions. RFK Jr. was this elections leading third-party presidential candidate. Chase Oliver couldn't even secure his own party's endorsement. It isn't clear to me that we want these politicians to be more competitive.More importantly, it isn't clear to me that we want their supporters to wield disproportionate electoral power. Under the current system, gaining a vote from a third party is worth half as much to the duopoly candidates as gaining a vote from the other duopoly party. If you allow third-party voters to effectively cast two votes that stops being the case. It becomes important and perhaps even appealing for the Democrats and Republicans to pitch themselves to this crowd. I'm not sure I want third-party voters to become a potentially decisive force in national elections.

You don't have to stop thinking it, but taking every possible opportunity to say it isn't helpful. They're trolls for sure and it's a lot of fun to call them out on their bullshit, but they truly get rather upset about being called stupid (as every human does), and they shut down or double down on the bullshit as a result.Even if it's completely fake compassion, we have to bite our tongues and stop telling them they're stupid. It's like working with kids - if you repeatedly tell them they're stupid, whether they are or not, their behavior usually changes for the worse and becomes hateful and/or violent. But if you show them in a compassionate way, without getting visibly frustrated, how it should be and why, they start to open up.Take a look at what magats say when they're not directly talking about something a politician did - they want many of the same things we do. Lower prices, a fair chance, freedom to express themselves (yes sometimes their expressions are truly unacceptable, but it's fixable), and a decent living for honest work. They just want to get there in a much different way, in large part because they lack the education to see the nuance of the situation, regardless of which situation we're talking about. They also have a hard time with empathy for situations they haven't experienced. Again, in large part due to a lack of education (this is grossly oversimplified but I don't want to write a book here) and more importantly, a lack of exposure to people facing those situations.Some of these people are lost causes, and a lot of the ones we interact with on social media are bad actors or bots that deserve every gram of shit we throw at them, but that doesn't reflect the majority of them in real life, at least not in my experience. I've been around these people my entire life, and more have seen the light with simple compassion and patience than you might expect, but go back to their old ideals because they keep being told how stupid they or their friends are, or see random people they can empathize with out of experience on the internet being called stupid.Unfortunately this is never going to get any better because the left and the right love dunking on each other for internet points, but it's the first step if we want to initiate coming together against the ultra-wealthy and corporate conglomerates.

Our \\"[assessed contribution](https://open.who.int/2024-25/contributors/contributor?name=United%20States%20of%20America)\\" was actually about $262 million (that's with an \\"m\\" not a \\"b\\") and with that we get a seat at the table and access to the data shared by other WHO members (as opposed to having to generate it ourselves).  Everything else we've paid to get to that $1.3 billion were voluntary contributions that we paid to fund specific initiatives.If we just keep making the assessed contribution, we'd still have access to all of the data that other members share and a seat at the table to try to push for any reforms that we thought were needed (and not make any voluntary contributions above that).  What we've effectively done is shut ourselves out of the data sharing which means we're going to either need to figure out an alternative way to get that data (which will likely cost us more than what we're paying now to be part of the WHO) or not have access to it when we face another pandemic.This was not a smart move.","title":"Trump Signs Executive Order to Withdraw from World Health Organization"},{"text":"Metric mooch or imperial mooch?","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy quits Doge cost-cutting program leaving Musk in charge"},{"text":"Would they be leftists if they weren't crying?","title":"Holy Sh!t !

I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country, and no place in our movement.No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine can ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans.

Here are some of the key areas where the WHO was perceived to have gotten things wrong or handled inadequately:1. Delay in Declaring a Pandemic:\\nLate Declaration: The WHO was criticized for being slow to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. Although the outbreak began in December 2019, the pandemic declaration did not come until March 11, 2020. Critics argue that earlier recognition could have prompted swifter global action.\\n2. Reliance on Chinese Data:\\nOver-reliance on Early Information: In the early stages of the outbreak, the WHO relied heavily on data provided by China. This included initial reports that downplayed the viruss transmissibility and severity. There were concerns that this delayed an accurate global understanding of the viruss potential impact.\\nDelays in Investigating Origins: The WHO faced criticism for delays and perceived lack of transparency in investigating the origins of the virus, including potential political influences from China.\\n3. Mixed Messaging on Masks:\\nInconsistent Guidance: Early in the pandemic, the WHO advised against the widespread use of masks by the general public, citing limited evidence of their effectiveness outside healthcare settings and concerns about supply shortages for medical workers. Later, as more evidence emerged, the WHO reversed this stance, leading to confusion and skepticism about their guidance.\\n4. Transmission Modes:\\nConfusion About Asymptomatic Spread: Initially, there was uncertainty and mixed messages regarding the role of asymptomatic carriers in spreading the virus. This contributed to delays in implementing widespread testing and contact tracing.\\nSurface Transmission Focus: The WHO initially emphasized surface transmission (fomites) over airborne transmission. It took time for the organization to fully acknowledge and communicate the significance of aerosol transmission, which is now understood to be a major mode of spread.\\n5. Testing and Border Controls:\\nDelays in Promoting Mass Testing: The WHO was criticized for not advocating for mass testing and contact tracing more aggressively from the outset, which could have helped contain the spread more effectively.\\nOpposition to Early Travel Bans: The WHO initially advised against imposing travel bans, arguing that they were ineffective and could cause unnecessary disruption. Some countries that implemented early travel restrictions later credited these measures with helping to slow the viruss spread.\\n6. Slow Response to Variants:\\nDelayed Action on Variants: The WHO faced criticism for being slow to react to and communicate the risks associated with emerging variants of concern. Early detection and rapid response to these variants are crucial for controlling their spread.\\n7. Vaccine Rollout and Equity:\\nCOVAX Program Challenges: The WHO-supported COVAX initiative aimed at equitable vaccine distribution faced significant challenges, including supply shortages, logistical issues, and delays. Critics argued that the WHO did not do enough to address vaccine hoarding by wealthier nations, leading to global disparities in vaccine access.\\n8. Public Communication Issues:\\nInconsistent Messaging: Throughout the pandemic, the WHOs public communication was sometimes criticized as unclear or inconsistent, contributing to public confusion and mistrust. This included changing guidance on masks, transmission, and other preventive measures.\\nWhile the WHO played a critical role in coordinating the global response, these perceived missteps fueled debates about its effectiveness and preparedness in handling a global health crisis of this magnitude.","title":"Trump withdraws the U.S. from the World Health Organization"},{"text":" Even if both of your parents were born here, that would not necessarily be enough.Since birth certificates don't typically capture the citizenship status of the parents, and people born in the US wouldn't have gone through naturalization since they were already citizens, it would effectively strip most Americans of their citizenship if applied retroactively.

These concerns include:1.\\t?National Decision-Making Authority: Autonomy in Health Policy: Some countries worry that the treaty could limit their ability to set and implement their own health policies, especially in areas such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and vaccine distribution. Control Over Resources: Nations are concerned about potentially being required to share critical health resources (like vaccines or medical supplies) under terms dictated by an international body, which might conflict with national priorities.\\n2.\\t?Obligations to Comply with International Directives: Binding Nature of the Treaty: If the treaty includes binding obligations, countries may be required to follow WHO directives, potentially overriding national policies or decisions, especially in urgent or high-stakes situations. Enforcement Mechanisms: The establishment of enforcement or compliance mechanisms could further limit a nations ability to act independently if they are required to adhere strictly to international rules or face sanctions.\\n3.\\t?Transparency and Data Sharing: Mandatory Information Sharing: Some nations are concerned that mandatory sharing of health data, including sensitive information, could compromise national security or privacy. Loss of Control Over Outbreak Narratives: There is a fear that the WHO or other international bodies could control the narrative or response strategies during a pandemic, reducing national control over public messaging.\\n4.\\t?Equity and Fairness: Uneven Impact on Sovereign Powers: Developing countries worry that the treaty could disproportionately affect their sovereignty, as they may be more dependent on international assistance and thus more subject to external pressures or conditions. Resource Allocation Decisions: The treaty might enforce redistribution of resources in a way that some countries perceive as unfair or not in their best interest, especially if it mandates sharing with other nations before securing their own needs.\\n5.\\t?Potential Overreach by International Organizations: Expanding WHO Authority: Critics argue that granting the WHO greater authority during pandemics could set a precedent for overreach, where international bodies gain too much influence over national policies beyond health emergencies. Loss of Sovereign Control: Some see the treaty as a step towards diminishing national sovereignty in favor of a more centralized global health governance structure. These concerns reflect the tension between the need for global cooperation in managing pandemics and the desire of nations to retain control over their own health decisions and resources. Balancing these interests is a key challenge in the treaty negotiations.","title":"Trump withdraws the U.S. from the World Health Organization"},{"text":"Good.

I asked him multiple times to move his bag and let me back in because people needed to get their bags from the other over head bin. He wouldnt move.
