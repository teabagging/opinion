How is a layman supposed to determine a good scientist from a bad one? They can't, they are not equipped well enough so the result is they dismiss it all and look elsewhere.We must condemn activist science in universities to start and it must be okay to use that science to criticize groups regardless of their political affiliation or perceived virtuousness. Again, the BLM rallies getting a pass when the churches didn't is an extremely good example of what I'm talking about. The science and scientists all said 6 feet social distancing, but they wouldn't condemn the BLM rallies for not social distancing. They refused to do it and that's a massive problem highlighting that it's not an isolated thing and that US culture specifically is driving this outcome of distrust due to obvious biased treatment. Why are scientists afraid of criticizing scientifically negative actions depending on who the subject is?It's also not close to zero. There are activist scientists in the mainstream constantly spreading misinformation using their credentials. All of the DEI stuff is a result of activist scientists for example. They use stats about system wide demographics to advocate for discrimination against individuals. That's bad science and there are some famous studies fueling these outcomes. Hormone blockers for example, there's a lot of contentious research touted as settled science when that isn't the case. Or the claims around long term effects of the covid vaccines being known and settled without long term studies on them.If you want a parallel, vaccines causing autism is an example of bad science that activist scientists pushed. People still believe that decades later.","title":"CMV: The post-truth era will usher in a new dark age if we don't stand up for evidence and compassion."},{"text":"I really do think about how much different the world would be if Carter won a second term.

Losing votes scares them. Dear [Representative/Senators Name],I am writing to express my serious concerns regarding the proposed increase in H1B visa allocations and its potential impact on American workers in the technology sector.While I understand the importance of maintaining Americas competitive edge in technology, I am troubled by the contradictory narratives being presented by major tech companies. These corporations are simultaneously:1. Reporting record profits and implementing price increases that boost their margins\\n2. Conducting significant layoffs and outsourcing existing positions\\n3. Claiming they cannot afford to hire American workers and need more H1B visas\\n4. Failing to provide cost-of-living adjustments to their current employeesThese inconsistent positions suggest that the push for increased H1B visas may not be driven by genuine labor shortages, but rather by a desire to reduce labor costs despite strong financial performance. This approach threatens American jobs and wages in the technology sector.I urge you to:\\n- Carefully examine these contradictions when considering any legislation to increase H1B visa allocations\\n- Request transparency from tech companies regarding their hiring practices, layoffs, and wage policies\\n- Consider implementing requirements for companies to demonstrate good-faith efforts to hire and retain American workers before seeking H1B visas\\n- Ensure that any immigration policy changes protect both American workers and legitimate business needsAs your constituent, I would appreciate hearing your position on this issue and what steps you plan to take to address these concerns.Sincerely,\\n[Your Full Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State ZIP]\\n[Your Email/Phone]","title":"VP Trump should have his media approved before speaking"},{"text":"What are you talking about?

Then by Constitution the Secretary of State would become the 47th President of the United States. If Grassley were chosen President Pro Tem then it would be him.Where the solid mud comes is there is no constitutional mechanism for a temporary president, outside the transfer of power by a sitting president for a specific period of time.If this happened, then absent the SCOTUS creating constitutional procedure out of thin air (highly likely) there is no letter of the law way for Trump to assume office.Without, again, SCOTUS invention of procedure or some scenario where Grassley appoints Trump VP then resigns for him to assume office.

Keeping their war footing precisely as it is but replenishing their very depleted stocks instead of having them destroyed a couple weeks later would be a better position for their economy.No. It would change nothing. It doesn't matter if war materials are put in a warehouse or shot. They do not generate value just sitting waiting to be used. What matters is the government deficit spending and how it drives inflation.Hell, maybe they'd even be able to start exporting some goods again.Not unless they get sanctions lifted. No one wants rubles and if they are going to take them, they are going to want a discount.The high wages aren't really being propped up due to volunteers on the front line, but requiring people to manufacture military goods which is not at all dependent on those goods being actively fired in Ukraine.The wages of the soldiers is the primary driver of inflation in Russia. All government spending is driving it, but the soldiers wages is a HUGE part of it. The average wage for a new recruit is between 2 and 3 times higher than the average wage in Russia. There are also reports of some soldiers being offered nearly 4-5 times the average wage. There are also signing bonuses equal to the average wage of a Russian for 1-2 years. This doesn't include the payouts the government has promised for injuries and deaths as well. This has pulled a large number of people out of the labour pool and forced other industries to raise wages to retain and hire staff. It has also injected large sums of money into the economy.

What this demonstrates is the reality that previously was obscured by overcentralization of media.Walter Cronkite was a journalist who built credibility over a long career. You have it totally backwards. Reality is now obfuscated by thousands of twitter propagandists and AI bot farms with zero credibility and proven malicious intent especially during elections. In the world of science and academia there are many different interpretations of how things work and most fields are full of internal debate that is invisible to an outsider.

And that any expert that is trying to tell you the 'truth' is at most only given a partial picture of the reality. This doesn't discount the importance of experts, but it means that treating them like clergy, as is wont to happen, is not a rigorous decision.Academia generally agrees with the overarching concepts and fight about the details.

I watched that interview live, trusted what he said because he was the lead for pandemic messaging, and when it came out that he was actually intentionally lying and not just misinformed, that eroded a lot of trust I had in official messaging. He used his position to spread a lie and that's what I'm talking about in regards to claimed domain experts. Other people don't get to to do that, as in appeal to their authority to carry their claims, and experts continuing to do just that instead of speaking the actual truth unaffected by their biases is driving the outcome where people distrust them more and more. They have caused this outcome and academia has fueled it by not shutting it down because they think a lot of instances of this intentional misinformation is virtuous. Your mention of the BLM hypocrisy is a tu quoque, basically an attempt to discredit an idea without offering a valid argument.The argument is that it was hypocritical treatment due to a bias and the experts were wishy washy about condemning BLM because they thought it was a virtuous thing. The label \\"BLM\\" being on a protest vs a church gathering meant those instances were treated differently by people who were claiming just moments ago \\"you must social distance at 6ft, and we will fine you or arrest you if you don't.\\" You can guarantee if it was KKK rallies sweeping the nation instead they would have been condemned for not social distancing. That is rampant bias driving that outcome and the experts were treating events differently based on their perceived virtuousness. That is very bad science and people who noticed that had an extreme distrust of those some entities trying to speak to science later. They showed they were too biased to be objective. The replication crisis is not what you think.You don't know anything about me or what I think. There is a massive replication crisis spanning all disciplines, not just one or two. Most high profile papers are wrong but science leads to truth over time. Its amazing how accurate and excellent scientific predictions are in almost all fields. No scientists trust a publication that just came out, thats not how it works and thats not what experts do. The replication crisis is not a science crisis.It is a science crisis when the scientists are intentionally doing bad science to further political and social agendas. It's not distrusting the science, it's distrusting the scientists who misrepresent it regularly and use their biases to manipulate outcomes. If the average person can't digest a scientific study and has to instead rely on someone who regularly bends the truth, they are instead going to just not listen to the scientist on it at all and are going to form their opinion elsewhere. That's a function of the messenger misrepresenting the message. We see this in topics like environmentalism, gender studies, equity studies etc. where individuals pushing the science are more closely related to activists than scientists. They have a biased goal and use scientific outcomes to push that goal in a biased way. That's what people are rejecting and those activists are more and more prevalent every year. Im not convinced that your attack of experts is based on knowledge of whats going on.See, this is the problem. I tell you about my lived experience, then you try and gaslight me into an alternate reality where what I experienced isn't true. That doesn't work, no one will listen to anyone who tries that play. I really hope that you realize that Im not trying to attack you, and I wish I were able to say all this in a way that would make you rethink your position, because as a society and a world we really need to change how we acquire information.Perhaps you shouldn't talk down to me in that case, maybe your approach would be more digestible.

He was a far-right politician in the early 30's, famously caught up in a trial involving a male prostitute, and his homosexual tendencies were well known around newspapers at the time. He was a leading member of the Nazi party and one of the leading men in creating the *Sturmabteilung* (SA), basically Hitler's paramilitary. His homosexuality was the worst-kept secret, so Hitler *tolerated* him for his work and simply had him killed during the *Night of the Long Knives* in 34 when his homosexual tendencies were more annoying than his SA work was useful.Secondly, *Weidel's party is turning against her.* While it is admittedly a small part right now, they just clarified a resolution to parliament that should define the *family unit*.

More or less the same thing that is being proposed by Trumps Team through General Kellogg. But Putin doesnt want a delay to Ukraines NATO membership. He wants no Ukrainian membership in NATO ever, on paper, signed and framed. Which would fit as a key cornerstone on a prospective path to Lukashenkazation (of the post-2020 variety). Well, maybe thats a bit too far. Probably closer to Ivanishvilization instead.Putin sees this prospective plan as just another attempt to let Ukraine rearm and possibly strike when Russia is in a weak state (or some such). Or at least not allow Ukraine to move into further steps along the aforementioned Regimization plans. But but but! These recent Russian offensives in the East are totally unsustainable based on attrition rates! Yes, sure. Although Im not sure the Kremlin Hawks believe that. Whether theyre being done to improve Russias negotiating position or a genuine desire to make Ukraines position unsustainable and force a mass retreat (or both) doesnt really matter.In any case, ruining a prospective ceasefire does not require a mass offensive. In fact, it does not require any offensives. Just, well, bombing and shelling. Which again means no period of either entry for Western troops to monitor the ceasefire or enact any security guarantees.For what its worth, Ukraine has been (more or less) privy to enacting a ceasefire at the current lines of contact (whenever the movements stop, that is). And to then wait until Putin is out of the picture to begin pressing Russia under a less secure or even a completely unsecure successor. For the record (and this is my personal opinion), I dont really see a successor to Putin being too secure in his seat regardless of how much time is spent grooming him to take up the mantle post-Putin. The current Kremlin system is just not fit for a proper procedure of succession. Even if they started working on one now, it wont allow for too-stable of a transition when the time comes. Not that Putin seems to be interested in establishing an heir, anyway.Anyway, the Ukrainian Manpower Crisis is significant, but it also cant be overstated. Even so, the compromisers in the Ukrainian Political-Military Circles, rightfully, believe that a simple ceasefire is a long-term death sentence for Ukrainian future. No prospects, no positive steps on integration with the EuroAtlantic sphere and of course, no security guarantees, would invite another full-scale invasion soon afterwards. Probably sooner than Russia would be ready for it (Putin staked much of his legacy on Ukraine and Im sure he wants to oversee the vassalization of her before he dies). But it would certainly be another massive tragedy for Ukraine.","title":"Russia rejects Trump team's reported peace deal proposals on Ukraine, FM Lavrov says"},{"text":"I agree- he's so rich he can't possibly be conflicted between his own interests and the country's- he's proven his own interests come first.","title":"GOP Gov.

Your mention of the BLM hypocrisy is a tu quoque, basically an attempt to discredit an idea without offering a valid argument. The replication crisis is not what you think. Individual papers are hard to replicate for all sorts of reasons (including questionable science), this has always been the case and scientists have been aware of this long before this got picked up by the media. Most high profile papers are wrong but science leads to truth over time. Its amazing how accurate and excellent scientific predictions are in almost all fields. No scientists trust a publication that just came out, thats not how it works and thats not what experts do. The replication crisis is not a science crisis. The studies that are suspiciously financed and biased to reflect a private interest are never ever the ones that are attacked, they are always the ones that are promoted by anti-experts. Ive noticed this a lot. Not sure why its the case but possibly its because the people that care about truth dont get involved in politics and media while the ones that fund bogus studies do get involved.

The house elects a speaker and then adopt rules.If no candidate can garner the 50% support needed, candidates will start to offer rules concessions weakening their power to gain the position.If even that didn't work the house would operate without a speaker AND without rules, which means that individual members can just bring things directly on the floor.People tend to confuse traditions with the actual constitutional requirements. The word \\"Speaker\\" appears exactly once in the constitution: The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers;The constitution doesn't say anything else about the position. It doesn't define its roles and responsibilities, it doesn't give it any power. There is no constitutional crises associated with the House failing to choose a speaker in a timely fashion. The only crises is if they fail to perform their other duties, and they are granted extensive leeway in how to perform those duties. Everything we can really say about how the House operates is specified in Section 5, but the emphasized parts give control to the body itself to self-organize and operate. Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide. Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member. Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal. Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.The House is basically free to do whatever it wants, and to certify the electors in whatever manner they might wish.

I don't have problems with immigrants as long as they are actually productive people (ie: doesn't make a living off the government one way or the other)2. H1Bs are pretty miserable and does create a sort of \\"indentured servatude\\" that big corporations take advantage of to drive down wages. H1Bs are tied to specific employeer and even specific jobs. So if you get fired you can lose your visa. You can't change jobs without governmental approval first and lots of paperwork filed by your prospective employer, etc.  Corporations know this and take advantage of green card holders.\\nIf I was king of the country and I was not allowed to immediately dissolve the federal governemnt or immigration restrictions my solution would be:1. Liberalize work visas. If you are in the country to work it doesn't matter who your employer is. The visas should be assigned to individuals, not to employeers.2. Eliminate all government benefits and welfare for everybody. Welfare states and open borders are incompatible because it attracts individuals whose only interest is in looting the system. This is especially a problem when other countries are significantly poorer then yours.  Were as immigrant workers, who are actually working and paying their own way, are, through market action, almost always going to be a net benefit. The wealth they generate is greater then the wealth they consume, even if they do send money to other countries. Ultimately these are problems caused by government policies. Eliminate the policies and you eliminate the problems.","title":"H1B situation"},{"text":"I think Biden forgot just how bad he did in the debate.","title":"Biden regrets leaving presidential race, thinks he would beat Trump"},{"text":"Mid 30s here, I'm going to die in a fascist neo-con America as well.

Personally Id argue health experts needlessly drew out covid protocols, heavily damaging education and other public goods, but the jury is still out on that one.The issue is that theres a difference between knowing more - even vastly more - than the average uneducated Joe and knowing enough to make a good decision. As an example, scientific expertise can predict how many extra deaths reopening the schools will cause, but it cant tell you whether you should keep them closed. The best insulation against this fallacy is to make available all the information and viewpoints, even if theyre mostly half baked.

National security experts all testified that the Hunter Biden laptop was fake when it wasn't. Medical experts openly admit they lied and speculated when it came to how to deal with Covid (such as by saying that N95 masks were ineffective when they were worried that the public would buy them out before doctors and hospitals could stock up, then saying that they did work and everyone should wear them, or by recommending that the schools be closed when they already knew children were at almost no risk, or by inventing out of nowhere that 6 feet of social distancing could protect people when they knew it wouldn't). The predictions of many climate experts have repeatedly failed to manifest (some have been accurate but the media tends to amplify the most dire predictions which have all been wrong).The reason the testimony of scientists and experts have had no effect on Trump and his supporters isn't because of Trump. They did it to themselves and the refusal of the right to listen to them is a manifestation of their own actions, not of anything Trump has done or said.","title":"CMV: The post-truth era will usher in a new dark age if we don't stand up for evidence and compassion."},{"text":"'All are Grandsons' of someone alive in the 1200's?That explains why politicians are all demons.","title":"Every U.S president except Van Buren and Trump are related and descendants from one person."},{"text":"In fairness most Germans arent fond of Nazis and are pretty good at spotting them.","title":"Elon Musk pens German newspaper opinion piece supporting far-right AfD party | \\nBillionaire Trump adviser said his significant investments in the country justify his wading into German politics"},{"text":"Of course not.","title":"Patrick Thomas Egan accused of attacking TV reporter, saying This is Trumps America now | CNN"},{"text":"I interact and have become friends with a lot of older vets through work.

The systems of governance collapsed, infrastructure broken and was never able to be repaired, trade systems were shattered, agriculture became increasingly localized, there was a reduction in urbanization, literacy rates declined, wide-spread invasions frequently occurred, and life expectancy dropped. The aqueduct systems that were built, for instance, largely ceased having regular maintenance performed on them and new large-scale aqueduct projects were not pursued in any form like that of the Roman Empire. The technical knowledge was lost, the resources were not available, and the social cohesion for such endeavors was not present. The collapse of central authority and the decline of urban populations meant that many Roman cities, such as Rome itself, saw their water supply systems degrade. Without the sophisticated Roman aqueducts, many European cities during the early Middle Ages had limited access to fresh water, which affected public health and living conditions. It wasn't until much later that similar systems of water management began to be re-established in Europe. The technology and infrastructure that the Romans had built were simply not replaced for several centuries after the empire's fall.","title":"CMV: The post-truth era will usher in a new dark age if we don't stand up for evidence and compassion."},{"text":"Thank goodness Trump isn't inaugurated yet so there's no reason for him to be at the funeral and making it all about him.

There is an objective truth to anything that happens, but there are only subjective interpretations of that event that everyone walks away with that are unique to them that make up perception of that event. Once upon a time you turned on the TV and Walter Cronkite told you what was fact and falsehood. This being what his script writers decided was fact and what what they decided was falsehood. Today you pull of Reddit or Twitter or 4chan and get a million interpretations of that event from many viewpoints. What this demonstrates is the reality that previously was obscured by overcentralization of media. In the world of science and academia there are many different interpretations of how things work and most fields are full of internal debate that is invisible to an outsider. I'm fairly well informed about the history of Christianity and late Roman religion. So I can tell you that there is a massive debate about almost every detail imaginable in that entire field. And that any expert that is trying to tell you the 'truth' is at most only given a partial picture of the reality.

Over one-third of our thirty-three presidents have been derived from a single interrelated group of families 2. Their presidents have held office sixty-six of the one hundred and fifty-nine years of our national existence, despite the death of two of them within a short time after inauguration. 3. Thirteen of them have served fully, or in part, a total of eighteen terms as president, and additional terms as vice-president. 4. Of a total of forty presidential terms in our history, eighteen have been served by them. 5. The only two instances of hereditary transmission of presidency from father to son, John Adams and John Quincy Adams, or from grandfather to grandson. \\nGeneral William H. Harrison and General Benjamin Harrison, in our history has been in this Dynasty. In \\nthe person of Robert Alphonso Taft, an effort is now in process to reaffirm that tradition. 6. On a number of occasions the nation has been confronted with two candidates derived from the Dynasty, as in 1848, Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams, were presidential and vice presidential candidates on the Free Soil ticket; 1944 when Franklin \\nDelano Roosevelt and Thomas Dewey, both of the Dynasty were Democratic and Republican candidates respectively; and 1948 when three of the Republican \\ncandidates Robert A. Taft, Thomas Dewey and General Douglas MacArthur are all derived from the Dynasty. In 1836 Martin Van Buren, Democratic Presidential candidate defeated General William Henry Harrison Whig candidate both of the Dynasty. In 1840, in return contest, Harrison was victor. 7. The number of policy making offices in local and national government that have been filled by the members of the Dynasty are innumerable and utterly out of \\nproportion to their number. **Apologists for the Dynasty and surprisingly enough even those possessed of intelligence, have a stock explanation for these extraordinary phenomena.*A family that has been in this country for so long a time is certain to be related to every other family in the land, they explain.*It is absurd to represent that within ten to fifteen generations the half dozen families which have constituted the backbone of the Dynasty could have intermarried \\nwith the forty some million families that can not trace their relationship even remotely to any of our presidents. This apology is as false as it is insincere.**It fails to explain the fact that there is no relationship traceable between the other twenty-one Presidents. It is also very striking that there is no relationship traceable between any of those twenty one Presidents amongst themselves despite the fact that their ancestors were in this country as long, and some longer, \\nthan the Dynastys. To refute the apologists there is the phenomenon of intense inbreeding and intermarriage between the families comprising the Dynasty, with the occasional introduction of the scion of some commercial dynasty such as the Astors, the DuPont and others. This follows the pattern of the royal families of Europe. It results in multiple relationships that reinforce those of direct line of ancestry. Thus Frederick B. Adams, a sixth \\ncousin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt married Ellen W. Delano, a first cousin; James Roosevelt Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelts half-brother, married Helen Schermerhorn Astor making a more distant cousin an in-law; and among the Delanos, it is their boast that most marriages are between cousins. Quite as striking is the deliberate and steady enhancement by the Presidents of the Dynasty of the monarchic powers of the President with the simultaneous wiping out of the checks on that power imposed by the Constitution. This indicates a deliberately designed drive to make themselves the Royal Family of an American monarchy. The published blue-print of this drive is the theme of a \\nlater chapter. Striking proof of the fact that the relationship that exists within the Dynasty is of a different intensity and degree than is found in the ordinary run of families, can be \\ndiscerned in the publications of the Roosevelts  Eleanor Roosevelts column My Day and her other effluvia and F. D. R. His Personal Letters. These make it evident that the relationships within the Dynasty are of far different order than occur in the ordinary run of families. One finds intimacy and social contact assidously maintained among cousins five degrees removed. Eleanor Roosevelt, though a cousin five times removed of Sara Delano Roosevelts husband, was taken in by her; and when the need arose, married her off to Franklin. This is much the same state of affairs as exists in Europes royalty and nobility. A significant development for the Dynasty is its inter-marriage with European royalty and nobility especially British. Their intermarriage with the British royalty make King George VI a closer relative of Franklin Delano Roosevelt than was even President Ulysses S. Grant. Most convincing of all, however, are the appointments dictated by nepotism and the deals that cry of favoritism and violations of the nations interests such as the Adams sugar deal and the Clayton cotton control deal. A few of these will be outlined later. The clearest demonstration of the purposefulness of the transmission of office within the Dynasty is the \\ncase of the secretaryships in the Navy Department which will be detailed. In conclusion it should be noted that there is a unanimity of opinion among the Democratic and Republican representatives of the Dynasty that Democracy is a failure. Thus Roosevelt and his New Dealers insist upon the inadequacy of Democracy. They insist upon the improvement that could be effected by the totalitarian devices they adopted. On the other hand, Mrs. George St. George, a first cousin of F. D. R.. \\nelected to Congress on the Republican anti-Roosevelt ticket from Hamilton Fishs Tuxedo Park district and with his support, has been reported to have \\npronounced with no qualification, the same New Deal concept, Democracy is a failure. She has issued no denial of this report. They all subscribe to the views of \\nHoffman Nickerson on the need for an American monarchy. The best commentary on the peculiar quality of the relationship that exists within the Dynasty to the nth generation which is characteristic of royalty, is a statement by Eleanor Roosevelt quoted by Westbrook Pegler: Although we are a lucky and somewhat robustious family given to contrariness and quarreling, nevertheless, in the great crisis of life, we close up like a fist in a common defense. Undeniably they constitute a coherent and collusive, open and behind the scene government.Roosevelts Communist Manifesto,\\nEmanuel M.

Prices would all go up until that $200 was worth the same as they were making before, and the money you had saved would become worth much less in the process. What if American car companies were only allowed to hire people with red hair. They would be crushed by international car companies that could hire whoever they wanted and thus could make cars more cheaply and effectively because they could get the best and most efficient car workers, since they weren't hamstrung by the red hair regulation. And if you then tried to bar those international car companies from shipping those cars into the United States, the cost of people's cars would then shoot sharply upward.","title":"H1B situation"},{"text":"Ironic isn't it","title":"Someone should check what Elon thinks about eating cats and dogs, so we could know what Trump thinks about it nowdays."},{"text":"The printing press was invented in 1440.

Everybody wants to buy low, and sell high.  It's a basic premise of interaction: Give and take, input and output, debit expenses and credit sales.  So, \\"they\\" want \\"cheap, skilled labor,\\" so they can buy work and sell product.  \\"We\\" want to sell labor as high as possible, while buying product as cheaply as possible.  - The sudden influx of competition is a pain in the ass, and leads to attempting at substituting quality over quantity.  When selling labor, being pleasant to deal with is part of \\"the product.\\"  When other cultures are unpleasant to deal with (i.e. the French), their labor is arguably an inferior product because of the added baggage.  Therefore, many are insulted at the implication that their product is inferior to having to deal with a bunch of Frenchies, when the reality is that frogs are just that cheap.\\n* There's also a slight existential terror at being replaced by something unpleasant that can somehow live on snobbery and little thin cigarettes alone.  Americans would be happy to undercut the competition, but haven't figured out how yet.  It's a little mindboggling that it's somehow cheaper to fly over Pierre for a data entry job than it is to hire Little Timmy out of high school.\\n* It's also a little Gaulling that Paris somehow turned out all these engineers and doctors who knew what they wanted to do since they were six- I recall, back in college, that there was no way I could keep up with them.  Moreover, the classes *were taught by, and catered to* France, so the locals couldn't keep up.\\n* In business, I've also run into a problem where outsourced \\"Experts\\" from the Louvre aren't nearly as good as advertised and we have to stop and wait for their project to expire before getting anything done.

Mess with someone's refund, other than to increase it, and they get REALLY angry. They might still be upset if the refund is somewhat larger.I have mixed feelings about getting a tax refund.  Suppose that you usually get back $2000 for your tax refund. The mathematically correct answer is to adjust your withholding to come within some small amount of money that you can easily pay, like $50 or $100 sl that you receive the money as you earn it. I can see the sense in getting a refund if it's hard for you to save otherwise.  You're missing out on $45 or so in interest over the course of the year were you to put the money over the course of the year into a high-interest savings account, but knowing that the money will be there in March (say) is worth something. What I hate are the usurious fees that tax preparers charge for refund anticipation loans. I learned that if you don't take advance payment of the subsidy for the ACA, it's refunded to you based on what your income turns out to be.

The enemy just keeps getting stronger while our defenses have failed. There is little reason to think that in 2-4 years time the situation will have changed in a positive way.

But a lot of journalism requires anonymous sources. Thats just a fact. People arent willing to compromise their careers and reputation just so a reporter can get a scoop so they go on the record anonymously.Now how do you determine whether an anonymously sourced article is truthful or a lie? Easy. You apply your fucking common sense. If you arent capable of doing that, of the bare minimum of critical thinking, you probably shouldnt be discussing politics in a public setting otherwise you risk making a total ass of yourself.Biden has a long storied history of egotism. This is no secret. His [entire career]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D1j0FS0Z6ho&amp;pp=ygUIQmlkZW4gaXE%3D) really. His entire presidential campaign in 2020 was based on the premise that he was the only person who could defeat Trump. He decided to seek reelection regardless of the fact he was clearly experiencing rapid cognitive decline and his team had assured everyone he wouldnt in 2020. Pelosi outmaneuvered him, constantly leaking information to the press and keeping his cognitive decline in the headlines long after the debate, until he was forced to drop out. His replacement ran against Trump and lost.Now when you see an article about his regret of dropping out that is anonymously sourced you can apply all of those facts you already have on hand and determine for yourself how likely it is. Thats called critical thinking and it is a far superior way to filter information than the but the sources are all anonymous reeeeeee way you are currently practicing.","title":"Joe Biden maintains he could have beaten Donald Trump in US election"},{"text":"Monarchy x oligarchy argument","title":"GOP Gov.

Places can have wars and tension that is not ultimately the fault of the US president.?Well, both of these wars were essentially engineered by the US.  It was the US policy to induct Ukraine in the NATO alliance that precipitated the war.  Biden had repeated talks with Putin just prior to this war.  Had he agreed on neutrality for Ukraine, the war would not have happened.  And it was not only that; the US built two nuclear missile bases close to Russia's borders, one in Poland and the other in Ukraine.  If you look at matters from a beligerent US perspective, you may agree with these actions.  It is really up to you.  Essentially, it was a American-lives-free war, it is simply too costly.  And it caused the inflation that dumped the Biden presidency.  As for Israel, it was the US policy to \\"assist\\" Israel in maintaining a long-standing occupation and a apartheid regime that created the current troubles.  Then Biden provided the bombs and untold billions of dollars to the Israelis to kill tens of thousands of civilians totally uninhibited.  The US could have stopped the killing at any time by stopping the delivery of weapons, but it did not. These are direct actions by a US president, not distant echoes from foreign battlefields.\\\\Our votes won't affect this much, but I think you are sorely misled, and Trump will not represent your interests.

It seemed to get good reviews, was fairly large, and I could find it in stores instead of having to wait for it ship. I'm fairly skinny, but I still I would have preferred it to be slightly larger, to fully cover both the front and back of my rib cage.. The manufacture also makes models that you can strap to your body, which might work better for some people, but this model worked OK for me, though it still took nearly two months for the pain to completely vanish. Good luck.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 29, 2024"},{"text":"...but then... where will he deport all the brown people to?

Without it, he might well have been just another two-term governor of California whose White House dream never came true....Reagan's calculus was different. He had just left the California governorship the previous year and had the backing of many Western and Southern party leaders as well as conservative activists. Reagan was also in his mid-60s, which at the time was regarded as posing the \\"age issue.\\" His brief bid for the GOP nomination in 1968 had been too little, too late. The Bicentennial Year looked like it might be his last chance.But Reagan had trouble raising money against the incumbent and was not connecting with the party leaders in the early primary states. He lost in New Hampshire and Florida and three other early primaries. His funding sources were drying up. Some in his camp were urging him to pack it in. Late in March, political commentator William F. Buckley wrote, \\"Ronald Reagan, it would appear, has lost his fight.\\" Another archconservative columnist, James J. Kilpatrick, saw Reagan's campaign as \\"just about played out.\\" Several Reagan intimates and biographers have written that Reagan's wife, Nancy, wanted him out to spare him embarrassment.Instead, Reagan dug in his heels. He looked ahead to the March 23 primary in North Carolina, a state where he had the backing of the state's senior Sen. Jesse Helms, an ultraconservative icon. The combined campaign teams hit upon a tactic and an issue. They bought time on local TV stations around the state and ran a prerecorded speech Reagan had given before on the subject of the Panama Canal and the Ford administration plan to \\"give it away.\\"...There's no public record of Trump's attitude toward the Panama treaties in the late 1970s. It is possible he opposed them at the time as a 30-year-old businessman trying to shift his real estate focus from Queens to Manhattan.What is known is that Trump has proven himself at least as adept as Reagan at hearing which issues excite the crowds at his rallies. The Panama issue this week was part of a fusillade of \\"America First\\" pronouncements about asserting U.S. interests abroad far more aggressively in his second term. These included Trump's renewed interest in acquiring the Arctic island of Greenland, a Danish possession that is not for sale. In what may have been a less serious moment, Trump also listed \\"Canada\\" among the items on his Christmas wish list.In this cluster of Trump statements, the reference to Panama seems likeliest to get the most response from the crowd at one of those rallies. It is most likely to keep the MAGA flame lit and the movement energy flowing.And for the moment, the return to Panama has also reminded us of Trump's unparalleled ability to remake the political conversation all by himself in the middle of the night.This was a helpful look at the history of this issue, and how this kind of rhetoric has been previously used as a tool to solidify a conservative base as well. The breathless coverage by many media outlets have not been helpful to the discourse, and it's good to see a bit more substance about what is happening and potentially why.","title":"With Trump's Panama Canal talk, it feels like 1976 all over again"},{"text":"He holds the title \\"President Pro Tempore\\"","title":"GOP \\"playing with fire\\" if Johnson removed as speaker, Rep.

Thinking about anything deeply like the meaning of life or human nature? Laughable! Because the government controls them through social media to make them stupid. That makes them easier for the evil U.S government to control themI believe that all social media like snapchat, instagram, etc is controlled by the deep state in order to make Americans stupid and it's certainly working but Tiktok is like all of these apps on Steroids, people that use it are incapable of even forming sentences, Americans with all their smartphones and pronouns aren't exactly known for being master wordsmiths as they always use \\"like\\" before every adjective or verb as their little monkey brain scrambles to think of what word to use and swears in every other sentence, but people that use Tiktok... holy moly, it's as though I'm talking to a 2 year old on crack.

Even highly skilled specialists in key roles will find their compensation drop significantly in the matter of just a few years.  Good luck to any entry level or intermediate level employees.This has nothing to do with advancement, productivity, or talent.  This is all about fucking the working class, in this case a well paid working class but still the working class.Musk's companies in particular have a pretty bad reputation in tech for both terrible work life balance and mediocre compensation compared to other big tech companies.  TSLA stock performance has masked that compensation issue to a certain extent, but when it does poorly people leave in droves.  The bad wlb also means attrition is high even when the stock is going up.  Even look at executive turnover, it's massive compared to their peers.

Thats because they would feel satisfaction and relief from their current, (relatively) constrained financial position, and that would be more than enough to satisfy anyone coming from relatively modest means.But Elon and Trump have been rich all their lives.  Without power, domination, control, authority over others, etc., their lives are just completely meaningless and empty, living in their hollowed-out mansions and indulging in meaningless hedonistic pursuits until they become addicts or injure themselves and their relationships to others through their selfish, reckless and narcissistic actions.Acquiring dominance and political power is their way of making their existence meaningful.  But unfortunately for us, theyre still the same spoiled, narcissistic children of rich families who see themselves as rightful rulers over the plebeian masses. Hence, their never-ending quest for more dominance, more wealth, more power.  Its the only thing that gives their lives any purpose.","title":"GOP Gov Called Out for Claiming Musk is So Rich That He Cant Be Swayed by Money"},{"text":"Well, what did yall think was gonna happen?

MAGA's concern is that too many Americans are out of work/underemployed, so our focus should be on hiring Americans - taking care of Americans first.

Just another guy who is commenting on things that he knows nothing about.It seems like most people THINK that H1B visas are for top 1% global talent, and those of us in the tech industry know this is not the case. Some people even think H1B visa is about labor shortages. I know, I know, stop laughing. You could fix the H1B visa system with 3 changes if they wanted to:1) minimum salary should be 1.5X or something of the average for the position they are applying for. This would mean that only above average candidates would be hired. There has to be a high minimum salary set that removes the way that H1B holders are used to undercut the native workforce. The H1B visa must be about high quality employees, not cost cutting. In reality, not just bullshit on paper with enforcement completely ignored for 30+ years. If you really want to increase the quality of the US engineering workforce, and not just add millions of more warm bodies, this is non-negotiable. \\n2) H1B visa holders should be free to change jobs without having to reapply for a visa. They need to be on the same playing field as any other worker, not indentured servants. This is really critical.  More so than low salaries, large companies love this provision because the H1B employee cant get a better job until they get a green card. Lower turnover of H1B visa holders is a tremendous asset to the corporation, ESPECIALLY when the job market is hot and people are changing jobs for big pay increases. \\n3) H1B visa holders need to have college/grad school degree in the US. This would greatly help with the cultural assimilation issues. Big tech projects, more so than most fields, require cohesive teamwork, which is all driven by culture. I highly doubt any of these changes would ever be implemented, as the fundamental role that H1Bs serve is that of cost cutting,  increase labor availability, and reduce labor mobility.
