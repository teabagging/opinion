But even with all that in the picture, things would have still played out in some similar ways. Lets assume it does for the moment, but remove any obviously Dominion impacted events.They gained Bajor, which clearly showed Federation alignment and intent to join.It is at least implied that they also gained some worlds.And they almost gained the Cardassians too - the junta fell and the [Detapa Council](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Detapa_Council) was briefly restored to the main power (before the Klingons attacked). While perhaps not quite democratic or completely Federation aligned, the Detapa Council was the civilian wing of the government, and seemed far more friendly and open to further peace. IIRC the Federation even aided them.You have to remember that the Cardassian Union was on its knees after the war and *did* actually collapse, albeit briefly before being reinstated. The Federation was playing the long game. Without the threat of the Dominion, the Klingons may not have attacked (because their pretext to attack was that Founders had infiltrated the Detapa Council - and were ultimately being influenced themselves by the Martok-Changeling), and had the Detapa Council remained in power - the Cardassians may well have become allies then subsequently member states too.The main miscalculation was the creation of the Maquis. But you can't predict everything every person will do, and once again, had the Detapa council timeline come to pass - the whole issue with the Marquis situation could well have sorted itself out. Even if not willing to re-join the Federation - the Marquis were ultimately *more* aligned with the Feds than anyone else - and would have easily just been a friendly neighbour to the Federation.Key for Non-Trekkies;* Federation - The goodies, the one Kirk and Spock work for, a big alliance of many races.\\n* Klingons - Were once baddies, now... noisy neighbours.\\n   * General Martok - a high ranking general within the Klingons, later became Emperor.\\n* Cardassians - ~~spoonheads~~ Grey lizard-y people.\\n   * Cardassian Union - A Fascist space junta.\\n   * Detapa Council - The civilian body within the CU. Largely ceremonial within the junta itself.\\n* Bajoran - A planet oppressed by the Cardassians.\\n* The Dominion - Baddies from the other side of the galaxy, came through a wormhole.\\n   * The Founders - a group of shapeshifters (called \\"Changelings\\") that rule the Dominion, but also act as spies and saboteurs.\\n* The Maquis - Rebels against / within the Federation who didn't want their planets given away to the Cardassians. Included a lot of Native Americans who moved to those planets because they found a spiritual connection with them.\\n* DS9 - Deep Space 9, the name of a space station and the series where all of this took place.

But Biden fucked up hard on inflation, which ended up being the biggest issue of the election by farBidenists like to say that inflation was a global affair and act like little could have been done about it, or that little could have been done without big risks. But Biden could have axed the Trump tariffs with executive orders, lowering inflation by around 1 point, and despite all the often repeated comments about how Dems just NEED to be protectionist to win, there's little evidence that being pro free trade actually hurts. And Biden's stimulus [likely contributed around 2 to 4 points to inflation at its peak](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/20/jane-timken/bidens-american-rescue-plan-fueled-inflation-so-di/). And the economy was already rapidly recovering at that point so it's not clear any stimulus was needed - and if one was, the GOP was offering a compromise stimulus for $600 billion, which would have fully patched the estimated output gap, rather than massively overspending with the Biden bill that did a whopping $1.9 trillion when the 1 year output gap was just $400 billion and the 2 year was just $600 billionSo with that there, that's 3 to 5 points of inflation at its peak that Biden could have avoided. Not the entire inflation surge of course, but that amount still could have genuinely made a differencePlus Biden fucked the pullout from Afghanistan hard - even if you assume we really did need to pull out, surely it could have been done more competently at least. That was what first led Biden to seeing horrid approval ratings that never recovered. Didn't help that Biden put his foot in his mouth in the debate and forgot (being charitable here assuming he was just too senile to remember, rather than actively lying) about how US troops died in the pullout (he said none did) which helped the right bring the issue back into public focusDude also helped fuck up BBB negotiations with Manchin, refusing to take his $1.5t redline seriously, leading to Manchin rage quitting and cutting his own topline in half. Hate Manchin all you want for that but Biden still made it worse by making choices that led to even less being done than Manchin allowed. And the social spending stuff was going to be paid for, rather than deficit spending, so that would have been the stuff that wouldn't have been inflationary too. Biden overspent on inflationary spending and then fucked it up on non inflationary spendingHis buy American/union made crap and tariffs on EVs just slow infrastructure and electric vehicle growth. You can argue for certain protectionist policy for national security with CHIPS, but we shouldn't put tariffs on our allies or stop China from subsidizing our transition to electric vehicles, at the very leastImmigration is good, but the general public doesn't agree, and Biden pivoted to the center there far too little too late after *years* of having taken more liberal stances and undoing Trump executive orders and then being super unpopular from it Biden's choice to remain in the election was a disaster of hubris that screwed the party immensely, and him pulling out only after we could have a primary left Harris the nominee by default but someone critically unable to separate herself from the hated Biden admin by nature of being literally his VP, which made the election even harder to winAnd then this fucking guy went and nepotistically pardoned his own son, and then followed it up by pardoning (\\"erm ackshually it was a commutation\\" I don't care!) the Kids for Cash guyHis presidency has been a disaster.

In my CSB, which uses largely modern English, it is written He said to the woman: I will intensify your labor pains: you will bear children with painful effortAnd he said to the manYou will eat from it (the ground) by means of painful labor. This consequence is given to humanity in response to eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.Lets take a step back and examine this from a literary perspective rather than religious for the moment. Metaphorically, upon receiving knowledge, humanity has increased pain in childbirth and providing food for themselves. One of the things that sets humanity apart from the majority of the animal kingdom is our large brains and our higher reasoning ability. This brain requires a high caloric input. By doing so, we as a species are forced to eat more and or higher calorie foods. This is why people developed farming, and why we used tools to hunt even before this. In addition, our bipedular design means we are much more efficient runners and throwers making these tasks possible. Being bipeds however necessarily means narrower pelvises.These necessarily small babies also have high caloric intact needs like their mature counterparts, in order to get through that fourth trimester. This is partially combatted by colostrum in the beginning, which allows for these calories in their small stomachs, but colostrum is incredibly difficult in a woman to produce, and is quickly downgraded to breast milk to conserve moms energy. However, in order to be able to get a baby all the calories it needs, its necessary to give a lot of milk, which their stomachs cannot take, causing frequent feeds. It is again this knowledge that directly causes the stressSo weve established that the metaphorical knowledge from the tree has directly created a narrow hipped, large brained species. This creates either very difficult childbirth, or severally underdeveloped offspring. Humanity has a sort of middle ground.If our infants developed any further prior childbirth, they would be virtually impossible to birth. If a mother dies the first time she gives birth, our reproductive capacity is not successful enough to maintain a population. And multiple births in a large brained, narrow hipped species lead to smaller, and therefore more frail children.If our infants developed a bit less than they currently do, they would be nearly incompatible with life. A few weeks makes the difference of being able to breath.As to our infants being incredibly needy and resource draining, this is to some extent magnified by our society, something created by people, not a potentially existent creator. Yes, new parents are woken up much more frequently and have very loud infants that could attract predators. But, when you are not having to go to work tomorrow, it does not matter as much if you are having interrupted sleep, because you can have longer sleep with no consequence. On the note of crying, children raised in a more natural way do tend to cry less. (Its much harder to cry when there is a breast shoved into your mouth if you start.) Babies would also never be separated from mother, which causes much more crying and stress than our society acknowledges.So, in order to create a species with high intelligence (that is mammalian), it is necessitated that we have narrow hips and large brains, which causes painful birth and minimal fetal development. While this also leads to a difficult infancy, this difficult is naturally much lower than we see in our more developed societies. Whether we were created cannot be determined from this, but if we were created and for some reason (know or unknown to us) it is necessary that we be intelligent mammals, this is seemingly the only way and therefore the most intelligent way for us to have been designed. While it is difficult to see the benevolence of our potential creation in light of the difficulties of child rearing, when considering that in our naturally created state we would have faced lesser difficulty in this matter, I believe there is enough evidence to provide at least reasonable doubt that a creator could have made us this way and still have compassion for us.","title":"CMV: Newborns are proof God doesn't exist"},{"text":"If he does the deportation and the tariffs we will be at -9.8% growth by the end of 2026.","title":"U.S. adds 256,000 jobs, as Biden leaves Trump with sturdy labor market"},{"text":"The argument is speech.Now, you and I, and most sensible people would say aha, but some foreign entity doesnt possess the free speech rights that we doSome might even make the logical extension that tiktok merely needs to add some domestic ownership as an anchor from which they can claim ok, see here our American shareholder(s) are having their rights infringed.

Gas prices have been on a long, slow decline this year, helped in part by lower crude oil costs and weaker fuel demand once the summer travel season ended. Given that winter tends to be a time of less driving, gas prices could slip further in coming weeks, falling below the $3 level that consumers often view as the difference between reasonable and expensive. Of course, many states are already seeing prices starting with a 2; in Oklahoma, home to the cheapest gas in the nation, the state average is just $2.53 per gallon. Diesel fuel is also down notably, now averaging $3.06 per gallon nationwide; a year ago, it was a lofty $4.09.What is the president going to do about egg prices exacerbated by avian flu outbreaks and beef prices driven up by climate change? Explain to me how you expect grocery prices to go down? You would either need to destroy demand (recession) or rapidly increase supply (which will not happen without federal ag support). \\"Eggs are sold on markets as commodities, like corn and wheat, and wholesale prices for eggs are driven largely by supply and demand,\\" Emily Metz, President &amp; CEO of the American Egg Board, told USA TODAY. \\"Our supply has been tight due to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza which is devastating to egg farmers. In the U.S. weve lost more than 40 million laying hens this year to bird flu.\\"[Bloomberg: US Cattle Herd Shrinks to 73-Year-Low in Blow for Beef Lovers\\n](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/us-beef-to-remain-expensive-as-herd-shrinks-to-73-year-low) | [Paywall Bypass](https://archive.is/GJz4w) The US cattle herd shrank to the lowest level in more than seven decades as ranchers continue to send their cows to slaughter, threatening to keep beef prices at stubbornly high levels for consumers for at least another couple of years while eroding profits for meat processors. American ranchers have for the past four years been culling more cows than they were retaining for breeding because of persistent droughts, surging feed costs and elevated interest rates. While improved pasture conditions and attractive prices are starting to encourage them to change direction, herds arent expected to start rebounding before at least 2026, said Lane Broadbent, president of KIS Futures Inc. in Oklahoma City.The only people who would helped your wages go up, the only path to success, was the party that lost.

The U.S. GAO report referenced below from March of 2024 clearly delineates between defense and security spending, and then economic and humanitarian spending.  The U.S. government's spending has accelerated significantly in 2024, and the GAO report represents only a fraction of the now total expenditures. Beginning this month, we issued the first and second reports in a series responding to requests by Congress about this assistance and its oversight. Todays WatchBlog post looks at our new reports on the **$44 billion that four U.S. agencies have designated to address the economic and humanitarian crisis,** and $42 billion in defense and security assistance.SOURCE: [Whats the Status of U.S. Assistance to Ukraine? Our First Reports on Oversight Efforts from GAO.gov](https://www.gao.gov/blog/whats-status-u.s.-assistance-ukraine-our-first-reports-oversight-efforts)Furthermore, we have so exhausted our **small and medium, non-strategic** weapon stockpiles, that the government is in a frantic push to build several new munitions development facilities across the U.S., as there is currently only one such facility in the United States, and it cannot handle the demand for Ukraine, let alone if the U.S. was to be drawn into another conflict of any size and substance.  Read [U.S. DoD - Army Opens New Munitions Facility](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3791962/army-opens-new-munitions-facility/) or this article [Military.com - Army Says the US Will Restart Domestic TNT Production at Plant to Be Built in Kentucky](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/11/09/army-says-us-will-restart-domestic-tnt-production-plant-be-built-kentucky.html).  So, you can give it a rest on the blatant deception that we're just sending over old and unused stockpiles... We exhausted that stockpile quite a while ago. Regarding Elon:  I view Elon Musk's wealth and others like him as an extreme perversion of capitalism.  The blatant wealth disparity between the ultra-rich and the average American must be addressed.  Our federal representatives from both sides of the isle have sold themselves and us out, for multi-national conglomerates (read monopolies), and feign outrage periodically, but never address the issue.  This is why both parties encourage divisive social issues, to divide and distract the masses, while they do the bidding of 'the elite'. Lastly, the FED prints our fiat currency at their whim, with no tangible relation to reality.  As long as they continue this practice, taxes are no more than theater to distract the masses.

(humans haven't done anything yet ??)\\"male and female created He them, separately.\\"Then He declares that He rested for a day (actually just waiting for the crop to grow and multiply, things do take/consume time to grow)But these things lol people were with no correct information about where not only they truly came from, but also all the creation and the creatures in it. Enter the fallen messengers (angels) who refused to be \\"born innocent of woman\\" and jumped ship at the get go.The were right on top of the goodies that our Father Love raised up from the depths of the waters, and having retained their morenatural/supernatural knowledge, immediately started corrupting temporal flesh humans with making them believe that they were the gods who made this temporal flesh realm. They had a 1000 of these temporal flesh years to do this, with no interruptions, as i lol figure that \\"the day of rest\\" that our Father Love took was to prepare for what He has to do out there I've had people attempt to dispute me about a day being a 24 hr day ? (lies cause this) Because, Our Father Love stated that because of the mistake (sin) made in the garden, humankind would as of now, never live more than a day ? We obviously live more than a day, but in the times of Noah and before, it is stated that humans were living 5,6,7,8 or even 900 and some odd years,But never a 1000 ?? Methusala (however it's supposed to be spelt) was the oldest.Noah was 500 years old before he could even find an appropriate wife, being that she would have to be a (likely virgin ?) Levite.Abraham was when the 120 year generations began, and Abraham is our Father Love's chosen vessel to \\"begin\\" the eternal covenant made and buried in love, in and through the families of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob/Israel. And then there is the verse in Peter,\\"for I would not have ye be ignorant of this one thing brethren, that as a day is unto Get Over Death (GOD) Almighty our Father Love, so is as a thousand years unto man, and as a thousand years is unto man, so is as a day is unto our Father Love.\\"So getting back on track, Almost ?? why would our Father Love do this? not leave the 6th day humans without the information?How our Father Love's perfect plan of salvation works is, that the further that one goes back in temporal flesh history, The more quilty they are at whatever it is that took place when Paradise got knocked 10 degrees off of its true north axsis and death was overthrown. We don't know what they did ? but the Godhead certainly does, we don't even know what we did, if anything ?Pretty sure that Our Lady Peace song called \\"we are innocent\\" is a direct message because, unlike this temporal flesh realm where ignorance of the law is no defense, Our Father Love says that mistakes (sins) that are made in ignorance are no mistake (sin) He is eternally Righteous/Fair ??The law takes care of the rest, well used to anyways lolSo now, after our Father Love has His day of rest/(preparations to leave) He declares His dilemma, Goes something like this, it's been a while ??\\" I have created those to gather and hunt, but I have yet to form anyone to till the soil. \\"Enter the 8th day of temporal creation, the \\"forming\\" of the Adam and The Eve. (not created separately as the 6th day humans were.\\"Sure hope that this flowed for you, i lol dunno, im just a simple commen witness, not a Teacher/Pastor, but it's hard to get around all of the misconceptions, or solicited lies if you will ??Thanks for having an interest, i had to go and cook lunch before i could get back to this.It's not about looking at this temporal flesh nightmare from our own point of view, It's about looking at it from our Father Love's perspective, because in His perfect plan of salvation, Everybody makes it, eventually ??Because He also asks?\\"Why should I suffer the loss of children?

Why is liberalism regarded as the ultimate system for the entire world, while ignoring the idea that systems evolve over time?For example, during the era of the Pharaohs, which was the greatest civilization of its time, their governance was theocratic. Other civilizations, like the Greeks, invented different systems of rule. Today, the United States adopts liberalism.

This package includes:Air Defense Missiles: To enhance Ukraine's ability to defend against aerial threats.Equipment for F-16 Fighter Jets: Supporting the operation and maintenance of these advanced aircraft.Armored Bridging Systems: Facilitating the movement of troops and equipment across obstacles.Communications Technology: Improving secure and reliable communication channels.Spare Parts: Ensuring the continued functionality of existing military equipment.\\nThis assistance is part of a broader effort to support Ukraine's defense capabilities amid ongoing conflicts. \\"\\nAlso....\\"President Biden has authorized significant federal assistance to California in response to the devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area. On January 9, 2025, he announced that the federal government will cover 100% of the costs for the initial disaster response, including debris removal, temporary shelters, and first responder salaries, for a period of 180 days. The cost of wildfire recovery and response can be significant, especially in a state like California, where fires can burn thousands of acres and destroy large amounts of property. Given that President Biden authorized 100% federal funding for the initial response to the recent wildfires, the price tag for immediate recovery could range from hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars, depending on the severity and scale of the fires.For example, previous major wildfire events in California, such as the 2020 wildfires, resulted in billions in damages and recovery costs. The 2020 wildfires alone caused an estimated $12 billion in damages, while federal assistance and recovery programs cost several hundred million dollars.If the current fires in California have similar scope, it's plausible that the total recovery cost, including long-term rebuilding, could be in that range as wellpossibly between $1 billion to $20 billion, depending on how widespread and destructive the fires have been.\\"Tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.","title":"Biden just authorized $500 million in aid to Californians who lost everything in the fires.

No one is excited to vote for moderation. We Want passion? and goals.Moderation is Luke warm, and even God despises moderation.\\"I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negros great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another mans freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a more convenient season. Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.\\"Dr. King","title":"Tim Walz endorses David Hogg for DNC vice chair, continues endorsement trend"},{"text":"No, they'll believe it next month and say Trump did it.

Facebook will make most of its user data available to anyone whose check clears. That being said the underlying concern of tiktok over others is the Chinese ownership. Specifically because of the very common assertion which is backed by some information that seems legitimate that a policy exists in the current Chinese government which states that any company based in China must turn over any requested data to the government without question and if that company is then asked by a third party whether or not they provided that data to the government they are legally obligated to say no they did not. There's no direct evidence that this is definitely a policy nor is there direct evidence that this is not a policy. However rumors have circulated for years that such a policy exists. In the event that there is an actual policy in China that a chinese-owned company must comply with intelligence requests from the Chinese government and also deny that such a request was made or fulfilled, some serious concerns exist. Specifically tiktok repeatedly saying that they are not turning over data, becomes a point of contention if they are legally required to say that despite having done so. The problem is the Chinese government will never acknowledge whether or not this is a thing and as a result it creates a very serious concern. Theoretically Facebook sells all of its user data to China somewhere a record of that exists and could be accessed by the US government the US government would then be able to say oh China now has everyone's phone number and their GPS data. But if byte dance were to provide the full transcripts of every single US citizens text messages as provided by a phone having Tick Tock installed, then there would be no evidence that that transfer had been made.Generally speaking The easiest actual solution to most of these problems would be to Simply make a ban For any U.S government employee or anyone who possesses a security clearance or works on government contracts.

Prior to the trade dispute with China, soybeans accounted for a growing share of total bulk agricultural exports. In fact,\\nfrom 2012 to 2017, soybeans accounted for almost 50 percent of bulk\\nagricultural exports from the United States, up from around 25 percent\\nin the early 2000sIn theory, Chinese tariffs should lower the countrys demand for\\nU.S. soybeans. Tariffs essentially create an artificial increase in the cost\\nof U.S. soybeans to Chinese importers. Given this higher cost, Chinese importers should purchase fewer soybeans from the United States,\\nthereby depressing prices for U.S. soybeans while raising prices for Chinese consumers. As a result, the quantity of soybeans traded between\\nthe two countries should decline.\\n \\nHowever, several intermediate steps follow the implementation of\\na tariff and could influence the magnitude of outcomes in U.S. markets.* For example, the tariff is not directly applied to U.S. farmers, agribusinesses, or exporters but is instead applied to soybeans as they are purchased at the port of entry by Chinese importers. \\n * The Chinese importer who pays the tariff has the option of passing the costs on to the Chinese consumer or\\n * submitting a plea for tariff relief or exemptions to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Moreover, soybean markets and commerce are structured differently in China than in the United States.* For example, a large portion of soybeans are purchased by state-owned\\nenterprises as opposed to publicly traded companies. As a result, the\\neconomic effects of the recent tariffs on soybean markets are challenging to estimate in practice.","title":"CMV: Trump will likely achieve his goals.

Sending carriers to scare off Israels enemies, shooting down missiles aimed at them, providing military aid without question or delay.Then on the topic of Ukraine, Biden rallied a massive international coalition to aid Ukraine and turn Russia into a pariah state. He was always a bit slow to approve new escalations against Russia, but most of the delays had to do with Republican opposition, not any lack of will from Biden. Ukraine would likely not exist anymore if not for Biden coordinating intelligence with Ukraine and providing massive military and economic aid.It seems like much of Bidens \\"weakness\\" in foreign policy has been based on perception and not fact. Obviously it's not totally cut and dry like that, but still. Ukraine still stands today because of Western aid. Israel has emerged victorious in large part due to Bidens policies. China hasn't started shit after seeing what happened to Russia.That doesn't seem weak to me.","title":"Americans have dimmer view of Biden than they did of Trump or Obama at term's end"},{"text":"Is this him walking back his bullshit?","title":"He mustve learned Canada is liberal"},{"text":"What's stopping any company from selling data to China?

Minow [then chairman of the Federal Communications Commission] who declares: There is censorship by ratings, by advertisers, by networks, by affiliates which reject programming offered to their areas. It is the same Mr. Minow who threatens to revoke the license of any station that does not comply with his views on programmingand who claims that that is not censorship . . . .[This collectivist notion] means that the ability to provide the material tools for the expression of ideas deprives a man of the right to hold any ideas. It means that a publisher has to publish books he considers worthless, false or evilthat a TV sponsor has to finance commentators who choose to affront his convictionsthat the owner of a newspaper must turn his editorial pages over to any young hooligan who clamors for the enslavement of the press.

OP seems to take it for granted that the vast majority of the population agree that life in America is intolerable, that this should be solved by dismantling 'the System', and that everyone understands the System in a similar way. I suspicious of that, and OP don't seem to offer any formula for building that concensus if it doesn't really exist.Saying we arent organized to do that right now doesnt negate the overall point of suggesting this is the the most effective way forward.Sure. But if a majority of the American population are committed to taking dramatic actions in a coordinated fashion, they'll be the dominant force in American electoral politics. Pointing that out does negate the need to collapse the social order by disengaging with the economic system.The failure of American democracy isn't that that the people who get elected aren't able to take office and enact policy. It's that bad politicians often get elected, and decent politicians often end up beholden to constituencies that want bad things. Money is a big driver of both these issues. But if half the population has already made up their minds, that problem goes away.The 51% of the 99% can agree to join a political party, it doesn't matter which, and back a slate of candidates. In relatively short order, their people will hold every elected office within that party, and their candidates will win every primary. Those candidates will then smash their opponents in the general elections. The newly elected leadership of the country won't owe favours to monied interests and they won't need significant campaign contributions to secure relection. They'll need to deliver on their promises to 51/99%.

Lady Justice is supposed to be a symbol that courts protect the rights of the people, blindfolded to emphasize impartiality. But when there is no equal consequence for crimes, when the wealthy are able to postpone and avoid consequences that the average American would experience, when a Supreme Court Justice such as Thomas accepts large gifts with no consequence, this is just more confirmation that the scales of justice are tipped.","title":"Democrats fume over Alito-Trump call"},{"text":"None of this changes the fact that the NRA has a large number of members who are very passionate and vocal about this issue.

But instead of updating their data centers to comply, Facebook sues the EPA on 1st amendment grounds by pointing out that enforcement would mean shutting down the data centers and prevent them from hosting content. I would not want the courts to rule in Facebook's favor in such a case.Between the way this ban singles out TikTok, and the way ownership is more closely related to content/speech I am concerned that a ruling against TikTok may set a bad precedent for 1st amendment cases in general, but I hope any ruling in TikTok's favor is narrow.","title":"Discussion Thread: Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in Case on TikTok Ban"},{"text":"I can't help but think that we're seeing problems like appeasement, anti-Semitism, lackadaisical responses to coups, etc. because the Greatest Generation is now almost entirely gone.

The fact that America would elect a felon as President is part of a much deeper problem that we now know goes beyond him, and that is ultimately what it will be our goal to help solve.

Part of the infrastructure bill was used to bulk up the \\"Revolving Funds\\" so they could offer loans close to zero % interest.  As municipalities pay these loans back, the funds can be lent out again for the next project.  It's a neat system but there is a TON of red tape to navigate, which is almost entirely delegated to state agencies, meaning that they have to staff competent analysts, engineers, and administrators.Theres a lot of pros and cons.  Ideally, communities would fund these projects out of their own tax base, but a majority of municipal income is from property taxes which are extremely hard to raise.  So instead, the money has to filter back into the community through a federal - state - local pipeline, each step costing a significant amount of money to administrate.  To counteract this, the projects are typically limited to maintenance activities only and do not fund new construction except in certain, highly constrained circumstances.At the end of the day, passing an infrastructure bill that just backstops existing programs without much innovation isn't all that impressive.  Stopping funding for infrastructure is like stopping showering or wiping your ass.  Once things get to that point, you are in crisis.  And you don't really give people credit for basic hygiene.

The Asian American career networking groups in DC also bore witness to the national securitization of large tranches of the Federal government.

The reaction to it is very remarkable, especially after enduring nearly 15 years of the evil superman trope through people like Omni-man, Homelander, and Zack Snyders rendition of the character. It is, according to the stats, *the* most viewed and talked about DC trailer, so its clear that there is a yearning for a more optimistic take on the character. Not only that, but Snyder fans soon came out of the woodwork to bash the new take. If you know anything about the man and his brand of politics, I think that might be a harbinger of how the manosphere and conservatives as a whole are going to react to the movie when it comes out: poorly.Needless to say, this might just be the positive model of masculinity people have been saying we need after the election. Not only does this bring the character back to his roots fighting for truth and justice instead of juggling the question do these people *deserve to be saved by me?*, but having him be recurring across multiple years fighting billionaires and monsters will allow him to *stay* in the public consciousness. That is the key part, I think. *Staying* in the public conscious will be a great tool to combatting toxic masculinity, especially if Gunns politics stay intact (which if youve seen Creature Commandos or Peacemaker, he does not keep quiet about).","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 10, 2025"},{"text":"You gotta remember that before politics everyone loved Trump, hes got no problem making friends with people and is generally a likeable person outside of politics.","title":"Trump says he and Obama 'probably do' like each other"},{"text":"So what, make democrats bend the knee for scraps while the GOP pillage the country?

Constantly telling voters that the economy is doing better than ever while many Americans are suffering from the outrageous cost of living was out of touch and disingenuous. Historically pardoning his son will go down as a bad move, and lends credence to accusations of the partys corruption. Contextually we know that Trump has pardoned worse and has got away with worse, but the history books likely wont reflect that. Ultimately much of the failings of his administration came from the Democratic leadership.

Society is nothing but individuals. A bunch of individuals is society.  It is a different way of looking at the same thing.\\nAnd to try answer your question:Much of Western Society, even though it claims to be liberal, is not actually liberal at all.  Much of it is actually much more anti-individual then a typical Islamic or Muslim country. Much of it is actually anti-human. The obsession with group identity politics and transhumanism and much of the focus on large all-powerful \\"democratic\\" institutions is intensively problematic from a Libertarian perspective. And much of their focus on \\"liberty\\" and \\"freedom\\" is extremely one-way.  They don't understand that their own belief system is a belief system and that they may not actually be right when it comes to attitudes about sex and women and so on an so forth... and that maybe they don't understand the perspective of other people or what they feel or think or trying to do.  Instead they automatically assume that anything not aligning to their own dogma is dogma and should be elimianted society as oppressive and evil. (Even though they don't acknowledge evil as something that actually exists.)\\nThis is why a important part of Libertarianism is the concept of \\"freedom of association\\".  It goes both ways.  If you want to associate with somebody and they want to associate with you... that is allowed.  But if you don't wan to associate with somebody, that is allowed also. And it should be entirely and 100% permissible for people to create societies that they want to be apart of with a common belief system and tradition and so and so forth.

But absent from their critique has been any acknowledgement that climate change has played any role in igniting the catastrophic fires C despite a consensus among experts that they have been caused by exceptional environmental conditions, including near hurricane-strength winds, low rainfall and unseasonably high temperatures....In later posts, Trump called on Newsom to resign and extended responsibility to Bass and Joe Biden, under whose presidency, he said, the Federal Emergency Management Agency [Fema C which last autumn had to tackle destructive storms in several southern states] had no money.The governors office rebutted Trumps claim on water shortages. There is no such document as the water restoration declaration C that is pure fiction, a spokesperson for Newsom said.Newsom himself accused Trump of fixating on politics rather than easing human suffering.People are literally fleeing  People have lost their lives. Kids lost their schools, families completely torn asunder, churches burned down, he told CNNs Anderson Cooper. This guy [Trump] wanted to politicise it.

In general, it could be argued that the state, or ruling government, has a valid interest in reducing deaths from alcohol, sexually-transmitted diseases, or public disorder. So, if a particular society deems it a suitable tradeoff, then of course you could pass laws that enforce strict alcohol consumption rules or strict dress codes. That would not be specifically \\"undemocratic\\" if it were supported by the majority or its representatives. I think there are a number of issues to be considered there though - the state may have an interest in reducing some perceived harm, but it may use laws or enforcement that do more harm than the harm it intends to reduce, or that interfere with people's \\"inalienable\\" freedoms - which ironically derives from a theocratic view of human rights - or that mixes in a religious doctrine with general governance, or that harms in the extreme those who disagree with those restrictions or with the perceived harm the enforcement of those laws may cause.For example, there are many who believe that any restriction whatsoever of what a person can wear - particularly a woman, is an overreach of government - that it is enforcing the rules of a particular religion - and that is an absolute no-no in Western thought - our first and most protected freedom is the freedom to practice (or not practice) religion, followed by our freedom to speak freely, and then our freedom to defend ourselves. In particular, those freedoms are \\"inalienable\\" and are not granted or denied by any government formed by men. In fact, any government that abridges those rights should be considered hostile to basic and intrinsic human rights, and should be overthrown - with violence, if necessary.The underlying fundamental principle is that all human beings - all \\"men\\" and all \\"women\\" and all anything and everything in-between - are born equal, with the same inalienable rights that are neither granted or denied by any government of men - you have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as well as the absolute right to freedom from religious oppression, to the freedom to express your opinions, and to the right to defend yourself - with violence and with weapons - if necessary to your self-defense. We also believe that all humans have a right to be treated equally under the law, in fact that is the primary duty of our government - that all people should be treated equally under the law, be they man, woman, rich, poor, black, white, Christian, atheist, Islamic, or whatever else. If you follow those principles to their logical conclusion, then it is not really possible or likely to be able to enforce a law that is clearly based upon a particular religion in a pluralistic society. However, we can still agree that murder is wrong - your personal rights do not include the ability to harm or interfere with another person's rights. Therefore, even if there were some minor perceived benefit to controlling the clothes women might wear in public to preserve the public peace from the leering eyes of men, such a law would be challenged in court and struck down as unenforceable in most Western societies - rightly so - because the \\"ends\\" do not justify the \\"means\\" - the harm caused to women and their liberties is greater than the public benefit of controlling men in a way that should not be necessary - men should be able to police their own behavior and not act like animals, and they have no right to stare at, impinge upon, berate, touch, or otherwise harass a women in any way that they wouldn't another man - who would of course present the threat of force to such an idiot, and so therefore prevent the issue in the first place.Do you see what I'm saying?","title":"Why Should Individual Liberties Take Priority Over Social Values?"},{"text":"I love your comments. ??","title":"He mustve learned Canada is liberal"},{"text":"Guy isn't even in office yet and it's already fucking exhausting.","title":"He mustve learned Canada is liberal"},{"text":"And that's all anyone will do. \\"Fume\\".

Joe Bidens eulogy was mainly a reminder of how different the two men were, particularly when it came to honesty and character.Plenty of comparisons can be made about the policy challenges faced by both administrations: inflation, energy, crime, global disorder. Yet they come with many caveats in Carters favor. Carter inherited his problems; Mr. Biden created his. Mr. Biden could have learned from Carters mistakes but ignored their lessons. Carter challenged a spendthrift, powerful Democratic Congress (though usually lost); Mr. Biden genuflected to a progressive minority. But its the contrasting characters of the two menone devoted to country and faith, one to party and selfthat reveal the starkest divide.Carter was elected on a promise never to lie to the American people, and he honored it. He was unequal to his governing task, sometimes misguided, but he genuinely wanted to make things better for the country. He was humble, and many forget he once fired half his cabinet in recognition that his administration wasnt getting the job done. Carters willingness to admit mistakes showed in several policy reversalsthe appointment of Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, a military buildup, the Carter doctrine.Mr. Biden leaves the Oval Office much as he burst into presidential politicsindulgently, self-servingly, pettily. Democrats presented Candidate Biden in 2020 as the wise old pol, the moderate deal maker, the successor of FDR. This was remarkable, since he is exactly the same Joe who was drummed out of his 1988 presidential bid amid charges of plagiarism and displays of arrogance (I have a much higher IQ than you, I suspect, he told a New Hampshire voter). The same Joe who constantly lied about his past and bragged about the Biden name. The same Joe who never took a position at odds with his party. The same Joe who always put that party, or his own reputation, ahead of the country.Consider the past month, a nonstop exercise in legacy building. Mr. Bidens historic clemency of federal death-row murderersadded to his blanket clemency for another 1,500 federal felons (the most ever in a single day, the White House boasted)meant he topped any of his recent predecessors on commutations. His order creating more national monuments and walling land off from development makes him the president who conserved more lands and waters than any other U.S. president in history. His latest illegal student-loan relief plan was another historic step for an administration that has forgiven more student loan debt than any Administration in history.Personal indulgences and pokes at rivals have also been features of the past month. Remember Carters promise never to lie? Mr. Biden promised he wouldnt pardon his son Hunter for the serious crimes of tax evasion and lying on a firearms background check. He did it anyway, after his party lost the election. He jetted off to St. Croix for his final vacation (one of many) as president. And while most presidents dont take official foreign trips in their final month, Mr. Biden decided to devote three days of his penultimate week swanning off to Italy for a private audience with Pope Francis. (Mr. Biden canceled as fires raged in California.)His recent Medal of Honor ceremony was as politicized as they come. He handed out awards to George Soros (thanks for all the dollars, pal), the late Robert F. Kennedy (take that, Junior), Anna Wintour (appreciate your putting Jill on the cover of Vogue twice), and Hillary Clinton (it should have been you, babe). This ceremony followed Mr. Bidens bestowal of the Presidential Citizens Medal on Liz Cheney, in thanks for her vocal Trump opposition. Also getting the medal were longtime Biden buddies Ted Kaufman and Chris Dodd, both former senators. Can anyone imagine Carter devoting his final months to petty jabs and cronyism?And while its one thing for a president to rush to finish projects, can anyone imagine Carter actively sabotaging an incoming administration? Signing hasty contracts with federal union workers to make it harder for his successors government efficiency team? Using a 1950s law to put 625 million acres of water off limits to development, to derail Donald Trumps energy plans? His Justice Departments attempt to publish special counsel Jack Smiths allegations against Mr. Trump, even though Mr. Smith abandoned his cases?Mr. Bidens party continues to protect him, even though hes never returned the courtesy. Hes left Democrats to defend his family business, his Afghanistan debacle, his coverup of his declining capacity, his pardons. Had he left the presidential race sooner, Democrats might have kept the White House. Stunningly, the press reports Mr. Bidens biggest regret is that he dropped out at all. Thats in keeping with his recent taunt at the media: I know more world leaders than any one of you have met in your whole goddamn life.Mr. Biden noted at the eulogy Carters enduring attribute: character, character, character.

It was acceptable in various religions and cultures until the majority of lawmakers (in ancient times) started following religions that suggested otherwise. Now it's a law. So if Dems want to call for total separation of church and state, who decides that murder is a crime and why? What's the difference between human sacrifice and an abortion? There can never truly be separation of church and state.

You're speaking about societal taboos, essentially. Not crimes, but still things that are considered greatly immoral.You're actually wrong in thinking that Western societies *lack* taboos. We have very strong taboos against many things. Just different ones to those in your society.In other words, *no one is actually saying any and all social-norms-related-pressure is automatically bad.*From a practical perspective, when a community collectively rejects harmful behaviors, their prevalence tends to decrease, which benefits society as a whole.The question is what behaviors are harmful. How does one define \\"harm\\" in the first place? What acts as a deterrent is societal opinion, and it would be undemocratic to legislate against people's freedom to hold and express opinions about certain behaviors.I agree with you entirely. Although the term you're looking for is not \\"undemocratic\\" but rather \\"illiberal.\\" It is *illiberal* to legislate against people's freedom of conscience (which includes their rights to hold opinions) and speech (which includes their rights to express such opinions). It is perfectly \\"democratic\\" to ban opinions or expressions of any kind so long as a majority supports said bans. Furthermore, why are we often labeled as a patriarchal society when men face many similar restrictions as women?I agree with you to an extent. I've criticized feminists for calling the West \\"patriarchal,\\" and used the same argument. Under Western society's norms about gender, men certainly aren't free to live however they wish.That said, in theory, a society can be \\"patriarchal\\" yet STILL greatly controlling towards *both* sexes **if** that society's norms, whilst still highly rigid and prescriptive and demanding, contain the idea that women's lives should generally be controlled and regulated by men (in addition, in your society a lot of the norms surrounding sex and gender are not *just* social norms, but are intertwined with the legal system and sometimes enforced with interpersonal violence rather than mere disapproval). \\"Women are ruled by men\\" doesn't *preclude* \\"and men are ruled by [Ruling Entity Goes Here].\\"","title":"Why Should Individual Liberties Take Priority Over Social Values?"},{"text":"They blame democrats for hurricanes and fires caused by weather machines and Jewish Space lasers.\\nThey blame democrats for getting teachers in grade schools to do daily trans surgery on little boys, cutting off penises with scissors.\\nOf course the idiot maggot cult will find a way to blame democrats.","title":"Are republicans still going to claim that Biden mismanaged the economy?"},{"text":"you and i know thats never going to happen.like many others, i think this is largely about people filming genocide in palestine, but the solution being proposed is letting zuckerberg et al be the ones to manage all that delicious, valuable data instead of some singaporean company (and also suppress palestinian genocide stuff via algorithm tuning)","title":"Discussion Thread: Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in Case on TikTok Ban"},{"text":"you mean the American Rescue Plan? and the Inflation Reduction Act?   \\nthe American Rescue Plan provided:Direct checks  \\nExtended UI  \\nTripling the child tax credit  \\nFunding schools and small businesses  \\nAnd much more  \\n (Every single republican in Congress voted against the plans)","title":"Biden distributes $5B in last infrastructure push"},{"text":"i get excited when people talk about increasing the number on the bottom line, especially when it's being fertilized with the blood of innocents.","title":"BIDEN just approved 8 BILLION dollars aid to Californians devastated by wildfires!!!"},{"text":"US STEM PhD.

Conversely, you arent oppressed if people dont like you because you said that.However, if the government bans you from saying that, and punishes you for saying that, that is oppression. You are having your autonomy restricted. In the west, people generally dont like having their autonomy restricted unless there is a good reason to do so. For example, we allow people to smoke, to drink, to say offensive things, to fornicate, to commit adultery, to practice homosexuality, to change their gender, among all kinds of other things that arent allowed in other places. Its allowed because doing things dont actually really harm anyone else, and laws against this are viewed as an unjust restriction on personal liberty.In fact, banning these things, would be viewed as oppression. It isnt up for the government to dictate what you say, who you sleep with, what you out in your body, etc. People can judge you for that, but the majority forcing you to not be able to do that is more oppressive than the opposite.

From a practical perspective, when a community collectively rejects harmful behaviors, their prevalence tends to decrease, which benefits society as a whole.The key element here is: \\"when the community collectively rejects\\".  If people don't drink because of the social stigma, personal ramifications, and/or religious beliefs, that's perfectly acceptable.  They're choosing not to engage in risky behaviors.  That's the key point.If people don't drink because someone in a spired building said so, that's an infringement on freedom.  We found in the US that it doesn't work.  The 1920s featured a ban on alcohol.  Not only was there more drinking during this time, but it was more dangerous (because people weren't as responsible), and it created a huge organized crime market around it.  If people drink and that drink causes them to become dangerous (angry drunk, drunk driver, etc.) and the government doesn't hold them accountable for their actions while under the influence, that's also a problem.  But the government should address the actions themselves, and not the choices that lead up to it.Alcohol is present in many religions.  Christianity is the biggest, in which it is said Jesus turned water into wine.  Many other religions have wine or other alcohol present in ceremonies.  It's encouraged in Voodoo.

If you look at any nation on google maps and randomly zoom into it, you'll realize of how many different regions, villages, towns, landscapes etc. a nation consists. Not to mention the cultural and social differences. I consider it stupid to call a nation a home, it's in general way too big, too complex, an almost infinite abstraction to what a home really is.

My claim is not a conspiracy theory; it's an observation that many people share about the media's tendency to align with established political narratives. This happens across political spectrums, and pointing it out does not make me insincere or aligned with Musk.Now, regarding Musk.1.Yes, he is extremely wealthy and influential. But so are many individuals who own or control media platforms. Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and Rupert Murdoch controls a significant share of media outlets globally. Wealth and influence alone are not inherently problematic. The focus should be on actions and their implications, not the mere fact of wealth.\\n2.You claim Musk uses Twitter to impact democratic conversation in Europe without transparency. This is an assertion without specific evidence. If you are referencing shadow banning or algorithm changes, these are accusations made by various political figures across the spectrum. Transparency in moderation policies is a legitimate concern for all platforms, but this isnt unique to Musk or Twitter. It has been a broader issue across social media for years. Do you have clear, verified examples of Musk personally interfering in ways that undermine democracy?3.Regarding the claim that Musk is allegedly making financial contributions to European right-wing parties. First, there is no publicly available evidence to substantiate this claim. If such contributions have occurred, they would likely be recorded and disclosed according to the political finance laws in the respective countries. Until verifiable evidence is presented, this remains an unsubstantiated allegation. Accusations without proof do little to advance the conversation and instead serve to vilify Musk based on speculation.But even if Musk has made financial contributions to political parties, it is important to remember that his money is private, and he has the legal right to use it as he sees fit within the bounds of the law. The notion that donating to a political party,? is inherently wrong contradicts the principles of a pluralistic democracy. Individuals, corporations, and interest groups across the political spectrum frequently make political donations. This is a normal and accepted practice in democratic systems.4.You mention the great replacement theory without citing specific instances of Musk explicitly endorsing it. Musk has made controversial statements, but labeling him as a promoter of extreme right conspiracy theories requires evidence of intent and context. Misinterpretations of provocative comments are not the same as genuine promotion of harmful ideologies.5. Musk has openly criticized the Digital Services Act (DSA), but challenging legislation is not inherently undemocratic. Many people, across political lines, have legitimate concerns about how social media platforms should balance free speech with combating misinformation. Debate on this issue is vital in a democratic society. Labeling dissent as \\"dangerous\\" stifles that discussion.\\n6.Dismissing Musk as batshit crazy is not an argument but a personal attack. Even if one finds his behavior erratic or unorthodox, it does not negate his right to participate in public discourse or justify dismissing his actions without evidence.Finally, your assertion that the AfD is extreme right and theres no other way around it is overly simplistic. Political classifications are not binary, and labeling a party as extreme right without engaging with their actual policies means nothing. The AfDs positions on immigration, public spending, and cultural integration are not extreme by virtue of being unpopular with mainstream parties. Many democratic nations have parties advocating for stricter immigration policies without being labeled extreme or fascist.You state that the problem is Musk abusing his power to impact public discourse, but this assumes that Musks actions are inherently abusive. Is it abusive for other influential individuals or media owners to shape narratives? Is it abusive for EU leaders and regulators to impose their views on tech platforms? If so, where do we draw the line? Public discourse is influenced by countless actors, wealthy individuals, governments, corporations, and ordinary citizens alike. Musk is one of many voices, and targeting him specifically seems more about personal distaste than actual evidence of harm.If you believe Musk or AfD is undermining democracy, the burden is on you to provide clear, substantiated examples of how their actions violate democratic principles. Until then, calling Musk or AfD extreme without addressing their arguments only reinforces my view that these labels are tools to dismiss dissent rather than engage with it.","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"Listen, if I run a marathon in a good time and during the last mile, I diarrhea myself and then start shaking my ass like a dog so it splatters all over the people watching, my legacy isn't going to be my good mile times for the first 25 miles.","title":"Biden's presidency is full of major accomplishments.

In December, wind was the largest source of electricity for the first time, ahead of hydro and nuclear power, making up 35% of production, with record monthly output, the SWEA said. \\"The December outcome gives hope. Wind power can account for a large part of the electricity production needed for electrification not to lose momentum, to enable a climate transition, and to achieve Sweden's climate goals,\\" it said.\\nFor all of last year, wind accounted for 25% of generation, up from 22% in 2023, after hydro and nuclear power. Still, the Swedish government in November rejected applications to build 13 offshore wind farms, citing Baltic Sea security concerns. It also removed subsidies for connecting offshore wind projects to Sweden's power grid. The government believes Sweden needs to double electricity output in the next two decades to around 300 TWh to meet higher demand and reach climate targets, and it plans to build out nuclear power. \\"2024 offered normal winds, but thanks to the expansion of wind power, the annual production was 40.8 TWh, the highest annual production ever,\\" SWEA said, citing official data.\\nAn SWEA spokesperson said that, assuming similar wind strengths and electricity prices, output from wind power should be at least as big in 2025 as in 2024.!ping ECO&amp;EUROPE","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Even if they incite a violent mob.\\nIt's always a slippery slope.

To create such a requirement would create one hell of a perverse disincentive to avoid war even when it is in the best interests of the country. Imagine if we had run with this idea historically. It would have become a major problem in early American history given the disputes between the preeminent power of Great Britain and the far weaker United States which escalated to war in 1812. Such a system, subjected to the stress of crisis, would likely have seen either the United States back down in a major dispute or quite possibly the President being incapacitated, killed, or captured. In the former situation where 1812 is averted, America would likely have become an actual militaristic society wherein all leadership must be vetted to have a demonstrated willingness to kill or be killed for fear that a President who values the lives of themselves or others would again be bullied by other powers. This presents problems for the quite small standing army of the United States because it is a tiny organization that now is a stepping stone to becoming the highest authority in the United States. In the \\"1812 still happens,\\" path, having President Madison fight would have been a fantastic way to learn the lesson that many pre-modern political systems had to learn and relearn: don't put valuable decision makers in proximity to pointy bits or else they may be rendered incapable, dead, or worst of all, captured. I should not have to explain the problem that having a decision maker who is supposed to make hard decisions in the best interests of the polity now in the possession of a hostile polity that would really rather he make decisions in their hostile polity's best interests would not likely be conducive to the original polity's best interests. Even a self-sacrificial decision maker understands that successions can be quite destabilizing for a wide variety of reasons and thus even making the most optimal decision in this is still far from optimal. Either way, American politics would absolutely see a militaristic turn that likely doesn't see much possibility of rapprochement with the British. Fair to note that even now, Iran regularly unofficially gets into hostilities with us through IRGC-commanded proxies, and we think it is more likely than not that North Korea and the PRC will pick fights with our allies within the next few decades. As if things weren't bad enough for our credibility, this idea would be one of the few conceivable ways to make that problem worse.Keep in mind also that the military, not now but especially not in the past, is not exactly a representative slice of America. It wasn't until Panama when we had the first time American servicewomen engaged in hostilities with an opposing force. Even now, it was only within the past decade that a number of combat positions were opened-up to women, officially a variety of MOS codes are still categorically unavailable to women which is not great in this paradigm since those ones are still the ones that get the bulk of book deals and media about them. Trans people for the foreseeable future maybe stuck stuck in a pattern where their ability to serve in the military is going to ping-pong between administrations. More reasonably, people with a variety of disabilities categorically may not serve in the military, so this paradigm would have barred FDR from the Presidency and, even as a non-succ, that is a damning statement.Fair to note that, in deciding on this whole \\"republicanism\\" thing and the subservience of the military to civilian governance, the Founding Fathers were also trying to reject a frustrating dynamic of the British military. To give a an example of the problem, remember how in *Master and Commander*, the midshipmen were literal children? That was an actual thing the British Navy did. You see, in having a large navy and a large empire, you tend to have large families of people whose dads and uncles were naval officers who had gained peerages through their service and thus had connections to rush right into being Midshipmen in spite of being literal children, or, alternately, young aristocrats who wanted to advance their status given their low probability of inheritance given British aristocratic inheritance used who used their family connections to again become Midshipmen to advance their status and hopefully gain peerages and landed titles again in spite of being literal children (one such was King William IV who, not being expected to inherit due to his two older brothers, joined the Navy in this fashion). It was hoped in using the state militia model and a small standing military and a promotion of the ideal of civilian governance as an ideal, we could just avoid that sort of thing and have a quality, mission-oriented military free of that sort of politicking, and even abandoning the state militia model in favor of a large standing army, it's mostly worked out. Well, kiss that goodbye because now military personnel are all potential Presidents to-be. This might have some negative effects on who enlists and decision at all levels as now the military, due to the incentives of an organization that exists to advance policy interests and achieve political power and the incentives of an armed force charged with conducting wars and a large scale of peacetime operations not being one and the same. Ambitious people and partisans and other sorts would now be quite interested in enlistment. Given extant examples of systems where the military is a prime avenue for acquiring political influence, you could say this might be quite a negative development given it may cause the rise of cliques run by the sorts people who make decisions that might be disadvantageous tactically or strategically but which might raise their status or cause rival cliques to lose out. There's also the general problem that a military filled with ambitious people is not something that tends to have an attitude of valuing civilian governance.TL;DR: We don't do it because then Senator Armstrong would have been President Armstrong, and I think that boss battle would have been too hard had I also have to fight the Secret Service and, like, every US military asset that can reach Pakistan ASAP. /s","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Republicans:  Dems spend too much!Also Republicans when Dems don't spend money:","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"And with your spirit","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Freedom of clothing and drinking alcohol are already guaranteed in the Egyptian constitution.

Well, what was the result? The bonds of the slave were bound more firmly than before, their rivets were more strongly fastened. Public opinion, which in Virginia had begun to be exhibited against slavery, and was opening out for the discussion of the question, drew back and shut itself up in its castle. I wish tooknow whether any body in Virginia can now talk openly as Mr. Randoph, Governor [James] McDowell, and others talked in 1832 and sent their remarks to the press?

Anyone who denies this should take a basic course in political ideology.The AfD (Alternative for Germany) is considered far-right by political analysts and observers from left AND right, particularly due to its positions on nationalism, immigration, and Euroscepticism. Labeling them as \\"far-right\\" isn't just a journalistic shortcut; it's grounded in their policies and rhetoric. The party has embraced anti-immigrant stances, openly criticized Germany's liberal refugee policies, and fostered connections with groups that hold extremist views.  These entities have accused Musk of election interference simply for allowing AfD leaders to speak on XI dont know from which echochamber you get your alternative facts, but in actuality it's  about the potential impact of amplifying specific political messages during sensitive times like elections. The debate is more nuanced than just \\"letting people speak.\\" AfD emerged as a response to the harmful actions of Angela Merkels government, particularly her decision to pursue policies of open borders and mass uncontrolled immigration. This was not a failure of governance but a deliberate misuse of public funds and a betrayal of German citizens. Public money, derived from the taxes of hardworking citizens, is meant to serve the common needs of the public: infrastructure, healthcare, education, public safety, and other essentials. Instead, this money was directed toward foreign private individuals, migrants who were accommodated, fed, and even given cash allowances at the expense of the German public.\\nThis claim is filled with mischaracterizations and oversimplifications, so let's break it down:1. **AfD as a response to Merkels immigration policies**:  \\nThe AfD capitalized on its fearmongering about cultural identity, to suggest it was purely a response to immigration policies is a typical oversimplification. The party's platform also targets the European Union, climate policies, and economic restructuring, issues that aren't directly tied to Merkel's refugee stance.2. **Open borders and mass uncontrolled immigration**:  \\n   The characterization of Merkel's policies as \\"open borders\\" is deliberately misleading. Germany's asylum policies were in line with international agreements, such as the 1951 Refugee Convention, which Germany is a signatory of. This wasnt a \\"mass uncontrolled\\" situationthere were checks and processing, even if it was a challenging logistical process. Labeling it \\"open borders\\" ignores the fact that these policies were rooted in humanitarian obligations, not a failure of governance.3. **Misuse of public funds and betrayal of German citizens**:  \\n   The claim that Merkels government misused public funds is deeply inaccurate. Public funds were allocated to accommodate refugees, but this spending was aimed at providing basic servicesshelter, food, healthcarejust as any government would for its citizens in times of need. The refugee program wasnt a luxury expenditure; it was about fulfilling legal and moral obligations. Also, many refugees who entered Germany contribute to the economy, either through work or by paying taxes, as they integrate into society.4. **Resources taken from Germans for migrants**:  \\n   The idea that public funds were taken from German citizens and given to migrants is a deliberate distortion. Yes, there was a financial cost associated with the refugee crisis, but its not a zero-sum game where money spent on refugees automatically comes at the expense of Germans. The German government also invested in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which benefit all citizens. Moreover, the economic contribution of migrantsthrough work, taxes, and consumer spendingcan offset some of these costs over time.5. **Betrayal of German citizens**:  \\n   This framing is politically &amp; emotionally charged and unsubstantiated. The German governments refugee policies were a response to a global crisis, and Merkels decision was aligned with Germanys broader values of human rights and international cooperation. Labeling it as a \\"betrayal\\" assumes that the well-being of refugees is inherently opposed to the well-being of German citizens, which isnt the case. A functioning, compassionate society is capable of balancing the needs of its citizens with its moral and legal obligations to others.","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"Its sad that they know they can simply attempt baldfaced corruption right in the open, knowing that the rightwing cult has grown so large and insane that they wont face consequences.

If I am truly to change my view, I need clear, factual counterpoints, not a barrage of emotional accusations.First, the suggestion that I require my views \\"sugar-coated\\" to change is a misrepresentation of my stance. I am not asking for emotional coddling but for logical, well-supported arguments. Dismissing my willingness to engage with opposing viewpoints by labeling it a fragile ego or a demand for \\"lap dogs\\" is both unproductive and contrary to the spirit of this forum. If you believe the data supports your position, then present it in a way that directly addresses the points I have made.You then move to historical anti-Irish sentiment, citing a quote from 1893 to challenge my point about past migrants funding their integration. However, the existence of prejudice does not invalidate the argument that mass migrations in the past relied on migrants own resources rather than state support. For example, the waves of European immigrants to the United States largely financed their journeys and integration themselves, often through family networks and mutual aid societies. Similarly, post-WWII migration from Eastern to Western Europe involved individuals seeking better opportunities, not states allocating public funds to provide housing, food, and cash payments as is done with modern asylum policies in Germany. These historical contexts differ significantly from todays government-funded programs, which are at the core of AfD's critique.Regarding the Nazi comparison, you cite excerpts from the NSDAP platform and claim they mirror modern far-right rhetoric. This is a flawed analogy. Policies restricting immigration or prioritizing citizens welfare are not Nazi. Many countries, including liberal democracies, have similar stances on immigration and resource allocation without being labeled extremist. For example, Japan and Denmark enforce strict immigration policies yet operate as democratic nations.You reference Poppers Paradox of Tolerance and Arendts warnings about treating facts as opinions to justify banning AfD. However, this interpretation misunderstands the nature of democracy. Popper warned against tolerating ideologies that would dismantle tolerance itself. AfDs platform, while controversial, does not advocate violence or the suppression of basic human rights. Banning political parties based on disagreement with their policies undermines democracy far more than engaging with their arguments.Your assertion that \\"millions of Germans voting for AfD makes them all extremists\\" is sweeping and unfair. People vote for political parties for various reasons, often driven by dissatisfaction with existing policies or concerns about issues such as public safety, economic stability, or cultural identity. Labeling all AfD voters as extremists ignores the complexities of voter behavior and dismisses the legitimate grievances that have led to their rise.The comparison to the 1932 NSDAP vote is a weak analogy. The historical, political, and social contexts of 1930s Germany are vastly different from todays. AfD operates within Germanys democratic framework, has not called for dismantling democracy, and has faced scrutiny from the courts and public alike. Equating them to the Nazi Party is hyperbolic and ignores these distinctions.Finally, you state that the truth needs to be said, yet you rely on broad generalizations and emotional appeals rather than engaging with the specific points I have raised. If you want to convince me, show me where AfDs policies or actions directly violate democratic principles or promote violence and hatred. Provide evidence that their critiques of immigration policy and public spending are inherently extremist. Simply repeating that they are dangerous without addressing the content of their platform does not suffice.If I am wrong, convince me with facts and logic, not accusations and false historical comparisons. I came here to have my view challenged, not to be dismissed as insincere or accused of hidden motives. If you believe my position is flawed, engage with it substantively and fairly.","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"That doesn't make it the better or worse 'idea'.

Moreover, they targeted Mossad headquarters, the airbase with most of Israels F35s which is Israels main method of response. That so many think Iran didnt make a serious attempt to destroy Israel is laughable. Everyone was saying that Iran knew Israel could shoot down the missiles. Israel couldnt, it didnt, the arrow 3 is top secret and not fully battle tested so capabilities were more theoretical, and the US only shot down 15 missiles as well with some making contact at the airbase because triaging of interceptors had to occur.

Your representation of migrants at the time is pure Hollywood.

Nothing new under the sun.AfD is not within the confines of what is acceptable in a Democracy. The Nazi party ran on a similar platform. Just reading its platform, the infamous 25-Punkte-Programm, echoes everything they stand for. The most pertinent exerpt follows:??7. Wir fordern, da? sich der Staat verpflichtet, in erster Linie fr die Erwerbs- und Lebensm?glichkeit der Brger zu sorgen. Wenn es nicht m?glich ist, die Gesamtbev?lkerung des Staates zu ern?hren, so sind die Angeh?rigen fremden Nationen (Nicht-Staatsbrger) aus dem Reiche auszuweisen.8.?Jede weitere Einwanderung?Nicht-Deutscher ist zu verhindern. Wir fordern, da? alle Nicht-Deutschen, die seit?2. August 1914 in Deutschland eingewandert sind, sofort zum Verlassen?des?Reiches gezwungen werden. ?It is exactly what the far-right says now. Theres no hyperbole. They violate the social contract by saying this. The idea that Democracy requires ??open debate of extremist lies?? is a deeply flawed idea. This quote, from Arendt, comes to mind:??But perhaps the most striking and frightening aspect of the German flight from reality is the habit of treating facts as though they were mere opinions. () in all fields there is a kind of gentlemens agreement by which everyone has a right to his ignorance under the pretext that everyone has a right to his opinionand behind this is the tacit assumption that opinions really do not matter. This is a very serious thing, not only because it often makes discussion so hopeless (one does not ordinarily carry a reference library along everywhere), but primarily because the average German honestly believes this free-for-all, this nihilistic relativity about facts, to be the essence of democracy. In fact, of course, it is a legacy of the Nazi regime.??The work of Popper on the Paradox of Tolerance and many others also come to mind.Hate speech and disinformation are not, in fact, part of Democracy. They are its opposite. A true free democracy thus requires strong Laws against parties like the AfD. The fact that it is not banned yet is a sign that Democracy is in trouble already.Millions of Germans voted for AfD because they are indeed, now, radical and dangerous extremists. Every single person who voted for this party is an extremist, no matter what were their inner reasons. Facts dont stop existing when enough people deny them.It is worth remembering that, in November 1932, 11,737,021 Germans voted for the NSDAP, then the most popular party. They mostly had the same ??reasons?? you are quoting now for electors of the AfD. Your appeal to popularity only convinces you.If these facts reinforce your mistaken beliefs, then so be it.

I might already know what kinds of things you mean such as my complaint that Hank, who hates androids, is on a case hunting a killer and finds the Traci's who attack him and Connor, and yet for no apparent reason thinks it's a good idea to let them loose into the city even though they might just kill again.  But I'm not sure if that is really what you're referring to.  I am most curious if you think there are other endings or major points where the game totally throws reality out the window to make thematic points like what you are saying gets done with Connor.  I spent some time trying to think if there were any other times in the game, especially endings, where the game chucked reality away and decided to make a thematic point.  Maybe one would be where Markus is peaceful and kisses North and the president decides to tell the military to stand down?  At least with that one, I can't say I find as much fault with it.  It might be cheesy, but it is at least in line with reality.  The public opinion of androids is rising and they are being extremely peaceful.  There is little risk in standing down to at least reassess things.  There is the Kara river ending which I think should get reworked because it is impossible to get a satisfying ending once you don't steal the bus tickets and I have no idea why the developers did that.  They seemed to have wanted to make the point that you have to break some eggs to make an omelet.  Like if you don't do at least that one bad action as Kara, you will pay for it later.  This too aligns with reality though.  Sometime you have to do something bad to get a good result.  I mean, see the Connor ending where he has to kill Markus to save the world.Probably the most heavy handed thematic moment in the game for me is where Markus becomes half-MLK, half-Jesus and is walking down the street remotely converting followers while soaring music plays in the background.  Very heavy handed, but this again doesn't fall far from reality.  Androids are able to communicate wirelessly and Markus seems to control a virus known as rA9 that allows him to convert androids into being his minions.  While the scene is a bit silly to watch, it falls in line with Markus's capabilities and desires to do what he's doing.Outside of the Hank / Traci's moment which is highly unrealistic and done only to show that Hank is becoming more favorable towards deviant androids, I can't think of a moment that defies reality to a grotesque level like the Connor \\"bad\\" ending.  The reason I'd give the Connor \\"bad\\" ending a lot more weight than the Hanke / Traci's moment is because it is literally the end of the game.  It isn't just some fleeting moment that makes no sense but the story carries on.  It ends everything including seemingly the end of Connor as a object.  Maybe if you can point out several other areas where the game will do things that are totally done just for thematics and ignores reality then I might start to see where this game shouldn't even be expected to follow reality, but at least from the time I spent really thinking about this, I don't think you'll find a lot of those moments if any.  I think the reason Connor's ending really bothers me is because 99% of the time this game stays within the bounds of reality.  Obviously it takes liberties here and there, but nothing other than the Hank / Traci's that goes so far outside of reality that it yanks me out of the story and world being built.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"NOTE: I'm getting \\"Unable to create comment\\" when trying to respond and have no idea why.  I'm going to break up my response into smaller segments so you might get a few replies from me before I'm done.I want to give you credit for writing what I think is the best response I've gotten in relation to making me reconsider my position.  While you are correct that another posted said something similar to you, they didn't really explain it in the way you did.I do still want to debate this though as I think you're overlooking some things.  The most important point is that you say robots are objects and thematically get treated as objects.  When you think about an object like a car or even a plate, how CAN you treat it?  Well, you can do anything you want with it ranging from treating it like your baby to utterly destroying it.  Just because it is only an object doesn't mean that you automatically treat it like garbage and in fact it is very unlikely that you will treat it like garbage until it becomes useless.  That brings me back to my lengthy write up that I started this thread with.  Does Connor's usefulness align with how he's being treated at the end of the game or is the game developer completely throwing out the window what CyberLife would do with the object named Connor in favor of giving the absolute worst possible outcome just to make the player feel bad?I also want you to consider a different ending that I argue is more in line with reality AND treats Connor like an object.  Would you agree that if CyberLife turned Connor into a person who made appearances for interviews and signed autographs and showed up for kids birthday parties would still be them treating him like an object?  Obviously Connor wasn't designed for these functions, but they would be in line with helping CyberLife rebuild their shattered reputation on the back of Connor's fame and success.  This is the ending that both shows that Connor is still treated like and object while also being in line with the reality of how this would have played out.  It also could be done in such a way that it gives the player a moment of real reflection on how things could have ended differently.  Like say there is a scene where the cameras are flashing and people are all asking Connor questions and amidst it all Connor takes a moment and looks a picture of himself that shows him as he once was.  A detective android in the field with Hank Anderson as they were on a case.  It could show a moment of longing for that life before he is pulled back into being the PR face of CyberLife.  Connor isn't free here, but rather an android being used by CyberLife to do their bidding.  I would argue this completely fits thematically and sticks with the reality of how things would really be in the post-rebellion world.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"If they are everywhere it will be easy to find and prove your point.

The claim that \\"refugees dont pay for their integration at first\\" is not only misleading but completely ignores historical context. In the past, mass migrations were often funded by the migrants themselves. Take, for example, the waves of European immigrants to the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These individuals uprooted their lives, paid for their own travel, and worked hard to establish themselves in a new country without relying on taxpayer-funded support systems. They arrived with little more than their skills, determination, and willingness to integrate into the culture of their new home.Similarly, after World War II, many Eastern Europeans migrated to Western Europe to escape oppressive regimes and seek better opportunities. These migrations were not subsidized by the host countries. Instead, these migrants contributed to their new societies through hard work and integration, funding their own paths to better lives. The modern context, where taxpayers are expected to indefinitely fund accommodations, welfare, and integration programs for foreign private individuals, is a significant departure from these historical norms.Your comparison of AfD to ISIS or a \\"pedophiles party\\" is not only factually absurd but deeply dishonest. ISIS is a terrorist organization responsible for heinous acts of violence, and a party promoting pedophilia would inherently violate human rights and the social contract. AfD, on the other hand, operates within Germanys democratic framework, has not advocated violence, and focuses its platform on policy issues such as immigration control, public safety, and the proper use of taxpayer funds. These are legitimate political topics that are debated worldwide. Comparing them to organizations or ideologies that openly destroy lives and societies is a blatant attempt to shut down debate rather than engage with their actual positions.Democracy thrives on open debate and the free exchange of ideas, even when those ideas are uncomfortable. Labeling AfD as \\"extremists\\" or calling for their ban simply because you disagree with their platform undermines these democratic principles. Millions of German citizens support AfD, not because they are extremists, but because they feel that mainstream parties have failed to address critical issues like uncontrolled immigration and the strain on public resources.History shows us that successful migrations often relied on the ability of migrants to integrate and contribute economically, without placing undue burdens on host societies. Today, however, we see a system where public funds meant for the common goods of citizens, like infrastrukture, education, healthcare, public safety, are being redirected to support foreign private individuals. This creates resentment, not because people lack compassion, but because they see their own resources being misused while their concerns about safety and integration are ignored.How am I supposed to change my view when these kinds of exaggerated claims and false equivalencies are presented as arguments? If you believe AfDs policies or rhetoric are flawed, engage with their positions and critique them based on evidence. But hyperbolic smears and false historical comparisons only reinforce my belief that these attacks are not about addressing real issues but about silencing dissent.","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"lol","title":"Why Should Individual Liberties Take Priority Over Social Values?"},{"text":"[The Elizabeth line has reached 500 million journeys!](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6232e9e1nno)!ping LONDON&amp;TRANSIT","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"[Chile surpasses 40% wind and solar for the first time in December](https://ember-energy.org/latest-updates/chile-surpasses-40-wind-and-solar-for-the-first-time-in-december/) Santiago, January 10th C Chile achieved a new milestone in December 2024 by generating a record 42% of its electricity from wind and solar, according to global energy think tank Ember. This surpasses the previous monthly record of 39.6% set in September 2024.  Throughout 2024, solar and wind generated a record 33% of Chiles electricity, up from 30% in 2023. In total, renewables provided 70% of the countrys electricity in 2024, while fossil fuels accounted for 30%. This marks a significant shift from just five years ago, when fossil fuels led with 53% and renewables provided 47% of Chiles electricity. Wind and solar were just beginning their meteoric rise, providing 14% of Chiles electricity in 2019.  The rapid growth in renewables in Chile has been provided by solar and wind, which currently account for 21% and 12% of generation, respectively. Their share has more than doubled since 2019 when solar provided 8% of Chiles electricity and wind 6%.  Embers Global Electricity Review published last year highlighted Chile as one of the countries with the highest share of solar in the world in 2023.  To continue advancing in the creation of a clean energy system, Chile enacted the Energy Transition Law in December 2024. Among its priorities is to expedite electricity transmission works to connect renewable generation projects and attract significant investments to strengthen and modernise the electricity sector. Check out Embers data explorer to learn more about electricity trends in Chile and other countries around the world. Chile is at the front of the global race to renewables and is determined to stay there.

There are plenty of libertarians who think that drinking alcohol is a bad idea.

It's why libertarians will tend to have a problem with most Asian countries: There is a societal code for behavior and libertarians reject that and think that every women should decide for herself whether to wear the hijab.  If she wants to wear it, that's fine.  If she doesn't, that's fine too.  And if other people in her society want to form judgements about her character based on whether she wears the hijab or not, that's fine too.  Personal judgements are fine.  Laws are not.  That's also why libertarians and US progressives do not get along.  We both think that abortions should be legal, but progressives want to take legal action to ensure they are legal.  Libertarians want to know why it was ever the government's or society's business in the first place if a woman goes into a doctor's office pregnant and comes out not pregnant: Why does there need to be a law saying that is okay?  Libertarians also don't get along very well with US conservatives because they want to pass laws about individual choices that we find in appropriate.

(NVDA) just days before leaving office, a final push in his effort to keep advanced technologies out of the hands of China and Russia. The US wants to curb the sale of AI chips used in data centers on both a country and company basis, with the goal of concentrating AI development in friendly nations and getting businesses around the world to align with American standards, according to people familiar with the matter. The result would be an expansion of semiconductor caps to most of the world  an attempt to control the spread of AI technology at a time of soaring demand. The regulations, which could be issued as soon as Friday, would create three tiers of chip trade restrictions, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. At the top level, a small number of US allies would maintain essentially unmitigated access to American chips. A group of adversaries, meanwhile, would be effectively blocked from importing the semiconductors. And the vast majority of the world would face limits on the total computing power that can go to one country. Countries in the last group would be able to bypass their national limits  and get their own, significantly higher caps  by agreeing to a set of US government security requirements and human rights standards, one of the people said. That type of designation  called a validated end user, or VEU  aims to create a set of trusted entities that develop and deploy AI in secure environments around the world. Shares of Nvidia, the leading maker of AI chips, dipped more than 1% in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the plan. They had been up 4.3% this year through the close, following stratospheric gains in 2023 and 2024 that turned the company into the worlds most valuable chipmaker.!ping FOREIGN-POLICY&amp;EUROPE&amp;TECH","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If there is an illegal, immoral, and unethical way to do something, a Democrat politician will do it.","title":"Democrat CEO used $5,000,000 overpayment from Florida to run for Congress"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|9EwnzGNjvmIG4)First rate, third rate man.

If Markus becomes peaceful, then Connor fighting him really is a bad ending, right?  But if Markus becomes violent, then Connor fighting him is the good ending.  In my game, I fully built up Markus to be the one that would destroy all of humanity given the choice.  He killed everyone he could during the game and made irrational demands like wanting an entire state for the androids.  Clearly if he'd been appeased with all this it wouldn't have been the end to his reign of terror.  It would have eventually led to the enslavement of humanity.

Labeling AfD as \\"Nazis\\" feels like a complete misrepresentation. The Nazis were responsible for systematic killings and the denial of basic human rights on a horrific scale. AfD has not advocated for violence or anything remotely resembling those atrocities. Without clear evidence of such actions, this comparison seems deliberately inflammatory and designed to shut down debate rather than address legitimate concerns.The comments youve cited from AfD leaders have been interpreted in a way that assumes the worst possible intent. For example, Bj?rn H?ckes remarks about Holocaust remembrance, while poorly received, were part of a broader debate about Germanys historical narrative, not a denial of the Holocaust or a call to repeat Nazi crimes. Similarly, Alexander Gaulands comment about the Nazis being a speck of bird poop in German history was insensitive, but it appeared to focus on the larger context of German history, not on trivializing Nazi atrocities. These statements can be criticized without mischaracterizing them as evidence of Nazi ideology. How am I supposed to change my view when such interpretations seem so deliberately skewed?AfDs actual policy positions, as far as I understand them, are focused on issues like immigration control, public safety, and the proper use of taxpayer money. These are contentious topics, but they dont strike me as inherently violent, discriminatory, or suppressive of rights. For instance, their stance on limiting immigration and promoting cultural integration is a debate that many countries have without being labeled Nazis. If Im missing something here, Id like to understand it, but so far, I dont see how these policies justify such an extreme label.The accusation that AfD wants to deport German citizens of non-ethnic-German heritage also seems misleading. From what Ive read, their policies are aimed at addressing illegal immigration and the integration of migrants, not stripping citizenship or targeting people based on ethnicity. If theres evidence to the contrary, Id appreciate seeing it, but right now this feels like another exaggerated claim meant to discredit them rather than engage with their actual positions.AfDs criticism of Merkels open-border policies is also being portrayed as hateful or extremist, but I see it as a reaction to policies that strained public resources and raised safety concerns for many citizens. These concerns seem valid, and the rise of AfD appears to be a direct result of them. Labeling them Nazis feels like a way to dismiss these grievances without addressing the underlying issues. Why is criticizing a policy that many citizens disagree with automatically equated with extremism?Equating AfD to Nazis doesnt seem productive or accurate. It shuts down meaningful discourse and prevents us from discussing real issues like public resource allocation, immigration policy, and leadership accountability. If AfDs policies are flawed, Im open to hearing arguments about that, but extreme comparisons like this dont convince me to change my view.If Im wrong about any of this, I genuinely want to understand why. However, these accusations and interpretations dont seem to hold up under scrutiny. How can I change my view when what Im being presented with feels more like an emotional smear than a substantive critique?","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"Not to move right during a campaign.

The AfD sees the spread of Islam and the presence of over 5 million Muslims, whose numbers are constantly growing, as a great danger to our state, our society and our system of values.[2]AfD members were exposed as participants in a November 2023 secret meeting of far-right extremists in Potsdam, including Austrian neo-Nazi?Martin Sellner, who discussed a?mass deportation plan?for foreigners and \\"non-assimilated\\" Germans, as part of AfDs strategy should it be elected to govern Germany.Following the exposure of the secret meeting, AfD politicians initially denied participating, but just weeks later began actively?campaigning?with the slogan, remigration, which was the term used at the meeting for the mass deportation plan.\\"","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"Also: Haven to paid russian \\"influencers\\" aka assets.

We don't care about any laws and rules that cannot be enforced and where no justification can be made that it is hurting others so eventually I think, in the west, laws and customs like this got abolished, since it was just a masquerade for the public and no one was truly following them anyway.To sum it up, society should exist to prevent people from harming others. Laws and structures that do that are understandable and I can get behind it. Like you can't go into your neighbors house and steal their stuff. You cause harm to them by doing it. All this morality BS though? Why is it anyone's business what you do, how you behave, what you drink and who you sleep with as long as it's consensual?

Europe at the time was messy, they were few good places to be.Regardless, by the beginning of WWI, the highest GDP per Capita were in Great Britain and Switzerland, who played their cards best in this era.About Switzerland, theyre a great example from History. Their dominion on watchmaking can be traced back entirely to the oppression of Hughenot protestants by France. A small anecdote, that says a lot about the mechanisms.

Siding with extremist theocrats who read sacred texts all day long wont yield the same results as siding with scientific-minded people regardless of their religion.

When trans folks are a tiny percentage and non trans women are 50% of the population, this means fucktons of extremely harmful false accusations over a problem that never existed in the first place.Simply put, this is not a good way to 'protect women', and it never has been. It's a way to control people, and create a fear of 'the other', when the other is far too tiny a demographic to do anything about it, and absolutely needs protections of their own.","title":"Judge strikes down Biden's Title IX expansion to LGBTQ+ students"},{"text":"Isn't that what the Nazis did?","title":"Considering leaving this app"},{"text":"I mean if I didnt work the last 1000 times it will definitely work this time right?","title":"Democrats May Signal a Fresh Strategy at the First Trump Confirmation Hearings Next Week"},{"text":"Hes selling himself as a savior not being sold as a savior by the deep state.

The existence of rare medical conditions doesnt negate the need for clear sex-based legal protections, particularly under frameworks like Title IX, which were designed to protect fairness for women.1. Intersex Conditions Are Medical Exceptions, Not the NormThe reference to intersex individuals conflates rare medical conditions with standard biological categories. Intersex people represent approximately 0.018% of the population, and the vast majority of individuals fall into biologically male or female categories based on reproductive anatomy and chromosomes.Policies must be designed for the general population while being flexible enough to accommodate rare medical cases separately. Using rare intersex variations to justify redefining sex for the entire population undermines the primary protections that exist for the vast majority of women who are clearly female..2. SRY Gene and Biological Sex Still Fall Within Two CategoriesWhile conditions like SRY gene transposition and Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome can result in chromosomal atypical cases, they don't erase the biological sex binary. These conditions are recognized as medical anomalies rather than evidence that sex is fluid. In fact, they often reinforce the existence of two sexes since they result in developmental differences tied to male or female biology, not a third category.Key Point: Legal protections for sex in areas like Title IX were designed based on typical patterns of male and female development. Expanding them to include subjective gender identity rather than biological sex undermines the clarity needed to enforce these protections.3. The Olympic Boxer and Bad Faith ArgumentsThe case of the female Olympic boxer (likely referring to Caster Semenya) is often misunderstood. Semenyas challenges were not about transgender identity but differences in sex development (DSDs). The controversy arose from physiological advantages related to testosterone levels, not subjective gender identity claims.This example demonstrates why objective, measurable biological standards matter in competitive sports. The goal isn't to \\"demonize women\\" but to ensure fairness in categories specifically designed around biological differences, like testosterone-driven advantages in athletic performance.4. The Small Number of Trans People Doesnt Negate the ImpactWhile the number of transgender individuals is statistically small, the principle at stake involves fairness and clarity in sex-based protections. Legal frameworks like Title IX were designed to protect groups based on biological categories, not identity-based claims.Example: Even a small number of biological males competing in womens sports can create disadvantages due to physical differences like bone density, lung capacity, and muscle mass. The impact of a small group can still significantly alter outcomes in female categories.The same principle applies to sex-segregated spaces like locker rooms and shelters, where the focus is on privacy and physical safety.5. \\"Trans Panic\\" Isn't a Fabricated IssueIts About Policy IntegrityLabeling the concern over sex-based protections as \\"trans panic\\" oversimplifies the issue. The discussion isn't rooted in fear but in preserving objective standards for fairness and safety.Conservatives aren't the only ones questioning this shift. Feminist organizations, female athletes, and even some progressives have raised concerns about the erosion of sex-based protections. These concerns include:Fair competition in women's sports.\\nPrivacy concerns in sex-segregated spaces.\\nThe risk of policies prioritizing identity over biology in medical contexts.Dismissing these concerns as \\"panic\\" fails to address the legitimate legal and ethical questions they raise.6. The True Policy Concern: Objective vs. Subjective Legal StandardsPublic policy requires clear, enforceable standards based on objective realities. Biological sex is observable and measurable, while gender identity is self-declared and fluid. Structuring laws around the latter weakens the clarity needed for consistent enforcement, particularly under Title IX and similar protections.Key Point: Ensuring fairness and safety for biological women under Title IX doesn't prevent compassion or protections for transgender individualsit ensures existing sex-based rights remain effective.Conclusion:The complexity of biological sex doesn't justify dismantling sex-based protections. The existence of rare intersex conditions and the small number of transgender athletes doesn't negate the need for objective, biological standards in legal frameworks. Addressing individual cases compassionately can be done without compromising protections for the broader population.This debate isn't about irrational fear but the importance of legal clarity, fairness, structural and legal stabliry,and safety for all.\\nIt's importat to add that these arguments are well supported within legal theories and principles.?Immutable Characteristics Principle (14th Amendment) C Protections based on inherent, unchangeable traits like biological sex.? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??Rational Basis Review C Legal distinctions must serve a legitimate state interest,?\\nsuch as fairness and safety.? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??\\nAnti-Subordination Theory C Laws should protect groups historically disadvantaged due to biological realities.? ? ? ??Title IX Legislative Intent C Title IX was created to protect womens opportunities based on biological sex.? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??\\n? ? ? ??Procedural Justice Theory (John Rawls) C Fair laws require clear, objective standards for all.","title":"Judge strikes down Biden's Title IX expansion to LGBTQ+ students"},{"text":"I agree in essence.

As do protests.  The media - controlled by oligarchs - will try to make you feel powerless and like your vote / actions / protests can do nothing, but it's not true.  Put a million people on a street in front of anyone saying \\"This is us *peacefully* telling you this will not stand\\" and they will react - or at least understand that change has to happen if things are going to remain peaceful.Unions, Protests, Voting, these are the things we all agreed to do instead of fire, pitchforks, guillotines and nooses.  They're the right choice in a society to work things out and find solutions that work for everyone.  They're powerful tools and carry very strong messages. Historically they've worked time and time again... though often only after many abuses and pain happened first. When no one votes though - that just tells the rich they're winning, that they've disenfranchised and convinced people that they're powerless.  That we can't do anything that matters.  Despite history showing that these types of actions will eventually lead to rebellion and revolution - that abuses of power will not stand in the long run... people in power still think they can get away with it.   Sometimes they're right... for a while.  It helps if you think of power as a drug and the super rich as addicts - they don't *need* more power, but they will fight to get it and fight anyone who they think is trying to take away their \\"drugs\\".  Like any addicts they're not entirely rational and tend to get rather single minded / self absorbed... and no addict likes being called an addict.  They're always different.

They'll lie, cheat, steal, hurt others, and rewrite their own beliefs and history if it'll get them their next fix... and they'll take us all down with them if we let them.
