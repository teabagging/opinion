The fact that China is apparently pretty interested in becoming involved with the canal is certainly adding fuel to the fire and, realistically, is another treaty violation if Panama is actively entertaining the same.

If you say \\"public utilities like Europe, but not in my lifetime because the quick change will cause backlash\\". What *is* your political alignment? 3. There is a split between Dems on equal outcome and equal opportunity, as there is in all left leaning parties. But equal outcome over opportunity is a very very radical position. And to say that unless you're there you're not really left wing to me is like saying because one man was 3 metres tall, noone under 2.7 meters is *truly* tall. Most European left wing parties are not equality of outcome, but of opportunity. They've been in public discourse pushing their ideas for much longer than the Dems. Who have to start from the position of being in a country that is fundamentally anti-government (and imo anti-intellectual).

And even if that weren't the case, there are the elements of federalism and the fact that it's a republic/ representative democracy. Now, does corruption exist? Absolutely. But if influential people are publicly trying to influence elected officials, and those elected officials are publicly swaying as a result...that's not an oligarchy, thats just sad.

It's also important to note that the switch to neoliberalism coincided with a removal of labor support and social safety nets, which is something many self-labeled neoliberals don't seem to understand today. I would go so far to say that it was actually classical liberalism, rather than neoliberalism, which is often considered center-right in Europe (neoliberalism is supposed to be the softer of the two and so it's been a bait &amp; switch tactic).Thing is that it's not just the US. You see the same happening in other developed countries: i.e. labor parties turning into supporters of free trade and no longer supporting their working class base.

Just like Germans, Italians have a negative view of the military since 1945 for reasons that are quite obvious and this take has been passed from generation to generation- italy does not have any significant enemy anywhere near the border. If we just have to defend ourselves, a minimal armed force and a decent navy is enough (and indeed we have a decent navy). If we build a significant army, it is necessarily for power projection and, in regard to this, see above- public expenditure in Italy is already extremely high. This is mainly due to pensions and a thousand of subsidies and tax discounts here and there that are really difficult to remove as they go to more than 50% of the citizens (if you ask me, Italy basically lives off the income of 15-20% of its citizens).\\nThis leaves not much for defense spending","title":"Prime Ministers of Sweden, Finland and Greece all agree Trump is CORRECT in asserting that European countries must increase defense spending to 5% of GDP"},{"text":"So this Republican did a ton of molly and still experiences zero empathy.

It is hard to draw a line when you are a oligarchy and when you are not, but certain milestones represent a significant shift in that direction. Its more like a spectrum with the US drifting further and further away from democracy towards oligarchy.Citizens United basically greenlit unlimited bribes, formalising that billionaires hold most power, however only indirectly. Trump 1 was the first time billionaires directly ceased executive power. Trump 2 basically drops all pretence with the richest man now also literally being the most powerful. Trump escaping any kind of criminal liability due to taking power is another significant milestone, powerful people already had a significant advantage but are now officially above the law. Billionaires have also slowly been taking over the media, with Musk buying Twitter and Bezos buying WaPo and turning them to their personal mouth pieces being prime examples. These are all signs of drifting towards oligarchy, but you cant identify one event or circumstance and say that is the moment democracy ceased and oligarchy started.

They were back down to about 2.1% back around October. So the opposite would be sending inflation sky high. Well, putting tariffs on everything would do that. What else, he got a massive infrastructure package pushed through. Cut child poverty rates in half through the American Rescue Plan. Historically low unemployment rates. Got the CHIPS act through.

If the Left took the side of Russia, they'd argue that sending armaments to Ukraine is no different than sending armaments to Afghanistan, which led to the blow back which caused 9/11.The political paradigms are illusory and only make post hoc rationales for their positions.In an alternate universe, Trump wins 2020 and the Covid vaccines are embraced by the political right because Trump's Operation Warp Speed bypassed the conventional strangleholds of Federal delays for medication development and got a miracle vaccine released in 18 months rather than 8 years.

HR, fundraising, volunteer recruitment, volunteer assignments, data entry, budgets, revising budgets, revising the budget again. Want to know the scary truth. I have worked with candidates that were barely to the left of Joe Manchin, and worked with candidates that would make Bernie Sanders look like a Republican. Each got my full support because in the end they understood that they were a member of our coalition that were willing to work to some common goals.","title":"CMV: The most meaningful way to assess the amount 'left' or 'right' a political party is, is to place the 'center' at the present status quo"},{"text":"Im saying that blue states have significantly more liberal abortion policies than most (if not all) European countries.

If you review the [sentencing memo](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.378539/gov.uscourts.flmd.378539.161.0.pdf) for Greenberg, the prosecutors seem somewhat skeptical of Greenberg's cooperation on Gaetz, though they give him credit for cooperation on 4 other people (2 individuals involved in a conspiracy to provide bribes and kickbacks, 1 individual involved in a conspiracy to submit false claims to the SBA and to bribe an SBA employee and 1 individual involved in a conspiracy to defraud the Tax Collectors Office). Greenberg was pushing for a downward variance on his sentence for ratting out Gaetz but the Florida prosecutors weren't all that impressed.I think it's absolutely reasonable that the Florida prosecutors have some questions to answer on the Gaetz matter but I don't think anything funky happened at Main Justice.Hunter's investigation was predicated based on a [Suspicious Activity Report](https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/T27-Exhibit-206-HWM-DOJ-Tax-Provided-Timeline-OIG-Email-04.15.2019_Redacted.pdf) from his bank (Wells Fargo) on 9/21/2018 for using an escort website in the UK that was skirting taxes. IRS opened an investigation on the escort service on \\n10/31/2018 and then a full investigation on Hunter on 12/10/2018. After that, we probably have seen the wildest fishing expedition and political hit job in history which included bullshit gun charges and entire branch of government (congress) and the media chasing around dick pics for 6 years. I fault Garland for appointing Weiss as Special Counsel and letting his dickhead prosecutors carry on the charade. I don't see Garland as an unbiased agency head, I see him more as a person who puts WAY too much trust in career lawyers at DOJ to do the right thing.

Even after the invasion of Crimea and the Donbass by Russias Little Green Men, Obama continued to refuse to provide any weapons or approve of arms sales to the Ukrainians in their fight against the Russian proxies in their Eastern frontier. Trump on the other hand, approved of the first arms shipments and training exercises with Ukraines military, and empowered US forces in Syria to bomb Russian paramilitary forces into ash and cinders when they dared to engage or troops.The Biden admin has, despite what many claim, has chosen to hem, and haw, and drag their feet on any aid provided to Ukraine. The delays in their willingness to give various pieces of wartime technology and materiel to the Ukrainian forces have been one of the major contributing factors to the current stalemate the two sides face. Whether it was Abrams tanks and Bradley AFVs, or offensive missiles, or F-16s, Bidens administration has been a day late and a dollar short on providing the Ukrainians with the support they need to actually achieve victory.If we had been willing to provide them with everything they needed back in 2022, the west would have been fairly well suited to demand a return of all Ukrainian territory. However, at this point, the war has killed a large chunk of the militarily-fit population of Ukraine, and allowed the Russians the time to dig even further into the entrenched positions they have held onto forin some casesover a decade, while also learning to adapt their doctrine, strategies, and tactics to the realities of the battlefield.If a return of all territory is your standard, you arent asking for a realistic resolution. You are asking Trump to either be a miracle worker who can create a Time Machine, or youre asking him to commit American soldiers into a protracted conflict with a great power that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons.So either you are alright with warmongering or you are simply uneducated on this issue.

And if you can't buy the country and try to take it by force, the military undertaking, including the cost of War, which would be exorbitant when you're fighting one of your largest trade partners, is something that would immediately affect every single American citizen and cause things like energy rationing. We would have civil unrest so quickly and you'd be fighting a battle internally and externally. Which means increasing internal policing efforts with a wartime mentality. Also when you have a war that nobody agrees with it's really hard to get everyone on board. So no one's going to do a land war and they're just going to try diplomatic measures and what possible things could be offered? Nothing aside from a giant check. The check has to come from somewhere. Anything you do is going to piss off the two main legislative bodies because they have to answer to their constituents who are going to complain about a costly war that is providing no immediate benefit. And there's certainly not going to agree to a massive tax hike in order to buy the Panama Canal. Because anyone of these people are not going to agree to a fire sale price. Premium real estate comes at a Premium cost.To buy Canada, you would have to not only pay the price of their entire domestic GDP and then something but also agree to take on all of their debt. It's just not feasible. We're talking about people like Elon Musk who said I want to buy Twitter and then someone sold him Twitter at a price that was way over asking and he just agreed to it because he wanted to look cool, but there was no negotiation. Now that was a price tag he could afford. If you say I want to buy Canada someone's going to be like that's going to be several trillion dollars. Elon Musk and the next three richest billionaires and every crypto bro combined could probably muster a 1.5 trillion dollar check if they liquidated their entire net worth. And Congress would never approve adding several trillion dollars of debt so that we could own Canada and have to merge our social net systems with theirs and give every single Canadian citizen a social security number, some account would come up that that would in and of itself add something like a trillion dollars of infrastructure merging.

Agree with most of the rest, but theoretically the trade thing could be vastly improved depending on how such a deal was structured, and I guarantee the US can afford more than $11,000 / year per resident if it was perceived to be in its best interests.","title":"Can Trump Buy Greenland?

The Social Democrats were a junior partner under the conservative CDU for quite a while - and in the real life, you have to compromise to get things done. Being a hard no on the austerity-policies of the conservatives would've not worked out. We would've gotten new elections, the Social Democrats would've been blamed for the instability and instead of a seat at the table, they would've been in the opposition.Now that they're in government, they want to actually invest into the infrastructure and the economy - something the previous governments neglected to do in a sufficient scale. They are furthest left on many economic issues in the now-busted coalition, but were held back by the Free Democratic Party when it comes to spending.Overall, you cannot say that \\"they\\" are \\"pro-austerity\\". As a party? Surely not. Some members of the parliament? Possibly. Their stance in various coalitions? Sometimes, sometimes not.You cannot say \\"they\\", as much as you can say \\"they\\" when talking about Democrats in America. It's a political party led by individuals.

These don't suddenly shift meaning just because society moves in one direction or another.Your slavery example actually proves my point. Abolitionists were left-wing in the 1800s because they valued equality and human rights over tradition and hierarchy - the same principles that define left-wing politics today. The fact that slavery is now universally rejected doesn't change where that position sits on the ideological spectrum.A better way to measure left/right is to look at the underlying philosophical principles a party supports, not just how they compare to whatever happens to be normal at the moment.","title":"CMV: The most meaningful way to assess the amount 'left' or 'right' a political party is, is to place the 'center' at the present status quo"},{"text":"Elon's little bitch is complaining again.

Nowhere is it more clear than with the LGBT agenda. That has had the greatest shift in public perception of any other subject since the 1980s. And it has EVERYTHING to do with the media putting LGBT people/characters on screen. Cable channels like MTV led the way, movies like Philadelphia and Basic Instinct participated as well, and LGBT characters quickly came to primetime sitcoms and daytime television, starting in the '90s. Ellen DeGeneres has always been cited as a major turning point in the culture by LGBT activists. As a result, the LGBT lobby has gotten absolutely everything they wanted in terms of legislation and court decisions in the last 20 years.And this is after a time in the '80s where actors have said simply playing an LGBT character on screen could destroy their career, as Harry Hamlin has said. There was a segment of early '80s movies that tried to portray LGBT lifestyles and flopped (Cruising, Making Love, Personal Best), and some TV shows with LGBT characters (like Sara) that also failed. But they just kept trying, had some success with niche \\"indie\\" movies as the '80s went on, managed to start making the characters more \\"cool\\" in the '90s than the earlier portrayals had been, and eventually gained acceptance and success in mainstream productions.Now it's at the point where studies have shown LGBT characters are statistically OVER-represented in media, such that public polls show the American public grossly overestimates how many LGBT people actually exist in real life. Which, once again, shows how what the media shows people on the magic box greatly influences how the public perceives the real world to be.","title":"Fetterman believes fascist label of Trump did not connect with people"},{"text":"Ok, but when you define 'status quo' should we say that goes for one specific country or go for the whole world?How about to comparative countries, like similarly economically developed?I think it's fair to compare the center to the status quo around the world for developed countries, for example, which is why America is definitely a conservative/right-leaning country for its religiosity and lack of socialized medicine for example","title":"CMV: The most meaningful way to assess the amount 'left' or 'right' a political party is, is to place the 'center' at the present status quo"},{"text":"I don't understand the use of the word \\"distraction.\\" You think people are not going to notice another pandemic or war because of the media coverage of this guy?","title":"Wake up"},{"text":"He can only do it if he apologizes to France and Britain and lets them have the Suez back in the name of fairness.","title":"Trumps Wish to Control Greenland and Panama Canal: Not a Joke This Time"},{"text":"Uh they renamed it because it got transferred from the Air Force to the space force","title":"'Orangeland' Has a Nice Ring to It: Trump Repeats Desire to Acquire Greenland for the U.S. ??"},{"text":"i thought nutcase is the correct term","title":"Nancy Mace has chemical imbalances, her resentful former consultant says"},{"text":"Bit like all sis women really.","title":"Nancy Mace has chemical imbalances, her resentful former consultant says"},{"text":"This is fuckin dumb and he shouldn't.","title":"Trump says he's going to change the name of America's tallest mountain back to Mount McKinley ??"},{"text":"Why?","title":"Can Trump Buy Greenland?

Its the kind of thing an overconfident freshman turns in and thinks the teacher will be impressed, but she just rolls her eyes and breaks out the red editing pen and torches it.\\n* Matt Gaetz sent tons of letters compaining about news articles which he says are proof the committee is leaking to journalists.\\n* Joel Greenberg discusses having his friend join two girls for a sex encounter and sends a photo thats clearly Gaetz identified as my friend.\\n* While arrranging a trip and overnight stay with some girl(s) Gaetz sends a picture of himself seemingly taken in a church cathedral (?)\\n* Matt Gaetz is frequently obsessed with having the girls obtain drugs for him.  Constant references to cartridges, rings, pens, all of which I assume are marijuana vape related.  Lots of references to other party drugs.\\n* He does agree to send money to girls for various alleged purposes like $250 Uber rides and school expenses, which could certainly be cover stories. \\n* Hes also notably cheap at times.  Girls complain that he forgets to pay them for sex encounters, and then later seems to forget about promises to pay, creating an awkwardness.\\n* One girl (Marissa I think?) converses about a plan of reminding him of his forgotten payment while giving him a blowjob, and withholding sex until he has addressed that.\\n* At one point Gaetz apparently still wanted a sex party weekend but referenced having low cash flow.  Instead of a promise to pay later, he suggest that weekends sex partying would be free/discounted as a customer appreciation event.\\n* Theres reference to purchasing a $400 moodhoop which I first assumed was drug related, but now I think it may be a hula hoop with LED lighting, common at rave parties.\\n* Committee leaders give him patient extension after patient extension and never take the bait on his snarky accusations of being weaponized or part of a retaliation by Kevin McCarthy.  \\n* After numerous impasses they eventually order him to appear and copy the House clerk to drag him in him if needed.\\n* Theres comical exchanges related to Gaetz being asked for evidence for his claim of having paid for his own trip to Bahamas.  He sends screen caps of his flight numbers to Bahamas which arent actually evidence of payment.  He also bickers with them because he sent the flight info *to* Bahamas but not *from* Bahamas based on his interpretation of their questions, and his idea of what travel info is versus travel itinerary.  Eventually its determined he lied about paying and the whole trip was a undisclosed gift from a sketchy marijuana business mogul of some kind.\\n* Gaetzs primary defense is claims that Joel Greenberg might be framing him, plus odd conflating of other schemes Greenberg was involved in.  \\n* Gaetz makes strenuous denials about sex and drugs that are laughably non-credible when you read through the appendices that show evidence details.","title":"Bombshell Texts Reveal Full Scope of Matt Gaetz Sex Scandal"},{"text":"A stopped clock is right twice a day, and his mental clock must have gotten stuck right at one of those points.","title":"Fetterman believes fascist label of Trump did not connect with people"},{"text":"She should be asked about this in every interview from now on.","title":"Bombshell Texts Reveal Full Scope of Matt Gaetz Sex Scandal"},{"text":"Called the simulation.

Trump said during his first administration that he was looking into the U.S. buying Greenland and canceled a state trip to Denmark after Danish officials said the autonomous territory that's part of its kingdom was not for sale.It's not even January yet, and the president elect has already proposed taking control of multiple territories and even trade routes outside the U.S.'s control. Which mind you, is all part of an effort to mitigate the consequences of his disastrous tariff and trade policies.He's not even in office yet and he's already doing damage control! And in the most ridiculous way possible! Look at how Denmark responded to Donald Trump, almost like he's a temperamental child who's lashing out because his parents won't purchase the whole Ice Cream parlor for him. \\"I'm sorry little Donald, it's just not for sale.\\"And keep in mind that his supporters portray him as a staunch isolationist. which is absurd to begin with considering his last administration's dreadful foreign policy.Not only was Trump responsible for escalating wars in multiple theaters during his first presidency, not only did Trump increase provocations and airstrikes in foreign countries, dropping more bombs within his first two years alone than were dropped during Obama's full tenure as president, not only did Trump cozy up to dictators and strongmen around the globe, weakening our alliances, emboldening and appeasing our enemies while aiding their proxy wars, not only did Trump literally negotiate with terrorists during his last term and publicly invite the Taliban to camp David on the anniversary of 9/11...but in case his supporters forget, Congress viewed Trump as such a dangerous interventionist that they had to pass not one, but two historic war powers resolutions while he was president. The first one to curb his support for the violent, Saudi-led war against the Houthis and the thousands of innocent Yemeni casualties, the second to lessen the possibility of a war with Iran after he approved another drone strike that killed the Iranian general, Soleimani. The consequences of which the US is still dealing with today. \\"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\\" Trump said in a post to Truth Social An \\"absolute necessity?\\" Really? Reign this idiot in! He wants to colonize Greenland ffs! If it's such a necessity, then why didn't you do it during your last term? Really? Taking control of Greenland is central to national security and world peace? Is Elon Musk about to weigh in with 100 Twitter posts by noon tomorrow about how he's going to \\"jokingly\\" make Denmark an offer?

Hes got a team of people ready and willing to bring the Ultimate Conservative Agenda to life (also said he had no idea what that was, his team later admitted that that Project is the gameplan). Also, hes doing tarriffs as his main economic policy, which is basically a consumer-paid tax on imports that companies will just force all of us to pay instead, meaning that *everything* will be more expensive (even stuff from our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, not to mention the massive increase in tarriffs for stuff made in China, yknow whats made in China? Almost everything the US uses or buys). Hes got people and industries panic buying either their important items for the next year, or as much as they possibly can for the next *four* years.Hes also massively deporting pretty much all hard labor professionals (think agriculture, construction, hospitality, the restaurant industries and other *mainly cheaper labor* industries), good luck getting hired help if your state is mostly non-white people, no white person is going to willingly want to do the backbreaking work that factory and large-scale farming requires when they can just work at a gas station or somewhere they arent required to sit in the sun for hours. Good luck with any new construction being done on time, or any construction work being done now from not being massively delayed because the big companies and the local companies run out of willing workers. Entire industries are gonna go to shit if hes serious about attempting to deport the amount of immigrants we have, and thats not even accounting for the massive immigration judicial backlog we have currently, the fact that we need some place to hold all these people and the various status of them all. His rhetoric is disgusting and its *scaring* people. The people who just wanted cheaper eggs and lower gas (Ive seen gas as low as in the 2 dollar range, thats pretty damn low but whatever) didnt vote for him to massively deport a decent part of the US workforce or for culture wars or to piss off some of our biggest trading partners and neighbors because some 2-bit elderly man with mental health issues and a degree practically bought by nepotism decided he wasnt done being president yet. Of course consumer confidence has dropped, the day after the election, people were mass googling how they could change their vote, Id say thats a vote of no confidence on this whole damn 2nd term if the US just did that process.

Biden's primary legislative accomplishments were passing massive fiscal stimulus through the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure law and a major subsidies for green energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. He also expended a bunch of political capital on a plan for widespread student loan forgiveness that even other Democratic politicians conceded went beyond the scope of the Executive Branch's powers. I don't see how any of these things can be considered remotely right-wing. Even left-wing commentators like Ezra Klein at the New York Times have said that the Biden administration has been the most progressive administration ever in American history.Whether Biden \\"ran on\\" these promises is irrelevant since he clearly made no serious effort on any of them once in office. Also I highly doubt most voters really believe he ran on those or even knew about it. Secondly the only real legislation passed in the Biden era was very very early on, the COVID relief bill. That was it. Nothing else of note happened. Infrastructure was written by corporate lobbyists and Senate republicans! The \\"IRA\\" bill is garbage and right-wing in many ways. The actual attempt to pass something meaningful under Biden called \\"Build Back Better\\" did not happen, and Biden then elevated and flattered the two Senators who primarily prevented it from happening. On abortion I think you're cherrypicking a bit but ok. However when it comes to healthcare, education, stances on wars etc the Democratic Party is way more right wing than those of Europe. Death penalty, etc. Also Ezra Klein is not really a progressive commentator and no real left winger thinks Biden is the most progressive, that is a talking point that some folks tried putting out there but it's obviously completely wrong.At least in Europe you can have MORE THAN ONE CHOICE, in the USA we aren't allowed that to begin with.

From what I've found she is currently 35. There is a pic floating around of May supposedly at age 25 in front of a car given to her with a note that says \\"Merry Christmas May Congrats for 15 years. Love Don &amp; Vicky\\" Don and Vick are supposedly Matt's parents' names. That would be 2014, the same year Nestor moved in with Matt. I have also seen her age being mentioned as 31 in that pic. Whats wierd is in 2016 she filed for joint custody with Nestor's father, Nestor Galban, Sr. That would be 2 years after Nestor moved in with Matt. Matt also posted a pic of him and Nestor together from 2012. So they had been around each other before he moved in in 2014. So why if Nestor was living with Matt did Nestor Sr have custody of him and why did May need to sue for custody?My theory is Matt is Nestor's bio dad. Other people have thought this too. The 2 supposed ages from the car pic are 25 and 31. Halfway between those ages is 28. 28 - 15 years is 13. 13 is May's age when Nestor was born. Matt likely knocked up May at 13 when he was 20. They hid the pregnancy and had May's mom raise the baby as hers. In 2014 when the mom passed away Nestor Sr didn't want to raise a kid that wasn't even his bio grandkid anymore so Nestor Jr got shipped to his actual bio dad. Nestor and Matt do look alike. It would also explain why Matt's parents knew May for 15 years. I just dont understand why she needed to sue for joint custody. Maybe as an inlet to get him citizenship in the future or a way to be in the U.S. legally?","title":"House Ethics Committee accuses Gaetz of 'regularly' paying for sex, including with 17-year-old girl"},{"text":"  It makes people nervous.Chaos often does.","title":"Trump again calls to buy Greenland after eyeing Canada and the Panama Canal"},{"text":"Dementia Donnie says a lot of things.

Ask them if theyve ever heard of the CNP. This group of Christian nationalists formed in the 80s and theyre the ones that set up the agendas for the first and the upcoming Trump administrations. Theyve been influencing politics for a long time but dont get much coverage in the news.Washington Spectator - [How the CNP, a Republican Powerhouse, Helped Spawn Trumpism, Disrupted the Transfer of Power, and Stoked the Assault on the Capitol](https://washingtonspectator.org/nelson-cnp/)Operating from the shadows, [the Council for National Policys] members, who would number some 400, spent the next four decades courting, buying, and bullying fellow Republicans, gradually achieving what was in effect a leveraged buyout of the GOP. Favorite sons, such as Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, were groomed, financed, and supported.In 2016, the CNP put its partners money, data, and ground game behind Donald Trump, as the ultimate transactional candidate. Trump promised it retrograde social policies, a favorable tax regime, regulatory retreats, and its choice of federal judges. He delivered in spades. By 2020, the leaders of the CNP were ready to go to extreme lengths to keep himand themselvesin power.Over the final year of the Trump presidency, the CNP took center stage. By January 2020, its leading figures had become sought-after guests on talk shows and frequent visitors to the White House. Many of its stated goals had been advanced. By March, the Republican Senate had confirmed more than 185 of Trumps conservative nominees for the federal bench. All but eight of the judges had ties to the Federalist Society, headed by longtime CNP members Eugene Meyer and Leonard Leo. Two of the CNPs favored Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, had been confirmed.Donald Trump remained a dependable ally, asking only for an audience for his megalomania and a free pass for the business interests of the Trump brand. In return, he delivered his dynamism and his unshakeable base.Ultimate realization of the CNPs agenda depended on winning a second term for Trump in November. With another four years, it could enshrine its socially regressive policies on the federal level, further blur the line between church and state, and consolidate huge windfalls for corporations and wealthy individuals.Youll find folks like Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon in their membership directory.[Council for National Policy Membership Directory 2014](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf) (Redacted)","title":"My family voted for Trump.

Trump was a lifelong Democrat before it became politically advantageous for him to change teams. He really doesn't care about what people do or how they live their lives as long as he gets whatever he wants. He's at his core a completely self-absorbed narcissist. He's had media training from crazy people who have been successful by being crazy. It's just as likely that all of his posturing about taking back canals and purchasing Greenland as a result of the fact that most new sources have been talking about Elon Musk and a failed bill and not about Donald trump. So what does he do when no one's talking about him, just runs out there and says something outrageous knowing that everyone's going to be talking about it and he gets to read people in the Press talk about how smart he is. Even my previously mentioned suggestion that this is a plan to back out of his tariffs, will not be something that he thought of when he started doing it it's just a convenient out that he creates from doing the crazy thing. This is a man who has a person who is paid $100,000 a year as a full-time private staffer, whose Soul job is to follow him along on the golf course behind his golf cart in a separate golf cart that has Wi-Fi, look up articles about him, use a portable printer to print them out, and then bring him the Articles so he can read the headline about how smart he is and then he gives notes to send to the editors.Occam's razor shows us that when you remove the unlikely scenarios the  likely scenario is almost always the correct one. So what's more likely? That the US government, which may or may not currently be operating as a oligarchy beholden to powers like the fossil fuel industry, is going to engage in a costly effort to Annex Canada which isn't guaranteed to succeed and may lose access to a number of fossil fuel sources, and will undoubtedly cause a negative impact for multiple fiscal quarters for any us-based fossil fuel company that has operations in Canada, or that Donald Trump is just saying crazy things like he always does because he knows it gets a reaction but will ultimately give up on the idea when the next shiny thing comes along?","title":"Trumps Wish to Control Greenland and Panama Canal: Not a Joke This Time"},{"text":"Trump also said Covid was a hoax, 1/6 was a hoax and Russian interference was a hoax.

During the period 2017 to 2019, Representative Gaetz used or possessed illegal\\ndrugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, on multiple occasions.  \\n? Representative Gaetz accepted gifts, including transportation and lodging in \\nconnection with a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, in excess of permissible amounts.  \\n? In 2018, Representative Gaetz arranged for his Chief of Staff to assist a woman \\nwith whom he engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating \\nto the U.S. Department of State that she was a constituent.  \\n? Representative Gaetz knowingly and willfully sought to impede and obstruct the \\nCommittees investigation of his conduct.  \\n? Representative Gaetz has acted in a manner that reflects discreditably upon the \\nHouse.

And from Bluesky, no less![Here's what we have so far in the Virginia SD-32 and HD-26 special elections.](https://bsky.app/profile/samshirazi.bsky.social/post/3ldyypxqy5224)  Both districts are entirely within Loudoun County, so these are all the numbers as of today.Topline: We've got 2,177 mail ballots received, and 1,090 early in-person votes.  So far, 2.09% of registered voters in SD-32 have cast a ballot.  I can't find results for HD-26, which is fully within SD-32.On the one hand, Virginia has a very long early voting period, and the next two Saturdays will have extra locations open.  There are also more than 9,000 mail votes outstanding, and those are more Dem-leaning in Virginia.On the other hand, I don't feel like leaving this up to chance.  The stakes are huge: **If we lose these races, the GOP gets a trifecta in Virginia and can destroy the state.**  And they've been noisy as hell about interfering in schools, rolling back voting rights, reducing gun protections, and restricting abortion.  (They *say* a 15-week ban, but so did the Florida GOP, and now they've got a six-week ban and regular attempts at total bans).Beyond the policy stakes, too, we're starting another four-year fight with Trump.  Do you want to start that fight losing control of a state, or barely squeaking out wins in safe blue districts?  Or do you want to start with a loud, clear message?  The day after the 4th anniversary of January 6th, I want us to blow out the GOP.  Let 'em know loud and clear that we're awake, engaged, and not fucking going back.Y'all know what's coming, but I'll say it anyway.  Get on the phones.[Here's a phonebank for JJ Singh and Kannan Srinivasan for Saturday.](https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/745939/)  If you want to hang out with some cool folks, [here's another with the VA Dems Women's Caucus for January 2nd.](https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/747000/)  We'll be volunteering for lots of these ladies in 2025.

In 2023, Mr. Gaetz announced that the department had decided not to charge him, leading the committee to restart its inquiry. But, at that point, the Justice Department refused to respond to the committee, according to the committee. The committee said that after three months without a response despite repeated follow up, it filed Freedom of Information Act requests with Justice Department offices, which to date have not been adequately processed. The committee continued to reach out to D.O.J. throughout 2023, having still not received a substantive response to its request for information, the committee said. The committee said it received its first correspondence from the Justice Department in January 2024. At that time, D.O.J. provided no substantive response or explanation for its delay, the report said. But the department told the committee it does not give nonpublic information about investigations that do not result in anyone being charged. The committee said this stance by the Justice Department is inconsistent with D.O.J.s historical conduct with respect to the Committee and its unique role in upholding the integrity of the House. D.O.J.s initial deferral request and subsequent lack of cooperation with the committees review caused significant delays in the investigation, the report said.It looks like Merrick Garland really *is* the mole.","title":"House Ethics report finds evidence Matt Gaetz paid thousands for sex and drugs including paying a 17-year-old for sex in 2017"},{"text":"Vanilla Ice","title":"Republican logic: Daddy was born in the Panama Canal Zone, so we get to take over the whole country 88 years later."},{"text":"I can't wait for Trump to destroy rural America.

The electorate would push against attempts to remove their existing health insurance plans, especially when a single payer would offer worse terms of insurance to many people with the privilege of a good insurance.- The federal structure of the US means that stuff like mandatory paid leave is usually enacted on the state level. The general lack of labor unions in the US means that government collaboration with them is obviously more limited.- The second amendment severely limits the ability of the government to regulate guns, limiting the federal government to half-measures like banning assault rifles and not allowing them to enact European-style gun regulations.- As for climate, I don't think Democrats are really an outlier here. Plenty of European governments work with the private sector. Electricity production is not nationalized in the majority of EU countries, so transitioning to green energy means working with private producers through incentives. Aggressive public ownership hasn't been a thing in most European countries in decades.

And so on to Step D.*  \\n  \\n*And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying Jewish swine, collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live inyour nation, your peopleis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.*  \\n*D Milton Sanford Mayer,* [They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/963585)","title":"Donald Trump threatens to end trans rights on \\"day one\\" in terrifying speech.

People who were in high school. He was a Representative. You can try to spin it like these girls were in love with him or something, but a 17-year-old girl, in a room with a congressman, doesn't have a whole ton of options. When he says suck, what choices does that 17-year-old girl have, knowing that this Congressman can do anything to ruin her life?
