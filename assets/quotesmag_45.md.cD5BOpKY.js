The establishment threw its weight behind her in the form of endorsements from the obamas and other party leaders.2. She was immediately projected to have 500 or so superdelegates before Iowa. Its undeniable that people like voting for winners. And perception of ability to succeed influences the outcome of elections. superdelegates are members of the democratic party establishment that can influence the outcome of the primaries. And reporting before the elections even started showed her 500 delegates ahead of the field.3. Bernie and maybe Martin OMalley were Clintons only serious opponents. A lot of prospective candidates just didnt run because clinton seemed to be pre-ordained to be the nominee. Its impossible to say how much of this was backroom dealing. It could have just been based on early polling, but its somewhat undeniable that candidates like Biden sat out in 2016 in part because it was widely viewed to be Clintons turn.","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"Excuse me, sir, its nice you won in Kentucky and all, but this is the DEMOCRATIC Party.

He told his voters he didn't need their votes and they won't need to vote ever again if he's elected. He told countless lies, made dozens of empty promises - and the voter has to know he failed to make good on healthcare on day one, Mexico building (and paying for) a wall, and promised COVID would just go away.

Another issue - before ACA it was common to hear yet another horror story about a health insurer denying to renew coverage because you got sick.  Sometimes even denying coverage for something like heart surgery, that has been done - because they went through your application and health record with a microscope and find you had your birth month wrong by a month, or even day.

It should cover a little bit of everything, science, technology, public policy, everything all the way down to how road construction works. He needs to make education interesting and make learning about stuff Interesting. He just has that ability to communicate. He can restore order and an appreciation for the issues being more complicated than Trump's bumper sticker level complexity. Does that make him ineligible for president in 2028? I don't think so. In some small part him being gay is almost helpful. You look at how popular Obama was and part of it was him being young and charismatic much like Pete. But I think a large part of Obama's success was coming from being a minority and still carrying the message of Hope and equality. You combine the messaging with the obvious implications of knowing that he's experienced some level of challenge to being treated equally and that's what resonates. The message is more powerful because of the source. Pete's going to have the same thing going for him, especially after 4 years of threats on lgbtq rights. We're going to see States attempt to do horrible things. And Pete coming out the other side of that is going to have the general Goodwill of people and he doesn't need to campaign on being gay, as a matter of fact, he can take the traditional Republican stance of keep your government out of my bedroom And shove it down other people's throat.","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"Its a numbers game and they are winning.

It's indirect intentionally, letting people fill in whatever solution they prefer (even if it's functionally impossible). Problem for Dems is that people saw Trump as credible on this issue. He presided over pre-inflation economy, and he's a celebrity businessman, giving people the impression that he would actually know how to \\"fix it.\\"Also important to put \\"price gouging\\" into context. Harris said that early, then backtracked after pressure from business community.

Bernie Sanders called open borders a \\"Koch brothers conspiracy\\".  Go back to that.  Don't let the Republican party have such an easy win on an issue that costs you nothing to support.2.  Ending foreign wars, not funding them.  How exactly did Trump out flank Democrats to the left on war?  When I was a kid, Republicans were the neo-con war hawks who wanted forever war in the middle east.  Yet now public perception (rightly or wrongly) is that the Dems are war funders, and Republicans want to back away from the global stage and entrench at home.  How did the Dems fuck up so badly on messaging that conservatives are the party of peace?  Dems MUST get back to being the party of peace.3.  Economic populism.  Trump said he was going to put tariffs on foreign goods.  Trump had is name on stimulus checks that went out during Covid (and I have heard multiple people say that's why they will vote for him this time WHICH IS INSANE but remember, low information voters are the majority of voters).  Trump says he's going to keep jobs here by punishing companies that outsource.  Like the above three positions, until NAFTA, the Dems were the party of economic populism.  Dems were the party of unions.  Dems were the party of not free trade, but protecting the American working class.  Hate to sound like a broken record, but basically Bernie Sanders.  3 decades of neo-liberal policies by Democrats like Clinton and Obama have led to the working class no longer identifying with Democrats, and Trump comes along speaking their language, BECAUSE HE'S A 90's DEMOCRAT.TL;DR - Go back to being 90s Democrats with Bernie Sanders economic populism, and you win.","title":"Trump Stole Bernies Working-Class Story.

Hillary lost to Obama for a lot of reasons in 2008, but one of the big ones we forget is that he was running more Establishment than she was (that was her Progressive primary)... she heavily moderated her message in 2016 because she became convinced that you cannot get the votes to run on the Blue ticket if you're not at least a little Establishment.

Then suddenly the Democratic candidate loses, and they are back to claiming what they did all past elections when Republicans won.","title":"Our democracy is still in danger: Head of Rasmussen Reports says that \\"Trump needs to go on an Election Integrity Jihad\\" There's evidence they did try to steal 2024"},{"text":"Unable to use any logic What logic?Do you have any or are you just barking at people?","title":"AOC asked her followers who split their ballots either for Trump/her or Trump/downballot Dem to explain why and posted the replies.

It ended for the rich, but for no one else.   The true stupidity of America is almost beyond belief.  Everyone touted great employment numbers in the face of unbelievable inflation like a population refusing to believe in the Black Plague as the bodies pile up around them.I never use to understand the expression my mother would say.  \\"You can't have your cake and eat it too.\\"  I do now, what is means is you can't have a good thing without consequences, in this case if you eat the cake you will no longer have any cake. I understand the expression now in terms of the economy.  You can't have a prosperous economy without paying the price of a prosperous economy.  In this case a prosperous economy means less wealth into the pockets of the rich and less dividends into the pockets of individual investors, which in the religion of Capitalism is a sin.  This is why business owners in America act as if workers are stealing when they ask for higher wages, as if we are trying to take their cake.In 2007 the federal minimum wage was $6.55 an hour, it was set to increase to $7.25 over a three year period ending in 2010 and its has never been raised since over the last 15 fuking years.  This is a true American crime.  The rich business owners want to raise the cost of goods, so they make more money, without increasing wages, so they make more money, which causes inflation.  The economy isn't rocket science as they want you to believe.  If you want the poor not to be poor, you need to stop stealing from them, it is a simple as that.  The poor in this country are stole from constantly in thousands of ways, in ways to numerous to list.  One of the ways is when public institutions become for profit corporations such as the Departments of Motor Vehicles in every state, working in concert with insurance companies, or the enactment of what should be illegal personal property taxes. How many times should a worker be taxed for owning a car or a boat.  For the rich none of these costs matter.  For the poor they matter a lot.    The Democrat were implicit in these crimes as stealing from the poor padded their economic numbers.  Even though it was still thief.  At least Trump and the Republicans honestly steal from you the Democrats lie about it.  Truthfully the only man in America I trust is Bernie.  He never lies.  The same man the Democrats have spent the last twenty years demonizing.","title":"Progressives arent the problem in the Democratic coalition"},{"text":"LMAO?\\nThe Republican narrative on the Democrats was \\"gender ideology, global warming and abortion instead of the basic needs of ordinary Americans\\" is what happened.\\nIf you want to say they successfully labeled them that, and the Dems fascist label failed while Trump's playing garbage truck man and working at McDonald's with more joy in his life than I ever saw while he was president well I won't disagree.Back in reality?\\nKamala wanted to give ordinary Americans a child tax break, help first time homeowners, secure the border, and help small businesses in their first year.\\nHer message didn't settle in over the 100 days\\nThe she's for they/them is actually a brilliant ad because it hits culture wars, financial spending, it's repulsive to moderates, and lastly it says \\"she's not for you\\"?\\nKamala didn't have an equivalent attack ad reminding people Trump isn't working for you.\\nHe door knockers kept to the cities and won groups of women but it lost a lot of ground because of inflation.As for your turn out nonsense, cool statistic, 1% of the white vote flipping is worth 14% of the Latino vote flipping.\\nSo the idea that the Latino vote is the primary reason ain't exactly true when Trump increased white turn out with people who skipped in 2020 AND he converted Latino voters because of inflation.\\nSo Specifically in blue states?\\nTo me the only thing you're seeing in Blue states is Dems being lazy (more of them stayed home than 2020) and Racial Republicans out in full force.

Obama was not some super orator in touch with Americans, 24 Trump is not some magical folk hero. People are mad about the economy and people agree with anyone in opposition who says economy bad regardless of how bad the economy is.The lesson of 2024 is accept its a fluke and get ready for 2026 to be a blow out of 2010 proportions","title":"Matthew Yglesias: A Common Sense Democrat manifesto - Not because its the only way to win but because its the BEST way to win in ways that can generate large majorities and effective governance that solves problems in durable ways."},{"text":"I can't believe we're almost a decade into Trumpism and people are still pretending some specific thing will break the fever","title":"Stop Bashing Democracy"},{"text":"Broke: Bashing democracyWoke: Promoting democracyBespoke: Recognizing the limits of democracy and using state power with moderation for the most severe and intractable problems that markets and civil society can't even address in a poor-to-mediocre way.","title":"Stop Bashing Democracy"},{"text":"WhitmerI don't see Democrat primary voters wanting to back another woman so soon.

Because we have had neo nazi rallies that resulted in murder, insurrections/riots, we have 'your body my choice', we have had POTUS mocking disabilities, saying American citizens are poisoning the blood of our country. We have had inflammatory language spur mass shootings, mail bombs and mass death. Like what specifically the fuck are you talking about, do we just let everything slide, let people spew and spread hatred?   but biological sex is not.Gender identity is also not a social construct. It is, **by definition**, inherent. You can not pray the transgender away, it is not a choice. Study after study shows there is an underlying, *biological* hardwired component to gender identity. We don't understand how or why yet, but it definitely seems to be there. There is a good argument to be made, one that I agree with, that transgender people are biologically the gender they identify as. Not to mention HRT changes your biology, as well.I would never dare make that argument if I was trying to get *elected* but as someone interested in transgender issues form a medical, scientific point of view, someone interested in fact and hard evidence, I do believe that to be the inconvenient truth, not to mention that is also consistent how the language used around it defined by medical professionals.Honestly I do not know why this sub likes this guy so much, his takes always seem vague with no specifics or data to back him up, the populist of neoliberalism. It's usually anti woke with no definition of what that is supposed to look like, because the reality is there is no way to be anti woke without just throwing people under the bus.

Thats why Republicans have consistently performed worse than him in midterms and down ballot races over the past 8 years. But with Trump not being on the ticket in 4 years, those voters wont come out for someone else. A guy like JD Vance or Ron DeSantis just doesnt capture those voters for whatever reason. And I think this country has at least proven that you can have one strike against you. Obama, a black man, was elected. Hillary, a white woman, while not elected, still won the popular vote by 3 million. I think Harris being both a woman and black hurt her more, even though of course thats dumb and it shouldnt be like that. And so Pete only being gay I think is fine. Plus, with JD Vances comments about winning the normal gay guy vote, while very stupid yes, I think a lot of people will see Pete as one of the normal gay gays, whatever the hell that means.

The infrastructure for natural gas/electric vehicles is simply not there yet, and pushing emissions standards down the throat of the market without a plan for the infrastructure to replace it was horrible.

I'm writing a much bigger post on this as well, but for now, [I think this tweet from a leftist sums it up.](https://x.com/god_yell/status/1836194683946438988) Leftists are specifically people who are *not* liberals, and progressive is a type of liberal that traditionally here, we'd just call a Succ. There are leftists in unions, sometimes a fair few, but most of my union experience hasn't had anything to do with them, but way more progressives. If nobody in your group was sympathetic to guillotine posting, enjoyed people like either Vaush or Hasan or Shaun or someone, and are literally members of a specific online subculture, or don't even call themselves leftists, then they're not leftists. Like, that's the most basic minimum criteria - they should call themselves leftists. I use the term leftists because I am referring to a specific group who calls themselves leftists, and they're the only group that calls themselves leftists, so they get to be leftists, just like how we get to be neolibs.In terms of being hated by the people supposedly being represented, the reason I used the specific examples I did is because it applies especially for race. That wasn't accidental. The reason that exploiting the race part would be powerful is because most leftists only learn about minority groups (including POC leftists, learning about ones outside their own) from other leftists who belong to that minority group, and they're motivated by a sincere desire to do what they believe is right by X group, and we can see for a fact that this is not working. This *may not* translate to, say, trans issues, because I think unfortunately, it honestly seems like most trans women are probably leftists at this point and so *I'm* the one with the minority position and not representative of my X Group if that's true.If you're actually going around to places and speaking to real life people, listening to their concerns and compiling them properly then you're representing those concerns in an entirely different way than how leftists would, and for the record, I absolutely do dismiss all IRL, offline leftists, because they don't matter and are always either just downstream of online leftists, or irrelevant in general. Online leftists are the ones who are representative and motivate all the other types of social issue discourse.","title":"Social Systems win Culture Wars - here's how liberals and you (you personally!) can win the next one."},{"text":"We spent a billion dollars to build an off ramp for these people and they pissed on it as they drove by.

Remember when everyone said the soft landing from inflation was impossible.

Woke has a particular negative connotation for a lot of folks because it ties to the hypersensitive party line that rejects anyone who isn't completely in line. I can both not be an asshole and also not know every term for gender identity there is. As a man, I can vote in my own interests without those interests being counter to women.The problem with what everyone outside of the left sees as woke is that that movement is extreme in nature and has no room for anyone who isn't already on board.Kamala's team and supporters spent their money on ads that did not resonate. All that ad about manly men eating steaks, drinking whiskey and voting Democrat did was show how out of touch the party is with straight men, and it WASN'T EVEN AN AD BY HER CAMPAIGN.What Trump did is campaign towards his target audience. He went to rallies attended by rural voters he wanted to woo, and went on podcasts listened to by the audience he wanted to listen to him. Kamala's campaign money was spent talking to people who were going to vote for her anyway.Also, people who voted for him didn't necessarily vote against their own interests. This narrative is getting out of hand. For example, look at videos of what campaigning was done in Michigan Muslim communities: the whole point was that the Democratic party keeps telling them that the left is the lesser of two evils. The ground game said: Muslims deserve better than the lesser of two evils. The Democratic party has made promises it has not kept to the community, so the community needs to show them that they can't take their vote for granted. If there is short term pain under a worse Republican platform, that is better in the long run if it results in a left that takes their issues more seriously in the future.Latino immigrants trend towards very conservative social and religious values. Folks who came legally that voted for Trump aren't going against their own interests, it's more surprising that they haven't been a part of the right in the past and the only reason I can see for that is the fact that there are also racists on the right (a valid concern).I keep seeing people say that the people who voted for Trump will regret their actions, which may or may not turn out to be true, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the left is suffering the consequences of its own actions now.","title":"'Morning Joe' Hosts Rip Dems, Say 'Woke Is Broke'"},{"text":"Yeah and selling state secrets to foreign adversaries is also illegal up to and including the death penalty, and yet the guy who did this is going to be president again.Using a legal argument against republican shenanigans is no longer valid.","title":"King, Jackson and Obama Had a Dream.

It would be interesting to see what the administrative costs of your system are.I looked up the official cost reports of the respective bodies.The [GEZ took in 9bn in 2023 and spent 2.03% of that on administrative costs](https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/e175/e8976/Jahresbericht_2023.pdf), \\\\~183m (sorry, it's only in German, but can be translated. These numbers are highlighted on p. 7). The most recent [cost report of the UK TV license](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8101/CBP-8101.pdf) shows that it had 3.74bn in revenues and 137m in collections costs (3.66%). Based on the current EUR/GBP conversion rate, this makes the GEZ revenue about 2x the UK TV license's.Let's use simplified, approximate conversions for comparison's sake:* GEZ revenue in : 7.5bn\\n   * scaled down to the UK size: \\\\~3.75bn\\n* GEZ cost in : 150m\\n   * scaled down: \\\\~75m\\n* Scaled up UK license revenue: 7.5bn\\n* Scaled up UK license costs: 275mYou can describe these numbers in a few different ways:* GEZ costs are over 1.5 percentage points lower\\n* Proportionally, the GEZ administrative costs are 55% of the UK TV license's\\n   * This is speculation, but I get the feeling that the admin costs in the UK are underestimated, as I find it unlikely that it accounts for the total cost of jailing people for non-compliance. Costs may be underestimated in some way in Germany as well, so this isn't part of my argument.\\n* If you scale up the UK TV license costs &amp; revenues to the GEZ revenue size, this would mean savings of 125 million\\n* If you use the current size of the UK TV license and adopt the cost percentage, this would still be **60 million in savings**I imagine there are much better uses for that 60m than jailing predominantly poor people.# Qualitatively:the BBC remains incredibly impartial and there's huge controversy every time it broadcasts anything that could be perceived as biased.This contradicts your post's statement about people from the left saying that the BBC is too right-leaning and vis versa. If anything, I would argue that the BBC is a demonstration of the value of impartial, objective media as a public good. We should be funding such public goods more, not less.So I agree with you about the current state of the BBC, but my point was about the consequences of solely relying on privatized media.But if free riding is baked into the cost and it doesn't get out of hand then it's probably a lesser problem than forcing everyone to pay.How is free riding baked into the cost in the UK system? Free riding is never completely avoidable, but the structure of only paying for a service if you demonstrably used it creates a perverse incentive structure and positive feedback loop/vicious cycle of degradation of public media:People are unsatisfied with/don't want to pay for the TV license  \\n They don't pay the license fee  \\n Public media has less money and has to rely more on private funding sources  \\n Public media becomes less objective and more beholden to private interests  \\nAND/OR  \\n The TV license fee becomes more expensive for those who do pay  \\n People are more unsatisfied with/don't want to pay for the TV licenseThe BBC remains one of the most respected media institutions in the world with it's only tarnish being that some people don't want to pay for it, forcing everyone to pay for it would increase criticism not reduce it.You're arguing that everyone agrees that the BBC is good, but no one wants to pay for it? Do you not see that this is a classic free rider problem/tragedy of the commons scenario?Also, from a psychology/cognitive science perspective, simply paying for something makes people value it more, not less.This can be applied to all public goods: Would people like for them to be free? Sure. But unfortunately:1. this is capitalism and things have to be paid for, and\\n2. getting something for free actually decreases the perceived value of a good/service.It's better to distribute the costs of public goods in a fair manner, and clearly demonstrate the value of those goods to the people who pay for it (tbf I don't think the GEZ uses the fairest cost distribution, but that's a separate debate).","title":"CMV: Not paying the TV Licence fee is now a perfectly reasonable consumer choice (UK Post)"},{"text":"(As someone on the left) Obama ran as a hope and change candidate and did very little to change anything- this led to trumpism and fascism being seen as the only possible route for systematic change that workers need, when Kamala didnt even run as a change candidate but a stability one","title":"King, Jackson and Obama Had a Dream.

It certainly affected my ability to read novels. I've read several articles in the past about grade inflation at the Ivy Leagues. Addressing the licensing of what is \\"news\\" is the big hurdle. We have states regulating what can be taught. That teaching about slavery has made kids feel guilty and parents don't like that. And then there is the anti \\"critical race theory\\" movement that sees any class taught to enlighten about the history of discrimination and persecution of marginal populations is a Trojan Horse to recruit kids to the Democrats.I personally believe that we need to acknowledge how Colonialism has affected geopolitics. The 1979 Iranian Revolution grew out of the 1953 CIA Coup. The tensions in Israel/Gaze can be understood through the filter of how the region was carved up post WWI by the Sykes-Picot agreement. And the Broken agreement of the McMahon-Hussien correspondence which promised the Arabs some autonomy in the Levant (current day Palestine). The 40 trillion in resources Britain extracted from India during their occupation of that country.And why is it if you criticize Zionists, or triggers that you're anti-Semitic or a Holocaust denier? But no one is aware of the Ukrainian genocide, The Holodomor, engineered by Stalin.The same thing about South America and how the US meddled in their affairs. The more prominent being the 1954 coup in Guatemala for United Fruit and the 1973 assassination Salvatore Allende in Chile.\\nLeopold II and how he turned the entire Belgian Congo into a violently ruled plantation. Or with Patrice Lumumba's CIA assassination and undermining the burgeoning Pan-African movement.So much of the immigration issues in Europe that has been a catalyst for far right movements like the AfD in Germany, are in response to the West's colonial policies after WWI. The same could be said of the economic refugees we see from South and Central America.They are coming here after a century of the US extracting trillions from that Continent.Or even the Haitians eating pets narrative. No one in the US knows about their history. How after their independence in 1801, the French, supported by the international community, made them pay reparations for the money they would lose from their colonial extractions. They didn't repay these reparations until mid 20th century. And then there was the trade agreement that Clinton forced them to agree to for aid. This agreement forced them to essentially get rid of tariffs on rice. This allowed Arkansas rice farmers to flood the Haitian market with cheap rice decimating their agricultural economy.Even Clinton has acknowledged how this crippled the country.And then there is the neo-colonialism of the World Bank and the IMF that forces countries that we plunged into poverty and accept loans on the conditions of austerity measures and draconian trade agreements that benefit corporations.It's not just news that has to be addressed. It's the honest teaching of history. And both parties have participated in this cleaning up of 20th century history. All of this is documented. But if you bring it up, you're labeled a conspiracist, fringe or being a communist.The global south has had trillions systematically stolen from them since the Berlin conference in 1884. But the narrative of them being irresponsible savages is what most Americans think when they process global politics. And this narrative of them being savages is replayed daily when folks say immigrants are murderers, racist and pet eaters. These tropes propelled MAGA to a decisive victory that saw trump grow his base in every demographic.

We should, in fact, judge people by the content of their character rather than by the color of their skin, rejecting discrimination and racial profiling without embracing views that elevate anyones identity groups over their individuality. Race is a social construct, but biological sex is not. Policy must acknowledge that reality and uphold peoples basic freedom to live as they choose. Academic and nonprofit work does not occupy a unique position of virtue relative to private business or any other jobs. Politeness is a virtue, but obsessive language policing alienates most people and degrades the quality of thinking. Public services and institutions like schools deserve adequate funding, and they must prioritize the interests of their users, not their workforce or abstract ideological projects. All people have equal moral worth, but democratic self-government requires the American government to prioritize the interests of American citizens.Why does this just feel like saying the Democrats need to go on an apology tour? I don't even disagree with most of these, but I don't think this is what swung the election. Good messaging is important, but the fact that the swing states were more blue than the national mood seems to suggest our messaging and campaigning was actually not that bad.In the end, the election was more a referendum on incumbent than a rejection of Kamala's platform. Next time, the Democratic President should simply govern better and make a better economy (duh). Part of that is local politics, and he does propose a couple good ideas here about that. Nationally, though, all we can really do is wait for Trump to screw up worse than Biden and try again.Good policy is good politics. Don't let the cynical pundits convince you otherwise.","title":"Matthew Yglesias: A Common Sense Democrat manifesto - Not because its the only way to win but because its the BEST way to win in ways that can generate large majorities and effective governance that solves problems in durable ways."},{"text":"Larry, first of all, Im not a weather man.

Biden sent White House lawyers to work in every State case brought against him from Atlanta, New York, Washington DC and Florida.

Bidens DOJ pursued THOUSANDS of Trump supporters for Jan6 Felony Trespassing charges that never entered the Capitol for just being in DC that day.

Real life isnt a fairytale, its full of extremely sad and fucked up, and yes, even illegal shit.  Our economy currently does not function if everyone obeyed the law.  Well maybe if EVERYONE obeyed the letter AND intent of the law, such that billionaires paid millions or 10s of millions in taxes instead of $0, then there would be enough tax revenue to subsidize agriculture to the degree necessary to pay the laborers who will these jobs livable wages (for people who have to pay taxes, etc).  But thats just not the situation, and never will be unless there is a massive political revolution.  We have no parties that support this.Its all sad.  Its sad that there are people who have to work for such low wages.  Its sad that our economy relies on them working such low wages to keep the country afloat.  But that is the truth of the situation.  I didnt look up exact numbers, I made up $1.50/hr off the top of my head.  It could be more than that, it could be less.  But it is certainly significantly less than federal minimum wage, and so it is by definition illegal.But to your argument again.  Not just the agricultural industry, but the entire economy depends on people being paid wages so low that they are illegal (because everyone in every job needs to eat, so if food prices go up then the price for manufacturing and transportation goes up, the cost of clothing goes up which increases price of living even more, and that causes the cost of everything to go up because everyone needs clothes, etc etc etc).  So if we deport these VITAL workers, one of two things will happen.  Either the country will just collapse immediately.  Or replacement workers will be hired from the natural citizen population, people who have to pay taxes because the government knows about them.  This forces the agricultural industry to pay them many times more than the current rates for illegals (at least federal minimum wage, I believe $7.50/hr).  And I dont think many would would those jobs for SO little, so theyd have to pay more, and probably provide benefits.  So the cost of this labor has now gone up like 15x.  The prices of agricultural products will rise by at least this same factor, and the prices of food will rise by a compounded factor, an even greater multiple, because of what I described earlier.  Now eggs cost like $30/dozen.  Everyones cost of living skyrockets, but there is no force causing wages to go up in other industries, so people will start to just starve unless the government steps in.  What happens from there, idk, but it probably leads somewhere extremely bad.  Like US citizens fleeing to other countries as asylum seekers, and being denied entry because of the same draconian immigration laws we want to apply that got us into this hypothetical situation.  It would be a poetic way to die at least lol.  We can only pray it remains a hypothetical.","title":"CMV: A pause on immigration should be wanted by the majority of the population and should be seen as an opportunity to create an actual Living Wage."},{"text":"Sean Penn was going to play him in an HBO mini series based on a biography a few years back, but the project fell apart...","title":"King, Jackson and Obama Had a Dream.

As far as I understand it, the TV license in the UK and the GEZ are similar in a lot of ways, but their implementation is different.**Context:**The main differences are in who is obligated to pay and how it's enforced: the *Rundfunkbeitrag* is enforced in a much more automated way C whenever you register at a new address, you get a notification from the GEZ saying you have to re-register your household (each household shares one license, same as the UK).The TV license afaik runs on a penalty-based system that checks whether households use the license and prosecutes for non-payment. In Germany, everyone, regardless of their media use, is required to pay the *Rundfunkbeitrag*, and you get payment reminder notifications and eventually collections agencies go after you if you don't pay.While I disagree on the payment structure of the *Rundfunkbeitrag* to an extent (it's inherently regressive, as essentially everyone, regardless of their income, must pay the same amount), I think that the general idea results in significantly less controversy surrounding its media legitimacy/ news bias.**Where I disagree with you:**The problem with the UK system results more from the requirement that one use the service to be obligated to pay. That:1. adds administrative burden and ultimately results in a waste of money, and\\n2. results in the media itself becoming more polarized and unpopular for different groups, as they are incentivized to appease their customer base.While I agree that it's a consumer choice to not pay the TV license in the UK, it's also a consumer choice to, e.g., pirate media. I find it very unlikely that everyone who opts out of the TV license consumes no media funded by it, resulting in a free-rider problem.**TL;DR:** I think the solution, unlike your suggestion of having fewer people pay for it, would actually be to make everyone pay for it.","title":"CMV: Not paying the TV Licence fee is now a perfectly reasonable consumer choice (UK Post)"},{"text":"January 6th was a setup.

If you just abruptly believe people are plotting against you regardless of what anyone around you is doing, *then* you're paranoid.","title":"CMV: Liberals erasing Trump-voting family and friends from their life is a cult-like mental illness"},{"text":"Quotes from the Jan 9 release of the Epstein files: Bill Clinton:Q. \\"Where were you the first time you met Bill Clinton?\\" A. \\"On Little Saint Jeff's, which is the island\\"Q. \\"I understand you were not sexual trafficked to Bill Clinton; is that correct?\\" A. \\"Correct.\\"Source : DE 363-7 pages 72, 73Q. \\"Have you traveled on Jeffrey's planes with President Clinton?\\" G.

It became a derogatory term applied generally to Mexican laborers, including those who were legal residents.One of the biggest problems caused by the program for the deportees was sending them to unfamiliar parts of Mexico, where they struggled to find their way home or to continue to support their families. More than 25% of apprehended Mexicans were returned to Veracruz on cargo ships, while others were transported by land to southern cities in Mexico. Those apprehended were often deported without receiving the opportunity to recover their property in the United States, or to contact their families prior to deportation.Deportees often were stranded without any food or employment when they were released in Mexico. Deported Mexicans sometimes faced extreme conditions in their country; 88 deported workers died in the 112 F (44 C) heat in July 1955. Another issue was repeated illegal border crossings by those who had been previously deported; from 1960 through 1961, repeaters accounted for 20% of the total deportees. Certain U.S. Border Patrol agents practiced shaving heads to mark repeat offenders who might attempt to reenter the United States. There were also reports of beating and jailing chronically offending illegal immigrants before deporting them. While most complaints concerning deportation were undocumented, there were more than 11,000 formal complaints (about 1% of all actions) from documented bracero workers from 1954 through 1964.Operation W@@back was the culmination of more than a decade of intensifying immigration enforcement. Immigration enforcement actions (removals and returns) rose rapidly from a low of 12,000 in 1942, to 727,000 in 1952, the final year of the Truman Administration. Enforcement actions continued to rise under Eisenhower, until reaching a peak of 1.1 million in 1954, the year of Operation W**back. Enforcement actions then fell by more than 90 percent in 1955, and 1956, and in 1957 were 69,000, the lowest number since 1944. The number of enforcement actions rose again in the 1960s and 1970s, but did not exceed the 1954 peak of Operation Wetback until 1986.At the same time that immigration enforcement was expanding in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Bracero program was also rapidly expanding legal opportunities for Mexican laborers. Although it began as a wartime measure, the Bracero program saw its largest expansion after the war. The number of wartime braceros peaked at 62,000 in 1944, but the number began to rise again in the late 1940s, and reached its peak in 1956, when the program gave temporary work permits to 445,000 Mexican workers.","title":"CMV: A pause on immigration should be wanted by the majority of the population and should be seen as an opportunity to create an actual Living Wage."},{"text":"Unlike Catholic Joe Biden, of course","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You know the meme","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Wouldve been great for sure.Instead his signature is the Iran deal lol","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"SENTIENT","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"As someone part of an immigrant diaspora whose father was a skilled immigrant to the EU with a US graduate degree in a shortage profession, I'll never fail to be amazed at the number of first worlders (let's face it, it's always them)? who believe that get can just turn up anywhere on a whim.

It should also go without saying that if you asked these people if they feel Trump wishes to exploit them, they're going to say yes.When you assume someone has a mental illness by using a list of early symptoms, without any expertise, yes, it was actually necessary. It also does not go without saying. Exploit them how? Which anti-Trump talking point talks about exploiting Democrats? Interestingly, you make an argument about the abstract \\"people\\", not the person who cut you off. The nature of the post?*is*?the example. They're going down their list of friends/family and querying their \\"loyalty\\" to their cause. Once again, if you surveyed these same people \\"Are you concerned with the loyalty and trustworthiness of Trump voters to your beliefs, feelings or issues that matter to you?\\", do you think they'd say no? Let's be honest.No, the nature of the post is an accusation. The only example provided is a family member cutting you off, and from your description - \\"A close family member who states he admittedly values and cares about me said he just can't have me in his life anymore because he thinks I voted for Trump.\\", didn't do that in an aggressive way. Once again, who is \\"they\\"? Does the family member that you mention do that? Do you know that they do, or is it an assumption? You also have a misunderstanding of the motivation behind cutting off someone who voted for Trump. Loyalty or trustworthiness has nothing to do with it. If it was loyalty, the reason would be \\"You didn't vote Democrat.\\". That would apply to Dems who didn't vote, 3rd party voters, and Trump voters equally. If it was trustworthiness, the reason would be \\"I was sure/you told me you wouldn't vote for Trump, but you did.\\". But those were not the reasons, the reason was, simply, that you voted for Trump. Liberals spend the better part of the election season taking everything Trump said out of context. Latest was probably \\"the enemy within\\", claiming Trump's going to use the military to go after his political enemies. Off the top of my head another would be the \\"bloodbath\\" comment.Is your family member's first name \\"Liberals\\"? Why are you talking about the abstract crowd making abstract claims, instead of using your real-life example? Is it because they are not at all similar? Or is it because you bunch up your family member with the group you think is a cult? Also, as a side note, why don't we look at the \\"context\\" of the example you gave. Lets see the full quote - [\\"But I don't think they're the problem in terms of Election Day. I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.

Does that context help you, in any way? Does it prove anything but the fact that Trump did in fact say that he would like the National Guard or the military to handle \\"the enemy from within\\"? I mean, I'm posting that directly from the CDC's website talking about signs of mental illness/delusional disorder. You object to that? What happened to \\"follow the science\\"?Do you truly believe, that a person holding a grudge is a sign of mental illness/delusional disorder? Why are you asking me \\"What happened to \\"follow the science\\"?\\"? Did I ever say something like that? Or do you, once again, bunch up another person (this time me) with the group you consider to be automatically wrong to dismiss my arguments? You're taking the single action of cutting someone off to argue a point that's outside of that. Whether or not they're cutting you off is irrelevant to whether or not that person has a \\"readiness to respond and react to perceived slights\\", whether they stem from you or from someone else.   \\n  \\nAnd for what it's worth, completely innocent responses/comments in the lead up to this \\"cut off\\" fit this description quite accurately. It is very relevant. When a person cuts you off, they are no longer willing to respond and react to perceived slights. The whole point of cutting you off is to not perceive you. You cannot argue that this behavior (cutting you off over your vote) is a sign of mental illness, while simultaneously claiming that it will also be a mental illness if they **don't** cut someone off. Those two positions are contradictory. I do not know what you mean by completely innocent responses and comments in the lead up to the cut off. I do not know what they are, and they might as well not be considered innocent by a reasonable person.","title":"CMV: Liberals erasing Trump-voting family and friends from their life is a cult-like mental illness"},{"text":"The problem is that since they can't make kids of their own they are going after and trying to groom other little children.","title":"Seriously where are they getting all this from"},{"text":"I was excited when I thought this was a book ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"There comes a time where the people who have been put through a long list of bullying, disrespecting, and be treated like shit finally have had enough and decide to start holding the miscreants accountable.

This was on air within days of lockdown being announced. Netflix made no such effort - there is no incentive in the commercial sphere whereas a publicly funded BBC, which is governed by its charter, is explicitly required to provide such programming.

Epsteins wealth originated from loans provided by  JPMorgan Chase between 1998 to 2013 , around the same time he started his sex trafficking business. How did he repay these loans? By having the privilege of working as an accountant for several extremely wealthy people despite having never graduated from college. Go figure.But ignoring the financial issue this point becomes clear by looking at the sheer scale of Epsteins teenage brothel-service in Palm Beach alone. He is known to have employed around 30 teenage girls for his brothel-spa in Palm Beach, but allegations against him suggest the figure to be \\"over 100 girls\\" judging by the line of questioning in [Jeffrey Epstein's deposition](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/1335/6/giuffre-v-maxwell/).According to Juan Alessi the guests of Epstein were free to use the girls during visits. Officially , they were \\"massages\\" that were held in an upstairs spa facility in the mansion with massage table, sauna , shower and a bedroom. Juan Alessi stated that there was a \\"laundry basket full of sex toys\\" near the spa. He also stated that the bed usually had to be remade after every \\"massage\\" and that the Epstein household would place 50-60 towels per day in the laundry during certain visits.It is assumed that a log of the \\"massages\\" was kept in the Epstein household via digital means using a message system called \\"Citrix\\".

Students don't want to go out and pick fruit, graduates have better prospects working a minimum wage shitty job in the middle of a city than a medium to shitty paid job out in the middle of nowhere. At least in the city you can apply for higher skilled work, frankly anyone with even a modicum of skill would be an idiot for moving out into the middle of nowhere because cities are hubs of wealth generation for individuals. What happened after Brexit was the fruit and vegetables rotted on the vine, with no one to harvest it and the British economy unsurprisingly collapsed. This idea that Americans are willing to leave cities to work unpleasant, low paid, and often exploited jobs, is just erroneous.Australia has fly in fly out work for the mining industry, for which the work is incredibly undesirable but great wealth can be produced by just a few people. This is fundamentally distinct from farming, which requires a lot of people to produce a middling amount of wealth. Notably the Australian farming industry is BUILT on migration. So much so that if travellers want to extend their visa duration they can work on a farm to earn extra years of stay in Australia. In countries like India and China farming is built on the backs of hundreds of incredibly low paid farmers. I can't think of a single example of farming itself being a point of great wealth generation for workers, except maybe for luxury items.You say that companies can't just increase the prices of their product because people wouldn't buy it, but during COVID that's exactly what they did...and people still bought it because it's food, they either buy it or they starve to death.It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what your missing, because I'm sorry but it shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the entire farming industry.I feel like your point is that if we get rid of all the workers who are farming the food that people will eat, then the industries that are hiring those people will be forced to create enticing packages to draw in local American workers who have a strong aversion to doing the gruelling labour that immigrants currently fulfil. This seems like a crazy approach to take to solving this issue, rather we could create strong regulatory bodies that empower workers so that they are less vulnerable to exploitation, create a minimum wage and defend it for those workers, shift power away from billionaire monopolies into the hands of those workers so that they can improve their conditions to a point where local workers are willing to take on the jobs. I strongly suspect that even in those situations local workers would still prefer to work lower paid jobs in cities due to the upwards mobility and opportunities that cities provide for individual workers to earn greater wealth.This way you get the benefits of having strong farming jobs where locals can be enticed to work there without causing a generation of poor people to starve to death due to increased food scarcity.","title":"CMV: A pause on immigration should be wanted by the majority of the population and should be seen as an opportunity to create an actual Living Wage."},{"text":"I feel like prices of goods would increase, but if the consumer stopped buying the goods, then it would stabilize.During (or after) covid in the US eggs costs around $30 at one point, and many items increased in prices.

This is like saying someone shows signs consistent with being a double amputee because they have problems picking things up. Sure, maybe they do, but Steve. *They've got both arms*, Steve.The slightly less easily dismissable one - disconnecting with others is a sign of cult behaviour. This is subtler, but runs into the same issue. Cults don't just isolate people for the hell of it, and just isolating people doesn't make you a cult. Cults isolate people because the cult leader is trying to exploit them and that's easier when there's no-one else important in their life. This requires focus, and organization, which is impossible on a broad political level. Who is in charge of liberalism to be doing the exploitation? It also requires *instruction -* cutting people out of your life because you don't want to hang out with them anymore isn't cult behaviour, because you can't be a cult of one.Basically, your issue is that matching a few points on a checklist for X doesn't make you X.","title":"CMV: Liberals erasing Trump-voting family and friends from their life is a cult-like mental illness"},{"text":"The real fear is that their partners will retaliate with physical abuse our possibly kill them....

There are anti-democratic laws in some states establishing a double standard for ballot access.  These laws were put there by Republicans and Democrats to keep themselves in power after nearly getting swept out of power in elections.The Democrats spent the last election demanding that we vote for them so they can defend our democracy.

In California that ratio is closer to 70% in some cases. It doesn't really matter how much money you have, deporting half or more of your workforce is going to be disruptive. Trying to bring in tens of thousands of new hires, including training and decreased production from losing experienced workers, can't happen overnight. That's why this is potentially a huge problem.In principle, I don't disagree that industries that rely on cheap/exploitable labor deserve to be disrupted and forced to provide better working conditions and pay. In reality, deporting millions of people punishes them more than the companies and invites a bunch of supply chain disruptions.

This can also exist WITHOUT being a sign of delusion, especially if its reasonable. If this person happens to be gay, or have close gay friends, or if they have had an abortion, it would be completely reasonable for them to question your trustworthiness if you voted for someone who would likely jeopardize those people.3.

Some women prefer not to get involved in straight relationships despite being straight, because they're sick to death of all the inadequate men who feel entitled to her body, her labour, her capacity to produce offspring.

You see 4B as first and foremost a protest when it is primarily a protection measure.It originated in South Korea after women discovered a telegram channel with a very large number of male members sharing either deepfake porn of their friends, classmates, and colleagues, or naked photos they had deceptively taken of their sisters, mothers, and girlfriends. Most of the victims are underage, and this is only 4 years after another scandal where a large number of men were found online sex trafficking girls, also majority underage (look up Nth Room scandal).4B is a protection measure for SK women to keep themselves as far away from harmful situations as possible because the law isn't protecting them. It's the same in the US, except the protection is more from situations that could result in pregnancy or needing an abortion.The protest part is a bonus, some might be doing it for that reason primarily and that is their right to do so and it's so condescending for yall to try and be like \\"actually you're being irrational\\". But it is primarily being promoted for safety because young girls especially are very vulnerable. Like come on man a literal pedophile rapist is in the highest office, and we're already seeing girls die from something he set in motion during his first term. Project 2025 talks explicitly about how to, in practice, have a national abortion ban, prosecute women for even trying to get one, and ban contraception.This is the problem with the internet, it's like a large game of telephone and by the time people outside of the organizing nexus hear about something it's completely bastardized, especially because you can make shit like this trigger something in the populace that drives discourse and views because everyone is a reactionary now.

He stayed in, so there wasn't a competitive primary (normal for a party who holds the White House).The debate in late June made it clear Biden couldn't compete in the general. Once they finally convinced him to drop out, the primary was over. They faced two terrible options. A contested convention in August, in all likelihood producing a barely-viable candidate and tremendous resentment all around. They would have had less than two months to put together a slate of possible nominees. The nominees would then be voted on by Biden's delegates from each district, not the primary voters. The first round of voting wouldn't likely have secured a nominee, so a second round of voting with the superdelegates would be required. People don't understand the role of superdelegates, and the word has become so toxic that the mere mention stirs up resentment. The candidate produced would then have two months and change to start up and run a campaign. Or they could pass the torch from an unpopular incumbent to the unpopular incumbent's also unpopular and to this point nearly-invisible VP. However, than unpopular VP would at least have the benefit of already having a campaign staffed and funded. They'd also benefit from having an extra couple of months to campaign.

The 4B movement will be ineffective because young women were already refusing to date young men. Our only difference now compared to where we were before is that a small, highly visible group of women have made it a political decision.  Men aged 18-29 are terminally single, and have been for a long time, with over 60% reporting that they are single and similar numbers reporting that they hadn't had sex in the last year. When you compare this to women, who are single at a rate of **34%**, you get a pretty clear picture. Women are dating older men or bisexual and other queer women are choosing to date other women. When you ask those women why they won't date young men that have, generally, similar complaints: (1) noticeable emotional deficits; (2) disinterest in household or emotional labor; (3) sexual dysfunction caused by porn over-consumption. Meanwhile, conservatism in young men is rising while women in the same cohort report being liberal at the highest level in modern history. Women's complaints about young men have not been addressed so they're deciding they'd rather stay away at the same time those men are making themselves more repulsive to them by embracing a regressive political movement overtly hostile to women's rights. That's a terrible combination. We're going to keep getting the same questions about how effective this movement is in the United States. We're also going to see right wing influencers pivot towards parodying these women and gaslighting the young men who follow them into thinking their complaints aren't valid. In doing so those same right wing influencers and their followers prove those women's point: men aren't listening and don't want to change. Passive aggressive questions primarily aimed at ridiculing this movement (i.e. the entire reason this thread exists) with massive numbers of men taking the opportunity to make fun of it prove that point.

Post-modernism was heavy on deconstruction. While a lot of good came from that, critical institutions that provided safeguards and guidance were eroded. For example nobody respects the presidency like it used to be and hardly anyone trusts the media, which is supposed to be a major source of truth. Lots of people think they have to do their own research yet dont have the skills to do so effectively. Even this election shows deconstruction where people are upset with the system and want someone who is saying they will radically change the system. So people are still eager to tear down what works, but they dont have an alternate ready to replace it. So they tear down what is but dont build anything leaving nothing.

Catholicism inherently puts value on modesty, guilt, and self sacrifice. So a rich person is not being a proper Christian. And working hard to enrich yourself is sinful, so you just kinda wish that richness comes onto you by chance. (Or by other people's taxes). Protestant values, on the contrary, emphasize that if you have success, it means God smiles on you, so people are inherently motivated to work hard to prove that God blessed them. And if they fail, it's their fault and their fault only. It's more complex than this, but this is a quick summary. I encourage you to read on the topic, is enlightening.Americans live submerged in American values, which are deeply rooted in Protestantism. They dont realize it, because a fish doesn't see the water. But the cultural difference is very alive and present. It doesn't mean that people have never blamed each others in America.  It's more subtle than that. But there is a reason why the American dream is American and not European. Also part of why American populism is wildly different than European populism. Handouts and stimulus work significantly less on the American working class than the European one. It goes against values and offends pride. It's also why immigrants tend to be more fiscally conservatives: most people think they are just \\"ladder puller\\", but it's mostly that they came to America because they like this attitude/values, and think it's right. It's also why American immigrants integrate better.

Spare me your hyperbolic false analogies. What people could worry about is the violence, harassment, and discrimination that cis people inflict onto trans people. Cis people are killing trans people, not the other way around. Or you could worry about the 34% poverty rate among trans people, which is one of, if not the highest, rates of poverty of any group in America. The data doesn't show trans women have an advantage in sports. Democrats have long since been, or at least tried to be, the party that devises policy based on data. If you want fantasy, I suggest you join the Republicans since they're not even remotely interested in what the data shows ever, on anything. If you actually cared about trans women's bodies masculinizing during puberty and thus providing an unfair advantage in sports, you could support trans kids having access to puberty blockers which would actually prevent that, but oops. You oppose that as well. So you're denying a group of people something and then faulting them for not having the thing you're denying them. This is also the same argument that white people tried to use against black athletes to try to keep them from competing against white players. Racist white folks tried to claim that black people had an unfair genetic advantage that was passed down from their ancestors who were enslaved and forced to do hard labor, and that this lead black people to be more \\"athletic.\\" Deny a group of people something, then fault them for not having the thing you denied them.And a policy that forces trans people to compete against the gender they were assigned at birth results in trans men--again, *many of whom are on testosterone*\\\\--competing against cis women, which you say you don't want. You say you don't want men with high testosterone competing against women, and then you support something that would accomplish just that. But then again, that's what this election has been all about, hasn't it?

Women stay with shitty men for shitty reasons which vary from person to person, but the main one is that women are taught that shitty is what they deserve and/or what they should settle for. That destructive lesson comes from a lot of places - watching your parents and other adults in your life is a big one; crappy relationships in your formative years is another; seeing friends in crappy relationships; being told to compromise and make it work (which is good advice, of course, in a *healthy* relationship but not so much when the woman is the only one compromising); gender roles that teach us that women should be naturally subservient to men. I could go on. One motivator for some women is the fear of being alone or the fear of not being able to afford to live. The first fear is *not* exclusive to women. Men can be just as co-dependent as women. And the second fear is rational, especially when gender roles still lean toward the man being the higher earner and/or the woman being the one to kneecap her career and financial prospects to raise the kids.

Minimum wage, breaking up monopolies, housing credits, child credits, expanding medicare/medicaid, strengthening unions, the biggest stimulus bill in American History, expanding domestic energy production with a goal of hitting the 2050 Paris agreement, reducing carbon emissions and tax credits for clean energy, etc. Biden is the most progressive president we've had since FDR, but the ship doesn't turn around over night.People don't vote for policies, though, apparently. They vote for, or against, people, and voters didn't think Kamala Harris was going to enact those policies for a variety of reasons.I think the DNC/Democratic leadership are a bunch of insular political insiders that operate the way cliques do in highschool.

The same way you might feel like someone is a bit nutty if they're crying over a sports team or getting passionately worked up over a change in a video game or rulebook. They seriously see it in the same light and they don't understand why anyone wouldn't, and they assume you're exaggerating or not grounded in reality.My mom is one - in her eyes there's no point paying attention, there's more important things like directly helping her friends, family and neighbors. She's a \\"good\\" person who is just completely blind to the wider world, or decided a long time ago that whatever happened \\"out there\\" she couldn't influence it and may as well focus on matters closer to hand. If I try to inform her, she shrugs and dismisses it by saying she's too dumb to get it or just seems bemused - I know this isn't true, she's *not* dumb, she just doesn't want to think about it. I kind of get it, she grew up under a regime and immigrated to the US, and has just never really believed individuals can do anything to fix or change things broadly through civic action, only in one's own neighborhood. When I was a kid I assumed everyone else felt that way, as a teenager I thought nobody else felt that way, now as an adult I'm starting to go back to the former view.....It really does kind of feel like, you know, rich and powerful people just play their own games up in the clouds and don't care whether we cheer or riot. Even though citizens make a powerful collective, we're also dumb as a mob, more like a force of nature or some emergent phenomenon than intelligently guided individuals. I think more and more that she's right, all we can do is what's best for ourselves, our kids, our local communities, and as for the rest... eh.In retrospect I see pretty much no value added to my life from actually reading more and more national/international news over the past twelve years and trying to stay abreast of events and understand what's going on. Like, being better informed hasn't helped me make the world any better or do anything positive in my life or anyone else's life. All it's done is stressed me out. My mom probably enacts more good in the world and she doesn't know anything about the president at any given time. I'm not saying I'm giving up, I guess I'm just saying... I don't think people are bad people for setting their \\"civic duty\\" down at this juncture. We're tired.

And I understand your frustrations.  We have a commonality in our belief of a representative democratic Republic form of governance that we're blessed to live under.Yes, there was Freemasonry in the ranks of the Founding Fathers (FF's), but, you also have to look at that organization and how they operated back then, and even before then, in comparison to how they operate today.  That organization was an actual good thing in it's inception, bastardized to unrecognizable along the way.  Speaking of that organization, it has many factions from back then until today.  Even THEY couldn't get themselves into lockstep from the very start, and follow different paths within their structures in comparison of the overall concept.Secret societies, secret orders, private groups, etc. are as old as humanity itself.  Brotherhoods and whatnot.  They're gonna continue to exist, regardless of our personal disdains for them, or our choices not to participate in/with them.  And, within most of them there is a degree of benevolence in their malevolence.But, let's get back to the matters at hand.  Those FF's tried to enjoy their wealth as colonists under a tyrannical king, who kept heaping on the taxation without representation, to the point where they broke away from monarchy and decided to fight for an ideal that we both seem to welcome, accept and believe in.These ideals were meant for them in their selfishness at that time, (malevolence), but, with possibility of all citizenry enjoying inalienable rights along the way (benevolence).  The concepts presented in the cornerstones of building a brand new governance, by a Declaration of Independence, a Constitution and a subsequent Bill of Rights with the first 10 items being the mortar in the building blocks of . . . a mason's build, amIrite?  And I'd take a building built by a mason over a lumberjack, it'll stand the test of time better, IMHO.In my personal history, I have voted Republican, Democrat, Green Party, Independent and Libertarian along the way, evaluating all candidates for the big chair each time and choosing who best represents my ideas and my ideals.  Are they perfect?  Nope.  But, who is?  Are they capable of winning (Go, Dr. Ron Paul!!!), nope.  Yet, I truly believe my vote was counted, even when it was a vote of protest against the \\"favorites\\".  And that, sometimes, is the best I can hope for.  I don't want that clown or this mime, I want THAT dude.  And, in the case of H. Ross Perot it kinda worked.  That dude scared the hell out of the establishment, garnering WAY too big of a share of the vote.  Bigger than they anticipated, and, by their own rules, forced them to acknowledge him and even allow him on the sacred debate stage.If there was a third of the voters that picked the Democratic nominee and a third that picked the Republican nominee and a third picked someone else, they'd shit themselves proper.  Because they would clearly see their days are very numbered.  And those damned Freemason FF's railed against political parties back in the proverbial day.  And, that's where we need to get to. We, the disenfranchised people need to get behind that person that rises up against the grain.I had no good third option this past election, so I decided to look deep into the two mainstream choices.  My deciding factor to give Trump my vote, my voice was his consistency in messaging.  The dude has preached the same thing regarding politics since the Oprah and Letterman interviews back in the 1980's, the magazine articles and additional interviews in the 1990's., 2000's and into a first term as POTUS.  He's different enough from the nepotistic presentations I've been given (a Bush, a Clinton, a Bush, a Clinton, again) and his idealistic approach to that early messaging of decades ago aligns very much with my own.Is he controlled opposition?  Maybe.  Is he rich and powerful with his own agenda?  Probably.  Does he drive the establishment nuts, publicly?  You bet!  I'll give him a chance to prove his allegiance to those old ideals of those interviews so long ago, or not.  Time will tell.  And next time around, I'll give the next person that aligns best with my own ideas/ideals a vote as well.  Especially if I can truly have a choice that's not a feather in either wing of the two winged bird.  I hope you join me in voting next time.","title":"Cognitive Dissonance in America"},{"text":"Covid deaths would have happened no matter who was in charge.

Fortunately, no such sacrifice is required.If we had a stateless society, it would be one with private cities. Private cities means you can choose the laws you want to live by and either find a private city with those rules or start your own and invite others to join you using those laws.This means that private law allows a significant range of law greater than currently, because it is a decentralized legal society. Libertarians would of course build a society with libertarian rules. But nothing prevents people from using rules they like and opt-into that currently libertarians bristle against because they are forced upon us.So for instance, I would expect social safety nets to continue to be used by most places, because they are politically popular. What makes them tolerable in such a society is that they are not forced on you--since all private law societies must be opted-into--and the amount of money you are willing to pay for them is also fixed by your own choice and cannot be changed against your will.What currently is a policy we find abusive then, in those conditions, becomes a function of your own choice and freedom.Similarly with public education, healthcare, and economic regulation. We do not want a society without business and economic regulation, we just want the power to choose it for ourselves instead of it being forced on us by the State.\\\\ This dichotomy poses significant concerns regarding safety, externalities, and fair competition. Furthermore, while I acknowledge the fairness of progressive taxation, I advocate for lower taxes overall or even its complete abolition.

However, I am skeptical about its practical implementation in a real-world society. r/unacracy \\\\ If anyone can present compelling arguments explaining why these concepts are not essential or could be successfully implemented within a non-liberal system, I would be grateful for their insights. I am currently torn between libertarianism and modern liberalism and would welcome the opportunity to engage in an honest discussion with someone who can assist me in reconciling these conflicting viewpoints.I have thought a lot about how a libertarian society could reconcile your issues.

I was glad to see the left take a spanking, sure enough, but I'm not naive enough to believe that it means good things are on the way. Maybe better prices at the grocery store for a while. Maybe less chaos at the border and who knows? Maybe the economy will rebound a bit over the next four years.

And so did Obama advisor Larry Summers (pbuh) https://thehill.com/policy/finance/537521-key-ex-obama-adviser-says-biden-stimulus-is-too-big/These concerns were sidelined because a stimmy check with biden's name on it looked really good going into midterms.","title":"Democrats' $1.9 trillion bet that blew up"},{"text":"I doubt this is the primary issue that sank the Harris campaign but Im pretty convinced it didnt help. This issue is currently just way too divisive at the national level. The local and state level Democrats have to cut the national level politicians some slack and dial back on this until they get back in power.Hell, even Trump has dialed back on abortion. The MAGA side at this point will pretty much take anybody so long as theyre willing to pull the lever for Trump. It doesnt make any sense for the Dems to be dying on this ideological hill when other side is practically letting anyone in.","title":"Rep.

They adopted the tariff mindset, Biden blocked the Nippon Buyout of US Steel, he even invested billions into building US industry into emerging industries in semi conductors and EVs. Biden even shifted rightward on immigration almost as soon as he got into office.?None of it mattered. To voters they didnt care about the new manufacturing jobs he made even if they directly benefitted.
