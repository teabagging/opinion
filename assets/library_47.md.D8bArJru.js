He told a local NPR station that his party was out of touch with the views of most Americans. In an interview with The New York Times, he got more specific about where the lefts ideology is out of step with much of the country. I have two little girls, Moulton said. I dont want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat Im supposed to be afraid to say that. While progressives may want to smear Moulton as a hate-monger, his comments on transgender athletes in girls and womens sports align with the vast majority of the country. Moulton said on CNN his party is often too focused on how it can cancel people rather than actually having debates about issues that Americans care about.It's one of the reasons so many voters turned away from Democrats this election. They were sick of being called racist, transphobic or sexist simply for having views that differed from the far left. Issues related to transgender young people demand debate, not name-calling that shuts down conversation. Trump made this and other gender issues a big part of his campaign, and it paid off for him.The country is nearly evenly divided between states that are trying to limit medical gender-affirming care for transgender children and those that encourage a broad range of treatments and procedures. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a related case this term.Progressives like to say that the science is on their side. Yet, recent studies highlight that there is still a lot unknown about the long-term consequences of gender hormones and surgeries in young people. That research also shows that caution is warranted. In October, The New York Times revealed that Johanna Olson-Kennedy, a doctor and proponent of gender treatment for adolescents, has purposely avoided releasing results of a study on puberty blockers. The study, which began in 2015, tracked the effects of puberty blockers (drugs that prevent the natural changes that occur during puberty) in 95 children over the course of two years. Olson-Kennedy didnt get the results she had expected. The puberty blockers did not lead to mental health improvements, according to her research. Youd think that would be valuable information to have, especially because nearly $10 million in federal taxpayer dollars have fueled the broader research. Olson-Kennedys excuse? She didnt want her work to be weaponized by opponents. It is a scandal of epic proportions, and a perfect example of why so many Americans have lost trust in our public health institutions, Kelsey Bolar, senior policy analyst at the Independent Womens Forum, told me. Bolar has worked closely with young people who regret the transgender treatments they received and has helped share their stories, including what happened to Cristina Hineman, who is suing Planned Parenthood for giving her testosterone at 18. Clearly, the science isnt settled. On this and other important issues facing the country, Democrats should heed Congressman Moultons advice: Weve got to have these debates ... and we start by listening to Americans.https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/11/14/trump-seth-moulton-trans-athletes-democrats/76228989007/","title":"Detailed Analysis of Progressive Options for 2028"},{"text":"I never made that connection!

The only thing they're going to be able to agree on is handing money to the rich because that's the only goal that is shared among all of the party members.I have no idea why people keep allowing themselves to be totally manipulated by the republicans, but they are, and I'm aware that it's not going away any time soon. Their strategy of wipping their voters into a frenzy with racist and bigoted lies is proven to work extremely well, so they'll be doing it again for sure.The question is: For how long are people going to allow themselves to be totally distracted by the clown show?","title":"Letter: Blame for the coming catastrophe is on Trump voters"},{"text":"Post-Truth timeline weeeeee","title":"NBC: \\"The Trump transition team is compiling a list of senior current &amp; former U.S. military officers who were directly involved in the withdrawal from Afghanistan &amp; exploring whether they could be court-martialed for their involvement, according to a U.S. official &amp; a person familiar with the plan\\""},{"text":"Honestly, I am not a Trump supporter, but all of the neo liberal - neo conservative establishment should walk the plank for what they did to this country over the past decades. \\nHell, they are the reason we are at this point to begin with.","title":"Trump Signals a Seismic Shift, Shocking the Washington Establishment"},{"text":"Learning to shoot doesnt create my heart meds","title":"Former GOP congressmans $2.5 million GoFundMe trolled over his anti-Obamacare vote | \\nPull yourself up by your bootstraps!"},{"text":"I go through a small town thats only industry is turkey and somalians do all the work essentially.

These are either inserted bullet ballots for the Presidential race or manipulated data fields.  They are surgically added to totals in limited jurisdictions and within only the seven swing States.  This historically unprecedented set of numbers found in the 2024 swing states is absent in every other state. In AZ, MI, NC and WI the effect of these drop-off votes reverses the voters' will and even more improbably always pushes the winning margin beyond the mandatory recount numbers.  It is a result too perfect for belief.  It is a bespoke and programmed outcome.  In other states including PA and NV, removing these strange and bespoke added votes, it appears Donald Trump may have won the cast votes but within a margin which would force recounts.  The inserted votes raise his totals, to avoid any scrutiny during mandatory recount results which would have slowed his claim on the Presidency.  In GA and FL the same pattern exists with unclear impact on the results.edit: note - Elon did that fake sweepstakes in PA, BUT his PAC had a voter registration/sign-up website for all states, which collected your name/address only if you were from these swing states (significance explained at link).For anyone thinking of dredging up 'blue maga' from last August... remember that actual maga screamed about fake votes from the roof tops but couldn't bring any actual proof/data in 50+ court cases.

The Israeli media term it a dream team for Netanyahu. It certainly looks that way.-But in the domestic sphere the tone is precisely the converse: The key nomination for cleaning the stables is Matt Gaetz as Attorney General; he is a real bomb thrower. And for the Intelligence clean-up, Tulsi Gabbard is appointed as Director of National Intelligence. All intelligence agencies will report to her, and she will be responsible for the Presidents Daily briefing. The intel assessments may thus begin to reflect something closer to reality.-Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have the near impossible task of cutting out-of-control federal spending and currency printing. The System is deeply dependent on the bloat of government spending to keep the cogs and levers of the mammoth security boondoggle whirring. -This must be deliberate. Trump knows that Bidens legacy of bloating GDP with government jobs and excessive public spending is the real time bomb awaiting him.","title":"Ray McGovern: Trump Caught Between *Two Worlds* in the Middle East &amp; Ukraine!"},{"text":"Yeah, let me check the calendar if the reverse happened in 2020","title":"How RFK Jr. would change McDonalds  and Trumps diet"},{"text":"He's been very specifically pro fully completing the genocide of Palestinians as rapidly as possible for years.","title":"Muslims who voted for Trump upset with his pro-Israel cabinet picks"},{"text":"That's exactly what Smith is doing.

I think it's likely that they skipped prosecution hoping he would just fade into the background And they could avoid the whole messy and politically charged situation and backlash from his supporters. But when he ran again there was a sudden oh no, we can't let this happen, not after what he's done, it's time to prosecute. And rightly so, he's incredibly dangerous - but even more rightly so in January of '21. It may have been politically motivated to delay or avoid prosecution, and politically motivated to finally get the ball rolling, but even if so, I would say there are very justifiable arguments for both. Not saying I agree with them ultimately, especially the decision not to prosecute in the beginning, but it was a complicated choice in some ways. Not keeping him in the headlines and galvanizing his supporters and risking blood in the streets was a real part of the calculation I think.

Because it's easy enough to count up and tabulate the community-reporting reports.And it's not like those top misinformers are going to stop misinforming, or even deviate from such a path. It seems the platform's purpose could very well be, to misinform. Instead, what will happen is that using a bunch of fine-tuners in a fine-tuning-center overseas (where labor is cheaper) they will try to retrain the AI to be more tolerant of lies. War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Bliss. You know, that kind of stuff.And this led me to a darkened thought about that innocent little five-year-old boy who asked his AI about cars and had a pretty good time learning with it for forty-five minutes. If the kid uses ChatGPT6 in the future he'll learn things about the world one way, but if he uses Xai trained on lies and evil, he'll learn different things about the world, things that perhaps the very people interested in dismantling the Department of Education want him to think.

Its national spirit is revived, its elites secured and its forces are now battle-hardened and well equipped and the most experienced in the world.\\n the only feasible option is to pressure Ukraine into accepting a peace that grants Russia a big part of what it is now sure and aiming to achieve Or to let Zelensky / Ukraine fall completely and put the blame on them.Russia still wants to isolate Kharkiv and have the city delivered to the later on. This will succeed.Russia still wants to capture the entirety of the Zaporizhia Region, and this will also succeed. Hereby youll find some room for negotiation because it is unclear if Russia is willing to also take the regional capital Zaporizhia itself, because that will be costly and consuming of time and men. They would succeed eventually, but they might favor a destroy bridges and siege approach. \\nBoth sides would gain if they leave that city intact. Same applies for Dnipro. Same room for negotiation.Russia will not give up the status of the captured regions as being part of the RF proper, but they will eventually accept that Ukraine will save face here and never recognize.There has to be some permanent treaty about Russias security issues. Nato membership is out of the question, but some multi-lateral guarantees were negotiated before. But this will not entail western forces permanently on Ukranian territory and of course limitations for Ukraine to posses longe range weapons.Russia is in no hurry, it is prepared for the war to last into 2026.  Its casualties are way overblown in western media while Ukranians situation is much more dire than reported. Still, Putin, despite being portrayed as a bloodlusting dictator still holds an interest to spare as much Russian soldiers life as possible. Thats the point were Russia will be willing to make concessions. \\nIf sufficient desires are met, goals achieved while letting go of further potential points of attrition then Russia will in turn let go of maximalist negotiations.I personally hope Trump wont be narcissistically insulted by Russia not caving in to his dealmaker approach.

And that's a lack of economic opportunities. All around the world, when young men see a lack of economic opportunity or hope, they turn to crime, terrorism, gang violence, drugs, etc. In the US, we even see the growth of these men turning to figures like Andrew Tate. The solution is to actually improve the economic fortunes and opportunities of people. And that's across all racial lines. That's for a poor Black teen in Baltimore and a poor white teen in Appalachia. These people feel left behind and abandoned by the system. Change the system to improve their fortunes. Make college more affordable. Make housing more affordable. Make healthcare more affordable. Have more technical programs. Create jobs in the renewable energy industry. Create more infrastructure jobs, most of which go to groups that Democrats have lost, not because of preferential hiring, but because these are jobs people will work. Support workers and unions. There's probably more, but centering your politics around economic populism is more inclusive and a winning message.","title":"Detailed Analysis of Progressive Options for 2028"},{"text":"This was his deal that he made?

Or course thats a tiny drop in the bucket compared to military requisitions. I do know the republicans want to clean up performance management though which will help a lot, assuming you have various appointed heads who want to trim fat.Another thing of importance - if you just cut budgets across the board without changing rules, all the contractors get cut to make budget because you cant really fire employees, then productive employees quit because it is ineffective to work without some of the more effective contractors, and you get left with useless employees. Imagine doing that to for example a local fbi office thats busting gangs or dirty doctors, or a social security office enrolling people in benefits and taking dead people off.

The Trumplicans are going to go overboard and the Democrats will be favored because they are not Republicans at that point. They still have to have a winning message. I think it is a disastrous political mistake to compare this period with the 1960s and the flight for civil rights. There huge differnces. Whats the progressive movement is fighting for now is not equality, but a remaking of society to THEIR values. Cancel culture is rife online and in society. Social justice is not about rights but about what one set of people deem as the right thing to be shoved down the throats of others. Eg reparations. DEI etc. Thee policies take ordinary people and force them into the role of defendants being judged guilty, despite them not having done anything. Its time we took MLKs words seriously and stopped judging people by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. And its not always the case that if the outcomes are not racially proportionate, that the system is rigged or wrong. For instance, in Boston, SF, ans NY, advanced math classes were cancelled because not enough black and Hispanic students were enrolled. This was done in the name of equity. Who do you think the parents are going to vote for? Similarly in cities, if for example a large proportion of black youth are rounded up by police, it doesnt mean the police are racist. Perhaps it could just mean that black youth are the ones indulging in crime. Progressives try to change the system to fit the outcomes rather than tackling the root causes, tackling of which is the the only real way of solving the problem .

They have a strong preference for rule of law and cultural norms that allow for all these different types of people to live together in high density. As a result this cooperation leads to more innovation, higher education levels, high incomes, etc... all this is empirically supported by the data.People that can not abide by these rules or norms tend to self select into more rural areas, which are far more homogeneous thus their belief and preferences tend not to be challenged, they feel a strong sense of community, but forego higher income, nearly no innovation, etc...In this election Trump lost the Urban area badly, the gap between urban and rural has never been wider. Some suburban-rural fringe areas moved significantly to the right.People vote with their feet.\\nRural voters are happy to endure lower incomes and other maladies to live in homogenous communities. They have always been this way. I do not blame the Right for this election, the sad thing was too many democrats never got off the sofa.

The civil rights movement in the 1960s wasn't popular, but through organizing and protests, they captured the imagination of the American public, and eventually, legislation got signed. I don't believe in a kind of politics where you just look at what is the majoritarian position and poll-test to death what you should be doing. That was literally the Kamala campaign. It looked like she didn't stand for anything.That being said, I agree progressives have a bad reputation on cultural issues, especially \\"cancel culture.\\" I wouldn't attribute it to the Bernie left necessarily. Much of the Bernie left were maligned as \\"Bernie Bros\\". I think on things like trans issues and crime, we need to have a hard look at how we communicate these things and even how much we support certain ideas ourselves. Trans issues impact very few people and is very easy to scapegoat, but on crime, yes, progressive DAs simply have a bad reputation. I think we do need to have a conversation about reforming our justice system which badly needs to be reformed, while at the same time investing in public safety so that the average person walking in San Francisco feels safe. I was always against the idea of \\"Defund the police.\\" I think body cams, training, qualified immunity, etc., are things we can look at. I think you fall into the trap of defining protest movements by their most radical, unpopular, and controversial elements. Why focus on the parts of the BLM protests that turned violent and not the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY that are just marching for justice? Same thing with Palestinian protesters. And no, AOC does not support protesters with Hamas flags. You're just simply being dishonest. And neither do the majority of protesters. If anything, I agree we need to do a better job of organizing behind mainstream leadership and speakers who distance themselves from easy attacks from the right. There's always a few stupid people at a protest that ruin it for the rest of us and we need to talk about how to combat that, because we know we're right on what we're protesting on.I think a strong, economic populist vision is actually what we need to go forward. We need to target healthcare affordability and housing affordability. We need a message and story about how the elites have ruined this country.

The only time an acting secretary can assume the presidency is if they have been subject to Senate approval for another position within the department they're acting as Secretary of. So the Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth can become the Acting Secretary of State and then assume the Presidency, whereas the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs can't, because the first one is appointed with the Advice and Consent of the Senate and the second one isn't. If Trump relies on acting appointments for his more controversial picks thus far, like Defence, AG, Energy, and Homeland Security (and potentially Treasury, depending who he chooses) then that reduces the line of succession massively. Not only does it remove the actual secretaries of those departments, it means any Deputy and Under Secretaries who have received Senate approval aren't valid in the line of succession as they can't become the Acting Secretary of their department whilst that position is filled with someone who can't assume the presidency. Obviously it would be an absolutely disastrous situation if you're talking about the need for the Deputy Secretary of Energy to become the President...but there's a reason the line of succession exists, and disasters can happen.","title":"Elon Musk Says He and Trump Gave Mandate to Delete Regulations.

The consequences of mass incarceration also didn't quite register in the brains of the white working or middle class yet due to the privilege and systemic racism. Democrats wouldn't have won if they decided to go back to public health messaging.

The earliest possible medical treatment, puberty blockers(normally used for percocious puberty), require regular checkups and monitoring so even in states where teens are empowered to make their own medical decisions it's not really in the cards without the parents' cooperation, and you don't get it without social transitioning, and jumping through hoops with the doctor first. HRT(also used to affirm cis kids genders cause sometimes puberty isn't working right)  already can't be had before 16, and still can't be had without satisfying a doctor(though there are apparently some diy solutions for estrogen if you reeeally want kids doing risky things instead of listening to medical professionals).All gop legislation and rhetoric on the matter focuses on social transitioning, not medical, because the only way to drum up enough numbers to justify such a laws existence is to catch athletic girls, tomboys, theatre kids, neuro divergent's etc in the cross fire for not acting man/woman enough for their respective genders. Look up what happened when utah passed its sports ban, their secretary of education attacked a teen cis girl as trans and when she learned of her error she blamed the teen as not looking womanly enough. Look, we all get that it seems counterintuitive to how one was raised, but we didn't arrive at this permissive affirming conclusion on a fad or to piss trads off, there are rational,  practical reasons affirmative care for teens and affirmative care for children(big difference) are the way they are, and why the rights emotion driven dogma in this matter scares all sorts of folks.","title":"Trump's Staff and Cabinet Picks Are Shaping Up to Be a Who's Who of Anti-LGBTQ+ Extremists"},{"text":"Literally stupidity.

That's fine, but the vast body of testimonial evidence, accumulated over millennia and across generations, from many people that experienced spiritual truths and insights, are not easily dismissed as just hearsay by everyone.  These are part of the vast body of evidences available to humanity, representing deep, personal experiences that have been shared and corroborated by countless individuals and generations throughout history, including our own - indicating theres more to our existence than just the material world.Regarding the history of religion, the perspective you presented is an overly one-sided view, overlooking the significant positive contributions religion has made to society through charity, education, social justice, and outreach. Many of the worlds greatest movements for compassion, justice, and mercy have been driven by religious values and communities.Scientific understanding of the natural world has certainly provided a powerful framework for understanding life on Earth, and its encouraged by faith (eg: Psalms 111:2). So for most people, theres no conflict between faith and science. Both offer valid insights, tools, and complementary perspectives to understand our existence and drive humankind forward positively.

They also claimed like half the globe. It was completely unenforceable to begin with and they never actually set boots on the ground there. You see, Guyana historically was known as the Wild Coast. Right down to the coast was dense jungle and it took a lot of money, death, and disease, to clear the areas that are clear now. An expense the Spanish Crown did not want to undertake so their claim remained lines on a map.Enter the Dutch in the 1600s. The Dutch ALSO claimed this land and ACTUALLY put the work in to settle the land. At this point, the Wild Coast was both the modern territories of Guyana and Suriname combined. Guyana itself was subdivided into three separate administrative/colonial companies: Essequibo (remember this one), Berbice, and Demerara. This is why many towns and people's surnames sound Dutch. The Dutch Colonial period lasts roughly 175 years. In all this time the Spanish Empire are quiet on the issue.Enter British North America and their Revolutionary War. Little known fact, the Dutch Republic was on our side. They were still a little salty over New ~~Amsterdam~~ York plus some other more recent issues with the British. The British, in response, took the colonies of Essequibo, Demerara, and Berbice. AND AGAIN THE SPANISH DID AND SAID NOTHING TO ENFORCE THEIR CLAIMS.  As weve established, many Spanish claims were lines on a map the lands of which the Spanish had never actually set foot in. After some back and forth, will they wont they, the three colonies of Essequibo, Demerara, Berbice, end up permanently under British control in the 1800s and merged into one administrative unit of British Guiana.Enter the Spanish American Wars of Independence. Simon Bolivar creates the Gran Colombia which eventually splits into Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia/Panama, and Venezuela. Because the maps from the Spanish Empire show the Essequibo colony as being part of their lands, Bolivar includes it into the claimed territory of the Gran Colombia. Though again it was always a claim and never acted upon. When the Gran Colombia breaks up and Venezuela is created, they maintain this claim. And here we see THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THE CLAIM. Why? Venezuela is diminished from being part of New Spain then again from the Gran Colombia, and now some more land seems worth fighting about.Enter International Arbitration in 1899. An ascendant United States represents Venezuelas interests in arbitration. This is key. Venezuela itself does not have a voice in its own affairs due to a bit of Monroe Doctrine, and a bit of Britain BIG, Venezuela SMALL in terms of global politics. The arbitration panel begins with the Schomburgk line. A line Britain commissioned a German/HRE naturalist named Robert Schomburgk to delineate for them. His line is TBH way out of pocket. It consumes the entire Essequibo territory and reaches until the mouth of the Orinoco river which would interfere with Venezuelan trade and taxation. Venezuela obviously protests this and with the United States intervening a new line is drawn which is the current border. Guyana got to keep the Essequibo which we had occupied for at least 2 centuries (my family among them) and Venezuela got to keep control of the Orinoco River.Maybe the Venezuelans genuinely accepted this, maybe they kept quiet because what else could they do? Were they about to go to war with the largest Empire in the world at that time? Anyways, this is the start of the conspiracy that they were robbed. A conspiracy of Anglo interests against Venezuela. Considering Guyana was a territory of Britain, we had no actual say in the decision. I believe there is a story about some letter the then President of Venezuela wrote which was not to be opened until after he died which claimed they were robbed and hence the current conspiracy.Anyway the decision persists until 1962 - Guyanese independence. Venezuela, now the bigger of the two, reopens the case with this conspiracy saying they wont abide by arbitration because they were robbed. There have been attempts to reach diplomatic compromise with little success since then. They invaded and still hold an island of ours called Ankoko Island. We Guyanese are here like, you never owned or occupied this land, and now that you think you can bully us, you want what was never yours. They in turn have put troops on the Border to detract from the failures of socialism (I dont wanna hear it about thats state capitalism and US imperialism and thats not real socialism blah blah blah their people are fleeing to MY country and others so shut the fuck up).Its funny the Venezuelans call others Imperialists when they are in fact trying to restore imperial claims which even the originator of those claims didnt enforce or do anything about. This story is basically their version of the Trump conspiracy that the election was stolen.","title":"You guys won: I'm a neoliberal too"},{"text":"I don't care for that pick either.","title":"First time posting."},{"text":"I cant speak for SpaceX but when he would go to the Giga Factory in Nevada, he would often walk through and fire a bunch of people, who would then be told to wait a day then come back and that they arent fired, and more than once he fired critical employees and groups for the giga factory to operate","title":"Elon Musk Says He and Trump Gave Mandate to Delete Regulations.

We all do it from time to time, but we should be self-aware enough to manage it and not let it get the best of us or destabilize us. People who reside in base consciousness are usually victims of the elite's war on the mind. They are right brain imbalanced due to a concerted effort to destabilize their mind and conscious awareness. Only when you balance both hemispheres of the neo cortex can you open the path to the pineal gland, which grants us the garden of Eden, or harmony in our thoughts. There was a study years ago that has since been contested that said we only use 10% of our brain capacity. Those who are able to access their pineal gland can use much more than 10%.Likewise, I believe we have an electromagnetic \\"aura\\" or frequency that surrounds us. I for one can actually feel it in other people. Sadly, many people are negatively charged and very off balance now days in their energy fields also, which indicates that they are that way in their brains as well. This imbalance weakens the field around them and may lead to disease and sickness due to a weakened immune system. It also makes them out of harmony with nature and mother earth.In human alchemy, the object is to bring human consciousness and awareness up from lead to gold. You do this by a rigid process that involves breaking someone's ego down and also many hours of shadow work. Hardship can forge it as well.

Ill propose a number of reasons and then you can tell me which candidates might be suitable. Although no doubt Newsom is licking his chops.The problem completely lay on the left. Trump got nearly the same amount of votes he got the last election. Over 8 million people who voted for Biden last time around stayed home. Thats clearly a problem with the Democrats and the left. Trump did not change. It was the Democrats that did not resound. There are reasons.A big problem was  the Democrats constant pandering. They assumed Democrats, especially Latinos and Progressives would want open borders. Thats why they didnt do anything on the border for nearly 3 years. They pinned all their hopes on abortion not realizing that MOST people were fine with the power of being handed down to the states. They got carried away with social and identity issues.Most people do not want to see men in womens sports. You can debate all you want, but people do not want to see a man beating up a woman in the boxing ring, or placing 1st in the swimmers rankings from 554th, simply by changing his gender and competing with other women. Democrats were also passing policies in some states where loans would only be available on the basis of race. They even change the FEMA directive to disburse aid the basis of  equity. And hours and hours of mandatory DEI training and all these initiatives at work also pissed off a huge chunk of people. Most people want to be judged by the work they do, and actually qualified they are, not on the basis of the color of their skin. Affirmative action directly goes against this. in addition, a whole bunch of cities and states started discussing reparations and started a prioritizing social justice above Later day needs of most people. One needs to understand that with the exception of the hard, Progressive left, these types of issues do not resonate with the masses, and they felt ignored. Further, when it comes to social issues, most dont appreciate being called racist, or transist whatever -ist simply because they oppose the woke policies pushed by the left. In short, there was too much change at the social level in too short of time. And if the Democrats dont understand, this will continue to lose the elections.In addition to rampant cancel culture! Dont even get me started. Sites like Reddit and IMDb are notorious for removing reviews and comments they dont like. When Lord of the rings was review bombed, most were immediately removed. People dont like being censored by a woke police. Granted had nothing to do with these initiatives, but its the Democratic Party that is tainted by such actions because that is part of their brand. It didnt help all these students protesting on campus waving Hamas flags were supported by the likes of AOC and other prominent Democrats.Likewise wirh crime. After George Floyd Democrats went overboard with defund the police and easy on crime DAs like Chesa Boudin, LAs Gascon, that fruitcake in Philadelphia and all the major cities. People were sick of those videos of mobs shoplifting at will with security, just standing by. They were similarly sick of calling attendant every time they wanted to purchase some shaving cream or bottle of Tylenol at CVS or Walgreens because everything was put behind locked shelves. Videos of tent cities, downtowns drug infested hellholes did not help. Yes, people blame inflation but they understand the supply chain issues. But they also understand that these ESG and environmental policies that places like California adopt, add a huge amount to the price of gas. And whether we like it or not, the price of gas is still extremely important to most peopleThere was the issue of the various lawsuits against Trump. Whether you agree or not, Alvin Bragg made him a martyr. And what he was charged with or convicted of, I bet no one can actually knows. And in all the other cases where he deserved to be prosecuted, the Democrats were asleep at the switch or completely inept.Internationally too, Bidens policies were a complete wreck. His Disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the timorous and peacemeal handing out of weapons and aid to Ukraine -  no you cant have tanks, OK you can have tanks; no, you cant have, ok you can have planes, same thing with ATACMS, HIMARS, and dozens of other weapon systems. He succeeded in distributing aid in the worst possible way - slowly in drip drip fashion.He canceled XL pipeline on day one and put the kibosh on oil drilling while at the same time rushing to Saudi Arabia to beg for oil. He was met with derision and ridicule for that fatuous fist bump because his advisor said he should not be seen shaking hands with the bone saw killer. Hootie have shut down the Red Sea, and all his attempts Very limited military strikes have failed. His constant equivocating and moving his deadlines with Israel and with Iran have also condemned him as a weak figure and impotent figure in international geopolitics.It was for all these reasons the voters simply lost interest in Biden and Harris because Harris could not divorce herself from Biden or his agenda. She did not condemn and did not propose anything new. People did not want the same type of governance they had been seen for the last four years, so good chunk of them apathetically just stayed home. Which of course allowed Trump to win.Democrats really need to understand that the government needs to represent the people, and trying to get the people to represent the government is not going to work. People like competence in and being able to relate to the people they elect. In Biden and Harris they do not find that. Which is why Trump won the popular vote as well as the electoral college, a first for Republicans since 2004. He also made in inroads  into virtually every demographic and category, including getting a record share of black men and Latinos. Democrats learned the hard way that if you have an agenda, a brand or stand by policies that do not resonate with the masses, you get kicked out.

I'd love to believe there's hope, because right now I feel none. We're nowhere near as propagandized as those nationsI'd say between Fox News, Rogen, Tucker Carlson, Musk, etc, there's a clear bubble where reality does not matter, and pandemics and crimes can be declared unreal. And given that Trump won this election, it seems the bubble is only growing. Hell, the senate just outright rejected Trumpism in denying his majority leader for a guy who's actively an anti Trump guy because they see the writing on the wall.I hope so, but isn't he one of the Repubs who went to Russia on July 4th? Feels very fragile to put hope there. Incompetence begets Incompetence. He fills those positions with loyalists he has craven idiots to answer the call when the guillotines come out...People said Hitler's incompetence would protect them, but you don't need competence to do terrible things with power, you just need nobody standing in your way.His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \\"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei?em und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaosand it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \\"the greatest actor in Europe,\\" and wrote to a friend, \\"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childishhe would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \\"prodigious amounts of cake\\" and \\"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\\"He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.**Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \\"half-mad rascal\\" or a \\"man with a beery vocal organ.\\"** In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and **it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.**","title":"A clarification on Trump"},{"text":"Yeah.

Reagan won a landslide victory, was insanely popular, and even though H.W. Bush wont after him, it swung in the other direction after one term. Trump won very handsomely in 2016 and by 2020 lost very decisively. Trump often over-performs other Republicans on the ballot, so whether another Republican will recreate Trumps popularity, well have to see.People are sick of Biden and choosing Harris meant choosing someone who isnt even allowed to criticize the incumbent but is somehow meant to convince people she will do things better. Even then, yes, the swing in all categories was massive, but it was still the same 3-5% of swing state voters who call the shots. Considering how Biden fumbled the border, was seen as weak on foreign policy, the fact that prices were massively up, and the job market was rough, its not like the states swung 60-40%. Also, people tire of Trump. When everything is bad, people can put up with voting for him. But the next 4 years are likely to be very exhausting and there is a high chance people will vote for the Democrat, provided hes mentally there. Lastly, Senate swung in the Republicans direction, but thats because red states states finally voted in Republican senators, such as in Montana and West Virginia. They were the exceptions. Of course there are states like Pennsylvania who could have gone either way but went red.Lastly, it depends on what people are expecting. Lower prices? I cant predict the future, but well have to see how that works out. People are much more worried about 2019 vs 2024 prices, not 2023 vs 2024. If you paid $3 for a specific food and then in 2023 it went up to $6 and in 2024 it went to $7. Youre more worried about $3 vs $7 more than $6 vs $7. If the product keeps going up at regular inflation rates, it will never go even close to $3. Very dumbed down example.We cant tell the future, the Democrats did bad and are out of touch, but it depends on how well Trump does and if Democrats learn any lessons, especially on the border and social issues.","title":"CMV: Republicans will continue to win both the Presidency and Senate continually till 2036."},{"text":"It's not kosher, but it's far away from corrupt when it comes to Trump.","title":"Washingtons lobbyists are stunned Trump chose RFK Jr."},{"text":"This is two paragraphs of the pot calling the kettle black.

Those people that fought in the civil war on the side of the confederates built their own mythos through the Lost Cause; they passed the lessons and beliefs of a time where men could be owned like chattel to their children and children's children; and that is how they and theirs supported Jim Crow and in turn, how they and theirs that supported Jim Crow, continued to do so all the way until Desegregation was forced into law.And the people who lived under desegregation, not just the black folks, but the white folks; including the legislators, were, up until fairly recently, very much still in power; and they groomed successors, and taught their children lessons; that again, not all people are equal. Some ought to be separated. And we never dealt with that. We never dealt with the *cultural differences* between the two Americas. We presumed that with time, it would abate itself.But it has never abated itself, because America, for centuries now, refuses to have the honest conversation that this country is split most predominantly between two distinct cultures: one that believes in progression and one that believes in conservation of the status quo, even to everyone's detriment.","title":"Democratic leaders across US work to lead resistance against Trumps agenda"},{"text":"what if. that's cute","title":"Trump team weighs Pentagon pick after sexual assault allegation surfaces | Stars and Stripes"},{"text":"What fucking more?

And the idea of one or two people having the power to unravel generations of government-sponsored research and programs designed to strengthen the social safety net is terrible.   Chances are Musk and Vivik never had to file for SSI or programs themselves.  Theses social safety net programs should be hands-off.  Indeed, their own accumulated wealth may prevent them from valuing a $200/month federal program a disabled person may qualify for. Overall, Federal Government sponsors and funds programs that carry risk a private company wont take on.. or program outcomes remain valuable to people but not marketable/profitable in the private sector. Sure, some programs may be wholly redundant but the reality remains that funds are approved by Congress, its spent, R&amp;D occurs and cash is placed in circulation.  Like Trump, this way of thinking is not the way a typical billionaire is trained to think.   Successful millionaires and billionaires in mass-market roles often focus on cost reduction.   Sure, A few successful millionaires and billionaires dont fully adhere to this mold- like Steve Jobs.  He was arguably one of the masterful exceptions.  Jobs saw a business or mass market need and developed strategy and products around delivery.Another thing is the number of civil servants and subsequent jobs Government creates.  These are generally people in good paying positions, the salaries spent prevent poverty, enable people to perform niche work and be a positive influence in society.  Place a large percentage of people in these niche roles out of work and expect unemployment to rise.  It feels more like a nod to policy with goals to not only increase hardship but also increase crime.","title":"Elon Musk Says He and Trump Gave Mandate to Delete Regulations.

I'm glad you don't want children to be trafficked at the border, but Trump just appointed a child predator as AG. All in all, it's your vote and you used it as you saw fit.  I'd just encourage you to look at policy positions of the candidates and examine the info you're using to make that choice rather than relying on the narratives that you're getting.

Germanys economy had been in the dumps since the end of WWI, when massive war reparations bankrupted the country. The ripple effect from the Great Depression didnt help. Russia, when Putin was elected back in the early 2000s, had suffered a decade of political and economic kleptocracy. The collapse of the Soviet Union decimated the economy, and the Russian mob moved in to grab as much as they could. People were ready for anyone promising change, and both Hitler and Putin did exactly that.The economy here is still strong, and there are still guard rails protecting democracy, here scattered among the house, and definitely in the courts. There will be a pretty strong pushback to anything crazy Trump tries. If he wants to go full autocrat or dictator, hell have to completely destabilize the economy, and that will cause chaos. I suppose he could declare martial law at that point. I dont know if thats part of the plan, but it would cost billions to the people supporting him, and turn his fans against him.Well certainly see what happens, but I dont think democracy is dead in America just yet.

It is unambiguously a chauvinist movement, not an equality movement, nor any kind of movement to deconstruct gender.Feminists had a chance to recognize the manhaters and other toxic elements in their group and kick them aside in favor of a more honest, open, and inclusive equality movement; instead it overlooked them, protected them, and embraced them and their hatred. Like all the other social justice movements, feminism allowed its symbols and rhetoric to be coopted by corporations and liars in exchange for fame and power, and in the process it became wedded to neoliberalism.People wonder why young men are moving right. It's because they see all their enemies in one place that they think of as \\"the left\\": the women and white knights who hate them on social and corporate media for clout and ruin every male space while decrying masculinity as toxic, and the corrupt establishment that has abandoned both free and fair democracy and the working class and calls them names if they complain about it.It's not that the men are all fascist racist misogynists. It IS that they've had just about enough of this shit, and they see no other political home for them than the right - which, for all its flaws, accepts them with open arms, not the calculating death-stare of some noseringed, fluorescent haired harpy.It will probably lead to empowering _actual_ racists, misogynists, and fascists - and that's the price that the SJWs and their pet demographics will pay for trying to bully society into changing and succumbing to the temptation of hypocrisy.I'm not sorry at all.

Ok...There isn't any power that comes with any of this, it's just a parliamentary term for the opposition's designated spokesman on an issue: e.g. the shadow health minister speaks on health issues and usually criticizes the government's actions while laying out the opposition's plan.  Usually it's the person who the opposition would nominate to run that ministry/department if they won the next election. There is no power for a shadow cabinet because, by definition,  a shadow cabinet is out of power.  I think your misunderstanding comes from differences in how the word shadow is being used. In parliamentary language 'shadow' doesn't have the same nefarious connotation that it does in normal American speech. Its meaning is much closer to 'follow,' as in \\"I'm shadowing my training manager today so I can learn about this process at work.\\"","title":"Congressman Openly Discussing Creating \\"Shadow Cabinet\\" To Overthrow Trump's Rule (saying the quiet part out loud/literally treason/shadow government)"},{"text":"More fearmongering....

Past presidents push back against Netanyahus settlements into Palestinian territory and Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem which was contentious, but he was president so it was definitely within his power.Well, youre right there - itll definitely be less complex if Netanyahu gets his way. Im sure on a human level Trump cares about casualties, Im sure Biden and Harris do too - but they make nation level choices with other things to consider than casualties. You say the Biden administration helped with a genocide, but theyd see it differently; just from his last term, if anything Id bet Trump wouldve been more supportive of Israel, honestly. Policy with Israel is really only now being strained a bit, but the US has and probably will always be supportive of them as long as Iran are our enemies; probably for as long as terrorism in the Middle East continues.All that said, maybe things being shaken up one way or the other is what this country needs, well ultimately just have to see how his next term plays out.","title":"im a leftist and i voted for trump. dont hurt me"},{"text":"Too much haha, pretty soon boohoo.","title":"How RFK Jr. would change McDonalds  and Trumps diet"},{"text":"I completely agree with everything you have said here.

I've never voted for the same person twice.Some may say that a few of the people I decided to vote for were throwaway or protest votes, but, a protest vote has it's importance as well.I voted for H. Ross Perot.  When he garnered 10% of the National vote, it should have rattled the establishment all those years ago that there were a lot of unhappy people.  Both of the wings of the Uniparty should have heeded the warning.Fast forward several years and I voted for Dr. Ron Paul.  I went to one of his rallies.  He was filling small venues to over capacity.  He scared 'em, but, he didn't scare 'em enough.  The establishment didn't pay attention.  Again.I voted for some of the original Tea Party candidates as well.  And, whadda ya know, a few of them won!  But, the Republicans and Democrats fought for these conglomeration of independents to come into one of the two folds.  The Republicans won.  They bastardized the group that came to buck the system, and again, the power structure didn't see what they were building up to.  They went along business as usual.  The D.C. power structure created an opening for Trump.  It's all of their fault.  Not ours.  We protest voted for decades.But, then, these dummies circled the wagons in Trumps first term, ganging up on him, leaving the majority of the real support he got in congress up to the handful of Tea Party people that weren't happy with being dragged over to one side when they were trying to be a true third party.  The RINO and the Democrat fought EVERYTHING.  So did the world.  To a point where someone out there released a designer virus, and ensured the bullshit leadership of the world helped with punishing all of us for being sick of the gamesmanship and picking the billionaire that wasn't on their bingo card.The candidates that were supposed to be in \\"competition\\" when Trump won were Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.  Either way, the establishment of the nation and the world were in very good hands.  But, this bozo fucked it all up.  It was an act of war upon them by the people, and our punishment began.What they didn't realize is that if you beat a dog every day, even though you feed him every day too, at some point, he's gonna bite your ass.A couple of Tuesdays ago, the people bit back.We have a spanking coming.  A really thorough beating this time.It's up to people like OP to trust their gut. Doesn't matter how you aligned yourself yesterday, or the day before, it was Election Day that you marked a ballot for Trump.  You're not cow-towing to your chosen label, you're throwing out some hope for change.I remember all the hope and change Mr. Sotero promised, and by 2012, I was hoping for a change FROM Barry.If you trusted your gut, or instinct, or that little voice inside your head to pick Trump, it's o.k.  If you didn't, that's o.k. too.  However, the only way the guy is going to have any ability of making good on any of his promises is for us not necessarily to support him, but, instead, make sure we tell THEM we'll take our beating and do it again.  We're learning to bite harder.","title":"im a leftist and i voted for trump. dont hurt me"},{"text":"You think?
