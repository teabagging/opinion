The left has way more power to indoctrinate the masses with lies. They control almost all of online, hollywood, TV and print media, the education system, entrenched government institutions and bureaucrats, the biggest most monopolistic corporations and industries are all run by democrats. The only reason the communist label sticks is because it's organic and grass roots - because it's actually true. Many democrats are even ok with the label because they agree with it and self identify.And those who don't are de facto supporting communist/fascist/authoritarian government by voting for democrats at this point. Cancel culture and political correctness, suppression of opposition speech, manipulation of algos, media propaganda, abuse of power and lawfare against political opponents, use of identity politics to create division, full support of the establishment and patriot act surveillance state types, the party of top-down government control... I mean they literally just murdered some guy's innocent pet squirrel and racoon the other day in NY... I don't even know where to begin or where to end in explaining how the label actually applies to them objectively from a purely factual basis but not to us... So no it's not the same at all.We can say you are a communist because X, Y, Z and list direct examples of them supporting policies that would undoubtably classify as that. Meanwhile they call Trump and us Nazis... but can't back that up with anything real. They say because he had a dog and Hitler did too... I mean there is some serious logical problem and disconnect from reality on one side compared to the other. Trump's about to be a grandfather to both jewish and arab grandkids too.If you don't see the difference between the two sides here then your mind is so clouded by democrat conditioning and you are far gone. Survey after survey and real life event after event shows that modern day democrats are the intolerant ones. The hate is off the charts from them they are the same people who in nazi germany would report their neighbors and family members to the state. They have a bunch of the key psychological traits of nazis even their overwhelming use of projection which is why they literally gave us the label all over mainstream news even though it obviously makes no sense to anybody who spends more than a minute to think about it and has a brain larger than a pea.","title":"WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE?

During her Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour Stop in Atlanta on Saturday (Nov. 2), the Birds of Feather singer paused her show in order to talk to her fans. In a TikTok posted by the Democratic Partys official account, Eilish can be seen standing on stage at State Farm Arena urging her fans to vote for Harris in Tuesdays election (Nov. 5). Times are really scary and a lot is at stake and I know that if youre in this room and you support me, you support women, Eilish said to a screaming crowd. I hope that you will vote for Kamala Harris. This is not the first time Eilish has spoken about her support for the vice president. On National Voter Registration Day back in September, the Bad Guy singer and her brother, Finneas, made a video speaking directly to their fans about why they were supporting Harris and Tim Walzs bid for the White House. We are voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy, Eilish said. Vote like your life depends on it, because it does. Eilishs plea to voters came in a strategic location  Georgia is one of the seven key swing states that Harris and Trump are both looking to lock down in Tuesdays bout. According to polling averages from The New York Times, Trump currently leads the state by a single percentage point. But the Times political analyst Nate Cohn writes that polling averages in this particular election should be taken with a grain of salt: In the history of modern polling, theres never been a race where the final polls showed such a close contest, he writes.","title":"Billie Eilish Pauses Her Atlanta Concert to Urge Fans to Vote for Kamala Harris: A Lot Is at Stake"},{"text":"Heres the thing, stuff like this is great until the general public finds out about them.

Good article. Some tidbits,   But this cycle, with former President Donald Trump and Co. discovering it might be smart to encourage Republicans to vote early and even by mail (the horror!), the GOP vote has been frontloaded. The inverse is true and the question is whether the Democrats can overcome a 43,000-plus GOP ballot lead as I write this.\\n \\n But my theory of the case is there are still a lot of Clark County mail ballots to be counted that favor Democrats and the GOP partial cannibalization of its Election Day vote will propel some Democrats to victory but perhaps not quite get there with others.\\n \\n I have been calling this The Unicorn Election because of the unusual voting patterns.   \\n \\n The key to this election has always been which way the non-major-party voters break because they have become the plurality in the state.

How many people die from preexisting medical conditions when they are kicked off their health insurance?  I said I'm against modern warfare because the loss of life is usually civilian for the last 100 years.  But we aren't living in a perfect world -  we are living in a world with nuclear weapons-  not every leader of every country is actually able to manage a responsibility so horrific.So go add up the loss of life in the wars in the middle east for the last 20 years only.  Don't bother with the last 2000 years just deal with the last 20 years.  Helping an ally is not the same thing as being an aggressor.  Putin threw an all female band in prison for 2 years because rhey staged a musical protest at an orthodox church that was supporting his campaign.  He kills moderates and has been expanding Russia.  Expansion is aggression.  Helping an ally isn't the same thing as aggressive expansion.  So if 79 million boomers got kicked off their health insurance by Republicans STILL trying to gut AND KILL the ACA and let's say 10 million of them had untimely deaths from that in the next few years -  wtf is that?!  Is that the same as 1-2 million people dying in war in the middle east in the last 20 years? They both suck in certain ways yes.  But one party has the alt left calling for an end to genocide.  Moderates at the UN are calling for bibi to stop.  Look what rhe taliban is doing to women?  12 million women locked in their homes.  Feminists are saying this equates to gendered SLAVERY because rhe woman is the domestic servant of rhe man, not allowed to speak to other w omen and not allowed to move freely in society without her male guardian. Feminists are saying that's WORSE than apartheid because in apartheid at least the abused race is not tied to one domestic master and is allowed to operate in society even though they are being oppressed in a horrific way too.So go ahead and say there's no difference in the two parties but it means you didn't do a real body count -  you didn't really look at a body count or the fact that no the taliban cannot handle certain technological capabilities that other countries are managing right now.  We want the party with the lowest body count in my opinion","title":"Kremlin warns Trump 'may face JFK-style assassination' if he tries to end war."},{"text":" As a Brit thats weirdly sensible for him","title":"Donald Trump should accept result and go play golf if Kamala Harris wins, says Nigel Farage"},{"text":"He's been hated long enough that even Remo Williams killed him in book 90 \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" published in 1992.","title":"Donald Trump's Hometown Stronghold Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"The problem is ballots counted AFTER Election Day.

My mother is a very social person. We went a lot of places, were active in our local homeschool group and church, and did extra curricular activities like orchestra, gymnastics, dance, theater,  baseball, soccer, etc. While my mom was a shitty science and math teacher (I had math and science tutors), we were not lacking in friends or social interaction. I know not every homeschooler is that way, which is why I said it is a caveat. I certainly met some kids who were socially awkward, but was that because they were homeschooled? Or because they were socially awkward on their own? There are plenty of kids who went to public and private schools who also are socially awkward, so saying homeschooling makes someone that way would be disingenuous without serious study. When I meet new people, none of them would have guessed that I was homeschooled growing up and no one seems to care.Also, I was the kind of kid who liked to learn and was introverted (here's the kid/parent combo caveat). Homeschooling worked really well for me. I was a to-do list kind of kid who was proud of the fact that I finished all my work before my peers. I had no trouble transitioning to college and have three degrees. My younger brothers, on the other hand, fought my mom at every turn. I would have sent their asses to school because of the way they treated my parents and fought learning at every turn.

For all the people who can't believe why we wouldn't vote for Harris...According to latest polls: Only 10% of Arab Americans are voting for Trump. Stein 42% and 40%Harris 8% not voting/undecided. Arab americans voting for Trump are primarily republican, and would vote for Trump regardless. Stein voters are mostly democrat, and can't bring themselves to vote for Harris. The Harris campaign really dropped the ball with the Arab Americans. For the record, the muslim ban is preferable to genocide ALWAYS. It's an ignorant argument, and we're tired of having to explain why. But I'll keep doing it. To put things in perspective... We've had 15 wars between Palestine and Israel since the 1940's. This war alone:1.9 million displaced\\n43k dead\\n20k missing\\n101k injured\\n392k facing catastophic food insecurity\\n70% of livestock destroyed\\n68% crops destroyed\\n52% agricultural wells damaged\\nRisk of disease due to waste and sanitation interruptions \\n17k children unaccompanied by an adult or family member (Likely  orphans)\\nLong term mental health impacts on young children (they blame themselves and its fucking horrible to think about)I could keep going... My point is, any Arab american not voting for Harris has every right not to. If you want to complain, complain to Harris. Her campaign has blatantly ignored Arab americans, kicked us out of rallies unprovoked, declined invitations to speak with us, evades all questions about the war, brings Fucking Liz Cheney to Michigan, and Harris repeatedly saying, \\"Israel has a right to defend itself\\" when she knows damn well that's not what Israel is doing.Again, I could keep going...","title":"I am an Arab American voting for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Respect is earned, not given.","title":"NBC files FCC 'equal time' notice after Kamala Harris appears on 'SNL'"},{"text":"Demons are jerks, we can all agree on that.","title":"Does anyone here honestly believe that Tucker Carlson was mauled in his bed by a demon?"},{"text":"Reading the very first article it is clear that Trump is not planning on implementing tariffs on ever single product that comes into the country and he talks about using tariffs to getting better trade terms with foreign countries, to prevent foreign conflict and to keep companies from leaving America for other countries.

The reality is that \\"home schooling\\" is such a broad term, describing so many separate experiences, that it's hard to generalize.Some of the things you've highlighted are very insightful, and true of my own (and I think many other's) experience. e.g., this:Finally, the fact that the majority of their peers will have these common experiences will leave them perpetually feeling like an outsider, even once school is well behind them.Now in many ways, this can be helpful; I think it tends to produce more empathy for others and a capability to see similarity in people outside of a narrow generational cohort; it's harder to feel a strong sense of generational / regional \\"us versus them\\", for all the positives and negatives of it. I think that's a pretty universal experience of homeschooling.With that being said (and counter to your POV), home-schooled children [statistically](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/parenting-translator/202109/the-research-homeschooling):* Consistently achieve better academic outcomes than other children\\n* Score similarly in socialization and mental health through high school\\n* Achieve somewhat better long-term mental health and economic outcomesNow, you should take causality with a grain of salt here -- the strongest predictors for success in the factors above are a) parental engagement and b) family income. Since home-schoolers tend to be wealthier than average and are by definition heavily engaged, it's tough to know whether these kids would have had better outcomes, anyway. However, empirical study certainly fails to support the idea that homeschooling produces worse outcomes; at worst, you could interpret the above as a super economically inefficient way of achieving similar outcomes.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Its radio silence on the left as well","title":"If this happened to a democrat it would destroy their career (rightfully so)"},{"text":"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://forward.com/opinion/670756/i-was-stephen-millers-rabbi-heres-why-im-voting-for-kamala-harris/) reduced by 87%.

But broadly, in the last several decades, there has been a failure of government to protect small business owners from big business. In turn they were preyed on by the right,  exploiting their struggle by blaming people lower on the socioeconomic hierarchy (welfare recipients, immigrants, non-whites, etc etc). Seymour Martin Lipset and Theodor Geigers wrote about this extremism from the center and how sections of the middle classes ended up voting for Hitler. But in any case, the Nazis ended up selling them out to big business anyway, which they needed to fuel their war machine and maintain their power.

I think social liberalism is every bit as much of an evolution in the liberal tradition as right wing or \\"classical\\" liberalism. It is not only us who have changed, there's plenty that \\"classical liberals\\" say that would be unrecognizable to actual liberals from the periods they claim to emulate. There's a whole bunch of social darwinism thrown in there from late 19th century thought, and they just pretend like that's not a big deal. It's not. \\"Classical\\" liberalism forecloses in specific and distinct ways many questions that had previously been more or less open within liberalism. Just the same as modern social liberalism has. They put on the pretense that their developments of these questions is the authentic and original interpretation, but that's putting on airs. The actual figures they are quoting would have simply been confused had you gone up to them and started talking with some of the assumptions that classical liberals take for granted - these assumptions were developed later on, and would appear novel to them. It always stuns me when right wingers think of themselves talking in the voice of the founders or whatever, pronouncing angrily on what is going. These speculated founders always talk as if they had full knowledge of the intervening events between their time and ours, and knowledge of specific arguments and types of discourse that are in fact entirely modern cliches. There's simply no chance that a person who lived at that time could even say much of what they're saying. But they don't think of this. Just imagine George Washington died, and in the interceding 250 years of debating himself in heaven happened to as he was watching jump onto all the bandwagons in the interim that a modern conservative would have thought it appropriate at that time to jump on? Then what would he say? It's such a stupid thing to think, like clearly the interceding 250 years of bandwagon hopping and building up grudges based on that probably dominates whatever speculated ideology George Washington ever had, which mostly would have been things that the leader of a small Atlantic nation could have at that time been aware of and noticed at that time. So why don't we just discuss the 250 years of grudges themselves? And get directly to the matter, as I think that's where the heart of the issue probably lies. But no, we have to run a seance with a speculated version of George Washingtons soul who happened to have made all the decisions you think would've been right in the interim. This is somehow a meaningful activity.","title":"What is the neoliberal stance on libertarians.

Voting is just one of the many things a responsible adult will do. No one will agree with a candidate 100% in our crappy 2 party system so no one expects voting for anyone to carry connotations of endorsement or agreeing with things that you dont agree with.Being a responsible adult just means understanding that change will take time and that we are in a giant boat together as the United States. We cant all be asking what can others do for me because that is a selfish and childish. The question should be what sort of society do I want for myself and others and what incremental steps can be taken to get there.Children want to blow things up because theres an adult who will deal with reality for them. Adults understand that theres no one else. Its on their shoulders to create that better world regardless of what pain they must deal with on that journey.I do feel for the Palestinians who are essentially being asked to vote while attending a funeral for their loved ones, but there are others who are going through their own shit as well. Women are dying in hospitals. Children are getting shot up in schools. There are massive problems the country faces and there is no one coming to save us.We are the worlds leader.

I didn't provide them with anything more than the info on the form.  When they interviewed me later they asked about everything they found while I was connected to a polygraph. I was on video, and my responsiveness was being recorded. If I had lied I would have been charged with a crime and faced prison time.

All other concerns of the State should be secondary to that. (Though I definitely do NOT believe that those should be the states only concerns) The libertarian view on immigration is the first break I realized I had from conservative values after growing up in a very Republican household.I also hold a strong belief that the government in general and any of its representatives specifically, from the President right down to local cops should be scrutinized very, very heavily, and held to a much more critical standard than the average person or private organization, simply based on the fact that private firms and groups may fail and disband and fall into obscurity, but even the most inconsequential government representative has some degree of the potentially infinite power of the Leviathan at their disposal to do as they wish.\\nIt seems logical to me, with these being my greatest concerns when it comes to governance, that libertarians should be doing everything in our power to stop zealous right-wing populists headed by a would-be tyrant from controlling the government.\\nOf course now we have the Libertarian party inviting the most out-of-control would-be despot speaking at their national conference because he knows those people love him. So, true libertarians should of course be mostly in favor of what are considered liberal values. But true libertarians are far from those who now claim that label.In addition, I would say that after examining history, rethinking my own empathy, and appreciating how close we have come in the past to true worldwide despotism, and recognizing the current despots that exist the world over, one big break I have from Libertarians is that I believe fully in international \\"meddling\\" by western liberal governments in the affairs of antiliberal governments and movements all over the world, not only on the basis that weakening anti-freedom groups everywhere is essential in the long run for protecting freedoms at home, but I take a much less popular and somewhat extreme view, probably even among most of us here, that the final mandate of Liberal society will be to ultimately liberate all those who live under despotism anywhere- ideally by intimate globalization of culture and trade.","title":"What is the neoliberal stance on libertarians.

They acknowledged that they knew he did it, but couldnt do anything to make him stop. So, they moved *me*, instead, like I had been the one to do something wrong. This was 2/3 of the way through the school year, so I failed, that year, there were so many classes I couldnt get a final grade for since I was moved halfway through the year. The boy got worse after this, seeing how close he could get to me, before I would start crying. I would have been held back a second time, since I was so afraid to go to school, I missed 100 days in one year.The boy was repeatedly holding me down and fingering me against my will. I would be frozen in fear, unable to move or scream. It wasnt like he just grabbed my butt (not that thats okay, either.) The school tried to blame me, because I froze and couldnt scream. I was so ashamed. My mom only found out, because she found me with handprint-shaped bruises on my breasts, and I begged her not to say anything, because I feared for my safety. He told me he would hurt me, and he was already hurting me, so why wouldnt I believe him?We tried to go to the police. The police just asked if I was wearing short shorts when he did it, as if I provoked him with my clothing. It made me really distrust police.The other kids found out what happened, and bullied me relentlessly. They didnt understand it was non-consensual, no matter how many times I tried to defend myself. They nicknamed me retard fucker. (I dont like that word, its just important for the story.) to this very day, people in my hometown still ask me if I still fuck retards. Im 27 years old. The trauma I got from going to school is immense.If it werent for homeschooling, I would have fallen through the cracks. I would have never been able to graduate high school.

It's like his \\"quiet\\" period was really him taking really expensive courses in contemporary philosophy, science, and critical thinking trends.I've been seeing indications that everybody on the right has been taking these kinds of courses. I haven't seen any news articles on this, it's just my own personal observation.And look at how the entire right wing has responded the Democrats' gender ridiculousness: they get all philosophical about \\"truth\\", sounding like well-educated philosophy professors. This is something that's never happened before in American politics.I've only heard all that talk about \\"truth\\" in college philosophy classes, never in mainstream American society. I've even been hearing it from various Catholic and Protestant church leaders. They go on about the importance of \\"truth\\" and all that.Of course, the right wing starts it all off with the gender stuff, and the context is that only through Jesus do we have \\"truth\\", but their language and argument styles for it are all straight from university philosophy classes.Then there's people on Reddit and social media who've started to put on a show acting like they know how to recognize structures of people's arguments and how to refute them.I know just from simple observation that some kind of massive, nationwide intellectual upgrades have occurred among the political right. It's also happened somewhat from the Democrat side, but they're lazy about it as they think they're right all the time, plus just trust authority figures now and angrily insist we all just obey without thinking.

Reading through slave narratives or of what happened to people of color 100 years ago is just horrifying to see.

My mom applied as a nurse in the late 70s to a North Florida hospital and the hiring/HR director when she started said in passing \\"we have our ni&amp;&amp;ers here but they know their place\\".  How many black nurses do you think they hired there... I'd say it might be stagnating.  You see a lot of those same white supremacist arguments made just behind a bit of a curtain while taking the overt white supremacy out of it and that being more accepted in some groups.    For example years ago white supremacists complaining about Juneteenth would overtly.  Black people were better off enslaved, they got uppity with freedom, they try to use white only parks to celebrate, etc etc.  Now it's  \\"I don't like Juneteenth because it's not the perfect day in my mind as all slavery officially ended on this day instead\\".   And that just lacks any sort of logic when the person hasn't made one complaint about Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, or the 4th of July and those dates being chosen.  But if you take out the blatantly white supremacist reasoning, no matter how unsound a different reason that's created is, there's some people willing to keep accepting the same old story.  Or the idea of embracing white supremacist/white nationalist ideals, but pretending to not know where they come from.  It's tough.  Like I said, born and raised in the South.  It's better from the days of my youth, but still kind of shocking how many hoops someone will go through to embrace that stuff without being overt about it.","title":"CMV: US society is probably becoming more racist"},{"text":"I wish Trump could get this treatment but unfortunately it's still going to be closer than it should be","title":"Arizona Democrats Are Ready to Bury Kari Lakes Non-Career"},{"text":"Yes but there will still be dramala","title":"Had a 2 hour debate with my MAGA stepdad the other day and my mom just told me hes voting for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"What have I turned around and down?

A lot of neoliberals are fond of a some major schools of libertarianism because of the important role libertarians had in forming neoliberalism as it currently exists. Milton Friedman was a self-described libertarian, and some libertarians claim him as one of them just as you'll see a lot of Friedman flairs on this sub. They are always welcome to join us at the corner taco truck.There are points of agreement between the camps on some approaches and issues - just as there are between Neoliberals and Progressives or even Neoliberals and \\"Social Democrats\\" or - kinda - some Socialists.But most (not all) of the precepts that ground libertarian thought are different from those that ground liberalism and especially neoliberalism.I will say that you'll often see points of agreement, connection and \\"crossing over\\" between consequentialist libertarians (those who see libertarian ideas as the best pragmatic means to positive outcomes) and neoliberals.But there are also really important differences:Most neoliberals share a belief in the importance of constructive institutions to ensure the proper function of the rule of law, democracy and free markets - locally, nationally and internationally. We're globalists and big fans of wonkish technocratic policies in finance and trade. Multilateral alliances and cooperation FTW. Libertarians see \\"constructive state/mandatory institutions\\" mostly as an oxymoron, and definitely are not okay with international institutions having any kind of umbrella regulatory or market interference role;Most neoliberals recognize the importance of a good social welfare state and openness to non-market distribution to alleviate acute and also *chronic* distress, secure broad support for open, free, democratic and market driven societies. Desperate, starving and miserable people are usually less productive and more stabby, and liberalism's moral core is the inherent dignity, liberty and worth of the individual human being. Libertarians share some of this moral core, but are usually hostile to social support programs, seeing the taxes that fund them as a morally offensive deprivations of liberty and a socially destructive necessary evil at best.The importance of a pragmatic and proactive role for the state in ensuring the best infrastructure and groundwork for free markets, innovation and growth to flourish. We prefer free markets like Libertarians, but will use public enterprise where there is a clear and definite advantage over a market solution. Libertarians are less pragmatic and more idealistic - they only accept government intervention where there is no other possible choice; andWorms. Neoliberalism is about worms. Libertarianism is not about worms.The Neoliberal Podcast has some good episodes on the topic, if you're interested.","title":"What is the neoliberal stance on libertarians.

The problem isnt that these institutions inherently lack expertise; rather, political pressures interfere with their functioning. As you mentioned, appointments can be politically motivated, and individuals like Jerome Powell may not have a specialized degree in economics. However, the teams working under these leaders often possess the expertise needed to guide decision-making effectively.Its true that no system can be entirely free from politics, and technocratic solutions are not meant to eliminate political influence. Instead, its designed to complement democratic structures by bringing specialized knowledge to complex problems. The checks and balances in our government should ensure that experts propose data-driven solutions while elected officials and the public hold them accountable. This can prevent technocratic processes from becoming detached from societal needs.Historically, technocratic institutions have provided effective solutions in times of crisisthe Great Depression, the 2008 financial crisis, and even during the COVID-19 pandemic. These successes show that when adequately funded and allowed to function properly, technocratic bodies can enhance governance by balancing expertise with political oversight.The challenge isnt whether technocratic solutions can work; its about maintaining and refining it in the face of political neglect and underfunding. Rather than simply calling for defunding or dismissing institutions as corrupt, we need meaningful discourse on how to make them more effective, ensuring they adapt and continue serving the public good within a democratic framework.","title":"Seeking Meaningful Discussion on Technocratic Solutions to Societal Challenges"},{"text":"My mom told me she was undecided. 100% lie.

That's just the way it is.For anyone that doesn't like Harris, consider this: Trump made hundreds of judicial appointments (some wholly unqualified), including three to the Supreme Court. The next president is likely to get at least two appointments to SCOTUS.Getting Trump reelected will badly hurt the progressive agenda. In fact, Trump poses a threat to the existence of Democracy itself.  Harris may not be the first choice of progressives, but she is light years better than Trump. The way forward is not by choosing a great leader. The way forward is by maintaining a system with strong institutions that can preserve our democracy even despite a bad leader like Trump. Trump plans to deliberately dismantle those institutions. Harris may not be liberal enough for some, but she will not tear down the institutions supporting democracy. The progressive resistance to Harris is based on a badly mistaken way of looking at politics and government. It boils down to Harris not passing the purity test. This is a revolutionary mentality that has never worked and never will. What works is an evolutionary mentality. We can move the country to the left incrementally. But it has to start with beating Trump. After Harris, we elect an even more progressive candidate. With each administration comes new career professionals, new laws, new judicial appointments, new cabinet appointments, etc.  Over time things evolve in a progressive direction.  All of this may fail if those on the left that are hopelessly ideological cannot see the truth of this and refuse to help stop Trump. Ironically, they'll blame this on Harris and the Democrats, but it's their own shortsightedness.  Getting Trump reelected will set the progressive agenda back decades and anyone that can't see that is a damned fool.I always vote progressive in the primaries. However, I refuse to throw my vote away on a third party candidate in the general election when, like it or not, this is a two-horse race. If Clinton had won in 2016, there would now be a 6-3 liberal majority on the US Supreme Court instead of the nightmare 6-3 far right majority we currently have. Women in this country became second class citizens because Clinton was not elected. We cannot afford to be obsessed with progressive purity or fantasize that ANY candidate we elect will be a saint. Hundreds of millions of real people got fucked over because the lesser evil lost in 2016. Let's not find out what additional injustices will be perpetrated under a second Trump term.Of course, I wish our system wasn't this broken. Obviously, I wish we had different choices. But do you seriously think Trump getting elected in 2016 and ensuring decades of a far right SCOTUS helped progressive causes? If you cannot see a difference between Trump and Harris, you're a hopeless ideologue and I wager you have the **privilege** of not being affected by the adverse consequences of your own purity-obsessed \\"progressivism\\" (that is, assuming you're even sincere). You people do know that progressivism means *advancing* liberal causes, right? Progresivism certainly doesn't mean moving us closer and closer to fascism.Harris is not perfect, but there is no symmetry between her and Trump. Voting for Stein or any other third party candidate serves no purpose better than it serves fascism. It is obvious that either Trump or Harris will win. It's also obvious that choosing Harris will better serve progressivism. This isn't a difficult choice at all.","title":"John Oliver Fights Back Tears Urging Viewers to Vote for Kamala Harris: Wouldnt It Be Great to Live in a World Where Trump Is No Longer an Active Threat?"},{"text":"Yeah, I only know 1 person who voted.

At least in theory, anyone appointed to be in charge of something should be a subject matter expert in the related field. The immediate problem should be obvious. Whoever gets appointed will always have political pressures to get certain politicians elected and engage with politics directly. I have never heard of a technocratic system that gets around this. At the end of the day, all power in a society is inherently political. There will always be egos, infighting, and all the baggage that comes with power. We have checks and balances that completely disregard the qualifications of appointed government officials out of necessity. Even Papa Jpow, the federal reserve chairman and my personal flair, does not have a degree in economics or finance. He is accountable to Congress, whom I only elect my state's representatives. Fairly far removed from democracy, he is arguably the single most important person relative to the US economy. He is also the closest thing to a technocrat in the world that I am aware of. I guess all that rambling is just to say that technocracy doesn't really exist because it doesn't make sense to. In a dictatorship, republic, or parliamentary system, Jpow will be the closest thing you get.

Betting odds are purely a sign of where the money is coming in. Trump being a BETTING favorite currently just means more money has been placed on Trump than on Harris. Bookmakers are incentivized to adjust odds so that an even amount of money comes in on each outcome - that way the house always wins. If the overwhelming amount of bets/money is on one outcome, the house can get fucked without an equal amount of money having been placed on the opposite outcome to, in practice, cancel out payments to winning bettors. Just this basic knowledge of how betting lines are contrived should be enough for people not to put any serious consideration of them being indicators for future outcomes, but then you also have to consider that the population of people betting on a presidential race are self-selecting and in no way a representative sample of the voting population writ large, let alone likely voters in specific swing states who ultimately decide the final results of the election. Polling has been close for a month, and while the lack of statistical outlier polls raises some red flags for me as a data nerd, there really isnt much reason to believe this election isnt going to come down to ~200k votes in a couple of swing states like the last several elections. The only anomaly that I think possibly hasnt been accounted for in polling is the impact the Dobbs decision is going to have on voter turnout among cohorts that arent high propensity voters and/or possible affiliation shifts because of Dobbs like we see in the Selzer data from Iowa.

The departments report on the impact of the Butch Lewis Emergency Pension Relief Act finds that, as of October 2024, more than $69 billion in Special Financial Assistance has been approved for 98 multiemployer pension plans whose participants faced reductions in retirement benefits averaging 41 percent. The report also shows the American Rescue Plan already has provided more than $1.6 billion in restorative payments and ongoing benefit payments to more than 121,000 retirees, an average of about $13,600 per retiree. Almost half of the $1.6 billion reversed retirees previous benefit reductions.  \\n...  \\nSpecial Financial Assistance has safeguarded plan benefits for union workers and retirees in many industries, including nearly 620,000 Teamsters, more than 152,000 in the United Food and Commercial Workers International, over 103,000 Bakery and Confectionery workers, more than 89,000 United Steelworkers, over 50,000 Communications Workers of America, as well as 49,000 union musicians and 29,000 carpenters.The pension protection legislation in the American Rescue Plan was named for the late Butch Lewis, a former Teamster who fought to protect union retirees pensions from harsh benefit cuts through no fault of their own. Ultimately, the act is expected to ensure roughly two million workers and retirees pension plans remain solvent and able to pay full benefits workers earn through at least 2051.Statement from Acting Secretary Julie Su:A pension is more than a number on a sheet of paper; its the ability to stop working after years of making a good, honest living, to rest your aching knees and aching backs, and to go to bed without setting an alarm clock. A pension isnt given. Its earned, said Acting Secretary Julie Su. The Biden-Harris administrations American Rescue Plan has already delivered on the promise of ensuring a secure and dignified retirement for more than 1.2 million workers and retirees, and theres still more to come. We ultimately expect pension plans covering more than two million workers and retirees to remain solvent and able to pay out full benefits for the next several decades.","title":"Fact Sheet: President Biden Announces 1.2 Million Pensions Protected Under Biden-?Harris Administration, Celebrates Historic Support for Unions"},{"text":"While I hate that we're all permanently cursed with the knowledge of who exactly in our community actively supported a fascist these past 10 years, I'll breath one hell of a sigh of relief if he loses.

There's also the fact that a lot of Republican pollsters, especially after 2020 with Trump going absolutely insane over J6, and due to the hardcore consolidation of power in the party behind Trump after McCarthy went to Maralago to kiss the ring, that a lot of less reputable (and more reputable) Conservative leaning pollsters actually being straight-up bullied by Trump and his surrogates into giving actually BS stats.The numbers themselves might not be \\"false\\", but what we're seeing in both Republican pollsters tweaking the #s and everyone else under/overshooting Trumps numbers is the changes in how they're weighing return data and trying to sculpt it to fit actual census data. Selzer explains this when she's recently been talking about her bunker-buster Iowa poll with Harris +3, pollsters are trying to hard over-correct for previous cycles' weights being off, which is in turn causing the current weights to be off because the invisible energization of the voters has swung in the opposite direction again and they're still correcting for the bygone movement:[https://youtu.be/zguy5q1lfXc?si=mnnOdm7rtvIshoE4](https://youtu.be/zguy5q1lfXc?si=mnnOdm7rtvIshoE4)Something I'd like to note on an insane hopium note as well, *she specifically says that Harris' numbers in this Iowa poll were* EVEN FUCKING HIGHER *than the +3 presented after weighing the data*.

During the visit, President Biden will announce actions to prevent cuts to the earned pension benefits of 29,000 United Food and Commercial (UFCW) workers and retirees, primarily in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan C which zero Republicans voted for C the Biden-Harris Administration has protected the pensions of over 65,000 Pennsylvanians, 80,000 Michiganders, 78,000 New Yorkers, 73,000 Illinoisans, 63,000 Ohioans, 63,000 Californians, 42,000 Floridians, 38,000 Missourians, 36,000 Texans, and many more to date.The Presidents announcement in Philadelphia comes after the Vice President announced the protection of pension benefits of over 22,500 union workers and retirees under the Detroit Carpenters Pension Fund last month.Last week, President Biden spoke with Pennsylvania residents Roger Custer, a retired Teamster, and his wife, Marsha. Rogers earned pension benefits were cut by hundreds of dollars per month in 2019, but because of the American Rescue Plan, Rogers pension benefits were fully restored and protected for decades to come.Since they took office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have fought hard to protect union workers and ensure a secure retirement for every American.  The ARPs Butch Lewis Act pension protections C called the Special Financial Assistance program C will provide security for roughly 2 million workers and retirees, ensuring their pensions remain solvent and will be able to pay the full benefits that these workers have earned over the next several decades. Additionally, for retirees who previously suffered cuts to their earned benefits due to their pension plans becoming insolvent, or to avoid future pension plan insolvency, the Butch Lewis Act restores their benefit level and makes them whole for previous losses.Todays announcement will save the workers and retirees covered by the UFCW Tristate Pension Fund from an estimated reduction to their earned benefits of 15% on average beginning within four years. Instead, thanks to ARP, the plan will now pay full benefits to workers and retirees into at least the 2050s.The President also will highlight new data from the Department of Labors report showing the historic progress in delivering pension security for union workers and retirees that finds:* More than 120,000 retirees who otherwise would have continued to suffer or would have seen new reductions in their earned pension benefits have instead received an average of roughly $13,600 each in earned benefits so far that were protected or restored thanks to President Bidens and Vice President Harriss American Rescue Plan. The Butch Lewis Act is restoring benefits levels, making retirees whole for previous benefit cuts, and preventing additional cuts that would have resulted from new plan insolvencies suffered through no fault of their own. That includes thousands of Western Pennsylvania Teamster retirees who saw their benefits cut by up to 30% back in 2019.\\n* **Workers and retirees in plans receiving assistance from the Butch Lewis Act had suffered or faced projected average cuts of 41%** to their monthly pension benefits, with many facing cuts to earned benefits as large as 70% or more.\\n* **Union workers and retirees across many industries have had their pension benefits protectedto date, including:**\\n * Nearly 620,000 workers and retirees in Teamster pension plans,\\n * More than 152,000 workers and retirees in UFCW pension plans,\\n * More than 103,000 workers and retirees in Bakers and Confectionery worker pensions plans,\\n * Over 89,000 workers and retirees in United Steelworker pension plans,\\n * Tens of thousands of workers and retirees in Communications Worker of America (55,000), Musicians (49,000), and Carpenters (29,000) pension plans, among many more.The pension protection legislation included in President Bidens and Vice President Harriss American Rescue Plan was named after veteran and retired Teamster Butch Lewis (1951-2015) for his role in fighting to protect union retirees pensions from harsh benefit cuts through no fault of their own. Ultimately, the Butch Lewis Act is expected to ensure roughly 2 million workers and retirees pension plans remain solvent and will be able to pay the full benefits that workers have earned through at least 2051, making its inclusion in the ARP the most significant effort to protect the solvency of the multiemployer pension system in 50 years.Todays announcement builds on historic actions President Biden and Vice President Harris have taken to support union workers. While the prior Administration rolled back overtime protections and appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board, this Administration has expanded overtime protections for millions of workers, appointed worker advocates to the National Labor Relations Board, and also ensured federal dollars are going to create good jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union and that federal construction projects are built using a project labor agreement. The Biden Administration has also expanded worker protections and safety, made it easier to organize and collectively bargain, provided funding to increase registered apprenticeship programs, and is making sure the Administrations historic infrastructure investments are built with American-made construction materials and create good jobs. And, the Administration worked to protect and strengthen Social Security and the retirement plans of hardworking Americans, including by taking action to ensure retirement advisors act in the financial interest of retirement savers. The President also signed SECURE 2.0 into law, which encourages more employers to offer retirement plan benefits to their workers and makes it easier for Americans to save for retirement.Ensuring that union workers and their families enjoy the retirement security they earned through a lifetime of work is just one of the ways that the Biden-Harris Administration has kept its commitment to workers and delivered on being the most pro-union administration in American history.  \\n...","title":"Fact Sheet: President Biden Announces 1.2 Million Pensions Protected Under Biden-?Harris Administration, Celebrates Historic Support for Unions"},{"text":"Whatever happens the country will be more divided and angry than before.

I am asking all voters that feel deeply about this war to examine the other issues in this upcoming election. If you can truly look at both parties'positions on the economy, healthcare, equal rights, the environment, LGBTQ+ support, abortion rights, religious freedoms, and stability and still feel there is no difference on who you vote for, then I truly have nothing left to say to you. However, if you truly care about the future of our country, Middle Eastern relations, and the future we leave for the next generation, then I urge you to not throw your vote away on a protest vote, or abstain, or vote Trump to teach the Dems a \\"lesson\\". More than just the Middle East is on the line tomorrow and I fear that if we don't stop Project 2025 now, we may never get another chance. I say this as a father of two girls, a husband, a veteran, and an Atheist Jew. Please do not let Trump snatch victory from the clutches of defeat. Show the world we are better than that. Show your LGBTQ+ friends their safety matters. Show corporations we want regulations and cleaner air. Show the for profit healthcare system that keeping us sick and bankrupting us when we need help will only lead to a disastrous end for so many that would rather stay sick than incur the bills. Show the teachers and students that we care about the future of this country and that we value intellect and deep thinking over memorization and regurgitation. Good luck tomorrow, everyone. I hope we do the right thing.","title":"This vote-swapping service wants to help Democrats conflicted over the Gaza war cast 'protest votes' while still opposing Trump"},{"text":"Maybe that's how he gets his freak-on.","title":"Biden Closes Election With Urge To Physically 'Smack' GOP Voters"},{"text":"I think I saw something to the effect of an uncapped House would give us about 1,400 electoral votes and California alone would receive a huge margin of that.

She has NO idea WTF he is doing so she simply waves back and goes on her way, then she googles what it means when she gets to work and is like, oh, wow, he was saying \\"f-u\\" to me.She kept this from me for a few months then right before Halloween tells me as we are carving pumpkins on the steps of our place. Normally, at Halloween in our neighborhood we all get together and hang out, pass out candy and chat. Well there is the neighborhood trump humping a-hole sitting there like no big deal and I am f-ing HOT. I know I am gonna lose it if something isn't done and in the interest of being, as we always have to be, \\"the better person\\", I simply tell her, \\"I can't be here\\", she says I know, I get it and we leave. I start yelling how much of an asshole this guy is as we head home and some of our neighbors hear us as we leave and text my gal, \\"hey is everything ok?\\", she proceeds to tell them everything and finally, they realize, yea, \\"those people can't be at functions anymore\\".It's like those bastards get to do garbage with impunity and the minute you call them out, they turn into petulant 5 year olds and then since you know what would happen if you WRECKED one of them you turn the other cheek the best you can.That is DEFINITELY the last time ever, I turn that cheek.So yea, for us, it's easy to believe there are people who support him because there are FAR too many people who are afraid or don't want the hassle of calling out his supporters on their BS.He can't be over soon enough, and he will be one way or another.","title":"Jeannie Gaffigan: Harris isnt perfect.

We often get a lot of feedback that were being too nitpicky on these kinds of claims that dont fall neatly into True or False. But politics, policy, misinformation and the claims we fact-check usually aren't black and white.I think as fact-checkers, its our job to split hairs a little. But we also work hard to make sure that were applying our ratings in a consistent way across a variety of claims.?When PolitiFact editors [decide a rating](https://youtu.be/wGjM3tkGgI8) on a fact-check, [they ask a lot of questions](https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/#Truth-O-Meter%20ratings), like How have we rated similar claims in the past? and Is there another way to read this statement? (To be clear, this isnt just the editors asking this in their heads; theyre asking these questions out loud in a meeting with the reporter.) The goal of these questions is to kind of pull apart the claim, consider it from every angle and ensure our fact-check captures the nuance of it.At the end of the day, our ratings are a judgment call. But its a judgment call made using a tried and true process to help our readers place political rhetoric on a spectrum of truthfulness.

It's the very reason they are voting for him. They care about democracy about as much as he does. As Psychologist Elizabeth Mika put in in a 2018 essay on \\"Tyranny as a Triumph of Narcissism\\":\\"The narcissistic collusion between the tyrant and his supporters is also driven by their need for revenge, for the tyrant is always chosen to perform this psychically restorative function: to avenge the humiliations  narcissistic wounds  of his followers and punish those who inflicted them.The tyrant and his followers typically choose as vessels of their negative projections and aggression members of the society who are not just different but weaker than themselves. The tyrant fuels that aggression in order to solidify his power but also to deflect it from himself, shield his own narcissism, and repair his own narcissistic injuries dating to his childhood days. The figure of the narcissistic parental abuser / tyrant is protected through the scapegoating and the return to authoritarian, order-and-obedience based mode of social functioning promised by the tyrant, as he himself assumes the mantle of father-protector and directs his own and his supporters aggression onto the Others who have nothing to do with their real and perceived wounds.https://medium.com/@Elamika/tyranny-as-a-triumph-of-narcissism-76b6fec76d0d","title":"Trumps Closing Message to Voters Just Got Even More Dark: Donald Trump is revealing how little he cares for democracyand how his second term will be all about retribution."},{"text":"Omg its election eve ","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You too","title":"The media claiming that Harris and Trump are neck, and neck in the polls is a Pay-op to prepare/allow the steal."},{"text":"Theres a reason when I grab breakfast (on my way to law school), the New York Times (along with mostly local newspapers) quickly sell out while the stack for the NYShitPost is full.","title":"Kathy Hochuls anti-American gaslighting  final proof Dems dont dare discuss the real issues"},{"text":"i mean, your vote is effectively meaningless voting 3rd party.

DemocracyNow for its entire lifetime going back to the late 90's has been about being one of the few media outlets that interviews people who don't get a voice on the mainstream media. DemocracyNow has always sought out and found rarely-mentioned but active political groups. 2) It's a little late to be announcing some kind of \\"coalition\\" for 3rd party candiates, don't you think? This should have been done at least a year ago so we can force changes from the Democrats or guarantee that they'll never win another election again. You know, using leverage.3) Cornel West is a proven sellout who was just shilling for the Democrats the past year. He did a lot of great things in the past, but in recent years he's looked a lot like a sellout. He ran a sham campaign this year that was only intended to \\"raise awareness\\" or whatever and then quit towards the end and back the Democrats. Look for the Jimmy Dore interviews on this over the past year. Jimmy Dore totally exposed him early on in the campaign.4) I used to love DemocracyNow, but after Hillary lost to Trump, at some point I think 2017 DemocracyNow surrendered to the Democrats and started pushing the Russiagate hoax. I found this to be extremely uncharacteristic of that otherwise great political analysis and reporting organization, as it was all \\"officials say\\" claims, which Amy Goodman, Juan Gonzalez, and Nermeen Shaikh knew better than to just believe on faith. The U.S. government has a long history of lying to the public and using dirty tricks, and DemocracyNow is one of the few organizations that's been good at reporting on these, and then suddenly in 2017 they just believed on faith the U.S. government claims about Trump colluding with Russia? Aaron Mate left DemocracyNow and has criticized them for this, and he went and did great reporting against Russiagate before it collapsed in 2019 with the failed FBI Mueller Report. While DemocracyNow conducted an epic interview between Gleen Greenwald and David Cay Johnston in which Greenwald mocked and totally exposed Johnston for believing in Russiagate and the whole thing collapsing, I couldn't get over how biased DemocracyNow's previous reporting on the Russiagate conspiracy theory was. I stopped following them after believing for years that they were rare heroes.","title":"Democracy Now surprisingly speaks to Socialist candidate Claudia de la Cruz.

It seems like a majority of statements rated are \\"Mostly False\\" or lower (especially for Trump, who appeared to have only had a single statement rated \\"Mostly True\\" or higher in the last year), but I'm curious if that's because the amount of true statements is far lower this year, versus an editorial choice to prefer to correct false statements.Thank you for your work.

We often see a lot students who do apply for our program being home schooled however, not many get in.The issue with that, is that they don't really get to socialize that much with adults besides their parents. The parents usually socialize them with other kids through other means like signing them up for enrichment classes, however, it's equally important to socialize them with adults. This teaches them to advocate for themselves, and be more independent from their parents. Socializing to adults also helps them be more 'adult-like' to someone who is older/ there being an apparent power dynamic. Remember, college isn't there JUST for the diploma, the most successful people are there for the experience as well and often times, the experience includes reaching out to Professors, advisers, etc. If these students were never taught that since their teachers were their parent's, they won't get the most out of their college experience/struggle to talk to adults.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Josie here: Great questions!

That includes things like false claims about [FEMA aid](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/06/tweets/fema-gives-750-to-help-hurricane-victims-with-supp/) might dissuade survivors from getting help or disinformation that [discourages people from voting](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/03/tweets/this-video-about-ballot-fraud-is-not-from-the-fbi/). It can be difficult since there might not be a ton of information available at the moment; For example, we waited to publish fact-checks about the shooter who attempted to assassinate Trump until his identity was confirmed by authorities. But during breaking news, were more concerned about getting it right than getting it first.?","title":"Were part of the PolitiFact team fact-checking the 2024 Election - Ask Us Anything!"},{"text":"GOOD","title":"Democrats Warn That If Trump Is Elected It Will Be The End Of Bureaucracy As We Know It"},{"text":"Lol, yes please.In all seriousness though, Democrats and Republicans both need to get their heads out of their ass and produce a sustainable budget.

What would happen is that Trump would get 30% of the vote and the other three parties would, for this election, form a coalition to form a government to keep MAGA out of power.  Once MAGA was no longer a threat, maybe Progressives or Conservatives become less likely to form a coalition with Democrats.","title":"I am an Arab American voting for Kamala Harris"},{"text":" accept result and go play golfHe can't; he is facing jail time.","title":"Donald Trump should accept result and go play golf if Kamala Harris wins, says Nigel Farage"},{"text":"I agree with you.

It's a process, not a solution. Currently, we focus on special interests or lobbyists to facilitate these changes or advocate for them. Thanks for the feedback, Avreal. I appreciate the push for clarity. Heres a bit more on the direction Im aiming for:1. **Transparency and Accountability**: Technocracy isnt about imposing decisions from above but creating a system where decisions are openly made and leaders are held accountable for measurable outcomes.\\n2. **Safeguards and Efficiency**: By incorporating technology, we can identify gaps, streamline processes, and establish safeguards against bias and errors, ensuring that decisions are rooted in data and evidence.\\n3. **Collaborative Solutions, Not End Goals**: Rather than dictating an \\"end state,\\" the technocratic process focuses on testing, adapting, and improving solutions over time, allowing us to find what genuinely works. Its not about an ideological end but practical methods that can evolve.I hope this gives more substance to my goals. Each is meant to be more **future-focused** than *present-focused*. These systems evolve and become stronger over time versus immediate policy changes for the short term.
