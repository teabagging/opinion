Its rule is not so absolute.  There are suppose to be checks on its power.A plutocracy is an oligarchy that it determined by wealth.  Again, one can join the group if you obtain enough wealth.  An Oligarchy need not be a plutocracy.It may depend on whether or not you want to maintain your claim that \\"You are NOT allowed to join\\".There are so many articles defining these terms and they are so contradictory to one another (or the explained differences are so subtile), it almost doesn't matter.I use Oligarchy to define the capitalist elites who run our nation.  Not everyone is rich enough to be a plutocrat.  And it leaves room for other subsets like Finkelstein's \\"Jewish Supremacists\\".   Now, how do we define \\"the blob\\" or the \\"Deep State\\"?

The problem is that the solutions Democrats provided are not good enough! If Democrats had come out with strong protections for workers in this economy, if they had campaigned on issues that matter, then the choice between Donald and Kamala would have ended up differently. And time and time again Americans told the party what matters to them.... Prices are too high, wages are too low, health care and child care are too expensive, housing costs are too expensive, education is too expensive, and our families are hurting. Actions matter, and when you are given power Americans want to see that you are using it to help them. Period. Instead voters were mostly told that inflation is down... Don't worry! The economy is great... Don't worry! Your wages are up .. don't worry. That doesn't work when Americans feel the pain of inflation and the high cost of living literally every single day. It signals, and rightfully so, that the Democrats are out of touch and don't understand what workers are enduring. On top of all of that you push a democratic candidate down everyone's throats...  One that has been rejected twice already... Once in the previous primary, and again with such a low approval rating in this administration. This further signals that Democrats are out of touch with the people. Democrats offered policies that were too little too late by a candidate that was not liked and not wanted. That is a recipe to lose an election, and a repeat of 2016. You would think they would learn a lesson. Here is the winning formula: pick a candidate that is articulate, intelligent, and will stand up for working Americans. Pick a candidate that can show they understand these problems. Pick a candidate that doesn't bow down to corporate money. Then adopt a platform that helps workers...  Healthcare, housing, lower prices, low inflation, reign in education costs, child care, paid leave, taxing the wealthy, increased wages, strengthening social security, etc. When you are elected, do the things you said you're going to do! Don't cave to your rich donors... Help real working Americans to have better lives. Not a little better... Not 20% better...

This is arguing that swing voters were difficult to persuade that the *bad* things about the Trump time were his responsibility or fault. They just mainly remembered the economy was good. And thats why they swung Trump in the end. But lets make it less shallow and go a step further: if they remember the good economy as being due to Trump, then whys that? There was a terrible crash at the end of GW Bushs presidency. During Obamas 8 years, we came out of the deepest recession since the Great Depression and rebuilt to a booming economy (albeit with an income gap continuing to widen). Trump took office and, despite him dumping tons more money into the economy during a boom (not a good idea as he increased the deficit and overheated the economy contributing to the inflation that was to come), did not improve the trajectory of any economic indicator from what he inherited from Obama. Much of political media reported at that time the good economic news without the historical context, as they usually do. How many people realized that the unemployment rate was on-trajectory from Obamas term? I blame the political media for a *lot* of the wide-spread idea that the economy at any moment is due to the sitting presidents policies. The president has a limited impact on the economy, but most of what they can do still takes time to ripple through the economy and become noticeable. But beyond that, how one perceived the creation of the good economy during Trumps term was still to a degree a matter of what media one consumed. People who remember it as the greatest economy of all time were already pretty deep in Trump media. There were a lot of showing cracks in that economy, and they were discussed elsewhere. Then, of course, inflation: all the prompts for the growth in inflation were teed-off during Trumps term. These include over-heating the economy by dumping cash through tax cuts (of course the ones for the middle class set with expiration dates but those for corporations permanent), tariffs, and COVID (obviously not Trumps fault, but certainly not Bidens and Trump mismanaged it). Trad political media does a terrible job of reporting economic context. Right wing media of course just openly dissembles (blames Biden for inflation because he pushed money into the economy during a *recovery* which is what youre meant to do; ignores the impact of supply chain disruptions; ignores that Trump pushed money into the economy during a *boom* (that was in full swing at the end of Obamas term) which is just irresponsible. This cycle - Republican inherits a good economy, passes on a bad economy to Democrat. Democrat blamed for bad economy, passes on good economy to Republican. Republican credited for good economy, passes on a bad economy to Democrat, repeat - has been going on since G**H**W Bush. And it persists. Bidens recovery will be credited to Trump, no doubt. How actively will the media report that the decreased inflation and the construction jobs, which lead to further growth, were from *Biden* when the effects are felt in the next few years? And will the *next* President be blamed for the effects of Trumps tariffs if he follows up on that?And in anticipation, how much has the media explained what the effects of blanket tariffs are?The political media has a significant role in peoples false perceptions here. The right wing media cannot be controlled by trad/center or left media. Theyll just lie about it. But the rest could do a fuckload better in economics reporting.","title":"Why Did Trump Win?

Youve taken both positions at the same time and secured both group of votes.Youre asking democrats to essentially lie as well in order to have a chance at countering the volley of misinformation he spewed. Taking abortion messaging as one example:If Trump says, *Democrats are killing babies at all stages.*How effective is long winded messaging breaking down the medical circumstances for each statistic miscarriages and other health complications which is the truth.\\nVS.\\n*Trumps lying yall!* for a yard sign \\nWhich is technically a lie since they do not distinguish between the circumstances even if the mother wanted the child, only that the pregnancy was aborted and groups like Fox will just pull up the stats without context.Its far better messaging to simply assign blame to someone else, Biden, Immigrants, antifa, woke etc. Theres improvements to be made for sure but Americans seem to want simple answers they can understand to incredible complex problems and generally the bases of each party hold them to different standards.

Much more vulnerable at the federal level considering the multiple interests that would oppose the top down one size fits all method of legislating such an issue. \\nDemocrats just assume the federal government should run everything and frankly liberals tend to be less well informed about their own beliefs.

The outright greed is where the problem lies, and that is directly linked to a breakdown of a traditional moral center. The purpose of business has gone from providing goods and services, and centralizing the market distribution of those goods and services (i.e. consolidating independent sources under an umbrella to facilitate a broader reach and conformity to quality standards), to get rich or die trying. Price controls restrict a free market economy.Kamala had billions in campaign contributions. Where did the money go? I have not heard one word about her campaign spending. Youd think with all that money shed have funded some outrageously slick campaign ads, especially with Hollywood backing. Lets not overlook her ineptitude in interviews and the extremely shady debate antics. Lets also not overlook the fact she has effectively been President for several months while Biden has been unfit for duty. All the stuff she said she would do when she became President could have been done this whole time.Her lack of initiative dealing with the border crisis is also a glaring problem. Everyone is too worried about Roe v Wade, when the SC ruling meant it was a States Rights issue, not a Federal issue. The Federal Government cannot override States authority in many issues. This is why some States can willfully ignore the 2nd Amendment rights of citizens and not be burned to the ground for treason. If you want at-will abortion legalized in your State, replace your State government with one that will legalize it. Everyone is worried about Trumps legal battles and bad manners but say nothing about Congress doing the exact same things. Remember when Congress started raiding the Social Security system to pay for their pork barrel spending? Why is everyone so worried about Trump when none of that has been repaid? 90+ billion USD sent to Ukraine but Americans have to tighten their belts? The government of the United States serves the citizens of the United States, not the world. Yes, it sucks the Ukraine was invaded by Russia. Its a UN problem, not a USA problem. The conflict in the Middle East is the longest running sibling rivalry in history; both Muslim and Jew agree they are both descended from Abraham. Palestine is not Americas problem. They will sort it out on their own. Everyone is worried Trump will pull America back out of the Paris accords and start drilling again to meet our own energy needs, and to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We are not obligated to be a pal and take a bullet for other countries. The United States government is obligated to American citizens above all others. Trumps presumed victory (still watching for the 40 million ballots to be dropped at 3 am with Kamalas name on them) was not due to some poorly managed campaign, or ballot stuffing, or tampering, but because the silent majority voted for America First.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"When the line is included among instructions like take frequent breaks and  no one goes anywhere alone its pretty obvious Trump supporters, who had been riling each other up about FEMAs response In NC, quite literally making theirs jobs harder by stacking supplies on safe helicopter landing spots, are the biggest danger to these workers.","title":"Well well well.

In cases like that, I can see the government having the freedom to find the lowest cost provider and change who gets access to government land and resources. As a note, no, the electric company can't triple its prices overnight, at least not where I live. Any changes in tariffs must be approved by the city council. They are also subject to regulation by the state.For things like food and shelter without capitalism, who pays for these things? Who grows the food? Who builds the shelters? If it's through taxation, what prevents people from abusing the system and becoming freeloaders, or even having as many children as possible, knowing the government will take care of them.There are options such as euthenasia (assisted suicide) and birth control for people who can't obtain or will not obtain (if born) essential resources.

But people were fatigued. The biggest *ever* stock market collapse in 1987 (to this day still the worst) eventually turned into the long 1990 recession, and by 1992 the \\"jobless recovery\\" seemed like it would go on forever. Change was needed.When 'third way' Bill Clinton ran in 1992, Jerry Brown was by far the better candidate. But Brown lost the primary and Bill got the nomination. Bill Clinton won the election easily (despite the lie that Ross Perot was a spoiler--a myth still out there today).Democrats finally broke a generation-long failure to win the White House with the exception of squeaker Jimmy Carter. It is no wonder they moved 'to the right.' The 1993 term was disappointing, and people stayed home. So something terrible happened: Republicans took the Congress after two generations out.The 1990's was a period of unusually low voter turnout. People who bothered to vote seemed to prefer conservatives. Republicans held the House for a whopping twelve years straight.In 2000, Democrats finally managed to take enough Senate seats back to bring it to 50-50 and George W. Bush took the election when five Republicans ended to vote count and installed him. Despite the awful result of that election, there was reason to be optimistic--Democrats were coming back. It felt like the last gasp for Republicans. Then GWB failed to stop 9-11 rising to 90% popularity, and Republicans continued to hold Congress even though years of war mongering and WMD lies.By 2006 and after tens of millions of people were screwed by the response to Hurricane Katrina, fatigue finally set in. In 2007, Democrats took Congress back and stopped the GWB PNAC agenda.In 2008, a Democrat was a shoe-in. Barack Obama got in on a wave of almost cult-like excitement that was bound to cause disappointment. Major election reform was needed, but nobody was even talking about it.In 2010, enthusiasm was way down on the Democratic side as I predicted would happen then,but turnout did not drop. Instead, the Tea Party excited Republicans and their turnout as Democratic turnout dropped. On this I think we can agree: The 2010 election was seen as a major swing voter election. Although we can't tell to what extent, I say it was more of a swing of voting Democrats to apathy and nonvoting Republicans inspired to vote. The signs were starting to show: The more extreme Republicans became, the more people showed up to vote.So next come six years of pretty much nothing which was an improvement over what happened in the last six years of Bill Clinton when so many bad laws were passed, but certainly dissatisfying. Turnout in 2012 was down.Well, that's a lot of writing so let me jump to 2018. In 2018, Democrats won a huge landslide and the Progressive Caucus was growing. This moment could have been the end for the reactionary Ronald Reagan era but the 2020 election was a bit of a disappointment and there was some drift back to moderate--although not much. The 2021 term was very progressive despite the 50-50 Senate. We should have kept it up and turned out in larger numbers in 2022 to finally hammer shut the Reagan era coffin. We would have gotten voting rights, DC statehood, more of Build Back Better, etc., and that might have inspired 2020 voters to come back in 2024.After what happened in 2024, there is much to do on both perceptions and policy, but more so on perceptions as you said. As media becomes more reactionary, it gets harder and harder to work on perceptions.In the end, we should avoid \\"the Dems will learn absolutely nothing from this,\\" support policies offered or received, and demand more change at all times--sort of like Bernie Sanders usually does (not always though as his complaint about abandoning the working class the other day was ridiculous).And remember, Democrats provided huge change not when elections were going back and forth or when they had small numbers but rather when Democrats had huge popularity and large majorities.","title":"Pelosi blames Harris' loss on Biden's late exit and no open Democratic primary"},{"text":" I really dont know how his team just expected everyone to be ok with his condition or not realize anything was wrong.Go back and watch Biden's VP debate performance in 2012 or 2008.

They just slap a rainbow flag on everthing and get rid of SAT scores, and disciminate against Asians? A huge part of Republicans don't care about gay marriage or what you do in the bedroom anymore, so neolibs just go farther in the social direction to the point of derangement. But liberals care about meritocracy. And, dude, you're not going to get the Latino vote by calling them latinx. Just lol.Look at this poll:https://www.reddit.com/r/centrist/s/pF9dJrn1EnThe top issue for Swing States was dems caring more about trans than the middle class. Even above inflation and immigration. This shouldn't be hard for progressives to understand, but liberals will throw the baby out with the bathwater, and just do the inverse mistake and try to go farther to the establishment right. There's a reason why they called Bernie a sexist and racist - a phony attack. They'll probably try to run Liz Cheney next time. lol. They can't grapple with how complex Trump was with navigating some horse shoe campaign. The educated class and liberal elite are so far in their bubble they don't understand ordinary people.

Lets say to make the primary debate stage, there are three paths: a) be a billionaire (Bloomberg), b) articulate an economic message on corporate power that resonates with the average citizen, or c) prove youre an effective fundraiser.The right candidate in bucket A could probably pull it off. Thats what Trump did on the Republican side. Bloomberg was not that candidate. You would need a once in a generational class traitor Look how all the major players in the Democratic Party unite to make sure they snuff out any candidates in bucket to B (Warren, Sanders). Practically speaking, these candidates are bad for fundraising. Our election models require billions of dollars to run a campaign. You cant raise that money top to bottom with someone taking on corporate power. The legitimate fear is that they will destroy the party, because they will be outspent from the presidency all the way down to the local school board.So youre left with bucket C. Candidates that have proven willing to play the game, which is to raise a bunch of money while not pissing off the donors. If you make it to the top of the Democratic ticket, you have traded in every value you may have ever had when you started. You wouldve never made it out of the town counselor elections otherwise. Unfortunately youre also left with only Band-Aids as real policy options.Its a bit of a catch 22. Any attempt to touch campaign financing will be considered threatening to corporations. They love buying influence. Also, those billions raised are also billions spent on advisors, staff, commercial , events, etc. There is an entire mini-economy built around this that would collapse if we changed the rules. So a traditional Democrat could never touch it.Unfortunately, I guess that leaves us waiting for the billionaire saviors. Thats the only way we can deliver a message that will resonate with a large swath of the population.Still waiting.Edit: While I agree with your position, I dont see a path to where Democrats could ever deliver an economic message that resonates. So I disagree that messaging is the root cause of the failure. Its not that they didnt deliver the message, its that they cant deliver the message.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"This is how government works.I guarantee that if their campaign had $2 billion, they would have ended up $40 million in debt.","title":"Kamala Harris Blew $20 Million on Election-Eve Concerts with Lady Gaga, Katy Perry in Swing States Where Trump Beat Her"},{"text":"Hopefully this gets more listens than Talk Tuah","title":"The Interview: Nancy Pelosi Insists the Election Was Not a Rebuke of the Democrats"},{"text":"So the hate for FEMA came about because FEMA was delayed in response to hurricane HeleneAre you sure Alex Jones hasn't been calling FEMA a conspiracy for 25 years?","title":"Well well well.

I would love to see him put together a team to take a deep dive through the covid situation, the 2020 election, the riots, his assassination attempt(s).i believe the democrats were behind all of it and I want to start seeing being held accountable for it. The gaslighting and manipulation from the left is criminal in itself.","title":"To those who voted for Trump."},{"text":"Her and her little left over cabal needs to shut the fuck up and exit the role they created for themselves.","title":"Ex-Hillary Clinton Adviser: Democrats Must Stand Up to 'Extremes' in Party"},{"text":"Do you lecture people about their decorations when you introduce yourself?","title":"A Red-District Conqueror Wants Fellow Democrats to Look in the Mirror"},{"text":"84 year old multi millionaire wags finger at octogenarian POTUS, plans to stick around six more years herself - more at 11.","title":"Pelosi blames Harris' loss on Biden's late exit and no open Democratic primary"},{"text":"Then join a militia of freedom fighters.

However, to assert that it was the primary or only cause is somewhat short-sighted. That is also an extremely vague reason.You're fixated on a single issue while ignoring the bigger picture. It's akin to conducting an autopsy and finding a body riddled with evidence of violence: stab wounds, bullet holes, electrocution marks, signs of hanging, blunt force trauma from a baseball bat, a deep axe gash in the forehead, and countless other injuries. Yet, despite all this, you choose to focus on a trace of water in the lungs and label it a drowning.What other contributing factors are there? I am going to surely miss several, but I'll name a few:1: Just a few short months ago women were saying \\"I'd rather encounter a random bear in the woods than a random man.\\" this went viral. It was all over the internet, and it was a major surprise to a lot of young men. Do you think men forgot about that on voting day?2: Attempting to brand the opposition with the label of weird backfired majorly, and it was a losing strategy in the meme war. The right easily countered this one by taking various pictures of progressives that were conventionally unattractive, or obese, or non-passing transgender or unnatural hair color then they put a little speech bubble on there saying \\"You're weird\\".3: There was significant mistrust surrounding the election process. Polls indicate that around 50% of Republicans and roughly 20% of Democrats harbor serious doubts about how voting is conducted and counted. The Democratic stance against voter ID laws and the push for expanded mail-in voting, despite legitimate concerns about election integrity, can make them appear, at best, dismissive of these issues and, at worst, less than fully transparent.4: The past four years have seen record levels of illegal immigration, resulting in significant challenges for communities receiving these individuals. The influx strains local resources, including groceries, housing, and job markets, creating social tensions. By not addressing this issue adequately, it becomes a pressing concern for voters that Democrats often seem to overlook in favor of political correctness. Those who voice these legitimate concerns are frequently dismissed or labeled as racist, which only deepens the divide.5: Grocery prices have surged significantly, yet Democrats continue to assert that \\"The economy is great!\\" Just last week, I spent $120 on groceries and now find myself wondering, \\"What am I even going to cook for dinner today? Do I have anything left?\\" On top of that, I hear Kennedys warnings about the food being contaminated and cant help but notice that many of our food products still contain ingredients banned in Europe. This leaves me feeling that our food supply is not only overpriced but also potentially unsafe.6: Over the past five years, Ive felt gaslighted by mainstream media regarding Joe Bidens mental health. His cognitive decline has been apparent, yet there was a reluctance to address it. Waiting until he was decisively outperformed by Trump in a debate to finally act only reinforced the perception of weakness within the Democratic Party. Additionally, many people feel that Democrats and the media are trying to deceive the public. Right-leaning individuals had recognized these signs of decline long before, with alarm bells sounding years prior to Democrats acknowledging it after the Trump debate.I could discuss this for hours, but I think these six points provide a clear picture of my perspective. Its truly a case of death by a thousand cuts, and yet theres an attempt to isolate a single cause as the fatal blow. If you need more examples or elaboration, just let me know.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Nobody should listen to anything Hillary Clinton or anyone associated with her.

LoL","title":"This is why the Democrats lost"},{"text":"I would argue that Trump's victory was primarily a gift given to him by the Biden Administration. Biden wanted to remain as President, so he decided to run for a second term even though his popularity rating really suggested it would be an uphill battle. The only thing to suggest he had a shot at victory was Trump's low approval rating during his term, and his victory in 2020. But the polls showed Biden as behind Trump pretty consistently, so eventually, Democrats that care about winning elections started to pressure him to bow out of the election. After a disastrous debate performance, he did just that.The issue is that by the time Biden dropped out, it didn't leave a lot of time for a proper primary process, and instead, he helped to anoint Kamala Harris as the nominee, despite the fact that she had a lower approval rating than he did, and that she was the least popular candidate in 2020. Others attempted to run against her, but with the momentum she got from Bidens endorsement, it was too late. Kamala became the nominee.The Biden administration, through Jack Smith, also brought charges against Trump, but not until after Trump announced he was running for President. By the time they announced these charges, it was already too late to get them through the courts before the election, regardless of if the Supreme Court had to weigh in. This had multiple effects:1. The Biden administration now has criminally pursued their chief political rival. Whether or not you believe the charges were justified, it gives an impression to many voters that the charges are political in nature, which makes them uncomfortable.\\n2. Trump and his team now knows this election is do or die. If he loses the election, he could face prison time. That ups the stakes of how much they're willing to do to win, which as we saw in 2020, was pretty much anything already. It also motivates his base as a get out the vote function, since their chief candidate could face prison time for his political views, in their perspective.Finally, and to a much lesser extent than the previous two things that Biden did to help give Trump the victory, his messaging at the end of the election about Trump supporters and garbage didn't help. I'm not really going to go into this one, as there is some debate over what was said, and while I would give Biden the benefit of a doubt on what was said, for some voters, they understood that he was calling them trash, which again, serves as a get out the vote influence.My point here is that there is really nothing that Harris could have done from a messaging perspective that she didn't do already. They had Discord servers organizing Reddit brigades, celebrity endorsements, they completely blew Trump out of the water with fundraising for ads. They had their messaging aspect handled. The issue is that Harris was always a wildly unpopular candidate and should never have been the Democratic nominee, as evidenced by the Democratic primary of 2020 and her popularity as vice president. Trump's win is because Bidens actions ensured that the least popular candidate was given the nomination, which gave Trump the best chance at winning.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":" Arab AmericanWe need to stop using all of the hyphenated names and just be Americans.

The bottom line. People are stupid and so easily manipulated that all of these complex theories of secret groups controlling us are just exercises in justifying that as a large group we're stupid as fuck. The \\"mainstream media\\" spent the first 5 or 6 years of Trump coverage highlighting his lies and idiocy. On a daily basis. What they didn't understand somehow was the old adage that there's no such thing as bad publicity. And, what they discovered in Trump coverage is that it actually rescued the failing news business. CNN, even MSNBC actually has more viewers. They have somewhat tried to use the Fox model of keep people outraged and they'll tune in. This time they didn't cover every stupid thing Trump said because people got numb to it and the right used that coverage as proof the mainstream media is out to get him, it's part of the deep state or whatever dumb ass thing they put out. Then Trump stands up, \\"tarrifs, immigrants eatting dogs and cats, I'll protect the women, and Biden/Harris worst ever\\" and a bunch of people who don't have time to worry about politics or what it actually means all in indon say \\" hold my beer while I go vote for this guy who speaks the real truth\\".

Mostly though as a group we're idiots and just like hearing that someone is gonna fix everything.If Kamala had put forward her plan to bring illegal immigration down to maybe a pre 2000 level, and mandated E-Verify for all businesses all without destroying communities and putting them into death camps, maybe that turns the tide.

Votes are still being counted so we dont know the final popular vote margin. It will probably be more like Trump wins by one or two percentage points. One theory is that more people voted in 2020 because of states making voting easier and now those options are removed in some states. Also people were stuck at home more so paying more attention to politics. It is really important that we take the time to analyze data and do focus groups before reaching a conclusion about why Democrats lost the presidential election. Preliminary data shows that people believed misinformation and that made them more likely to vote for Trump. Another factor is that Democrats were fighting for a month and Harris did not break with Biden during that time. I see why she didnt but by the time he stepped aside there really wasnt time for other candidates to be chosen. Probably the best option would have been for Biden to step down from running last Fall so a full primary could happen.","title":"Some Democrats blame partys position on transgender rights in part for Harris loss"},{"text":"She spent $100,000 on the Call me Daddy interview It didn't even pull 1 million viewsThen she declined to go on the biggest podcast in history, which her opponent did and pulled 40 million views","title":"Kamala Harris Blew $20 Million on Election-Eve Concerts with Lady Gaga, Katy Perry in Swing States Where Trump Beat Her"},{"text":"??","title":"Where did the millions of votes for Joe Biden go?"},{"text":"As a white male, I recommend you grow some empathy and stop whining.Also the fuck they did.

Once the hearings on government abuse begin or when certain states start obstructive legislative or legal actions, then I believe appropriate declassifications and prosecutions will be in order. For example, the censure of Adam Schiff only emboldened CA to give him a promotion. If he so much as looks sideways the American people deserve a full airing of his abuse before giving credence to anything he may start. Those revelations are going to go a long way towards vindicating the mandate given to the Republicans.

I don't want anyone to be made unhappy for what they truly are or truly want.   But the trans agenda has overtaken our schools and the medical establishment and they are creating a generation of kids that will suffer terribly for the rest of their lives.

If my meager little contributions bettered society by .01% then I was fine with that.I've volunteered in coat drives. Food banks. Financial literacy. I've donated my share to other states during times of emergency. With how everyone vote, things will be much harder and resources limited. The uphill battle has weights added on top now. The right voting to hurt. The 18% of the dem voters choosing not to vote. The country asked for 15 minutes out of your day, once every 4 years and they couldnt even be bothered. They protest vote for something thousands of miles away, meanwhile our own people need help right here and they couldn't even bother going to a voting booth in their own backyard. Women are dying to lack of access to reproductive care. People will probably lose healthcare with all 3 branches going to the GOP. Families being separated. And of course tariffs. Trump threatens massive tariff across the board and morons think the countries are paying for it. People never paid attention in middle school. But we're paying for it.I always tell people, if you want to know where companies stand or what they are planning, look at their actions.\\nCompanies are now hoarding materials to embrace for the incoming clusterfuck. It tells you what to expect.To be honest, I'm done from exhaustion. I also have to think about my family. I can't afford to continue donating my time and resources to society if it means putting my family at risk. I have to now start saving up. Luckily I'm already in a good situation. Good job  good pay, healthare and insurance. And a retirement plan. I donated to society because I always felt that I should return some of the good life I was blessed with. My apologies to charities that I have to abandon. If the tariffs prove to be a lie, then it's great. I'll return. But I can't tell if Trump was spewing lies for the campaign. I have to act as if he's telling the truth on this. I have to brace myself, for my family. A bit of financial advice if you made it this far, prepare yourselves as well. Do not buy any holiday gifts this season. Save up that money. It sucks to not celebrate normally for the season. You don't know what to expect and might need the financial assets.

Most of the time, schools and teachers are simply trying to create a space where kids feel safe being themselves, asking questions, and being accepted. Things like using a different name or pronouns are reversible and are more like trying out new interests.Medical treatments are not available for kids, and in cases where they are pushed is a extremely long process needing both medical and psychological validation which both are long process by themselves which can take years. Many times its started a bit early so that when the person turns 18 or of age they can safely start the process.For many people, knowing that a school is a supportive place where they can talk about who they are without fear can make a huge difference. Studies show that supportive environments lower the rates of anxiety, depression, and even suicide among these children when at home they would be facing punishment, conversion therapies or physical beatings.","title":"Polling suggests that Kamala's support for radical transgender policies was the single most-important issue for swing voters who picked Donald Trump, narrowly beating out even the economy and the border"},{"text":"Is this ~~you're~~ edit: your fucking cubby house password test or something?

They're on the Same Team and We Need to be PreparedUnfortunately, i think the Capitalist Oligarchs have seriously f%#ed up and the hammer is coming down.?The insane amount of Quantitative Easing (money printing) that the Feds permitted between 2008-2024 has taken our situation over the tipping point. We have no way at this point in time to pay our bills without QE - we have no industry, no manufacturing, no supply lines, no trained laborers. All we have are weapons, consumers of cheap crap, and pyramid scheme market bubbles. We live way beyond our means, and now we're barely able to pay the interest payments on our debt, let alone pay down one cent of our principal.?Both Trump and Biden know all about it. Since 2008, QE is how we have kept our economy above water - during both of their presidencies. We are in a really, really bad situation as the market has literally crashed three times so far, but we've learned how to smooth it over with printed money bandaids - but every time we print money we drive down the value of our dollar. It's practically like they left the hose on at full pressure for the last 15 years. No wonder the market has been so strangely robust!Our pyramid scheme economy with its artificially inflated stocks and bonds clearly needed a massive overhaul in order to be fixed after the near total collapse in 08 revealed, but nobody wanted to spend the money on fixing it - not even the billionaires. This would require rewinding Reagan's market deregulation grift, agreeing to give all the money they had stolen back to the government so they could resume the New Deal. Nope, instead they wanted to funnel the money into their coffers and invest it in risky get-rich-quick schemes like the colonization of Mars and AIG.?I can see how both parties play into the political theater and are clearly on the same page - meaning they have the same Kingpins. The Dems take the hit for opening the borders, and yet, this gives MAGA the justification to conduct round ups. Reagan deregulated the markets, but then Clinton signs NAFTA into law. Both the Neocons and Neolibs went along with it all -? breaking down the unions, taking the jobs over seas, and robbing the middle class of 40 trillion dollars. Now you can find that money in the asset management packages of Blackstone and Blackrock. Wait a minute, what is the difference between a blackrock and a blackstone? oh yeah, NOTHING - except one funds the Right and one funds the Left.The Fed has been printing and feeding our economy since 2008 and all our markets -stocks, our housing, tech/AI, and crypto - are inflated. And where's the money?? Oh, got it, it's in the 'shadow bank' account. Phew...?the USA is the land of fantasy market mirages and bubbles. And Elon has quite a knack for blowing bubbles full of hot air. When Musk says that it's going to hurt, but then we'll see prosperity I don't think too many of us are going to make the prosperity cut.? ?Im actually very concerned that our whole economic savior was supposed to be the money we made on AIG and other high tech innovations - but Im getting the sense that those are still a long way off, if they ever do realize the kinds of financial windfalls and improvements that Elon has been claiming they will. Its feeling a lot like the deflation of Teslas stocks and Space Xs company town betrayal and abuse of Brownsville, Texas. Elons a ketamine addict and I think he might have taken at least 200 million of his fans down the K-hole with him.?and, watching Biden tell us everything is going to be okay today really pissed me off. and Trump saying he'll fix everything with one phone call is also so annoying.The Age of Easy Money: [https://youtu.be/EpMLAQbSYAw?si=tYJ7FNEtEvkpiru1](https://youtu.be/EpMLAQbSYAw?si=tYJ7FNEtEvkpiru1)","title":"How the Deep State Likely Knew Kamala Harris Would Lose to Trump"},{"text":"The votes that went poof need a thorough investigation.

Many never recovered while Pelosi's net worth more than doubled to more than $100 million. She's not the only politician who feasted on these gains like pigs at the market trough, but as a leading Dem she serves as a good example of just how much and how quickly  the investor class recovered while workers wages stagnated and millions lost their homes.Also, of course the Dems are marginally better than the GOP on labor and issues facing lower income people. But it's not nearly enough, which is why people are voting to burn the house down.

I consider that outrage at best a useful distraction from class consciousness, after all I believe Government itself has relatively little actual tangible effect on these cultural issues at the end of the day, while they are much more accurately shaped by impressions through media that folk are exposed to.

Macro issues that could negatively affect their lives down the road are completely irrelevant to the here and now.

My argument is that the conceptualization of progressivism is not being well explained by the force that explains politics and interprets policy for the majority of the electorate: main stream media. I find this sticky because, when you peel back the curtain, it appears that there are the same leadership and ownership behind these medias  and when you look closer you can see the unified messaging behind them, or at least a lack of coverage and fair practices on things that might be critical to their corporate interests. If together they all fail to cover and explain very important solutions, changes or proposed policy, I would ask what is the common variable? Why are liberal ideas like tax rates saving the middle class thousands hard to explain, but equally abstract topics like the dissolution of masculinity and the benefit of banning problematics books get ample coverage and wide scale reactionary coverage on conservative outlets. Certain topics enter the news cycle, and I would argue other topics are prevented from entering the cycle, or at the very least nefariously omitted. How can progressive policy be properly implemented if there is no will power and no one talking about the support and wide scale public approval of it? It cant.","title":"CMV: in the US many progressive ideas and challenge to the status quo, foreign policy, or wealth inequality, is and will continue to be stifled and silenced by Americas main stream news and the obscene ubiquity of corporate interests behind it."},{"text":"Meanwhile, we're still waiting for answers on inflation, healthcare, and jobs.

[This site](https://commonreader.wustl.edu/how-a-company-called-blackrock-shapes-your-news-your-life-our-future/) speaks on it in clearer terms, and is an analysis of the Harvard findings. As far as examples go, the big three: Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC are all prime examples. Id add Sinclair Broadcasting Group, which owns most local news stations, as well as Gannet, which has bought out many local papers, but really all the listed outlets that fall under BlackRocks holdings. Id also mention the recent debacle with The Washington Post when Bezos stepped in to silence the papers Kamala endorsement serves as a prime example of the flavor of this censorship, though this went awry (due to the journalistic integrity of the paper). That caused quite a stir due to the size and reputation of the paper, the reaction of the journalists, and that it was over something pretty reasonable and inoffensive, but I find it hard to believe that same editorializing by the higher ups does not occurs quite often, with much less coverage and outrage, for issues that are not on the forefront of coverage. It is certainly true that there is a line between c-suite and journalists, but without any transparency, how are we to trust that journalists are free to act against the interests of their superiors? If there was an actual enforceable code of ethics in place at these stations or channels, Id be happy to change my mind  but I cant imagine that these news stations are utterly free to act against the interests of of their shareholders without some degree of supervision. I cannot prove that editors are dissuading stories that champion real progressive restructuring  but even this story of the increasing corporate ownership of media has very little coverage outside of academia and independent outlets, and I find that too suspicious. I agree that these progressive topics could be considered boring, compared to more aggressive and sensational stories like border caravans and clashing identities, but we have a 24 hour news cycle, everyday, and I truly believe that as the informer of the public, and often the entity translating and interpreting politics to the people, there is plenty of space to cover these very real solutions and very important topics. I suppose its not that whole problems (that are difficult, abstract or technical) are not being covered because theyre difficult or taboo, but rather that progressive solutions are not being proposed compared to conservative and centrist one, or at those proposing them are not being earnestly given air time. It is the media after all that shapes public opinion, creates outrage, and has the power to raise politicians to popularity through their coverage. Regarding long form articles, that is certainly true  but unfortunately is not how most folks get their news. While I agree broadcast can not cover things as deeply as Id like, and is best used as a supplement to long form and more well developed content in a healthy media diet, these outlets are the widest received public informers and most public facing analysis of politics we have. I guess I have trouble accepting your assertion that slanted news is a good thing when that slant is evidently in corporate interests, or to the benefit of a select few. I would ask, as an example,[is the medias slant](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/cnn-msnbc-gaza-media-bias-study/tnamp/) on supporting Israel to the benefit of the country, [when evidently 55% of the electorate disapproves](https://news.gallup.com/poll/642695/majority-disapprove-israeli-action-gaza.aspx) of the countries actions, and only 36% approve? Does that give Americans a more well rounded perspective? To me it reeks of manufactured consent, and a way to crystallize the status quo in place.","title":"CMV: in the US many progressive ideas and challenge to the status quo, foreign policy, or wealth inequality, is and will continue to be stifled and silenced by Americas main stream news and the obscene ubiquity of corporate interests behind it."},{"text":"Another question is whether or not trans-identifying individuals are actually marginalized, and the real issue is, as has always been the case, the marginalization of same-sex attracted persons.It's not hatred or bigotry to probe what is actually going on with the trans movement, there are a lot of moving parts, and apparently it doesn't work to give unconditional support to a movement you don't really understand the dynamics of.","title":"Some Democrats blame partys position on transgender rights in part for Harris loss"},{"text":"Pardon your son, dude.Don't wait, do it now.","title":"Biden vows to make every day count before leaving White House to Trump"},{"text":"Could you share a source?

Reddit held a mock election a few days before the actual election.  On Reddit, the Green party garnered over 95% of the vote.  Redditors, living in a information bubble, celebrated thinking it was a lock that the Green's would score a massive victory in the real world.  In the actual election, Greens garnered less less than 5% of the vote.  Judging by this information, we can assume that the majority Reddit opinion is representative of less than 5% of the population, and that being the extreme far left.in 2016, Bernie Sanders won about 40% of the vote in the Democratic primary.  In 2020, he and Elizabeth Warren won about 30% of the vote in Democratic primaries.  We also know that mathematically about 33% of Americans, in any given election cycle, vote in Democratic primaries.  Bernie Sanders was, far and away, the most popular candidate on Reddit.  Simple math, once again, tells us that people that supported far left policies favored by Sanders represent, at best, about 13% of the population in the US.The problem for Democrats stems from Bernie Sanders and his 13%.  Sanders showed that there was a cohort on the left that could be courted for votes.  In the late 2010s, Democrats adopted boutique ideas such as the Green New Deal, Medicare For All, and things like banning fracking.  The problems with these ideas is that they cost umpteen trillion dollars, will not improve the life of the average American, and a population, outside of Bernie's 13%, that is highly skeptical of the idea that a government that can't manage the price of gasoline could expand and handle anything else.  In 2019, Harris espoused all of these ideas as an outright Bernie acolyte.Harris abandoned those ideas when she started running for president.  When asked why, she had no answer.  The reason for that is the most simple one.  She held none of the beliefs she previously espoused and viewed them as politically expedient positions to have.   That, of course, also means that any new position she has is politically expedient.  If the woman wanted to convince you that she has no core conviction, she certainly managed to do that.It's the economy, stupid\\\\- A banner in Bill Clinton's campaign for President offices, 1992If you don't connect with the voters and present reasonable plans for what their main issues are, you are going to lose.  The issues that voters were focused on this election were pocketbook issues, kitchen table issues, inflation, immigration, and public safety.  Bill Clinton's 1992 motto was basically the same one used by the Trump campaign.  Trump talked about real issues and concerns that voters and the ideas that he could bring to the table to help them.  Harris, meanwhile, yammered about abortion and how Trump is literally Hitler.  Harris took the voters for fools.What you say is partly true.  The Harris campaign website had a 90 page pdf file on it's economic agenda, not that you knew that previously.  The problem is that not only did Harris not write that document, she had never even read it.  No one on her staff read it.  The reason I know this is that she could not articulate the main points from a single item of what she claimed was her plan, or even more than one or two of the main points.Progressives will not compromise and will not coalition build.  The average progressive is easily seen as viewing anyone who does not hold his views as either evil or ignorant or both.  That is not someone who can build a coalition.  For the reasons in this post, going forward for at least the next decade, Democrats will accept progressive votes, but will not be an active part of any controlling coalition within the party, which means the progressive dream is dead for now.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Lefties must become unified members of the coalition, we must stress the importance of unity, and they must get on board.

By then, the president will be rather unhappy with JPow because he will be raising rates to fight the rising interest rates caused by this government intervention.Then the President will choose his successor to lead the FED, and the conservative senate will swear them in to remain in lockstep with the President.

The problem isn't some boogeyman that hates progressive policies - it's that the entire democratic campaign relied on scare tactics - and you are continuing to spread scare tactics. It doesn't matter if your scare tactics are against some minority racists or the silicone valley elites.Any scare tactics campaign is terrible in my opinion, and personally I will never vote for anyone who uses those tactics. However, the left, unlike the right, will never win with scare tactics. Scare tactics generally work against the lower IQ population, and require utilizing some pre-existing, half legitimate fear. \\nIt's easy to dehumanize some imaginary illegal immigrants - most Americans don't know who are those illegals, they don't have voting rights, and anti immigrant polocies rarely backfired against the non-immigrant population. It's relatively easy to make a random minority into a boogeyman, especially when the minority is small enough that many voters never even interacted with a person from that minority (like how jew dehumazation is still very much alive). The left, this campaign, and during the Clinton campaign has been dehumanizing voters. Any republican voter has been painted as an evil, racist, woman hating white man. When the reality is far more complex. \\nSure, these scare tactics work to drive the already persuaded into mass hysteria and to increase their voting numbers, but it will always only alienate undecided voters, and reinforce the common right wing narrative that leftists are detached from reality and are idiots. (notice the difference between dehumanization and painting them as idiots). It is easy to persuade a person their loved ones are idiots (we are all idiots in the end) it's harder to persuade them they are evil. If the left wants to win, they have to start running on a positive campaign. Empathize with the very real concerns of right wing and undecided voters and address these issues.The left, not just in the US, is too caught up with being hysterical about the other candidate, that they forget that their job is to offer a suitable candidate with a convincing policy.Left wing leaders being incompetent is exactly why so many countries are becoming more and more radicalized - and it's terrible for everyone involved.

I think most normal people are already aware that immigrants don't actually eat the cats and dogs. He paints the people who oppose him as enemies. That's nothing new. Those people werent gonna vote for him anyways. From what I see, the clown just came up with a new bad joke. Meh whatever.Harris spent so much effort appealing herself to minorities, black people, and women, but not only did she do a mediocre job at it, she sacrificed the male vote, especially the young white men vote. Those white young men with no control over the historic oppression of minorities, and yet are blamed and systematically put at a disadvantage nowadays, by ESG funds, lower college acceptance rate, job disadvantages, etc.Those people ended up voting for someone they DIDN'T agree with because at least Trump didn't attribute original sin to them, instead of Harris who they possibly did think was more reasonable, but told them they should know their place as cheerleaders besides females, and if you disagree you're a sexistThe fact that Democrats are attributing their failure to \\"young men and toxic masculinity\\" instead of reflecting on how THEY THEMSELVES failed men is a testament to their inability to recognize the issue.For the record, I think Trump is a deranged, lying, raping orange felon and I wouldn't vote for him if I were a US citizen. But I wouldn't support the other side that talks about men's issues because they need to win the election and not because they think men's issues are serious either.TL:DR: it works for Trump because he paints his enemies as enemies.

They had come to protest the securitisation of public swimming pools following a racist debate around incidents of young men getting into fights there.  Right-wing politicians and the media had used these incidents to promote racist narratives. By connecting them to increased migration since 2015 and speaking of the consequences of multicultural swimming they suggested that migrants, especially young Arab men, were a danger to German society. Their narrative was supported by the fact that the Prinzenbad is located in Kreuzberg, a district marked by Turkish and Arab migration and often referred to by police and the media as a crime hotspot.Dozens of people force the shutdown of public swimming pools because they have huge brawls at them, assault and intimidate guests and staff, and the ONLY thing the author cares to say about it is that the debate was 'racist'.The article they link about the 'racist debate' is just a DW report on the whole situation, with a brief paragraph about AfD's statements being the only thing that could even vaguely characterise the debate as 'racist'.This is emblematic of the left's unreason on public safety and law enforcement: leftists are so preoccupied with avoiding even the distant appearance of bigotry that they forget that basic governance is a public good too.","title":"Demonising migrants, fortifying borders: Germanys downward asylum spiral, Migrant communities in Berlin fight against racism and for the right to asylum."},{"text":"![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)","title":"The weakness of liberals is that we have too much compassion and empathy.

This is not a recent development in US politics.  It may have become more pronounced with the advent of social media, but this was a topic being discussed when I was a kid 30 some years ago.  A lot of Trump voters distrust of government and institutions is rooted more in a combination of grievances and a lack of good information as well as an unwillingness  to consider that they may not be right.   There are far too many people getting their news and information from dubious sources who seem to lack the skills/intellectual tools to distinguish between good and bad sources of information.  That coupled with an unwillingness to consider that they may be wrong, that they may have been led astray, and that they may be supporting someone unworthy of their support is a huge problemand it isnt limited only to Trump voters. Its just that Trump voters happen to be supporting someone who actively seeks to sow distrust and misinformation and who has no interest in maintaining the democratic norms of the republic if they dont suit his personal aims. Regarding continuously attacking Trump: what other choice is there? For the first time in history, an outgoing US president straight up tried to block the peaceful transition to a new president, first through dubious legal means, then through efforts at corruption, and finally through violence.  The man isnt Hitler but he literally tried to seize power away from the popular will of the people.  He tried to do the thing that dictators and despots get away with because their countries lack the legal means and democratic norms to stop it.  That is incredibly dangerous and in all honesty, the man should have never been allowed anywhere near an election ever again.  Failing to remind people of that reality would have been gross negligence on the part of his opponents (and his fellow republicans for that matter).  And his supporters simply refuse to believe it (see my first paragraph).As far as blaming other people.  Yeah I blame other people, those who were to apathetic to go out and vote to stop it and recognize the gravity of the moment, as well as those who blindly support it because they either refuse, or are unable, to understand the danger of what they have chosen to support.","title":"CMV: democrats are the reason to blame for losing and they wont get better no until they can fix it"},{"text":"That's not inflation.

I think many of the policies pushed by some of these wings *are actively bad for the country and their own causes.* A degree of compromise is always going to be required, but it shouldn't be forgotten that national rent control, price controls, broad nationalisation, higher tariffs, etc etc can be *disastrous* and *just like Republican policies* that may \\"resonate with voters\\" they should still be resisted for being *bad*.

We overturned Roe vs. Wade, and it led to a massive political victory in the next major election. Even in blue states where pro-choice voters are presumably more dominant, Trump gained votes in almost all of them. The shock of this ruling was not a devastating one. People have already gotten comfortable with the new status quo of letting these laws be maintained by the states, and they will be even more comfortable with that in 4 years. This is not a pro-choice country, or a pro-life country. It's divided. And, therefore, there will not be any federal abortion laws for the foreseeable future.One of Trump's weakest gains was in Georgia, where the story of the woman who died of problems with a pregnancy happened. That is definitely something that needs to be handled. We can't have women dying because they were denied care. I don't believe any of these state laws deny an abortion when the mother's life is in danger. That kind of story is what led to Ireland liberalizing its abortion law.

That list from Harvard is kind of a mess. Could you list just a couple examples of MSM that you are referring to? My argument though - This would make sense if there was no entity between the C-Suite and the consumer, but it is the actual journalists and editors in the newsroom writing the news. Dont get me wrong there are bad journalists/editors and plenty of times when the corporate side of the organization tries to interfere, but there are a lot of journalists who take their job to inform the public seriously. I think a large part of the public is more a mix of that real news is actually really fucking boring and complicated and takes effort to inform options based on it coupled with the decline of media literacy. To find the news arms, organizations have to create engaging entertainment content which does way better with consumers than actual news. Example- Tucker Carlson on Fox is entertainment, Chris Wallace on Fox is a journalist- but guess who people take more from. \\nAlso more often than not, stories that have the actual information are often long form and written. Broadcast cannot capture the depth required, but serves as an excellent supplement to written content by the engaging visuals. So more effort on the part of individuals.Also, to the slant of news - thats actually a good thing. Having competing views of the same facts gives a more well rounded perspective. IF we are talking about legit news and not entertainment.

While regulation has been dismantled in the US (which feeds into the global economy), there are still more safeguards today to prevent a market crash relative to the 1930s.Printing money doesn't always equal inflation, so long as the money supply in the economy is not growing at an exponential rate. Inflation in Canada is lower than the global average, and even came in behind alot of European countries. Meanwhile: Canada doubled it's debt to support people and businesses during COVID; but that money went straight back into the economy to pay for rent, mortgages and necessities. Interest rates will affect government borrowing in terms of debt costs, but the idea that the amount of spending governments are doing is going to crash the economy, right now, is false. The US dollar, even though the US is running a 1 trillion $ deficit, is stronger today than 5 years ago, and that's the world's benchmark currency; along with the price of oil being high which is what the US dollar is pegged to.There are also numerous other factors during the 1930s that led to a global crash. Germany's economy went topside due to high debt payments taking up 1/3rd of it's economy, the dustbowl in the US led to large natural disasters and crushed the backbone of the economy. Global stability was on a downturn (compare the 1930s to today, and even with the election of certain people and wars happening across the globe, the world today is more stable which leads to more investment in business due to financial security of private markets).Wealth gap being high could 100% lead to a recession, but you need to look at purchasing power. Statistically speaking: wages in the US and Canada have outpaced inflation, and while the lower class is highly impacted by inflation the average/median citizen, from data I've seen during some study in post-secondary, has risen relative to global inflation. So long as people can still buy essential goods and put money towards commodities, then the economy will still be able to function. Once people can't afford to spend money on xboxes, new furniture, etc, then you'll start to see problems.Bonds are less expensive due to lower interest rates. Private markets mark up bonds/GICs a little bit over what government bonds will use. People aren't wanting to invest in government bonds because we just came out of a period where bonds were higher return, relative to the last 10-15 years, where interest rates were extremely low to keep investment in the economy high.I don't disagree that the economy is headed for some sort of crash, but the reasons for said crash are going to be different. Geopolitics wise, protectionist policies are on the rise in areas like the US, which is typically extreme on free trade, and EU. People have been talking about a massive war breaking out in Taiwan, which will blow Ukraine out of the water in terms of escalation, and that will crash the tech market due to Taiwan being the only place in the world where superconductors are produced. OPEC is trying to use leverage to raise prices on a global scale to bring in increased profits. I think that your focus is too much on certain trends in financial markets without looking at shifts in the market, global stability and government policies which will drive those changes further.","title":"CMV: Were at the end of the long-term debt cycle, and the current market mirrors the lead-up to the 1929 stock market crash"},{"text":"Lol Unless it's posted you're good.

The GOP wins because they lure in working class voters with the premise of good jobs. Remember, Republicans love to tout how many jobs they will create.?Hispanics are social Conservatives and that is true. But they also support healthcare reform, which the second most polarizing position against the Republican Party, after immigration. Black voters favor the unions overwhelmingly. Thats not going away although Blacks who recently arrived in the country (1st or 2nd generation) overwhelmingly go to the Republican side. They dont support welfare because they themselves are too proud to be on welfare. And they are typically legal immigrants.But union jobs, thats all Democrats right there. Even if you offered people a higher minimum wage, most people would pick the union job because it confers stability. Republicans would destroy unions in a second.?Yes, this quite scary to moderates because it costs money. But if we continue to push for Moderates, then well keep getting Trumps in the government who will end up stealing from the American government. Make no mistake, this 2024 election is the result of Trump pushing people off the voters rolls and telling people not to show up.

We don't have anyone right now. The DNC elite likes to keep pushing through their ideal candidate. 2016 is pure example of that. If Hillary had picked Bernie for her VP, She may have squeezed out a win from the progressives. But she picked a unknown, Kamala fell into the same trap, She picked a unknown. She may have won PA if she picked Shapiro. But maybe even he knew it was a sinking ship.And We don't have anyone because the DNC is fucked up it failed to learn anything from Hillary or Biden from some degree. Trump is a populist, people who voted for him liked him. Can we really say the same for Biden? Even my vote for Biden back in 2020 was mostly due to my distaste of Trump and the mess he created, rather than me liking Biden or his polices . So even back in 2020? I really think most folk picked Biden just because the Alterative was Another four years of The Trump Dumpster fire at the time. Was Biden my first choice? nope, Was Kamala?                                                                                                                                                                                     Nope. Did i like either of them? nope. Would Kamala made a good president? probably. And I'll repeat this. Biden should have really dropped out before the Primary's maybe then we could have got somebody new and fresh voted in by the voters. Kamala was always going to be tied to Biden. And nobody picked her, because Biden took too long to drop out. But they were Gaslighting Biden the entire time. Dude is old and should have made it clear that he wasn't gonna seek a second term from the get go. But i still will say we needed Biden to bring normalcy back into politics.Obama was through and through a people person and it showed. People loved him. He held Gravitas. Kamala, again, it's just Hillary syndrome. Both would have made great presidents. (Hillary and Kamala) But i think their likability factor is what held both back, plus both were women. I have nothing against women. But i don't think this country is ready for a woman president just yet. And it showed i think both lost (Biden was the outliner and didn't technically lose to Trump) Democrats really need a super majority in both house and senate before they can push through a female candidate.You want somebody to win Against Maga? Then they need have the Gravitas of Obama, but the policy and adornment of Bernie.Picking Establishment Democrats backed by the elite ain't gonna win Democrats shit. This election has made me switch from Democrat to Independent, Until Democrats can get their shit together i aren't being associated with the damned party. This should have been an easy win. But somehow they fucked it up.","title":"Bidens internal polling showed Trump getting 400 electoral votes"},{"text":"At least as of now everyone seems to have polar opposite views on what the lesson should be though - in r/moderatepolitics by far the most prominent opinion is that Dems need to drop the progressive movement, including because its very unpopular with Latinos, Muslims, black men, etc. In r/politics the opinion seems to be the opposite.

Jeff Bezos took a more measured response but was clearly fine with Harris losing giving the lack of a WaPo endorsement.?\\nSo as the Democratic party, what do you do?

On the other hand, they could try to court a moderate voter demographic and signal to the billionaire class that they will suck their dicks and change nothing. They tried this, but failed, because the moderate demographic turns out to not exist, and the billionaires don't just want the status quo, they want to institute a techno-feudalist dsytopia.

I am a lifelong Republican but I often study the left and try to understand what they actually believe. I watch Democracy Now, Kyle Kulinsky, the Young Turks, Jimmy Dore (before he became conservative), and other more radical leftists such as Second Thought and Hakim. They have a few good ideas such universal healthcare, living wages, and rants against the abuses of private equity firms. But other than that they are pretty delusional especially on what they believe the \\"the right\\" stands for. The right wing is not a bunch of fascists and racists. Right wingers mostly just want to be left alone. The P'nut the squirrel story is a recent example of what Republicans are anxious about. Government goons kicked in a man's door, invaded his home and killed his pets for dubious reasons because he didn't have the proper permits and paperwork to have a pet squirrel. This is why right wingers are obsessed with guns. We are not authoritarians. We deeply fear authoritarians and government over reach. We know things could have gone much worse. Ruby Ridge and the Waco Massacre are known tragedies to almost every right winger. Our government is capable of so much evil and has done horrendous things over the years. The conservatives were initially fooled by Bush and 9/11 but now most believe it was 9/11 was an inside job. Our own government did that or the intelligence agencies that have gone rogue did 9/11. The Republicans had to lose in 2008 to Obama to reinvent the party after we discovered the truth of our betrayal. We had to cast out the Bush wing of the party and that required losing elections. In the aftermath it led to the rise of the Tea-Party which then morphed into MAGA and the rise of Trump.Briefly in 2011 both the LEFT and the RIGHT saw eye to eye at Occupy Wall Street. This scared the wealthy ruling class so they created wedge issues along racial and gender line to divide us. Both sides were saying fuck the banks and fuck the bailouts. From the right wing perspective the bailout was a betrayal of Capitalism and the free market. The bailout was socialism for the rich and a total mockery of what conservatives believed in for the last century. So there was a 2nd casting out of devil from the Republican around this time. It manifested in the rejection of the Mitt Romney wing of the party in 2012. There was an awaking around Ron Paul and the desire to END the FED. This awakening led to the financial elite being kicked out of the Republican party. And afterwards they found refuge in the Democrats in the fallout after Mitt Romney's defeat. The Wall Street bankers were no longer welcome in the Republican party so they became Democrats as wolves in sheep's clothing. This why in 2016 Wall Street was bankrolling Hillary Clinton to defeat Bernie and the populist MAGA Republicans. We kicked them out of the party and rallied around Trump. The Republicans are a populist party now similar to how they once were under Teddy Roosevelt.

While \\"regular conversations\\" discussing anti-vaccines, horse de-wormer, climate change being a hoax, JFK coming back and a whole host of other conspiracy theories are highly interesting for a lot of the pleb folks, you can understand why the so called \\"liberal elitist snobs\\" don't care to participate or listen to these types of shows and obviously not hold them in high regard. Mumps, measles and rubella, stuff the US hasn't seen in 50 years, are now sprouting up across the US as a result of listening to this type of stuff. It's akin to watching ghost hunters or finding bigfoot shows. The conspiracy theories the left has are right in front of your face, trumps tariffs will actually cause more inflation, getting rid of 11 million undocumented workers will harm the agricultural segment thus causing higher prices, not to mention the exorbitant cost of doing so, trumps policies will have drastic negative effects on climate change and global warming. But these are boring and require thought. There isn't a left wing equivalent of Joe Rogan to make those things interesting to the plebs. Instead, what is interesting is to say those are all lies and hoaxes (in this case by scientists, doctors and economists aka \\"liberal elitist snobs\\" as you say) and that is the shit that sells. It's more interesting to not know shit and say it's not true than it is to not know shit and believe the experts. Simple as that. There isn't a left wing equivalent of Joe Rogan for just that reason. If there were anything close, it would be Jon Stewart or John Oliver or Steven Colbert. But the topics of truth are less attention getting than the conspiracy theories and \\"doctors proven wrong on vaccines\\" topics and thus the left will never have a Joe Rogan.Edit: Glad to see more representation from the righties in this sub though. I for one appreciate the dialog and discussion of various topics and differences. Afterall, while we may disagree on certain things, I'll bet we have a lot more in common than not.

Given that they got caught red-handed funding counter-protesters and encouraging violence between Bernie and Trump supporters it didn't feel that far-fetched to me.It wasn't long after that until Hillary said, \\"You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. (Laughter/applause) Right? (Laughter/applause) They're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic C you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.

Well Gaza is gonna be a glass farm now, Trump promised Netanyahu more weapons and even more support. So progressives voted their ideals and feel better about themselves.  Yay for them.  Unfortunately it came with the real consequence of them directly or indirectly supporting Fascism in America, and the doom of Gazans.  They stated Trump would be bad and please vote for Harris, but nope.  American progressives by and large decided that their misplaced idealism was more important than actually defending Gaza as people who lived there asked for.20 million voters decided Democracy was not worth defending.  Progressives were the loudest non-MAGA about not wanting to vote.  Naturally they should receive a large part of that blame.  I know some (such as yourself) did your duty to help preserve Democracy, but that message was lost on many progressives.  Help your family see the consequences of their actions, and that the blame falls on them such as your sister-in-law for allowing this.  This was supposed to be a resounding and final defeat of MAGA.

I understand your argument and appreciate your input. My primary issue is that I have been to at least of all major cities in the US. I live in one, and it's hard for me to believe there's more than a few hundred people here. I work with a lot of people for a living and I regularly drive around 80% of my state and occasionally into two neighboring states.I've driven across America more than a few times. I think the only parts I missed are like Tennessee and Oklahoma, which of course, are commonly known to be basically empty anyway. Oh and Kansas. Unless there's like 300 million people hiding in all those cornfields. I've visited other countries. I've gone to Montreal multiple times. There is no way this city should be considered a major population center. Same with Toronto. I've attended concerts, baseball games. All of these things combined have only strengthened my convictions. There's virtually nobody out there.And I know what you're thinking. Maybe I just don't understand large numbers which is a very common and normal human thing. However, I do have a solid grasp on large numbers, probability, etc. I also take into account the things I have seen with my own eyes. Realistically, it's gonna take a whole lot of evidence to prove to me this massively fake and obviously laughable number of people exist on planet earth. Even the idea of 80 million votes being cast in an election is just laughable to me.It's just very incredibly hard for me to believe with what I have seen and experienced. I don't see how this is a wild conspiracy theory or anything either.. in terms of \\"flat earth\\", \\"fake elections\\", the moon being a space ship and us living in a simulation, I think this viewpoint in relatively pretty tame.

But there's a big difference between holding progressive ideals, and being so absorbed in those ideals that you're separated from reality. I consider myself a progressive, too; I would love someday to have a truly progressive nation with truly progressive leaders. But I'm also not an idiot; I'm aware that what I hope to see in the future has zero bearing on the reality of today. There were exactly two choices for our next president. Harris, who may or may not have ended up being good for the country; and Trump, who straight-up told us at every opportunity that he was going to destroy this country. Seems like a pretty easy decision to me; I voted for Harris. I also voted for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, because it was obvious to me that Trump was a threat to everything I hold dear, even if I didn't love those particular candidates.A lot of progressives are just unable to see past their own ego (much like MAGA, although at least they have the balls to admit they don't care about anyone else). They're privileged people who have never experienced any real suffering, but have convinced themselves that they get it. I grew up broke, constantly moving around and often on the brink of homelessness, and was in and out of foster care. One of the first things she ever told me is that she *does* understand the struggle of poor people, because she's a teacher and has some poor students. No. You *see* it, but that's completely different from *understanding* it. She and so many others attach themselves to these causes because it makes *them* feel better about themselves. Whether or not they're actually accomplishing anything doesn't even occur to them; it's all performative. They choose to live in a fantasy world where they're everyone's savior, instead of doing something that might actually save people. They just helped elect Lex Luthor, and they're going to find out very soon that they're not, in fact, Superman.","title":"The weakness of liberals is that we have too much compassion and empathy.

I've had redditors say, you know, there are people who are 70 and 80 or older and were actually there. And I get that, but those people got their news from the talking box in their living room and were heavily propagandized, and that continued with the advent of television.They read newspapers like the new York times, which we now know has had their editors in the government's pocket. We've had people from intelligence agencies come out and say agents would walk in with briefcases of money to get them to publish whatever they want.Even today, people that age believe everything they see on TV. They don't know a world where they're supposed to be wary of the media they consume. You could convince them of anything you want. Indeed, these are the same people who buy gold plated zinc and blow their life savings, who fall for romance scams all the time, and who are still waiting for their bank transfer from a Nigerian prince. And I'm supposed to trust these people with a factual account of modern history? I can't even trust them to toggle a turn signal.Additionally, think about lockdowns just recently. Do you remember the media showing photos of mannequins and cardboard cutouts in stadiums? I remember seeing a segment how like 200 people showed up and they filled the entire stadium with CGI people. Am I supposed to believe that was the one and only moment in history they did this? And again, returning to lockdowns. Remember when they lied about death counts and infection rates? I don't think they adjusted accordingly for the population being a near fraction of what it actually is. We went from something that seemed like a 50% kill rate to, lol, like 0.5%. But I get that this could have just been fear pr0n to control or to whatever end some lunatics claim. I'm of the opinion the pendulum swung too far in the other direction. Perhaps the Florida Dept of Health lady who refused to fudge those numbers and got raided, silenced and threatened by the federal government. I think it is entirely possible she nearly blew the lid off the whole thing. And you know, these aren't exactly stupid arguments.And finally, the proof I'm satisfied with, is how angry, triggered and personally offended a huge number of people get when I talk about this on reddit. You think about it, it's really an unimportant thing. I'm just some guy. Why the fuck do people care so much and get so shitty when I bring it up?

I refuse to see compassion as a weakness. I am at my strongest and my best when I am able to turn a compassionate ear to who I can, when I am able to worry if the people I don't know and haven't met are okay. I am at my best when I believe that, fundamentally, people are good.I am at my worst when I fear those people, when I am spiteful and resentful towards those people. There's so many people I haven't met yet. I don't know why some of the ones I haven't met voted for trump. It could be because they're hateful. Could also be because they're misled. Not everyone sees the way I do. Not everyone has the experiences I do.I didn't vote for Kamala just for myself-- I voted for my friends, my family, and for America. I truly thought Kamala and Walz would be the best option for America, not just for me, but for THEM, too. I voted because I thought Kamala's economy, keeping abortion, etc. Would improve lives. Not just democrat, and left leaning lives, but all lives.If you're young - which, I am young - You're going to be living with people who voted from Trump for a long, long time. I understand why you might feel angry, but a lot of gen Z men voted for Trump. How many of them were pushed there because of how online spaces demonize men and have been during their formative years? How many were pushed there because they didn't get the compassion they needed here? So they seek to get validation elsewhere? How many of them need help and are compensating for their lack of it?I am a trans man. I have interacted with the world in both ways, and I tell you-- it is different. Those \\"Kill all men\\" statements you see, the \\"All men are evil\\" sentiments, especially if unchallenged, apply to ME, too. You don't get to just say \\"Obviously I'm not talking about (specific groups or specific men). You know why? Because in LGBT+ spaces, if you're clocked as a cis man, you're treated differently. You're treated more coldly, especially if you also read as straight. This is alienating. Women treat you differently. This is alienating. It's as if we've forgotten that the patriarchy isn't men, but a system that ALSO harms men. If you're seen as a man, you are treated differently based on nothing more than your outward gender presentation. That's part of upholding the patriarchy.We can throw whoever we want under the bus-- blame it onGen Z men, blame it on latinos, blame it on Kamala, Biden, Tim Walz, Trump, MAGA, the uninformed voters, Those who didn't vote, Russia, The Courts, Police-- you can blame anyone and everyone-- but for the love of fuck! Don't cloud your empathy, don't  cloud your compassion, don't let your fear and anger be the thing that clouds your goodness.When you drop to a cold and dark and hostile view of the world, the world becomes cold, dark, and hostile. It becomes infinitely harder to see how you can change it. It becomes easier to be mad at smaller and smaller groups of individuals. It ALSO becomes harder to be mad at and tackle, the systems that shape people and culture if you're busy being mad at the people.The issue isn't compassion-- it's the death of it. It's the Us V.S. Them mentality that has done such an incredible job at dividing us as people. It's the US vs. them mentality that sells itself in shades of blue, red, and gold. As people who want to make the change for the better, we have to work with everyone across generations. Across sex, creed, race, gender, and political beliefs. When we start thinking any differently, we, too, develop a set of \\"In groups\\" which we want to protect, being women, minorities, etc. And \\"Out groups\\" being conservatives, which is being increasingly conflated with more and more types of people, one of those types of people being 50% of the entire population of the world-- men.If I see somebody lying on the sidewalk from a heart attack, seizure, or what have you, even if I see that goddamned red hat on their head, I'm doing CPR, and nobody can stop me. Because that is a person, and I am a person, and I wanna live in a fucking world where people help people. And I don't care if that sentiment will be returned back to me, because if the world is dark, and cruel, and everyone else's world has turned to be completely centered around themselves, god damn it, MY part of the world doesn't have to be like that. I choose what my piece of the world I occupy looks like, and it's gonna be compassionate because compassion is what makes me strong","title":"The weakness of liberals is that we have too much compassion and empathy.

If the Catholic church wants to develop a \\"Catholic platform\\" for Catholics to advocate for, there is no reason for them to poll atheists.

[Wikidata itself](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) has this data, if you cant find a topic you can usually find it that way.Our significance model is different from the one you're imagining, I think. We're doing fault-tolerant polling, not attempting to establish exact percentages, which have no meaning in the fault tolerant setting. Your measurements can and will be adversarially manipulated. We assume up to a third of the vote is *actively malicious and attempting to skew the results.* Fine corrections of a few points here and there are not meaningful when you're operating under the assumption that a massive chunk of your polling base may simply be lying to you. It's a very pigeonhole principle oriented setting - As an example, imagine if you polled 60% Catholics, 20% atheists, and 20% random people who may or may not be lying. If 90% came back saying abortion should be banned, at least 10% of the sample were atheists who wanted it banned. The maximum without any atheists is 60% + 20% = 80%, 10% short of what was measured.

Truer words I've never seen, and it sucks this will be lost in the scrap heap the conspiracy sub has become. I've got a similar back story, in that my family was almost exclusively Dem and it was accepted that they were the party for the blue collar, with an anti-war, anti-big business, party \\"of the people\\". To put it it as succinctly as possible, the R and D roles have completely flipped from when I was younger (I'm 40). My parents still are lost in their Dem haze, and the reason is they, and I assume this is the cause for a lot of folks, have been unable to break free from the mainstream media programming (literally and figuratively). My family went to start with them fur a couple weeks, and MSNBC was on literally all day. 8 hours a day (they're retired). No fucking wonder they think the way they do. And it's not *entirely* their fault; the media is used as a propaganda tool now, which was made legal by Obama. Lastly, I want to echo your sentiments regarding Bernie, Tulsi, and RFK Jr; to any objective observer, watching what the Dem party did to their brightest stars should be a damning indictment as to the party's true goals and motivations. Anyone that was not 100% in step with the party was shunned (and this ousting of any dissent is copied down to their grassroots organizations currently). This will be their undoing, as without a complete overhaul, the DNC will be beaten for the next decade+. I can crystal ?? ball the Vance/Gabbard ticket in '28 beating the shit out of whatever the DNC decides to put out.

American urban planning has favored low density residential housing for way too long, and at some point there's basic physical realities of not having more space for suburbs that are close enough to the cities jobs are in. Fixing America's housing would mean putting up more [\\"missing middle\\"](https://missingmiddlehousing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MMH_Diagram_Landing_Page-2.jpg) housing, things like duplexes, triplexes, cottage courts, townhouses, rowhouses, and live-work type buildings.But the reality is that existing homeowners hate any proposals that might affect their property value negatively. Which is exactly the same as saying that existing homeowners want housing prices to remain high. If anything, they want housing prices to get significantly higher, because it makes them richer (at least on paper). Sure, some of the issue is ultra-wealthy, REITs, AirBnB type stuff, but it's also just the random suburban homeowner that fights tooth and nail against something like [this](https://ducdn.denverurbanism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/18134337/2019-01-26_nonconforming-buildings_4.jpg) for \\"ruining neighborhood character\\".Ironically, reducing the amount of zoning restrictions would be the small government, free market solution. Even more ironically, Trump has an explicit policy position to maintain single family zoning.

Trump won the popular vote, all of the 7 swing states. All of the country (except Washington state) shifted right. The GOP will control the Senate 53-47 and the House too (by single digit margins). The obvious one, they will control the SCOTUS for decades. They also ended Democratic trifectas in MI and MN.It could have been worse. If Roe wasn't overturned, Dems would have had red tsunamis in 2022 and 2024. Democrats kept control of important Senate seats (AZ, GA, PA, NV in 2022 and AZ, NV, WI and MI in 2024). Democrats in most districts outperformed Harris (both in 22 and 24).Headwinds were against Dems. Only 28% of the country thought it was going in the right direction. This created apathy for Dems and non-voters, and ammunition for Republicans. Democrats messed up the politics of immigration (see [link 1](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/how-the-democrats-bungled-the-politics-of-immigration-0569acfc), [link 2](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/trump-immigration-border.html); archive [link 1](https://archive.ph/jRLWF), [link 2](https://archive.ph/KI2iT)) Incumbents lost badly all over the world post pandemic. **Dobbs gave Dems a fighting chance.** Harris ran a good (but not great) campaign. She had real momentum. Swing states only shifted right by a margin of 3.6 percentage points whilst the country as a whole shifted 6.7 points. Biden dropping out was a good thing. His internal polling showed that he would have lost in a landslide (https://x.com/socdem\\\\_michael/status/1855032681224192140). Sadly he still ran for re-election, and his worsening condition was kept hidden. Harris was the unpopular VP, and she wouldn't distance herself from him, so she was facing the same anti-incumbency backlash.Trump won despite being a terrible candidate, not because voters like him. A more competent Republican would have won MN, VA, NH, ME statewide, NE-2 and NM (even NJ, NY, RI and CT). Backlash against him and his policies will be severe.Where are we now?

Trump isnt particularly ideological, above all cares about his image + public support / fawning adoration over him. and, SCOTUS + congress aside, is quite capable of telling the religious right to go stuff themselves - or at the very least until sometime *after* he is done being president - *if* he wants to.Or not. Bear in mind that Musk / Thiel / Vance are going to be running the white house. Or at least half of it. Oh, and LMAO at Bezos lol. Short of trump just pitting those two men agaist each other for shits and giggles, anyone wanna bet how massively trump is gonna fuck over blue origin on space contracting / artemis and project kuiper? Like seriously, Trumps whole thing is personal loyalty + fealty to him; musk just bought him the election for ~$20B, and Bezos is / was based in seattle, owns WaPo and makes fun of him / religious red state america w/ The Boys et al. lolAnyways. Musk has a very personal, mostly just fucked up super-bad parenting hatred of trans people. So yeah.All that said. Remember thar Gen Z is still way, way more progressive than older folks 20-30 years ago. Who are now in retirement homes or dead.And that, simultaneously, there are members of younger gen z (and presumably at this point gen alpha, yay) who are straight up neo nazis and fascists. Thanks very directly to growing up under trumps / bannons influence. And god help us with Vance and his theil-backed hardline neo-catholic new right.Which is like in some ways maybe less bad than run of the mill US fundamentalist evangelical christian bullshit. And in other ways like 100x worse.Anyways, definitely didnt have that on my bingo card that *that* particular fringe thiel-backed CPAC group would legitimately manage to take over the US.In 2024. And by elon musk apparently doing his level best to fight the woke mind virus.

Its unfortunate that mainstream media often plays a major role in fueling hate, polarization and distortion of reality. Social media thrives on outrage, and with the news industry primarily ad-funded, the pressure to capture attention is high in our noisy world. To stand out, news companies frequently resort to sensationalized, rage-bait headlines, exaggerated claims, and even outright falsehoods, intensifying divisions further.Many people tend to forget that mainstream news articles are written by individuals with their own political views and biases. Rather than striving for neutrality, some reporters openly use their platforms to promote personal agendaslike wielding the influence of a massive social media following.When people exclusively consume news and opinions from sources strongly skewed to one side of the political spectrum, they can become indoctrinated. With enough repetition, almost any idea can seem credible when its the only message being heard. Since these audiences often view traditional media as authoritative, theyre more likely to uncritically accept whatever theyre told while dismissing any contrary information that doesnt come from their preferred trusted sources.It's also good to be aware that in modern politics people are inventing new terminology all the time. They invent a new term or concept that sounds noble and positive. But then their actual definition of that term is twisted in a way that it helps them to drive their own political agenda. For example the term \\"positive discrimination\\" means that people can be treated unfairly based on their race, religion, color of their skin etc., primarily to the detriment of the group of people who represent the majority, which is basically racism. But for some people suddenly racism becomes \\"acceptable\\" or even desirable when we just redefine it as \\"positive discrimination\\".For a happier, healthier life, its often better to limit exposure to politics and the negativity-driven news cycle altogether. However, if one does follow news and politics, its essential to learn to separate fact from opinion, which is challenging for the reasons mentioned. It helps to consult diverse information sources and approach issues calmly, without letting emotions cloud judgment. The goal is to think critically about strategies and solutions that would genuinely benefit the country and its people.Unfortunately, most people dont take the time to question what theyre told; they simply accept it as truth.I'm glad you have found your way out of the biased echo chamber.","title":"The Conspiracy of the Democratic Party and How We Lost"},{"text":"I think the correct response on Obama is who cares.

It could have been much worse.# It was bad. I don't need to tell you that. Trump won the popular vote, all of the 7 swing states. All of the country (except Washington state) shifted right. The GOP will control the Senate 53-47 and the House too (by single digit margins). The obvious one, they will control the SCOTUS for decades. They also ended Democratic trifectas in MI and MN.It could have been worse. If Roe wasn't overturned, Dems would have had red tsunamis in 2022 and 2024. Democrats kept control of important Senate seats (AZ, GA, PA, NV in 2022 and AZ, NV, WI and MI in 2024). Democrats in most districts outperformed Harris (both in 22 and 24).Headwinds were against Dems. Only 28% of the country thought it was going in the right direction. This created apathy for Dems and non-voters, and ammunition for Republicans. Democrats messed up the politics of immigration (see [link 1](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/how-the-democrats-bungled-the-politics-of-immigration-0569acfc), [link 2](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/trump-immigration-border.html); archive [link 1](https://archive.ph/jRLWF), [link 2](https://archive.ph/KI2iT)) Incumbents lost badly all over the world post pandemic. **Dobbs gave Dems a fighting chance.** Harris ran a good (but not great) campaign. She had real momentum. Swing states only shifted right by a margin of 3.6 percentage points whilst the country as a whole shifted 6.7 points. Biden dropping out was a good thing. His internal polling showed that he would have lost in a landslide (https://x.com/socdem\\\\_michael/status/1855032681224192140). Sadly he still ran for re-election, and his worsening condition was kept hidden. Harris was the unpopular VP, and she wouldn't distance herself from him, so she was facing the same anti-incumbency backlash.Trump won despite being a terrible candidate, not because voters like him. A more competent Republican would have won MN, VA, NH, ME statewide, NE-2 and NM (even NJ, NY, RI and CT). Backlash against him and his policies will be severe.Where are we now? It's Bush 2004, not Reagan 1980.

You and I both know that none of his economic promises will really happen, but when people are desperate, they will always vote for who is speaking to their fears and struggles.Democrats didnt do that.

Your post was polite and seemed sincere (or had the semblance thereof) so I am trying very hard to give you the benefit of the doubt.  I have read it several times trying to understand your viewpoint, but I cant get past the fact that I feel as if there are some inconsistencies or things you are leaving out.  I was honestly half asleep when I came across your post, but it bugged me so much that I felt inclined to respond.  I am still quite tired so I wont drone on too long, but I am hoping that you will be kind enough to answer a few of the many things that stood out to me.1.  You mentioned seeing Bush as a corrupt war criminal, so I assume you are at least my age give or take few years (mid 40s).  I did as well.  Actually, the 2000 election and the Bush Presidency, War on Terror, and all associated propaganda is what led me to start questioning everything in the political arena.  That is when I began obsessively researching issues and candidates, their voting records and campaign funding, as well as viewing multiple news sources including international news.  Fox News became the dominant news network during this period, and everyone was talking about it - either because they thought it was great, or because they thought it was shocking and appalling.  It was truly a cultural phenomenon at the time, yet you never watched it?  Even once to see what the fuss was all about?  Similarly, you reference the 2 different news articles about Trump (your airport story).  How was this your first experience seeing a political figure portrayed in two starkly different lights?  Honestly, this feels a little disingenuous, as if you are implying that Trump is some sort of victim, the first political figure to ever be portrayed this way.  You were cognizant enough about politics to see Bush as a warmonger, you honestly never saw any news sources praising him?  How about Obama?

So I was initially drawn into the carnivore diet agenda in 2020 as it started trending especially within the autoimmune and bodybuilder industry. People like Ms. Peterson were amongst them saying that we dont eat enough red meat and if we just ate more red meat we could reverse all disease and be well. Then there was liver king who said eating liver was the best thing for you and its loaded with vitamins. Granted liver is a naturally vitamin dense organ there so many other ways to achieve the same results. Plus the liver king was made when he was exposed for prolonged steroid use. This was obvious from the get go as his body was just not anything a functional person could accomplish without drugs. Lastly we had carnivore MD. Who is literally a psychiatrist and has no actual nutritional knowledge. He literally got caught and his health revealed elevated LDL-c so he went back to eating fruits and vegetables with mixed meats. Essentially every single Carnivore diet influencer has been an utter failure. As someone who has studied nutrition for a prolonged duration and is soon to be licensed dietitian it blows my mind how people act nowadays. They think beef tallow makes fries healthier, they believe red meat is the answer. They think raw milk heal all your problems but so many of these things can be explained by natural science. The issue isnt that these influencers werent getting answers its that they werent seeking the correct professionals. Organic acid panels shows your mitochondrial function, toxin exposure, and metabolic activity. You can get genetic testing as well to determine genes that are affecting your health. Methylation is well understood in todays culture to determine how your bodys gene expression and function. Theres so much. You cant tell me that you cant sit someone down and run the appropriate tests to determine why someone isnt functioning well and that you just have no idea how to help them if you run lab work. Its bullshit. Its all part of an agenda to make money and steer the sheep. This community of people who believe this are individuals who have been brainwashed and have lost faith in the health care system. Its not entirely their fault but like cmon thats why we have 2nd opinions. Do some work and find the right professional to help you get well. The carnivore diet is not the cure. As you said the most effective diets are those that are rich in fruits, grains, vegetables. Meat provides a lot of essential amino acids but realistically only B12 is exclusive to meat. All other B vitamins can be found in mixed meals. Moreover having mixed diet will help you digest better, feel better, heal better. Not one study has ever said dont eat vegetables because they produce micro toxins. The benefits always outweigh the harms. Shit look at polyphenols from olive oil. They are great for your body almost all of the time. However if your body has dysbiosis those micro biome can use polyphenols to hurt your gut. THis comes to show that there is a safe and therapeutic dose to everything. One diet is never the answer. The fact that weve been saying this for years and people still dont understand this is mind boggling. Stick to the evidence. Mixed meals, fruits, vegetables. Dont eat meat every day 3x a day you will kill your self. No one who has eaten like this had effectively lived a long healthy life.","title":"Is anyone else creeped out by all the Carnivore Diet propaganda?"},{"text":"Its 2016 every product has the promo code cum20","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Im here with the head of the kids need litter boxes in classrooms coalition, and he saysmeow.Do you have a response to that biting retort?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I voted for Tammy Baldwin.

Its a conundrum that everybody who optimistically supported Harris should dramatically lower our confidence in our priors for the next several weeks, but also lower our confidence in the explanations being proposed for this new evidence.But it doesnt really seem to me like this author believes his own claim, since in the third section he very credulously proposes a different explanation, where inflation and post-pandemic woes caused a global backlash against governing parties which Harris did her best to ameliorate.Speaking of which, he doesnt seem to have a very good grasp of who he is arguing with and what they actually believe. Its perfectly consistent to believe both that:A) Inflation and the post-pandemic economy made citizens around the world anti-establishmentB) Democrats prioritizing trans issuesor even *appearing to* prioritize trans issuesturned a hard but winnable election into a lossAnd if you really think Trump is a would-be dictator bent on destroying minority rights, then this sentence is downright stupid:Finally, and perhaps most importantly, even if Democrats should panic  which I dont think is the healthiest approach  shouldnt the panic be focused on protecting people who are most likely to be targeted by Trumps policies, followed by figuring out how to do so electorally in the future?Yes. The argument that is being made is that the optimal way to protect the rights of all minoritiesincluding those of trans peopleis to strategically retreat from pro-trans policies even when those policies are morally correct. The author doesnt consider this possibility and seemingly cant conceive of it.This is made all-the-more obvious by his straightforwardly stupid line of questioning about why the strawmen he constructs ignore the more fundamental issues.Whats worse is that in their comments  Moulton and Suozzi focused exclusively on trans girls participation in sports, and I dont even know what Yglesiass unprincipled principle does  the three men just ignore or avoid the more fundamental issues already being legislated against. Laws banning trans minors from receiving medical care have been passed in roughly half the country, Florida has a law restricting adult care, and bathroom bans and other laws restricting trans people from participating fully in society or schools have been passed in many states.They arent addressing them, you moron, because the entire point being made by these three is that Democrats should avoid the appearance of being pro-trans by strategically jettisoning the most unpopular and publicized trans rights issues, while quietly defending those that are more important. *They dont agree with these more conservative policies and they dont want to draw attention to them.*The author even had the opportunity to make the obvious example of such a move, when he recalls Bill Clintons endorsement and signing of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. You know what Clinton did in 1994? He used executive power to enact Dont Ask, Dont Tell, which itself was watered down from Clintons initial desire to allow open service of gay and lesbian soldiers. He passed legislation funding HIV and AIDs research. In his second term, Clinton appointed gay men to positions of power and celebirty within the executive branch, including ambassadorships. Like Truman with Black Americans, he used executive orders to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation within the federal government and called for legislation to ban it nationwide.Avoiding this discussion of tradeoffs with the specious alliteration protecting people is paramount is either remarkably stupid or deliberately deceptive. You cant protect people at all if you dont have power. Which moral-but-unpopular policies are worth the risk of losing elections is precisely the debate that we need to be having, and yet the author here cant or wont engage with that question.","title":"Dems going after trans people this week should be ashamed of themselves"},{"text":"We also don't know how much worse things might have gone had we not intervened in some of them.
