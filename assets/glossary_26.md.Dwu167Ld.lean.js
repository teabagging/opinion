A victims testimony can help move a case forward, thus helping to make sure a sexual assaulter does not walk free. If they did, there would be no justice  the ultimate unfairness. Victims often decide to press chargers, despite knowing that it will likely be a traumatic process for them. That said, we should limit scrutiny of the victim unless necessary for the case, to protect their health. If there is damning evidence, then there is no need to cross-examine the victim unnecessarily. One should also be mindful of how cross-examination is done. It is important that, in cases of a lack of a complete evidence, victims (as well as witnesses, etc.) are cross-examined. Otherwise, as you point out, there is nothing to support punishing the accused (thus it would be unfair to just do so). Of course, people may punish the accused without any evidence or cross-examination BUT this is not the same as legal punishment. I can cut someone off if I suspect they are a bad person, even without support for my suspicion. I do not owe another person my friendship. But this doesnt mean that the government or legal system can do so. They cant. This would be unfair. Which is more traumatic for the victim? \\nRunning into their assaulter and potentially being assaulted again, or being cross-examined to ensure their assaulter is imprisoned? Both are unfair but this unfairness was created the moment they were a victim of sexual assault, and we should do our best to rectify it.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"If he does this, US will fuck themselves the most.

Or used by American companies?I'll do some back of the napkin math: [14.8% of China's exports are to the U.S.](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/chn) and exports are [19.7% of China's GDP as of 2023.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=CN) So, assuming that the goods the U.S. imports from China are as carbon intensive to produce as the average good that China produces, that would mean around 2.9% of China's carbon emissions are from American-bound exports. So if China, stopped exporting to the U.S. entirely, the fundamentals for Chinese carbon emissions wouldn't change. Also worth noting, that for the U.S. imports are [13.9% of GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS?name_desc=false), this is among the lowest in the world full stop. We are less reliant on imports than pretty much any other country. For reference, the Eurozone has an import to GDP ratio of 47%, and the global average is 28.5%. So I don't think that America outsourcing our carbon emissions through trade is a major factor in climate change. The US could?**absolutely**?address this. It would just require putting their boot on the necks of companies doing business in America and requiring the products to meet certain standards to be sold. If the US can enforce sanctions on Iran, they can slap a carbon tax on items created in regions that pollute until those areas lose their competitive advantage or push for green energy.This would be a heavily protectionist measure that would raise prices on American consumers and stand to alienate many trading partners by suddenly making their exports less competitive in the U.S., which may also cause these countries to pivot away from economic ties with America. Reduce our economic soft power. I don't like Trump's tariff threats aimed toward friendly countries for this reason. Doing the same thing under the guise of climate change doesn't change its fundamental impact.I'll repeat that with our imports-to-GDP ratio being so low, this will also not make a tangible impact on climate change in the face of China's parabolic increase in CO2 emissions.","title":"Trump says will declare 'national energy emergency'"},{"text":"Are you referring to DSDs?

Graham writes. During his second inaugural, he tried for a slightly more uplifting message. The golden age of America, he declared, begins right now.?Perhaps it would be more aptly called a Gilded Age, Graham continues. Trump was joined in the Capitol Rotunda by many of the nations richest and most powerful men, including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Mark Zuckerberg. The attendance of the business titans was rendered conspicuous by the small space  Their presence also added a strange dimension to Trumps complaint that for many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens.The speech was saturated with 19th-century imperialism, including references to former President William McKinley, Manifest Destiny, and the Panama Canal. And why wouldnt Trump be feeling triumphant? Graham writes. The ceremony was held inside the Rotunda, where a little more than four years ago, supporters who hed instigated to storm the building paraded through with a Confederate flag  Trump stood face-to-face with Chief Justice John Roberts, who granted him broad immunity in a ruling last summer, and took the same oath of office that he flagrantly broke at the end of his first term. His mood was not only celebratory, but messianic.Trump delivered something akin to his stump speech: a meandering laundry list of policy promises of varying degrees of plausibility, Graham writes. Much of the speech was devoted to things that are almost certainly never going to happen, including his most audacious promise: Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable, he said.But the world already knows what four years of a Trump presidency looks like, Graham continues. Serenity, peace, and predictability were not the hallmarks of his first term, and they are unlikely to describe the second any better.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/yERCeaGs](https://theatln.tc/yERCeaGs) Evan McMurry, senior editor, audience and engagement, *The Atlantic*","title":"The Gilded Age of Trump Begins Now"},{"text":"Well and the cops wanted that to happen.

So tired of the sane washing","title":"Elon Musk appears to Sieg Heil at Trump inauguration"},{"text":"There is no longer a place for disbelief. This is a nazi regime. They want nazi things. They were given power by the people to explicitly do nazi things. They told you they would do nazi things. They are now going to do nazi things.Why are we still pretending otherwise? What does naivete give you? A tiny pearl of comfort in and amongst the boots thudding on the pavement outside?Denial will not keep you or your family safe. Delusion will not spare you from what is to come.For ten years we have warned of this and for ten years people have sanewashed these nazi fucks and downplayed their nazi intentions and every other ridiculous emotional salve to try and ignore the plain and obvious facts that these people are nazis and they are intending to do nazi things.This is what is happening. The time for pretending and disbelieving and hoping and all that other fucking garbage is over. The nazis won. The bad guys are here.If you want to understand what's happening here, specifically, Elon Musk knows Donald Trump is a walking corpse and he's intentionally trying to steal the nazi zeitgeist from him. He continually steals the spotlight by going further nazi than Trump, by soaking up the attention, and now by signalling to all the nazi militias out there that \\"he's their guy\\". He can't (yet) legally become President, but he's going to continue to leech all the attention and spotlight away from Donald Trump and try to capture his base, because Donald Trump's one mini-stroke away from being weekend-at-Bernie and Musk knows it and is making moves.That's what this is. A myopic powerplay by a emotionally dead sociopath to steal a cultural movement. That's why he bought Twitter, that's why he helped steal the election for Trump, and now he's trying to win over the hearts and minds of all the nazi militias out there so that Donald Trump and his handlers can't simply cart Musk away when he irritates the shit out of them.Do you remember the odd PA reference Trump dropped the other day? Which sounded suspiciously as though he were throwing Musk under the bus for illegal activity in PA? That's Trump's version of warning Elon to stay in his place, less the long arm of justice find him for trying to hog the spotlight.So now we have a game of chicken by two emotionally dead billionaire fucks with the maturity of a ten year old. Go look at the front page of reddit right now. See any pictures of Trump? Nope. It's wall-to-wall Elon. He's capturing and soaking up all the attention, because that's how he do. He knows exactly what he's doing and he's doing it on purpose.This was all *painfully* fucking obvious before the election. We warned and warned and America did not fucking listen because America is largely a nation of emotional infants that purposefully choose to drown reality away in propaganda so they don't have to reconcile with the reality in front of them. Is Elon Musk a \\"true believer?\\" No. None of these people on the stage are true believers in anything other than themselves. If there's a nazi zeitgeist that offers them power, they'll jump on it. They don't give a fuck. They do not see you or anyone else around them as human beings. They are gigantic goldfish with infinitely short memories gorging on endless wealth and capital and they'll put you in fucking camps if it gave them a nickel.

You can bury your fucking head in the sand and sanewash it and try and wave it away but today a convicted felon and Nazi was sworn in as President, surrounded by oligarchs and a cadre of other nazis, and the richest person in the world gave a nazi fucking salute to the crowd, turned around and gave another to Donald Trump.That happened.

If a \\"rally\\" was just a bunch of looters and one guy was saying something about George Floyd while it's happening, that's another thing.  This is clearly like the latter case.Clearly at some point if a rally has enough bad people then you would in fact criticize anyone who was part of it.  I can't give you an exact number.  But in this case not only was it organized by white nationalists (I already posted the link to the Wiki article of the guy who got a permit), not only were they chanting white nationalist slogans - you haven't even pointed to a *single person* who was there doing anything *other* than the racist stuff.Wikipedia explicitly prohibits the use of primary sources as references for its articles. It's not an authoritative source and can not be used to prove any claim. As such, you have yet to prove that the Charlottesville rally was organized by white nationalists.Further, your argument that if a rally or protest had enough bad people in attendance, one must criticize everyone who attended it, doesn't seem to justify assuming that everyone at said event is a part of the bad group of people. Why should I assume that just because one group of people attend a public event, everyone at the said event is a part of that group?It's also a completely subjective way to measure whether the attendees were all good people or bad people. What number you might feel is enough bad people attending an event to criticize all attendees is not the same as what number someone else might feel is enough. This would mean that one can't argue that one event can be criticized, but another can't; because there is no way to objectively determine which event had enough bad people in attendance to make it condemnable.","title":"CMV: Trump Praised White Nationalists At Charlottesville"},{"text":"Engaging earnestly with bad faith actors is a trap.","title":"Trump preparing sweeping pardons for Jan. 6 defendants, including hundreds convicted of violent attacks"},{"text":"Ah, we found the maga in r/politics.

India's carbon emissions are also beginning a curve of significant increase as well.Okay, now tell me: What percentage of those emissions are created making products that are sold to American consumers? Or used by American companies? That's the problem. Because Americans didn't decrease their carbon footprint, anymore than they decreased their reliance on industrial pollution. They simply outsourced the worst, dirtiest and most toxic work out of the country because it was cheaper to dump pollution in China than to pay to prevent it in America. The US could **absolutely** address this. It would just require putting their boot on the necks of companies doing business in America and requiring the products to meet certain standards to be sold. If the US can enforce sanctions on Iran, they can slap a carbon tax on items created in regions that pollute until those areas lose their competitive advantage or push for green energy. This is a deeper problem. America's addiction to low-priced shit has led to a situation where, instead of addressing abuses, they just export them and hope no one notices.

Obama, Bush, Clinton, and Reagan did (Biden, Cheney, Gore, Bush Shr) but there isn't a rule against it.Jefferson was the 3rd president of the US and had Burr as his VP the first term and Clinton as his 2nd VP even though Burr was alive at the time. So that counts as +1 presidents but +2 VPsThen you had FDR who served 4 consecutive terms so he was only the 32nd president of the US, but he had John Nance Garner for 2 terms, Wallace for 1 term, and then Truman. So it's 1 president, but he had 3 vice presidents.","title":"Donald Trump officially sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, JD Vance as the 50th Vice-President"},{"text":"I have no clue what he meant.

It's probably going to be important to make new words, just because of the confusion this causes. There are typically 2 sexes, though there are many very legitimate exceptions. Those sexes are defined in a series of genetic and phenotypic traits. I want to emphasize, just because you do not fit male or female, does not mean you have a disorder. Genetics is complicated, and variations happen, that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with these people. They are no less human, they are not mutants, they are not freaks. It's just uncommon. Just like having red hair is uncommon, though in this case it's quite a bit more rare. There are any number of genders dependant on society. 2 is common in western tradition, because gender are the taught cultural norms we ascribe to specific sex characteristics, typically phenotypic characteristics, not genetic ones. Very few people actually interact with your genes on a regular basis as it turns out. There are a literal undefined number of gender identities, though. Gender identity is a personal way of categorizing yourself, so there is a number of gender identities equal to the number of humans at any given time. 2 may be similar, but they won't be the same. These would be the personal characteristics that you ascribe to the genders as set by society, for example, some people may think it is manly to mow the lawn, others may think that any form of housework, lawn mowing included, is not manly. Neither is incorrect. Then based on whether or not they feel they do enough \\"Manly\\" things, they would determine \\"Do I feel manly?\\" If the answer is yes, their gender identity is man, but maybe the person across the street does exactly the same stuff, but their personal schema, their categorization of traits, doesn't really align with their behavior. They may feel unconscious, maybe they are male, and want to be a man, but they don't feel manly enough. Their gender identity and their sex do not align. In this case, if severe enough, you might provide them with gender affirming care, because not feeling manly enough in our society can be EXTREMELY stress inducing. I haven't touched how being trans fits into this, because personally I am extremely depressed that our culture has taken upon itself to police people's identities, when they don't even understand what is being policed.","title":"F**k trump that is all"},{"text":"","title":"VIDEO: AOC Says She Will Not Attend Donald Trumps Inauguration Because I Dont Celebrate Rapists"},{"text":"Itll never happen, the weapons lobby pays too much money for that meal ticket to end.","title":"Trump invited the world's richest billionaire oligarchs to sit at the center of his inauguration, showing you what your even darker future will look like at the beginning of the fourth decade of 21st century, with the direct establishment of the new corporate feudalism"},{"text":"Time for white Christian nationalist to once again move the goal post ??I added this comment to r/pics for same posting and was banned lol.","title":"Trump fails to place hand on Bible when being sworn into office"},{"text":"No, because in middle school lunchrooms wed call him the r word.","title":"Awkward Moment Donald Trump Leans in for Kiss with Wife Melania Trump Ahead of Inauguration"},{"text":"Screw you, hermaphrodites./s","title":"Donald Trump to declare federal government recognizes two sexes - male and female"},{"text":"Trump has a mandate, not with voters, but the GOP as a whole party.

His theory was that if you left really obvious code violations like that out in plain sight, the inspector would give you a warning and a slap on one wrist and since they felt like they had done their job, they would leave before spotting the truly dangerous stuff that couldve burned down the whole city block.Thats the long way of saying, this is all part of their strategy. Distract people with stuff thats of no consequence butll really irritate them so they arent paying attention to the real godawful stuff they have planned.The only silver lining is thatll bite off way more than they can chew, in a few hundred directions at once, many of which will end up in court challenges, and theyll spend a lot more time disorganized and running around in a panic instead of actually committing to getting specific initiatives across the finish line.","title":"Trump will rename Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America' among 1st executive orders"},{"text":"Its an odd statement.

History is full of examples where the majority got things wrong. Segregation was once widely accepted. Popularity doesnt make something right. The moral consequences matter far more.The idea that the Pope or the Church has no right to criticize because of their past is like saying, You cant call this out because youve done wrong, too. Even if the Church has made serious mistakes, that doesnt invalidate the Popes point. His criticism is focused on the human cost of these policies, not on defending the Churchs reputation.If you disagree with his position, thats fine, but lets discuss the issue itself: Is it ethical to make vulnerable people pay the price for systemic problems?

This suggests that, at present, human labor remains essential for harvesting delicate crops, as fully autonomous solutions are still emerging.It talks about how robots are becoming increasingly capable in areas like weeding, planting, and monitoring, but also acknowledges that harvesting delicate crops like grapes or strawberries remains a major challenge due to the risk of damage. It supports the point that for now, humans are still essential for handling these crops effectively.

As it stands, [the U.S. accounts for 11.25% of all CO2 emissions as of 2023, with China accounting for 30%](https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2024), with [China's carbon emissions increasing at breakneck speed](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country) whereas U.S. total carbon emissions have been declining since 2005. India's carbon emissions are also beginning a curve of significant increase as well. We will not convince the CCP to reduce their carbon footprint regardless of what we do, and it would be foolish to do anything that would hurt our global standing or economy in order to try and prevent the effects of climate change, which we will be facing even if we completely decarbonized the U.S. At this point, low oil prices and increased oil supply stands to hurt other oil exporting nations globally - like Russia and Iran - while also more oil exports will make it possible increase other nation's dependence on the U.S. if we were to increase our oil exports. Increasing our soft power especially in comparison to the likes of OPEC and OPEC+. So, I'm not as upset about this as others are, we are ultimately in a prisoner's dilemma situation with regards to climate change, the CCP isn't going to cooperate.

This is the point CATO has made before and I think it's an important one https://www.cato.org/commentary/birthright-citizenship-constitutional-mandate. But this distinction makes no difference. If subject to the jurisdiction thereof refers to aliens who are subject to U.S. laws, it does not matter if the parents are in the country legally. The reason such people are called illegal aliens is that they are subject to U.S. law, and not in compliance with them.Foreign diplomats, enemy soldiers occupying US land and some children born on native land (although this last one was later rectified in 1924) are the only exceptions laid out in and only because those groups weren't subject to US jurisdiction. The only way around this is to frame them as invaders. But as James Madison put it invasion is an operation of war.So what you're basically forced to say is these illegal immigrants are foreign invaders waging war. Maybe that's the point.

What you want me to do is provide evidence that some of them were not. Correct? Anticipating the futility of this, Id like to establish exactly what you would need to see. I can certainly show you images or clips of people at that event who are not wearing, carrying, or chanting anything related to white supremacy. But I somehow suspect thats not going to cut it, because you believe by default that anyone there was indeed a white supremacist, regardless of what they might look like or what theyre doing at the exact moment they were on film. Do you need to see footage of someone in the rally explicitly stating that they condemn white supremacy? Even if I could find such a clip, it doesnt seem like that would do the trick either, because Trump doing precisely that has had no effect on you. You will just retort that their very presence at the rally means they must be a white supremacist, and that their statement is not genuine. So, youve basically setup a syllogism which makes disconfirming your claim impossible. Its circular and self-reinforcing. Id argue that its you who is making the affirmative claim without sufficient evidence. Its implausible that every person at that event was a white supremacist. How do you know that to be the case. Finally, even if every single person there actually was a white supremacist, its clear that Trump thought there were others there who were not. A far simpler explanation would be that he was simply mistaken. Your alternative is that within the span of a few moments he strongly condemned white supremacists, and then defended those very same white supremacists, despite the fact that he explicitly said those were not the people he was defending. Thats a hell of a lot of mental gymnastics to jump through just to be able to call Trump a white supremacist, when we already have thousands of legitimate and verifiable reasons to condemn him.Your analogy is not applicable. Your claim is that Trump praised white supremacists. He simply did not do that. In fact, he explicitly did the opposite. This isnt a claim about what did or didnt happen at the event. Its not a claim about who was or wasnt there. Its a claim about something Trump is alleged to have stated, which he did not state.","title":"CMV: Trump Praised White Nationalists At Charlottesville"},{"text":"FUCKING W I don't know how as a society we got to the point where we actually believe there were more than two","title":"TRUMP: It will be the officially policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female."},{"text":"Cool.

At heart hes just a doddering old pervert who will agree with whomever flatters him the most and gives him the most money. He doesnt have a coherent policy. The greatest danger he poses is how much he emboldens his followers. If he dropped over dead from a Big Mac Attack tomorrow, things would only get worse, because his followers could keep doing things in his name without even having to bother with him doing anything. \\nProject 2025 isnt his policy- its a wish list of policies that people think they can get him to sign off on, and some of those are about to be enacted right away. The civil service is about to be gutted. Do you want to see the local VA clinic run not by experienced personnel, but by randos who happened to donate $20,000 to the campaign? Thats not a stretch, and would in fact be a return to the patronage system that used to run rampant. The other part of the danger he poses is that his movement means that there is no sensible guardrail within the GOP anymore. There are plenty of republicans who know that mass immigrant roundups and deportations will cause more harm than good, but if anyone with actual power said so theyd be run out of town. Plenty of people know that tariffs dont work (and certainly dont function the way he says), but Trump is surrounded by too much insulation for them to be able to stop them. All he knows is that he is immune from consequences.His cabinet is an even worse problem. He is appointing people all over the place whose loyalty is to him and not the Constitution. What happens when this idiot hes propping up at DOD decides that only generals who kiss the ring can be promoted? What happens when our diplomats have to worry more about looking tough in Trumpworld instead of practicing diplomacy?Inaction can be just as dangerous as action. The GOP is already talking about forcing political concessions to get California any disaster relief. What happens when NYC gets hit by a big blizzard, and Trump/Congress demands a pardon from the governor of NY before sending them a dime? I dont think thats a stretch at all. Lastly, his rank-and-file followers- the folks who already got shut out of the inauguration - are driven by two things: grievance and identity. They want to go after people different from them so that they can blame those people for all the worlds ills. That was the whole strategy behind the lies about Haitian immigrants. Ive seen a ton of Trump supporters cheering not that life will get better, but that the lives of people they hate will get worse. Id be very pleased and surprised if we dont see another spike in hate crimes, including mass shootings like the one in Houston or the one in Buffalo.","title":"cmv: the best thing about trump is that he says a lot but doesnt follow through"},{"text":"If you dont like nationalist Christians taking over the US government, now is the time to play some division cards.

For example, a mother who is illegally in the United States is *objectively* under the jurisdiction of the US, as they are breaking one of its laws. A child born to this hypothetical mother is therefore a citizen, as they were born under the jurisdiction of the United States. If they weren't under US jurisdiction then they wouldn't be here illegally (since the US wouldn't have jurisdiction). It's a surprisingly robust conclusion for a single sentence written 160 years ago.The only *potential* argument against this, and I add this only because it's the only thing at all possible to argue, is foreign invaders are not subject to this provision and therefore because someone is here illegally, their children are not born American citizens. That's the only argument - here illegally = *literally* invading the US.I am not a lawyer, and any lawyer or knowledgeable person is very welcome to add context here. While I cannot imagine a court seriously considering someone here illegally, simply working and living, to be a *literal* foreign invader/adversary, that's the \\"legal\\" attack Trump and these dipshits are going to have to use to not be laughed out of court (and they still should be, because it's dumb as fuck).Thanks and continue bashing them for what they are, Soros bless","title":"Trump to sign sweeping executive actions on immigration, launch fight to end birthright citizenship | CNN Politics"},{"text":"Your Mexican neighbors are fine if they are not committing crimes and living normal lives.

Thats not how things are resolved.The Argentinian Pope, 88, whose family emigrated from Italy in the early 20th century, has frequently expressed sympathy and support for refugees and migrants.But the language he used in the interview on the eve of Mr Trumps inauguration was unusually forthright.The president has pledged to carry out the largest migrant deportation in US history, with post-inauguration raids reportedly set to?begin as soon as this week.It is not the first time that the Pope has criticised Mr Trump.In 2016, during Mr Trumps first electoral campaign, the Pope was asked about plans to build a wall along the border between the US and Mexico and replied that anyone promoting such a plan is not Christian.Several Catholic bishops in the US have criticised Trumps deportation plans, with the incoming archbishop of Washington DC, Cardinal Robert McElroy, saying such policies are incompatible with Catholic doctrine.On Monday, the Pope used more moderate and diplomatic language when he sent well wishes to the president-elect.It is my hope that under your leadership the American people will prosper and always strive to build a more just society, where there is no room for hatred, discrimination or exclusion, the pontiff wrote.He offered cordial greetings and the assurance of my prayers that Almighty God will grant you wisdom, strength and protection, and asked that God guide your efforts in promoting peace and reconciliation among peoples.**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/20/pope-trump-illegal-migrant-deportation-disgrace/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/20/pope-trump-illegal-migrant-deportation-disgrace/)","title":"Pope calls Trumps plan for mass deportation of illegal migrants a disgrace"},{"text":"Im not sure, its very possibly they will repeal it and instead make domestic partnerships more powerful or something like that.

Neither of the main two political parties are that popular and for the first time since the 1980s we've got a third party that could potentially form the next government in the form of Reform.

Our Prime Minister is more akin to the Speaker of the House in terms of being the Leader of Parliament. In the Westminster system the legislative house is far more important than it has become in the USA. Our executive is the King of Canada, represented by the Governor-General, which is a figurehead role with constitutional duties as we are a Westminster constitutional monarchy.  I think you're talking about Pierre Poilievre who is the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and is likely to be the next Prime Minister during our next session of Parliament. If the Conservatives win a majority of seats in the House of Commons, he'll be basically guaranteed the role. If the conservatives win a plurality of seate again (they actually have more seats than the governing Liberals), the current government will be invited by the Governor General to try and form a coalition government, if they fail, the Conservatives will be invited to do the same.

DOGE is intended to permit the gutting of programs and regulations serving everyday Americans and to expediate the interests of the rising American oligarchy.For example, DOGE seeks to slash regulation relating to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). DOGE seeks to cut benefit programs serving the poor, portraying the programs as rife with fraud and the recipients of benefits as lazy and undeserving. DOGE was calculated to bless tax cuts for the rich to \\"create economic growth\\" (i.e. the disproven trickle-down economics theory).Musk's DOGE was conceived to skirt disclosure requirements and vetting of China businessman Elon Musk, who has disqualifying ties to the CCP. For example, Musk's Tesla does 50% of its global manufacturing in Shanghai, China. This makes Musk subject to China influence.Musk is doing the bidding of Beijing on issues such as TikTok, Taiwan, H-1B visas, and tariffs.

But the fact he lies is how he got elected and now reelected. And then, the portion of things he does folow through on, those will almost all be bad.So, for example, maybe he said he'll do 100 things. Maybe he doesn't follow through on most of those things, but 20 of them, he does. Those 20 things will all be bad, or at least like 18-19 of them will be.

His approval ratings will benefit, and it will help Republicans in elections this year for states that have off-year elections, and it will help them in the midterms next year.On one hand, since most of his ideas are stupid and/or bad, it's good that most of them won't come to pass, but, on the other hand, his empty promises are how he came to power, and how he will attempt to buttress GOP power in the coming years. OTOH, it would probably be much better (for us) if he limited himself to things he can and will actually follow through on, because we'd have fewer distractions, his base wouldn't be as happy, and everyone could focus on the actual things he's doing, rather than getting distracted by the things he won't end up doing.","title":"cmv: the best thing about trump is that he says a lot but doesnt follow through"},{"text":"Next executive order- The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.","title":"Donald Trump to sign executive order today declaring that the United \\nStates recognizes only two genders: male and female, what do you think?"},{"text":"Thats odd.

Second, it would also likely require new resources for schools that include the change.  That means that states would have to provide new text books and new maps to schools that reflect the change.  Which would be bad and stupid because it would be a complete waste of money and would take away from funds going to something actually worthwhile instead of Trump's stupid vanity.Your example is silly.  The South Sea was named, according to Wiki, in 1513.  Magellan coined it The Pacific in 1520.  Just a difference of 7 years.  People used both names and at some point, Magellan's name became more commonplace than South Seas.  Now compare that to Gulf of Mexico, which has been called that since at least 1569.  For those counting at home that is 456 years.  Which, by all accounts, is more than 7 years.  The proposed name change did not come about organically by use as it largely did with the Pacific.  It was not something that was being pushed by people for decades (as might have been with Denali), and it isn't even something that we actually own entirely to be able to change the name (as with Denali).

For example, it's commonly believed that we can tell if someone is lying by observing nonverbal cues like fidgeting, gaze avoidance, etc. But extensive research shows that just isn't true:\\"Several decades of empirical research have shown that none of the non-verbal signs assumed by psychological folklore to be diagnostic of lying vs. truthfulness is in fact a reliable indicator of lying vs. truthfulness.\\" ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7767987/))Moreover, there's extensive research suggesting that eyewitnesses' memories can be much more faulty than we'd expect. E.g., if you show someone a car running a stop sign and hitting a pedestrian, then ask them about \\"what happened when the car went through the yield sign\\" (i.e., misidentifying the sign as a yield sign), then ask them whether the sign was a stop sign or a yield sign, they're somewhat likely to pick the yield sign.Likewise, eyewitnesses to a crime are at risk of providing inaccurate information under a variety of circumstances, e.g., when presented with a photo spread of suspects, they're somewhat likely to pick the wrong suspect when the suspect was of a race other than their own, presumably because their brain is less expert and identifying faces of people of other races ([source](https://nobaproject.com/modules/eyewitness-testimony-and-memory-biases)).","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Yeah.

Trump won in 2016 in the face of \\"establishment Republicans\\" and \\"traditional conservatives,\\" and as a relative political outsider, many of the people he hired for cabinet and advisory positions were members of these factions. As such, many of them held him back, quietly redirected him, or distracted him with other projects. Mike Pence certified the election, for one big example.   \\nOver those four years, and the four years in between, Trump has redefined the Republican party in a part of his own image. He has financially and politically supported \\"MAGA Republicans\\" in primary elections across the country, often unseating Republicans who he perceived as not loyal enough to him. Many other republicans, J.D. Vance among them, saw which way the wind was blowing and started to tow the Trump line more and more. His new team, as well as people in judicial and other institutional positions, are no longer opposed to him, but are instead full-throated Trump loyalists. When Trump wants something done this time around, there's a much higher chance it will actually happen. [Project 2025](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do), among other things, aims to gut many of the institutional civil servant positions who opposed Trump initiatives during his first term, further clearing the way for him to do as he likes.  \\nI found this [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/16/g-s1-34532/trump-cabinet-loyalists) which makes many of these same points if you want to read further.","title":"cmv: the best thing about trump is that he says a lot but doesnt follow through"},{"text":"Has Trump gone to the golf course yet?
