Be there as NRX is introduced to the MAGA brain trust. Be there as MAGA meets the Tech Right.NRX stands for neoreactionary and is used as a shorthand for the Dark Enlightenment, a far-right movement whose adherents are often as explicit in their distaste for democracy as they are in their reverence for fascism and monarchism.One of Passage Press biggest authors is Dark Enlightenment figurehead Curtis Yarvin. The former Silicon Valley programmer blogged for years under the pen name Mencius Moldbug before emerging as a kind of court philosopher for reactionary tech billionaires and prominent MAGA movers and shakers (including Vice President-elect JD Vance).Yarvin has advocated for a national CEO, [or] whats called a dictator to be in charge of America. He is scheduled to attend the Coronation Ball, according to a post from Passage Press, as are Jack Posobiec, Mike Cernovich, Christopher Rufo, Steve Bannon, Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova.Article about it: https://ca.news.yahoo.com/far-having-coronation-ball-watergate-220915112.htmlLink to event: https://passage.press/products/the-2025-coronation-ball","title":"Progressives Say \\"Billionaires' Row\\" at Inauguration Ceremony Shows True Winners of Trump Agenda | \\"Trump's White House is government by the billionaires, for the billionaires,\\" said the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus."},{"text":"Even fucking violent rioters that were beating and crushing cops got off.

The problem was Bidens decision to widely stop using both detention and credible fear interviews for people crossing the border. I personally believe the lack of CFIs was as issue if available manpower - which itself could be an argument in favor of detention, in that people should perhaps be held in custody while they wait for a process to play out.Between Title 42 and the recent-ish 1,500 people per day executive order (cant recall the name), it actually was catch and release at the border, to the tune of well over a million people. Thats not misinformation. The truth of the matter is that some of these folks have experienced persecution and merit humanitarian relief, but significant amounts do have non-meritorious or frivolous claims. The immigration court dockets have now exploded with cases (over 5 years to a final adjudication in some cities), and the majority of migrants will bomb and lose when that day comes. So IMO its not so much an issue with asylum law - the current mess is all due to law enforcement decisions.And also, we desperately need more immigration judges, ICE attorneys, and USCIS asylum officers. Its been the case for a while that Congress needs to flush the DOJ and DHS with cash to properly handle the migrant crisis.

I heard their dinner-table conversations. I listened to them at Christmas and birthdays. I know their dogwhistles and their little games.Let me tell you a story, however, about one I met as an adult.We had a neighborCoh, lets call him Gene. (This was NOT HIS NAME, and he has passed on now.) Gene was a terrible human being. He was retired, watched Fox all day, and took care of all the stray cats in the neighborhood.Gene drank the Fox Flavr-Aid early and he drank it DEEP. When we moved to the neighborhood, Gene came by with a plate of cookies hed baked himself and told a joke that made it clear he considered me a whore since Im a single mother.Gene was an elderly white man. I could have snapped him in half (and considered it more than once, truth be told). And Gene loved talking over the back fence. Since Im white, he thought I was secretly on his side.One afternoon, Gene mentioned whatever the current outrage du jour on Fox was. (This was well before Der Turmpenfuhrers reign, by the way.) He fixed me with his baleful, watery stare, and said, Obama was born in Kenya, you know.Normally, I just turned around and walked away when Gene said that shit. I showed him my back, hoping to make it clear I was not, in fact, secretly on his side. But that day I had read @SlacktivistFred about IndigNation.So I dead-eyed Gene and said, You dont really believe that. I know you dont. I will never forget the look that crossed his face. Because it was *familiar*.It was the same shit-eating grin my racist stepfather used to wear when spouting Rush Limbaugh dittohead shit at the dinner table. It was the same wink-wink-nudge-nudge all the fucking white supremacists and Satanic Panic assholes give.Gene absolutely, positively did not believe that Obama was born in Kenya. But he would continue to say he believed it, no matter who asked, to the end of his life. Because he thought saying he believed it *absolved him of responsibility*.And since Gene was firmly convinced saying it absolved him, he thought every other white person in the world secretly thought that way and agreed with him, no matter what *they* said.Now. There are pollsters asking violent white supremacists and their fellow travelers who was responsible for yesterdays attack1 on state and federal Capitol buildings. The people saying Biden was responsible absolutely know its not true.But admitting as much would require them to admit their own culpability, falsity, racism, and poisonous rancid ugliness. And that is something no white supremacist will do, just like no domestic abuser will admit they are a piece of shit domestic abuser.Domestic abusers, white supremacists, and religious bigots all operate off the same thin but very useful playbook that exploits other peoples politeness and (Ive got to say it) civility.Obama was born in Kenya. She provoked me, I had to hit her. Bidens followers stormed the Capitol. It was Antifa. I thought that black child was going to shoot me. These are all the same species of lie, and they serve the same purposeCto absolve the speaker.My ex-husband used to repeat the Zen saying, You cannot wake up someone who is pretending to be asleep. You cannot engage with white supremacists by giving them the fig leaf of pretending to believe their self-serving lies.This is why malignant narcissists and sociopaths do so well in white supremacist circles. There is no truth but what serves them at the moment, though they perfectly understand the concept of rules and consequences.They dont mind breaking rules; what they mind is GETTING CAUGHT. For the fellow-travelers who are not malignant narcissists, the lies they claim to believe make it possible for them to consider themselves good people.Which is why its so critical for other white people not to fall for that bullshit. To show our repugnance, to say You know thats not true, and to make it clear there are CONSEQUENCES for being a fucking white supremacist.Right now, white Democrats in Congress, attempting to be civil, are letting malignant narcissists and white supremacists get away with it. They are letting Gene spout his bullshit without consequences. And it will only allow the motherfuckers to continue.The only thing that will stop them, from Papaya Pol Pot down to ones cracker neighbor (who might take care of all the cats in the neighborhood, nice fellow if youre not brown, right?) is CONSEQUENCES. Social, financial, legal, and otherwise.To pretend otherwise is to give violent malignant narcissists and white supremacists cover. They will use you for cover and discard you without a second thought.For those of you wondering about Gene, he has passed from this world, and I can only hope he has some consequences in the next. He didnt dare do much to meCI was an adult, I was a neighbor, and Im whiteCbut I wonder how much harm he caused to others.Because it bears repeating, I will. The white supremacists saying Biden supporters/antifa attacked the Capitol do not believe their own bullshit. And neither should you.","title":"Trump pardons roughly 1,500 criminal defendants charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack"},{"text":"Thatll be on Day 2","title":"Trump pardons roughly 1,500 criminal defendants charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack"},{"text":"Why not support US renewable companies.

After the temporary shut down the algorithm seems to have changed, specific types of searches have been suppressed without misspelling words, and a lot of liberal leaning accounts were closed. At the same time the format of Instagram suddenly changed to look more like TikTok on peoples profiles. TikTok has also listed thousands of new jobs on LinkedIn, but in the same 24 hours that the app shut down they added job listings for a new division of TikTok called USDS (US Data Security).

For most of the Biden administration, Remain in Mexico was kept in place (more on that in a moment). But even after that ended, most asylum seekers did still either end up in detention or were swiftly deported for not having solid enough claims.Second, the alternative to residing in the US is Remain in Mexico. While this policy was in effect, asylum seekers were targeted by criminal syndicates along the Mexican border. There was widespread crime, rape, and murder, which then caused people waiting for their asylum adjutication to just give up and pursue illegal immigration.Remain in Mexico is not the answer. The answer is comprehensive immigration reform and actually devoting the resources to our immigration system so that there is not a backlog of asylum cases in the first place.

In a 1983 lecture, Bezmenov explained how the Soviet Union had a very long-term four-step program for destroying America from the inside out.The overarching objective of these tactics, they say, is to weaken a society from within, making it vulnerable to influence or control without a direct military confrontation.?[Bezmenov](https://asharangappa.substack.com/p/class-5-the-active-measures-long?ref=theframelab.org)?emphasized that success depends on the subverter's ability to keep the society in the dark about the manipulation process until its too late.* 1.?**Demoralization:**?This phase involves the long-term process of demoralizing the target nation. Tactics include the infiltration of, and influence on, the target nations educational system, media, politics, and culture. The aim: to alter the populations perceptions of reality, creating a generation of citizens who are unable to recognize or resist the subverters ideology or objectives.\\n* 2.?**Destabilization**:?In this stage, the focus shifts to creating instability. This can be done through the manipulation of the target nations economy, politics, and society. Strategies include sowing discord, social unrest and polarization, usually by exploiting existing divisions. This phase might involve supporting radical groups, spreading disinformation, and undermining trust in the government and institutions.\\n* 3.?**Crisis:**?This stage is characterized by a significant upheaval or crisis that leads to a state of emergency or a situation that destabilizes society to a critical point. The crisis could take various forms, including economic collapses, riots, or significant political upheavals, leading to a high uncertainty and fear among the population.\\n* 4.?**Normalization:**?After the crisis, the stage of normalization begins, where the subverter seeks to establish a new status quo. This often involves the implementation of policies and measures that solidify the subverters control or influence over society, supposedly to restore order. The subverters power and the oppressive new conditions become normal.\\n* source:?[Democratic Subversion](https://www.beyondintractability.org/newsletter-245)","title":"Trump Withdraws U.S. from World Health Organization"},{"text":"He didn't.

A message showed it was no longer available, and existing appointments have been cancelled.That dashed the hopes of migrants waiting in Mexico for appointments with US authorities, with many left stranded far from their home countries with few viable methods for crossing into the US legally.Trumps moves are aimed at targeting millions of foreigners for expulsion and keeping out migrants who dont have permission to come in, part of fulfilling his pledge to lead the largest mass deportation effort in US history. One edict redefined who is eligible to be a US citizen at birth, while another ordered the deployment of active duty military and National Guard troops to the border in an effort to clamp down on illegal immigration.[You can read the full story here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/millions-targeted-for-immediate-expulsion-as-trump-fulfills-vow)","title":"Millions Targeted for Immediate Expulsion as Trump Fulfills Vow"},{"text":"Its utterly bizarre youre not understanding this.Please point to me when the last administration conned Americans out of 50 billion dollars.

Prohibited was anything involuntary that could harm a third party.Ross was not convicted of selling drugs or illegal items himself, but was held responsible for what others sold on the site.SMEARED WITH FALSE ALLEGATIONSRoss Ulbricht was smeared with false, unprosecuted allegations of planning murder-for-hire that much of the media amplified through inaccurate and sensationalized reporting. The allegations were never charged at trial, never proven, never submitted to, or ruled on by, a jury, and eventually dismissed with prejudice.Ross consistently denied the allegations (which relied on anonymous online chats never proven to have been authored by him) and those who know him never believed them. The only alleged victim ever identified, Curtis Green, is a fervent supporter of Rosss clemency.EXTREME SENTENCING DISPARITYRoss Ulbrichts sentence implies that he can never be given a second chance for as long as he lives, regardless of his rehabilitation and attempts to make amends.The average prison sentence all the other defendants related to the case received is six years, including the actual drug sellers, the men who helped run Silk Road, and the men behind Silk Road 2.0, a larger replica. All but one are free today.A sentence of double life, plus forty years, without parole is unjustifiable. Decades of incarceration for Ross Ulbricht would be a great tragedy and serve no useful purpose.C Diane Goldstein. Exec.

Comprehend what you're reading.Lendup is a good example of the CFPB shutting down a financial business that wasn't doing a good job. However there are other examples of why the CFPB is problematic. Small business banks don't necessarily have the resources to handle tons of regulations. Big banks lobby the government to increase CFPB regulations that make it easier for them to maintain control of the market. Startups trying to disrupt the financial industry and make it more efficient hit a bunch of CFPB regulations that make things worse. If you need an example, look at how bank transfers still take 2-3 days to occur, despite being technically possible within seconds. The big banks profit off the enforced inefficiencies.

You can have a perfect system. So every single law is a balance between people who shouldn't be in prison and people who shouldn't be free. That is the unfortunate nature of law. So you have to consider these things when you make a law. How many people are currently in the 4 possible boxes of, in prisons should be, in prison shouldn't be, out of prison should be, out of prison shouldn't be.You then you have to ask what the chance of someone reoffending is if they arent dealt with, and how damaging that would be. And what kind of cultural message you want to send. In this case the best stats we have are that well over 90% of women will be sexually assaulted as defined by the law at least once by the age of 25 (the numbers are worse than that but these are the numbers that are pretty undisputable). The number also suggest 99% of people who commit sexual assault never spend a day behind bars.In those situations its clear that people know full well that they can do these things with effective impunity.

This is a permanent scar on the country. \\n- in 1918, the Spanish flu killed 675,000 Americans. By comparison, with more technology and access to information, in 2020, COVID had killed 440,000 American lives. The next closest pandemic, was the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 which only killed 38,000 Americans. This is what happens when useless leaders cant properly direct. The 50 years following 1918, huge gains were made in preparedness owing to the minimal casualties of the above pandemic. Another 50 years later, with the eradication of the tools and services in place for such an event, Trump punted the country into disarray and a huge death toll followed. \\n- he is the only president in history to stare at an eclipse without proper eye wear. Why? Because he doesnt believe in science or what experts have to say. Need proof: look at his picks for positions of high office. These are rolls that govern some of the most high stakes positions in the country. Have you tried getting a job with the government? You need a background check to work as a mail room clerk. But with this buffoon, all thats important is his word - which he cant even keep. Need proof: read about his stance on Tik-Tok. He is bought and sold as cheaply as a tribute of a million dollars. Hes fickle and spineless. \\n- regardless of whether he is joking or not, he suggested that people ingest bleach as a deterrent for COVID. In the moment, which requires a degree of seriousness and poise, his brain reached for the most inane and mundane question. The quality of a good leader is in the composure they express in a moment of gravity. His is absolute mindlessness. \\n- when faced with the atrocities of a hurricane roaring down on Puerto Rico and Florida, to make his point heard, he drew, like a weak-willed child an extra arc using a black sharpie on a meteorological chart to demonstrate his ignorance and pride. Qualities one should not extolled as virtue when presiding over a catastrophe. \\n- imagine having a team you need to coach. The manager of the organization keeps laying off key members of the management for personal reasons but never re-hires so the positions stay vacant. Worse, some players on the team defect and they get replaced by junior level players from a bantam league. As a coach, you are asked to win this years cup, but there is no way for you to do so as the organization is missing the right people to handle logistics, keep the team running and the players fit. With each passing day, members of the management team are arguing and as the coach you find out they are using performance enhancement drugs to get around the day. Players and management alike. Its now the end of the season and you know there is no way the team will be winning anything, no MVP, no draft picks, no rings, no cup. Its been a dumpster fire for the whole season, and as you read the team org chart and contracts, you find out the directing manager will be there for another three years. Its in his ironclad agreement - he cant be removed for four years. THATS what the first Trump presidency was. And just like the city that is represented by this team, which blindly supported the team, America just asked for another four years. Would this EVER FLY for a sports Team? Why should it for a country?The fact is, this is a fucking joke and everyone whos got a brain can see it for what it is, except for those brain washed fans who think this team is #1.\\nNotes: Edits for clarity.","title":"Trump Makes History: First Convicted Felon To Take Oath As President"},{"text":"Hate crimes did go up under the first Trump admin.

The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests. The next Administration must end blind support for international organizations. If an international organization is effective and advances American interests, the United States should support it. **If an international organization is ineffective or does not support American interests, the United States should not support it.** Those that are effective will still require constant pressure from U.S. officials to ensure that they remain effective. Serious consideration should also be given to withdrawal from organizations that no longer have value, quietly undermine U.S. interests or goals, or disproportionately rely on U.S. financial contributions to survive. **The Trump Administrations tough love approach to international organizations served American interests.

Typically, the Fed aims for a rate of around 2% inflation.I don't quite see what mechanism would cause actual deflation. Inflation is currently at a relatively healthy 2.9%, but that still means prices are rising; for prices to drop, we'd need something very unusual to occur. Trump has promised to set high tariffs, which would typically increase inflation, not decrease it, as imported goods would become more expensive.That being said: in the event that grocery prices undergo a significant and long-lasting drop within the next year, and the economy otherwise stays strong for a couple years after that... I would likely be forced to admit that all the experts I've listened to are deeply, deeply wrong about how inflation works, and Trump or those in his orbit likely know something I don't.What seems much more likely is that inflation will stay around 2 or 3 percent, and that over time, grocery prices will continue to rise, but at a slow enough rate that consumers *feel* them to be less expensive. (E.g., maybe a gallon of milk goes up from $3 to $3.10 in a year, but meanwhile wages are rising at a slightly faster rate than that, so we all feel like milk is getting just a bit cheaper.)If that happens... I won't be surprised, and I won't give credit to Trump. Inflation already dropped to 3% on Biden's watch, so this would just be continuing the pattern that already started under Biden.One thing I *would* give Trump credit for: if he implements a policy that drastically decreases the rate at which home prices are increasing in the US, or the cost of a college education. I haven't seen a policy proposal from him that I think would do that, but that'd be pretty great.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"But I thought those were antifa!","title":"Trump grants mass pardons to 1,500 January 6 US Capitol rioters"},{"text":"Enjoy white supremacy ElectronicBoat5205 you asked for 1864, youre going to get it.","title":"Trump pardons roughly 1,500 criminal defendants charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack"},{"text":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the US to withdraw from the World Health Organization, a decision that would cut off one of the international aid and disease response groups largest funding sources.Details of the order, which was among a flurry of executive actions Trump signed Monday in the Oval Office, were not immediately available.Thats a big one, Trump said before signing the document.","title":"Trump Orders US to Withdraw From World Health Organization"},{"text":"If they can ignore the 14th amendment.

It's a much lower rate than actual citizens, and by quite a big margin. (400 arrests per 100,000 versus 1,000 for citizens). https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate That's 0.4% or 80,000 people. Your math was wrong in the first place, 25% is 5 million. So 80,000/5,000 agents, 16 per agent, 4 per year. That's 0.08 per week.Your math is hilariously wrongAnd I'm being generous with these numbers. You can't deport 20M people in 4 years, so you go get the worst of the worst and you leave the other folks alone.You're talking about 80,000 people. You wouldn't declare a national emergency over 80,000 people. ICE is absolutely going to just show up at Home Depot and start grabbing people. They've already started in fact.I'm trying real hard to have a good faith argument without coming off as a dick.Your numbers are off by orders of magnitude, so if this is what you call good faith, then there are only a few options - you're lying, you're not smart, you don't know what \\"good faith\\" means, or you're actually arguing in bad faith.But if I think the politician says stuff he won't/cant do, and you think he's honest about everything he says, then I'm not sure who is more naive.So again, what are we supposed to believe and what are we not?

(I used to live in Tigard for reference) Go somewhere a little more rural if you happen to live in either of those two counties. I just get a weird vibe from the Portland area even though Im kind of amused by it at the same time. I may be an odd duck though because I also realize almost all of the amenities are near Portland.
