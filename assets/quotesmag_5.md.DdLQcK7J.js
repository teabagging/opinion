Who writes your scripts?....The National InterestWhat all these blunders have in common is the neglect of Samuel Huntingtons insight that the postCCold War world was arranging itself along ethnic, religious and civilizational lines.By Huntingtons civilizational standard, Ukraine is a severely cleft country, divided internally along historical, geographic and religious lines, with western Ukraine firmly in the European corner and eastern Ukraine and Crimea firmly in the orbit of Orthodox Russia.Even though it was published years before the 2013 Ukrainian crisis, Huntingtons most famous book, The Clash of Civilizations, is rife with warnings about the dangers of the Ukrainian situation and predicts that Ukraine could split along its fault line into two separate entities, the eastern of which would merge with Russia. The issue of secession first came up with respect to Crimea.As Huntington was the most sagacious observer of the most likely changes in the postCCold War world order, we should carefully heed his advice on how to manage tinderboxes like Ukraine.Huntington, in fact, warned emphatically against provoking the Islamic world and argued for caution and diplomacy in cleft countries such as Ukraine.Alpha HistoryDuring the late 1960s and 1970s Huntington worked as a strategist and advisor for the United States government.He provided strategic advice on the Vietnam War, suggesting a campaign of defoliation and carpet-bombing that would force Vietnamese peasants into communities, thus undermining the influence of the Viet Cong....The GuardianSamuel Huntington.... was one of the most controversial of American political theorists. Where his friends and contemporaries Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, while authors of substantial works, were best remembered for holding high office, **Huntington was essentially an academic, a Harvard professor who worked incidentally as a consultant for the State Department, the National Security Council and the CIA under the Johnson and Carter administrations.**","title":"National security advisor Jake Sullivan says Biden told him to oversee a 'massive surge' of weapons deliveries to Ukraine before his term ends"},{"text":"eff that guy","title":"How dare Biden eat that pea...."},{"text":"So now you just making up charges?

Polis: Biden Put Family Ahead of US With Pardon"},{"text":"My point was that overturning a major piece of precedent every 60-50 years seems perfectly reasonable. Maybe every ten years. This court has overturned 6 major precedents in 6 years! And that's not to mention the other radical decisions its made. That was the point. If Dobbs were the only overhaul, it would be a different story, but it's a ton of other activist rulings pluse Dobbs. That said, there are two things to consider when considering Dobbs/Roe. One, why is it not reasonable for there to be a national-based right to a medical procedure like abortion? There is no movement to make each state decide whether people should be allowed to get prostate exams or mammograms. If one state decided to ban those procedureslet's say on the basis of modesty/belief that people should not be touched theresurely the SC would be open to ruling that that decision should fall under the per view of the individual and their doctor. Or would it be acceptable for residents of Virginia or Nevada or wherever to have to travel across state lines to see if they might have cancer? Second, is a court not supposed to consider it's impact on the people, on the politics? The Court basically in one day swooped its hands and took the right for a medical procedure away from millions of people. Even if you want to put that on individual state governments, the Court knew that there were trigger laws, lots of controversy, strong feelings on all sides. And still it decided that it was its job, despite the fact that it is unaccountable, politically biased, and unlikely to see any effects of its actions. Is that not the core of judicial activism? It could have made a stepping stone judgment, tightening the screws on Roe as conservative activists had tried to do for 50 years, but instead it decided that it was the power in America today. Not politicians, not the people, just 6 people in robes who think they know best. 1. The only way that it violates the 14th Amendment is if you subscribe to the belief in the harm of the impact, rather than the intent. The practice of affirmative action in admissions was intended to have a diverse class of students. That is a perfectly reasonable goal, lauded by the US military, by sociology (people with different experiences and perspectives make for a better whole), but the claim is that that intent, negatively impacted Asian applicants, who might have gotten in with a race-blind process. If you believe we should judge 14th Amendment issues based on harm/impact, rather than intent, that would mean more affirmative action (to address the harms borne by black Americans who are still far poorer than white or Asian Americans as a class). 2. Okay but in the case, Coach Kennedy prayed to the Christian god at his public school's football game half-times with other students and coaches. When the school board learned of it, they were willing to negotiate and said he could continue to pray in a less public setting as the middle of the field at half-time(despite him being, at that moment, a representative of a public school) or that the prayer would need to be student-led, without making students participate. He refused and continued to do his display of religiosity while being a public school coach. It caused a media circus and an incident where people felt like they were in real danger, but even then the school decided to put him on *paid* leave and simply to not renew his contract. The Supreme Court ruled that Coach Kennedy was in the right, the school was in the wrong. 3. I don't know what you're trying to say here. This court is the worst group of judicial activists since the 50s-60s. Even then, the court was trying to underline existing Constitutional law, not simply overturn precedents that they found politically frustrating. I don't expect this will make an impact on your view, but there is Fed Soc reality and then there is reality. You have to embrace the latter and spurn the former if you want to be a thoughtful person.","title":"CMV: Gorsuch is as good or better of a SC justice as Garland would have been"},{"text":"And the Palestinians.","title":"What will happen to Zelenskyys Ukraine once Trump gets elected?"},{"text":"This sub is cooked","title":"The plot thickens!

It wouldn't be hard to pressure just one, possibly two Republicans to break ranks with their party. And we the public can help. I remember watching the DNC and seeing shirts and signs that read \\"DEMOCRACY IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT\\", and that really stuck with me. Our elected officials are not completely beyond our reach, despite their attempts to get us to believe otherwise. They do respond to public pressure. As Napoleon Bonaparte once said,Public opinion is the one thermometer a monarch should constantly consult.\\nThat means communicating with them, regardless of what party they are with. When they do as they please and act how they act, every moment they are not bombarded with phone calls, emails, letters, and even office visits, is taken as consent. I read a piece by Molly Jong-Fast for Vanity Fair, where she says that if we give in to cynicism, if we expect our Senators to do nothing, then we are effectively giving them permission to do just that. So, get engaged. Personally, I find letters to be the most effective and efficient correspondence with Congresspeople. Good, old-fashioned letters, on real paper, delivered via USPS. They can be typed if you want, or handwritten if you want to give it a more personal touch. Make sure it is addressed directly to your Representative or Senator, in order to ensure that it is they who will read it, as it is a federal crime for anyone to open and read correspondence not directly addressed to them without the addressee's permission, and I'm sure no staffer/intern wants to risk their job by reading their boss's mail. Another helpful tip is to send multiple copies of the letter, one to their DC office, and the other to their office in your State(Senator)/District(Representative). If you wanna be extra spicy, send a copy to their home address, as well. It's public information and is guaranteed to get a response, as long as the contents of your letter are non-threatening and inoffensive.","title":"Fight of Our Lives: Jamie Raskin Moves to Shake Up Democratic Party"},{"text":"Daddy!

It would also disrupt agricultural production for a couple decades and lead to starvation in resource-strapped areas, but it would serve as a buffer for climate changeperhaps long enough for a sustainable solution to be implemented, if necessary. Its not ideal, but we have options.Id recommend checking out a sci-fi book called Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. As part of its plot, it optimistically explores humanitys response to a global cooling event that threatens to cause the extinction of humanity within about 13 years. Humans are capable of great things if push comes to shove.","title":"CMV: Our global society is turning to a dumpster-fire due to pollution, animal cruelty, fossil fuel extraction, political/social polarization, new technologies being used to commit unspeakable injustices, and other harms."},{"text":"Bullshit.

It's usually just added onto other more serious charges to either add some time onto the sentence or give the prosecutors something they can negotiate away. (Is he guilty?

An egalitarian, feminist society is superior to any type of patriarchy, but I think that the current mainstream of American masculinity is *especially* toxic and has traits and influences that differentiate it from other cultures.For one, emotional suppression has not always been the norm in male-dominated societies. If you look at Ancient Greece and Rome, for example, you can see that men there were not only expected to be psychotic businessmen or Gruff action heroes, but to experience the full range of human emotions. Sure, men were expected to have near full control over their families, but they were able to express emotions and were required to act somewhat honorably. If we applied modern American masculinity to the Greco-Roman world, instead of Alexander wept for there were no more worlds to conquer, wed have gotten Alexander was a true sigma and hustle his way to the Indus River without being a pussy ass bitchIm not idolizing the Greco-Roman world or saying that it was better than the modern world, not by a long shot. In addition to terrible inequality between the genders, there was also everything from slavery to no antibiotics. But I think that one thing that we can learn from their culture or many historical cultures is that in social interactions, it wasnt seen as cool or encouraged to just be a dick, at least not in the open like today. (In the context of their time I mean. Greco-Roman men still beat their wives and kept slaves, but there were standards to at least treat ones peers well in public.)What we see in modern American masculinity is a concerted, anti-intellectual, subversive movement among the manosphere to just be a dick. Like actively try to screw people over by hustling, flaunt your wealth, and just be what even many mainstream to right wing people in modern society would consider being an arrogant douchebag. It has influences like the cutthroat business culture of the 80s and internet culture more broadly, but I think that a lot of American men are falling down the right wing rabbit hole because it tells them that they are great for just existing, their only purpose in life is to make a ton of money and preserve that wealth while flaunting it, and that women and anyone that doesnt agree with you is not worth your time. Theyre just a cuck or a beta male so why bother?This isnt the first country or moment where being a terrible person is so openly encouraged, but I think that the manosphere is the most blatant. Even Southern slavers were believers in their own idea of chivalry as they perpetuated some of the worst crimes against humanity imaginable.This is what I dont know how to address. How do we get people to understand, no, you cant just be a dick? How do we get people to listen to us when they think that we are evil or degenerate? Theres probably stuff we can do like community-oriented solutions, but this problem will take so long to scrub from our culture.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 2, 2024"},{"text":"He's put the Democratic Party back on its feet in Wisconsin after years of Republican dominance in both houses of the state legislature due to gerrymandering.

Again, you have the right to be completely detached from the politcal world. That's the beauty of our system. No one is required to participate if they so chose.\\"A political system that is not corrupted by money\\" is antithetical to liberalism. Liberalism doesn't consider it to be corruption. That's capitalism at play and it's awesome. What I'm seeing is that you greatly value democracy, but you are neither particularly informed on what liberalism is nor do you care for it.

He actually didnt lose money all together though, only because a couple pieces were actually a good buy(two peter max's skyrocketed in price). The dalis weren't though. He was primarily bidding to just buy kincaids for my mom and peter max/dali for himself(as a stoner boomer max was his favorite artist, same reason he got the dali's because he was the same age as chapman as the generation that revered him). This wasn't art worth $1000s to invest in, but $100 signed prints to hang in the living room. And even though many were overpriced, he still got 75% of his money back on most and made out good on a couple.\\nAlso, my mom was a big travel agent(some major clients were mickey mantle and subway corp), so the entire trip was free, even drinks, and we got access to all the higher class executive things a buisinessman or celeb would get since they wanted to give my mom the best experience so she'd sell their cruise(like the auction was only around 100 people invite, it wasnt open to the whole cruise like the big ones in the theater, a majority of items were sold on first bid.) So my dad would always go HAM on cruises. Especially all the tax free stuff like jewelry. This was also when the economy was rocking so it was about excess not investment, my dad got the things that he liked for himself, not to become an art dealer lol.?\\nMy dad was a working class factory guy but because he worked for a military contractor(painted the first sikorsky blackhawk) he made huge money so he constantly bought expensive things, then got sick of it, sold it, and got something else. You shoulda seen his record collection, had a butcher cover stereo in shrink, dsotm light blue triangle signed by all of pink floyd, NM UK piper, pretty much every classic rock grail imaginable, his collection at its height is easily $100k+ today. Same with cars, he had a super nice z06 when I was a kid, was even a \\"calender car\\" in camero magazine.?\\n?\\nNot to go on a tangent responding to a joke, just he passed tragically this year and I'm at that post grief stage where I like remembering him. Not saying that to be the guy that's like \\"oh you made a your mom joke? Well my mom's dead so thanks asshole\\", your observation is totally accurate lol, just explaining why I wrote this.?\\nBut that's besides the point, chapman having dali's on him is not at all evidence he was paid in them to assasinate him. Infact, if anything it'd be the norm for a dude like Chapman to have some dali's as bookmarks, since they were absolutely flooding the mainstream market, like a kincaid for suburban housewives. Or a Stanley cup for a suburban teen girl. They weren't high art but consumer pieces and scams. Every art dealer has experienced 1000s of people saying they have an original dali and it being worthless, to the point where many wont even look at it or buy dali's.\\n?Like imagine if the head of the US mint faked his own bills, with perfect watermarks, flooding the nation with them. It wouldn't merely be a case of counterfeiting, it'd completely collapse trust in any dollar authentic or not, making them all worthless. That's what happened with dali prints. And even his genuine sketches made for profit would be lazy and mass made solely to sell. Where having one is completely different to having a legit painting of his from a museum.?\\n?Now one can argue chapman's were real ones that were given to him just because they'd be easily explained away as the common fakes/prints, but we'd have to know I'd they're legit or not. But tons of the fake/for profit ones were sketches or prints of them.\\nAll the fraudulent dali's produced in the 70-80s has destroyed the market for his work till this day. And lennon was killed at the height of Dali as a celebrity. The odds of those being authentic pieces for a hit, are even lower than the seaside property in Idaho lmao.?","title":"Hunter Biden tried to make his rent payments with paintings he made out of his own poop!"},{"text":" Hypocrisy and mental gymnastics is wild...never changeThe difference being Trump has literally promised to weaponize the Justice Department.","title":"A Consummate Act of Nepotism Stains Bidens Presidency"},{"text":"We all knew he was going to pardon him.

I work in tech, I like logically perfect systems. Where a conditional can be written like this:\\n If X equals 1, do this. X is 1? It happens. X is ANYTHING except 1? Nothing happens. I've thought on it a bit, how exactly you could enforce a document which itself claims to be the highest law of the land. But no matter how I go about it, whoever's given the power will abuse it eventually. I think the problem is the result of having a document BE the highest authority in the first place. Any document must be interpreted. If it's left open to interpretation, then anyone can claim a differing interpretation, and to eliminate that and bestow on judiciary the actual power to enforce their interpretation over all other branches, would only work if THEIR control mechanisms were working. If impeachment of a supreme court justice wasn't a partisan issue, or if there were multiple political parties with no one having more than 50% of the legislature, then it might work. But solving those would be significantly more complex and would eliminate the ability for a powerful executive to... have power. EDIT: I got off tract: I think you just actually have to have a definitions, errata, and much more detailed legal language. The flowery words of the revolution do not lend themselves easily to eliminating corruption within an empire like ours, you can't just leave things open for interpretation, if the matter is so onerous down the line, it should be enough to trigger the editing mechanism for the constitution itself. If you can't get X% of the electorate, and Y% of the legislature to agree that something needs to be changed? It's probably a skills issue or a corrupt official.

Make no mistake: it was provocation with intent to prod Russie to do exactly what it did.* How would the US react if Putin did the same through Mexico's border with the US? I believe the US and its European allies have acted in bad faith for a number of years. I believe ordinary Ukrainians have been badly served by their leaders, a familiar story in countries ravaged by unnecessary war.The US and the rest of the West eventually will be forced to abandon the neocon goal of eternal US hegemony and recognize the reality of a multipolar world.

Ill take some of these moderately popular topics one by one to try and give you some hope.* Pollution and fossil fuel extraction: Were not eliminating either of these off the face of the planet. But, polluting the Earth as we do now and using fossil fuels is not sustainable. Its really shitty that my generation and future ones are stuck with the burden of reversing course but thats the way of the world. Technology has allowed for enormous gains in efficiency and effectiveness of current energy generating infrastructure; like iron-based batteries for energy storage and high efficiency wind turbines. Both are very sustainable to produce and create entirely new economies of scale. Theres also many transferable skills that people in the fossil fuel extraction industry possess that lend themselves to things likesolar panel installation. What a surprise! All that aside, we have absolutely no idea what tech will be invented in the future to help this problem.* Animal cruelty: This one I think has a very easy solution. Stop eating meat, ho. Ive done quit meat for months at a time(caveat that I am Mexican so my family doesnt really understand) and thankfully theres enough activists who publicize their findings to get more support to at least keep the most damaging and dangerous factory farms in check. Also lab grown meat is a thing! Theres so many unexplored facets of genetics we have yet to uncover, I have no doubt we will get to a Star Trek diet sooner than later(hopefully).* Political polarization: This is not whataboutism because we live in the present and the potential for outright Nxzis or f@rcist right wing governments exist in several countries. But, we should remind ourselves that this point is very much true of the past. The Spanish Inquisition did really happen, Taiwan has probably always been a Chinese resistance state since the late 18th century, and in my lifetime the U.S. invaded two more countries. The fact is, the U.S. is too big and has too big of a target on its back for us to just all get along at an antinatalist New Age alien mass wedding ceremony every decade(i want your funds). But, things are better than theyve been in the past! Im copped up in a lab making a stem cell cow testicle source for hot dogs, which can clearly only be a product of the radicals of a bygone era who fought, marched, and created the infrastructure necessary to continue their vision of a more just world. The only thing that can heal us is to cope through comedy and continue the work. Andddd we have no idea what aliens will bring us so lets see!* Technology: Anything can be weaponized by someone with ill intent and surely the weapon developers and blacksite cia op communicator have the best samurai powers for the job. But, anything can be friendshipdised too! Children are born everyday and they love their parents regardless of where they were born and what OPSEC book you have in your shelf. Why computers and phones are in the latest period of technological development is anyones guess but we are certainly overdue for the death of at least one of the big boys and a bottled genie or alien encounter. Anything we can do to literally evolve our reality through tech, like lab grown burgers and injectable wings, we should do. ANDDDDD there just so happens to be all of the aforementioned knowledge waiting for us to discover on technologies that are too new to not explore Hope you find a big ass cup of water in your mirage!","title":"CMV: Our global society is turning to a dumpster-fire due to pollution, animal cruelty, fossil fuel extraction, political/social polarization, new technologies being used to commit unspeakable injustices, and other harms."},{"text":"Ti ll he st op s be in g an in va si ve di ct at or , Uk ra in e wi ll st i ll re si st .","title":"Roger Boyd: Russia Will Just Keep Changing The Facts On The Ground"},{"text":"Fuck yes he should.

The rule no man is above the law?  Clearly not a rule.  The rule you can't commit an insurrection and run for office?

I can understand why Joe pardonded him and the way in which he did it because I imagine he sees his son as being a victim of a politicized investigation that only targeted his son in an attempt to disparage Joe.  Does that mean I think it was the right decision or a good decision?  Not really, but I also am not going to lose any sleep over it because in the grand scheme... Hunter Biden is just a private citizen whose crimes didn't affect my life in any real way. By contrast, Donald Trump committed crimes as POTUS and while running to be POTUS.  He committed crimes after he lost the last election, but those crimes were related to his time as POTUS.

It actually has widespread support - 66% of Americans and 73% of Brits approve of assisted dyingI also see a lot of comments saying that the state could encourage people to pursue assisted suicide against their wishes, or even that people who want to pursue assisted suicide dont know whats in their own best interests (I think this final argument is hugely illiberal, personally). Concerns about state pressure to die are totally unfounded. Most assisted dying legislation is very restrictive (the recent UK bill only is limited to adults with under 6 months to live, and their request needs to be approved by a judge and 2 doctors), and even in countries where legislation is more relaxed and longstanding assisted dying remains popular and uncontroversialIn Switzerland, assisted dying has been practiced since 1982 from what I can tell, with the only restriction being that the assisting person cannot have a selfish motive. Despite their comparatively lax regulation, assisted dying remains almost universally popular in Switzerland - the most recent referendum on it was in 2011, where **85%** voted to keep assisted dying legal in Zurich. My point is that if assisted dying was the slippery slope people here are saying it is, people in Switzerland, where regulations are more permissive, would probably have turned against in over the last 40 years. Instead, its completely uncontroversialIts pretty bizarre how so many people in this sub are anti-assisted dying, when polls consistently show this is a widely supported policy around the world, and its been practiced in Switzerland for decades without any major controversy","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"It certainly is hard to compete with a cult, especially when it's the economy stupid.

And in the resulting discussions, one major culprit has come up over and over: the 'manosphere'.  The network of podcasters, celebrities, and media influencers that spread sexist ideas, particularly to young men, and who overwhelmingly support Trump and the GOP.  We all agree that it's an enormous problem.Much of the discussion has focused on the need for an equivalent left-wing sphere that spreads a more positive message for men, and the need for better role models of masculinity from within the Democratic Party.  Maybe even draw in better examples from the larger culture.If folks want to do this, they're certainly welcome to, but I'm not sold.  I don't think this would be an effective counter to the manosphere, or change a lot of men's hearts and minds.Let's get into why, and what we can do instead.**\\"Where have the good men gone?\\"**Within the Democratic Party, we've got plenty of good men who pass the vibe check.  Maybe guys would want to hear from [the all-conference linebacker?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Allred)  Maybe the [Marine Corporal who saw combat action?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Golden)  What about [the rural farmer with the missing fingers to show his authenticity?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester)  Or the [master troll who never backs down from a fight with Republicans?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lieu)  Or maybe [just go with the big dude?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fetterman)And hey, why only embrace one version of masculinity?  Maybe men would look up to [a loving husband and father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz), or [a nerd who serves others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kim_(politician)), or [a brilliant legislative leader who absolutely pantsed McConnell to pass a huge climate bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer), or [someone who constantly wins in an unwinnable state and helps people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear)  Point is, there is *no* shortage of good men from every definition of 'masculine' in our party.By the way, who decided Republicans were the manly-man club, anyway?  Apologies for some mean words, but...Donald Trump is a soft, pudgy New Yorker who's never lifted a shovel in his life.  JD Vance is a venture capitalist who won't stick up for his own wife, and can't order a donut.  Mitch McConnell is a geezer who made a career out of saying 'no' a lot.  Mike Johnson is Ned Flanders without the mustache and shares his porn habits with his son.  Ron DeSantis needs no introduction.So...why did the manosphere idiots decide to roll with those guys if 'being a man' is so important?  The answer, sadly, is the same reason a left-wing manosphere is doomed to fail.**Men have good role models.  They just want shitty ones.**Yep, that's the long and the short of it.  #NotAllMen, of course, but the numbers aren't pretty.I know we started this chat with the manosphere, so let's get back to that.  Because a lot of the 'we need a left-wing manosphere' discussion seems to assume that people haven't tried to present a better vision of masculinity in the media.  There are podcasts out there that try to present healthier views of masculinity.  Sometimes that's the explicit focus, like Andy Grant's *Real Men Feel* or the *Art of Manliness* series.  (Neither of these are perfect but they're a hell of a lot better than Andrew Tate).  Other times, it's more incidental, like the McElroy Brothers' *My Brother, My Brother And Me*.  But these shows are completely dwarfed by the manosphere guys.  We didn't have anyone asking if Kamala Harris should go on MBMBAM, after all.[A quick glance at the most popular US podcasts makes the point for me.](https://podcastcharts.byspotify.com/)  Just count the number of toxic masculinity salesmen you see before you get to anything positive for men.  There are some neutral and woman-focused podcasts mixed in, but it looks like a more positive view of masculinity *just isn't popular.*  The podcasts I mentioned have all been around for hundreds of episodes and have their own cult followings.  Problem is, that's not what most men want.  You can try a different spin, but I have a feeling it'll go the same way.The manosphere guys care about making money and taking power from women.  It has nothing to do with 'being a man'.  That's why they photoshop muscles onto Trump instead of embracing the realistic view of masculinity Democrats offer.  But sadly, the toxic shit is what the people want.  And there's a reason why.**It's time to say the P word**Why is it so difficult to expand the definition of what it means to be a man?  And why is putting down women so central to the dominant definition of masculinity?  Women figured this one out a while ago, so it's time to listen, boys, because this probably hurts you too.This problem is explained by [patriarchy.](https://www.thoughtco.com/patriarchal-society-feminism-definition-3528978)  Lots of people get turned off by this idea, associating it with feminist lectures.  Well, it's an important idea, because it's why we're in the situation we're in.Patriarchy is the idea that our society is set up to give men power over women (and, within that, white men power over people of color, rich men power over poor men, etc.)  Things have improved for women since the theory was first advanced in the 1960s.  But every advancement in women's rights came with pushback, and the anger hasn't died down.  In fact, the idea of a woman becoming President has just made that rage even stronger.And patriarchy isn't just laws, it's attitudes and language that put men first.  Re-read Episodes 5 and 6 if you want to see how this works.  Men are implicitly taught that they come first, and women come second.  So they recoil at any attempt to challenge this assumption.  Guys who have been taught to question society's rules sometimes break free of this, but lots get mad about it.  And they seek out others to confirm their biases, whether it's podcasters or politicians.To sum it up: Guys get mad about 'their' position being challenged, and instead of questioning those feelings, they seek out people who'll validate them, and lash out at the people doing the challenging.  Until you solve that, no snappy podcast or awesome figurehead is going to break through.**How do we solve it, then?**This one can't be done by a podcast (though they can be excellent support tools, which is why I'm not opposed to the main idea).  Relationships set the stage for these ideas to break through.When you see a character you have no connection to, they don't make you change your mind.  But when you care about someone, you might allow your assumptions to be challenged.  Sexists have an advantage because they explain why isolated people are sad and lonely.  They do so through harmful lies, but they also use patriarchy, the assumption that men should have it all - and that someone must be taking it from them.Of course, as long as Joe Rogan is playing 24/7 in someone's ears, our counter-arguments are going to be challenged.  This one I haven't solved yet, and I'm hoping all of you have some ideas.  Maybe this is the real value in an alternative manosphere - something else to put on in the car or the office.  But it's going to take individual efforts from all of us to break through.  And I'd love to hear your ideas on that.**Questions to consider**1. How else can we challenge the assumption that men should be privileged over women - without causing a backlash that shuts down the discussion?2. Do you think you harbor any personal beliefs like this?  If not, why not?  (And if so, remember that society is set up to make you think this way, so it doesn't make you a bad person...unless you stay there).3.

Ok, so then she claims:trade war tariffs have directly increased tax collections by $200 to $300 annually per US household,However, during the first Trump administration, according to a Texas A&amp;M study of [Presidents, Inflation and Real Wages](https://archive.is/dLOTD)By his 37th month in office, January 2020, immediately prior to the Pandemic Recession, prices had risen 6.3% and real wages had increased 3.1%.  For all presidential terms we examine at their 37th month, President Trump had the second lowest increase in prices, and the highest increase in real wages.**Second lowest increase in prices**  and **highest increase in real wages** of all the Presidents in the study.So taxes went up by $200 to $300 but were offset by the actual increase in wages and the lowest increase in real prices (behind GW Bush) since Carter.Sure doesn't sounds like things were worse to me.

Hope it makes sense.One of Trump's \\"hobbies\\" in political life has been co-opting or taking down not just his in-party political rivals, but their families too. Cheneys are done. The Bushes have either been co-opted (Jeb's! son George P. Bush went MAGA years ago) or wiped out politically (the rest of the Bush family). [Romney's as much as admitted that, were he to oppose Trump, his family would be targeted](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4899093-romney-trump-retribution-threats/).The Cuneos, Barzinis, Tattaglias, or Stracchis were not available for comment. We joke about I'm Eric, or the failson Don, the Daughter He'd Date, or the One He Forgot About Until He Needed a Mideast Advisor (but Barron's OK so far). But that doesn't come from nowhere. Trump himself cracks about how his kids disappoint him. Jill continued her teaching while Melania lives whatever life she lives.The Bidens are pretty much the opposite. Joe talks about how his parents influenced him growing up, how much he loves his sons, how he stands by and believes in Hunter, etc. Public service and family vs. self-service and transactional relationships.A fascinating study in contrasts. The idea that the head of a family can be loving, caring and supportive of even the most wayward son runs completely counter to Trump's (real or projected) view of family. Factor in that Joe supports Hunter even with the prior drug use, and that Trump's beloved older brother Fred Jr. died from a heart attack brought on by alcoholism, and that just amps the feelings up even more.I'd *love* to imagine that, deep deep down, in his three-sizes-too-small heart, there lies a certain envy that Fred Sr. might have been just a little more like Joe and less than mid-century American Snidely Whiplash.","title":"White House says Trump wouldnt let go of Hunter Biden in defending pardon"},{"text":"Geraldo is an odd person.

CA residents are underrepresented by a factor of -8.6 and should have 62,6 votes. WY is overrepresented by a factor of 2.2 and should have 0.89 votes. The same carries over to the House, where CA has fewer reps per capita and the lower population states have more. Its even worse with the senate of course, although that one was done on purpose for the slave states.

If he refuses to answer, he can be charged with obstruction or contempt of Congress.As those charges would come after the pardon, they could be prosecuted.  Joe can't issue a pardon for any future crimes.  Oh, and as someone else pointed out, he's only pardoned from US prosecution.  If he committed crimes in other countries, he could still be prosecuted and hope a Trump administration wouldn't extradite him.Looks like old Joe just set himself up, Hunter would either have to risk jail or protect Joe and anyone else being investigated.Now, I do expect Joe is going to issue additional blanket pardon's to himself and others of his syndicate, but I'm sure something will be missed.Could be very interesting.","title":"We havent seen a pardon as sweeping as Hunter Bidens in generations"},{"text":"One shithead, actually.

If 12,000 voters were wrongly purged from the rolls, and 44 percent of them were African-American, and 90 percent of African-Americans voted for Gore, that meant 4,752 black Gore votersalmost nine times Bushs margin of victorycould have been prevented from voting.

In particular, he is against equal pay for equal work, he thinks that women should have an incentive to start a family with a man and raise children. He will vehemently defend that he *is* for equality but, according to some studies he read, women are always happier with a man and children. It's all basic biology to him.

In my country he is far from minority with those opinions. I suppose, this is why I'm kind of miffed when people call themselves anti-feminist while being clearly against the discrimination of women.

On the one hand I do feel Hunter Biden was pursued for a relatively minor gun violation that is often overlooked. This was likely done because of who he is, although he was treated with kid gloves initially until the judge rejected his plea deal. On the other hand, Hunter Biden is a nepo baby who's gotten off for things that land other people in jail for decades. He was given pre-trial diversions for crack possession at 18, which meant no criminal record and allowed him to continue to law school. He continued to use drugs. After he tested positive for cocaine while in the military, his dad hired lawyer to fight the discharge by claiming some black men gave him a cigarette he didn't know had crack in it. But then he decided not to pursue the appeal because he didn't think it'd succeed. In 2016 he crashed a Hertz rental car and claimed an owl flew across the highway forcing him to swerve. When the car was searched, a bag of crack cocaine, a crack pipe, secret service business cards, Hunter's ID, and his dead brother's AG badge were found in the car. The local DA pursued a case against him but it was dropped at the last minute citing a 'lack of evidence the material was owned by Hunter Biden'. The Secret Service repeatedly contacted the DA and the Sheriff's office before this decision.All this while Joe Biden was advocating a 'tough on crime' approach on drug addicts where people possessing small amounts of drugs were sentenced to months or years of jail time. But if you're a rich kid with a powerful dad you get to skip all that stuff. In addition, the excuse many Democrats are using is that he had to protect his son from Trump who would treat his son unfairly and have him imprisoned for life or executed. This is complete BS, Hunter was already convicted, and Trump has 0 control over his sentencing, that's the judge's decision who isn't a Republican. In addition, the pardon is good for all offences for 10 years b/w 2014-2024, including ones completely unrelated to the gun charge. If it was solely due to a fear he may be sentenced unfairly, why pardon him for all crimes he may have committed?Also, the party that pursued a biased case against Trump in New York from a DA who ran on going after Trump crying biased prosecution is a bit rich. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records in the first degree, a felony. This charge is normally a misdemeanor, and thus outside the statute of limitations. In order to prosecute Trump and have him declared a felon, they needed to show he falsified the records 'an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof'. The DA prosecuted him for this, but never said what the 'other crime' was. Despite this, he was still convicted of the felony.","title":"A whole thread of people who screamed that no one is above the law, cheering that Biden pardoned his son."},{"text":"I guarantee most of the names being thrown around now are *not* going to be the nominee in 2028*.

Reality is that Hunter has been the victim of politically driven investigations and prosecutions that he likely would have never faced had his father not ran for president.  Rather than subject Hunter to that continued GOP political witch hunt, Joe pardoned him with a blanket pardon that would largely lay to rest these actions.

This cuts the head off that snake as it were.

The state not agreeing to kill someone =/= state paternalism.Bodily autonomy was never the primary argument in favor of MAID. It was the argument to stop needlessly prolonging suffering from terminal illness. The prolonged suffering AND the clear terminality were key. Expanding MAID beyond terminal physical illnesses by adopting the \\"bodily autonomy\\" argument quickly gets us into territory where we are at very serious risk of needlessly and prematurely ending lives. Its probably one of the most clear and defined examples of a slippery slope I can imagine. Suicidal thoughts or deep depressions are often, if not usually, non-fatal many if not most recover. People also often attempt and fail to commit suicide and go on to live happy lives. MAID in those cases assigns a deterministic and 100% fatal end to lives where recovery was a real possibility. Bodily autonomy as the basis alone rapidly gets us to a point where we're just killing people who had real chances of recovery and when we're at that point, bodily autonomy, quite frankly, is a dogshit argument. To be honest with you, this attempt to adopt bodily autonomy as \\"the reason\\" for MAID feels more like a cynical attempt at appropriating successful and popular pro-choice arguments as a way to link the two positions into a sort of monocause -- to hijack that part of a well meaning but credulous liberals brain that only associates good things with the phrase.

They never actually found the crimes they were looking for so they tried to create their own by pushing laptop, dick pics and taxes enough that the media would pay attention. And it worked. They created a fictitious Biden Crime Family along with a fake committee ironically called \\"The Weaponization of the Government\\" which they weaponized against a civilian. And finally they promised revenge on these corrupt Biden Familt if Trump won. But then Joe dropped out. And along with that, so did their interest in Hunter. We havent heard a peep about that story for months.  Fast-forward to now and suddenly Republicans and the media are talking about the morality of handing out Pardons. Trump is hiring family members from prisons everywhere and putting pardoned criminals in positions of extreme power. And the media and Republicans are acting as if Joe Biden is the bad guy for protecting his son from a regime that has said out loud that they will take their revenge out on any Biden that they can find.  The people screaming about this are fools because Joe is doing the thing that Republicans have been screaming about for a decade.

Fuck anyone dumb enough to think otherwise.","title":"Democratic senator blasts Bidens pardon of son"},{"text":"I would like to introduce you to a little piece of American history known as the LA riots. Not to mention [Title 10 Chapter 15 of the USC](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-15). In American jurisprudence, there are a couple of factors that govern seemingly conflicting laws. First, determine if there is an actual conflict. The exact text of the Posse Comitatus Act isWhoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.So then we move to Title 10 Chapter 15. That would be Act(s) of Congress that authorize the use of the armed forces to support law enforcement or directly enforce laws. So there is no conflict. Case closed. In addition to this, there are furthermore laws under Title 32 that authorize the use of National Guard troops for direct law enforcement under both state and federal control and the lack of the mention of the U.S. Coast Guard in the PCA plus Title 14 authorization allows that branch of the armed services to be used for law enforcement purposes.Even if there wasnt that, in addition there are the general overarching principles of specific beats general and newer beats older in terms of which law has priority if there are any conflicts. Given a general prohibition on the use of military for law enforcement would be beaten by the specific cases listed in Title 10 Chapter 15 and that Title 10 Chapter 15 was passed more recently than the PCA, there is utterly no basis for the claim that it is wholly illegal to use military force for law enforcement in the country.Also the PCA had nothing to do with union busting. Rutherford Hayes *himself* used troops for union busting. It was passed because [Democratic states in the confederate south after reconstruction were pissed off that Republican governments kept using military troops to enforce their governments and policies to the detriment of the democrats](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R42659.pdf).","title":"Democratic senators urge Biden to try to limit Trump's ability to use the U.S. military domestically"},{"text":"Trump will find, kill and eat both turkeys Biden pardoned.

Also, the tariffs are meant to keep other countries in check and its working. They're economic tools. They're not permanent policies. It encourages the US to produce more of its own goods and bring back jobs/production. The deportations means people will have to come through legal ports of entry. This is the classic \\"who will pick the crops?\\" argument. There are loads of people in the US who are jobless, and willing to pick crops. The farmers who depend on illegals are taking advantage of their situation, not to mention, those people also are deprived of health benefits and insurance. It's modern day slavery. That's what is being argued for here. Deportations reduce/prevent that. This is what makes more jobs for Americans who need the work. Trump's policies are literally putting America first. Democrats are known for putting America last, and survive on hoaxes and lies.

Now when Biden uses the same tactics Republicans normalized, they're suddenly concerned about abuse of power.Voters have made it clear they don't care about these institutional norms anymore. Republicans can't have it both ways - either presidential powers should be used aggressively (in which case Biden's pardon is fair game) or they should be limited (in which case Trump's actions were wrong). Their selective outrage just exposes their real concern isn't about proper use of power, but who gets to use it.","title":"Analysis: Bidens sweeping pardon for son rewrites the rules"},{"text":"What was that definition of pathological liar again ??","title":"Were You Naive Enough to Believe Joe Biden?"},{"text":"Love to see it.","title":"Hunter Biden's Pardon Has All The Idiots Riled Up"},{"text":"Did anyone HONESTLY think he wasnt going to pardon his son?

By not printing money, by eliminating the Federal Reserve (they are not needed - banks can do the same thing as the Fed). By not bailing out big banks and big institutions, by removing barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and small businesses. By removing health insurance companies (eliminate overhead), and increasing the number of doctors and healthcare professionals to reduce healthcare costs. By removing useless college degrees and having student loan provisions for only useful college degrees. Not everyone needs a college degree anyways and we need to bring back trade schools. By reducing tax burdens on companies and incentivizing them to increase production and keeping businesses here rather than other countries. By breaking up large businesses (Google should be like 10 different companies). Eliminating income tax is also a great idea but unfortunately we will need to get the 36T in debt sorted out first. This country started a revolution on a 2% tea tax and we now pay well over 40% of all our income in taxes once you account for income, state, property, sales, and other taxes.All the above will help strengthen the purchasing power of the average American and make the country thrive.Look at Trumps first 4 years.
