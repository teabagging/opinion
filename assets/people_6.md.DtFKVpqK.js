As England and Wales had no such law, the slave, Somerset, could not be removed to Jamaica for sale to a plantation.

Ill just focus on just the Biden Department of Justice attacks on him personally and his businesses. The Classified Documents Case, where Biden had the FBI raid his home in Mar-A-Largo, plant classified folders with nothing in them and leak them to the press, rifled through Melanias Underwear drawer, all at gunpoint, all the time knowing that Biden had classified documents at 10 separate locations that he couldnt legally even possess because he was a senator or Vice President when he took them. Biden sent White House lawyers to work in every State case brought against him from Atlanta, New York, Washington DC and Florida. He and Harris met with local prosecutors (illegal) to direct these cases and worked to stagger timelines to keep Trump tied up in court instead of campaigning. Bidens DOJ pursued THOUSANDS of Trump supporters for Jan6 Felony Trespassing charges that never entered the Capitol for just being in DC that day. Many of those innocent people were imprisoned, fined, lost their jobs and even their lives because of Bidens actions.  We wont even throw in that Biden minimized Trumps Secret Service coverage and used Homeland Security workers instead of trained Secret Service Agents which lead to Trump being shot in the ear and millimeters from being assassinated.

As far as I understand it, the TV license in the UK and the GEZ are similar in a lot of ways, but their implementation is different.**Context:**The main differences are in who is obligated to pay and how it's enforced: the *Rundfunkbeitrag* is enforced in a much more automated way C whenever you register at a new address, you get a notification from the GEZ saying you have to re-register your household (each household shares one license, same as the UK).The TV license afaik runs on a penalty-based system that checks whether households use the license and prosecutes for non-payment. In Germany, everyone, regardless of their media use, is required to pay the *Rundfunkbeitrag*, and you get payment reminder notifications and eventually collections agencies go after you if you don't pay.While I disagree on the payment structure of the *Rundfunkbeitrag* to an extent (it's inherently regressive, as essentially everyone, regardless of their income, must pay the same amount), I think that the general idea results in significantly less controversy surrounding its media legitimacy/ news bias.**Where I disagree with you:**The problem with the UK system results more from the requirement that one use the service to be obligated to pay. That:1. adds administrative burden and ultimately results in a waste of money, and\\n2. results in the media itself becoming more polarized and unpopular for different groups, as they are incentivized to appease their customer base.While I agree that it's a consumer choice to not pay the TV license in the UK, it's also a consumer choice to, e.g., pirate media. I find it very unlikely that everyone who opts out of the TV license consumes no media funded by it, resulting in a free-rider problem.**TL;DR:** I think the solution, unlike your suggestion of having fewer people pay for it, would actually be to make everyone pay for it.","title":"CMV: Not paying the TV Licence fee is now a perfectly reasonable consumer choice (UK Post)"},{"text":"You dont need to apologize to me.

The latter is so inept it is almost perpetually under investigation by OFCOM for breaching broadcast rules. Netflix and all the other streaming platforms offer nothing in the way of news - zero, in fact, and there would be no incentive for them to offer it if the bbc were forced to give up the licence fee. The BBC might not be perfect in its news output, but without it, there would be just one credible 24 hour news channel, and ITV/C4 doing bulletins.As to public service in general: when Covid started and lockdown was implemented, the BBC immediately commissioned educational programming specifically to cater for children who could not go to school. This was on air within days of lockdown being announced. Netflix made no such effort - there is no incentive in the commercial sphere whereas a publicly funded BBC, which is governed by its charter, is explicitly required to provide such programming.

The President-elect would presumably now rank twice being voted into the Oval Office as a greater honour than entering wrestlings celebrated pantheon, yet the remark demonstrated the critical importance of combat sports in his life and work.The love Trump has for the sport has certainly been reciprocated by devotees of wrestling and bodybuilding who passionately supported his landslide victory over Kamala Harris last week. Those who have studied the links between Trump and professional wrestling testify to the role the sport played in getting him back into the White House. Everybody likes to attribute The Apprentice for his media exposure but Donald Trump learnt a lot how to interact with the public and how to do so much stuff from wrestling, says Dr Shannon Bow OBrien, a presidency scholar at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of Donald Trump and the Kayfabe Presidency: Professional Wrestling Rhetoric in the White House [Kayfabe is the wrestling convention of presenting scripted and staged performances as real]. Wrestling helped him inform how he sees the world, she says. He uses wrestlers tactics, their tropes and their skills C he never apologises, always forcefully doubles down and hes never wrong.Its not difficult to see why Trump was drawn to professional wrestling, which is akin to an overblown reality TV musical in a sports stadium setting and where bombastic pronouncements and grand titles are highly valued. In 1988 and 1989, Trump hosted WrestleMania, wrestlings annual equivalent of the SuperBowl, at the hotel he then owned in Atlantic City. He continued to attend WWE events and feature as part of their narratives, culminating in a bizarre 2007 appearance at what was dubbed Battle of the Billionaires where Trump faced off with WWE CEO and chairman Vince McMahon at WrestleMania 23. The pair battled via proxy fighters with the winner getting to shave the losers head. Trumps wrestler won the bout and McMahon lost his hair. The event became the highest grossing pay-per-view event in wrestling history.Donald Trump is a natural heel, says Dr Bow OBrien, using the wrestling term for a villain. He has antagonistic personal qualities to him and in wrestling, which is among the few spheres where the audience is allowed to interact with the performers, he likes the adoration of the crowd. His rallies look a lot like wrestling performances. They always have the music, the fireworks, the whizz bang stuff, people yelling and clapping.As Trump prepares for a second term in the White House, his wrestling connections are stronger than ever. McMahon, 79 C whose controversial conduct, flamboyant style and tendency to blur fantasy and reality in the eyes of his critics has frequently drawn comparisons with the President-elect C has severed ties with the WWE while federal authorities investigate allegations of sexual misconduct, assault and trafficking (all of which are denied by McMahon).Trump appropriated his infamous Youre fired catchphrase from the US Apprentice (later used in the UK version by Lord Sugar) from McMahon. While McMahons camp has insisted he no longer maintains contact with Trump, his wife, Linda, headed the Small Business Administration in his first term before leading the pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action. She has been tipped to lead Trumps Department of Commerce.Another key wrestling ally is Dana White, the head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), the worlds biggest mixed martial arts organisation. White introduced the President-elect at this years Republican National Convention and has credited Trump for UFCs success, once saying, Nobody took us seriously, except Donald Trump. Steven Cheung, Trumps belligerent campaign spokesman, was formerly UFC director of communications.Trump certainly wasnt shy of bringing up wrestling on the campaign trail, and his longstanding involvement in the sport helped him to enlist the support of retired high-profile wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan and Ted DiBiase.Trump recorded an election video with retired former wrestling legend Mark Calaway, better known by his ring name The Undertaker, and former WWE wrestler Kane, who under his real name Glenn Jacobs, is now Republican Mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. Other wrestlers crossed the line in their support for Donald Trump.Professional wrestler Jake Hager, known as Jack Swagger in WWE contests, was reportedly recently dropped from a wrestling event in Connecticut after he referred to abortion as killing babies and murder and called his former boss, All Elite Wrestling co-founder, Tony Khan, a communist for allegedly requesting Hager dial down his support for Trump.During his hugely influential podcast with Joe Rogan (himself A UFC commentator) Trump said suffering a grazed ear from a bullet in an assassination attempt in July had made him a tougher guy, citing the exploits of mixed martial arts fighter Bo Nickal.In the election, you heard a lot about the elite being Democrats and run-of-the-mill Americans being Republican, and to a large degree that got mirrored in wrestling, says a former WWE executive talking on condition of anonymity. [Wrestling legends] Jesse Ventura, Dave Bautista, Mick Foley, even [bodybuilder-cum-Republican governor] Arnold Schwarzenegger came out for Harris but the majority of wrestlers supported Trump.Are wrestlers and bodybuilders more likely to support Trump or does he himself serve as a gateway to interest in those pursuits? The former, according to the WWE executive: Wrestlers are attracted to Trumps positions on the economy and immigration and the fact hes a WWE Hall of Famer is an added bonus. Teague Moore, a former student wrestling champion and now a leading wrestling consultant, says he backed Trump on policy grounds. He is not owned by government or the autocrats that have destroyed the working class, Moore says. He does what he says he is going to do and will fight for the common man and women to be allowed to live freely and safely.This sentiment is echoed by Hollywood veteran Heywood Gould, who co-wrote the cult 1986 combat sports film Streets of Gold. Wrestlers love how Trump comes across as so strong and muscular and talks as if hes out to beat everybody up, says Gould. Its a popular space that was wide open for him.

Yet the bodybuilders have been even more strident in their support for the president-elect. Popular, anonymous social media accounts such as the colourfully named Bronze Age Pervert (BAP) and Raw Egg Nationalist have built up huge followings blending images of buff physiques with support for Republicans, that often spills over into espousing alt-right beliefs in white nationalism and social Darwinism.Bodybuilding appeals to right-wing ideas of invincibility, it appeals to the heart rather than the intellect, sentiment over rationality, and we saw that in this election, says Alan Klein, the author of Little Big Men, a study of gym culture and politics, and professor emeritus of anthropology at Northeastern University. This idea that manhood is defined by bodybuilding and mixed martial arts appeals to the sentiments of power and thats what Donald Trumps right-wing populism is all about.It was reported by Politico that younger staffers in President Trumps first term were reading BAPs book Bronze Age Mindset and as of last July JD Vance was following both BAP and Raw Egg Nationalist on Twitter/X. Yet mainstream Republicans, never mind Democrats, will be hoping that bodybuilding influencers dont influence the direction of Trumps second term in office. BAP, reputedly Romanian-born Costin Alamariu, though he has never confirmed his identity, wrote in a 2021 essay, I believe in rule by a military caste of men who would be able to guide society toward a morality of eugenics.Many alt-right bodybuilders also swear by the paleo diet, centred on nuts, vegetables and meat. Paleo diet advocates, who include billionaire right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a close ally of Trumps running mate JD Vance, believe it maximises their chances of living to the age of 120 and beyond. The paleo diet is all about the perfection of the human form and this idea of invulnerability and immortality, says Klein.While bodybuilders and wrestling forces helped Trump win a second term, it remains to be seen how durable the political alliances will be over the course of the next four years.Bodybuilders, wrestlers and the bro subculture is a temporary alliance and he [Trump] exploited it perfectly, claims Klein. [Kamala] Harris didnt see this at all. She thought the election was about issues. It was about impressions.","title":"Why Trump loves wrestling C and why wrestling loves Trump"},{"text":"If we do the president musk angle, Trump will fire him","title":"Republicans projected to win the house"},{"text":"\\"They can't eat the dogs if we shoot all of them\\"","title":"Trump picks Kristi Noem to serve as his Homeland security secretary"},{"text":"lmfao","title":"Will the Supreme Court Stand Up to Trump?"},{"text":"Lol. \\"I work for a living\\".Congratulations?I don't know what kind of flex you think that is, but you obviously don't work so hard that you couldn't respond to my post within thirty seconds.

His enterprise was always designed to be shared.**Epstein did not run a sex trafficking enterprise because he was rich. He became rich on the promises of providing a sex trafficking enterprise. Epsteins wealth originated from loans provided by  JPMorgan Chase between 1998 to 2013 , around the same time he started his sex trafficking business. How did he repay these loans? By having the privilege of working as an accountant for several extremely wealthy people despite having never graduated from college. Go figure.But ignoring the financial issue this point becomes clear by looking at the sheer scale of Epsteins teenage brothel-service in Palm Beach alone. He is known to have employed around 30 teenage girls for his brothel-spa in Palm Beach, but allegations against him suggest the figure to be \\"over 100 girls\\" judging by the line of questioning in [Jeffrey Epstein's deposition](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/1335/6/giuffre-v-maxwell/).According to Juan Alessi the guests of Epstein were free to use the girls during visits. Officially , they were \\"massages\\" that were held in an upstairs spa facility in the mansion with massage table, sauna , shower and a bedroom. Juan Alessi stated that there was a \\"laundry basket full of sex toys\\" near the spa. He also stated that the bed usually had to be remade after every \\"massage\\" and that the Epstein household would place 50-60 towels per day in the laundry during certain visits.It is assumed that a log of the \\"massages\\" was kept in the Epstein household via digital means using a message system called \\"Citrix\\". If true, this would indicate that the \\"massages\\" were not offered as a gift but as something which required payment. The logs from the \\"Citrix\\" system has not been submitted as evidence in this court case on grounds involving the Fourth Amendment. Why a general search warrant for all electronic media belonging to Epstein was not approved by Florida Police is beyond my understanding.

Epstein usually traveled with at least 2 girls. These girls had no money of their own and no housing of their own apart from what Epstein provided them.

The house manager in NY is known only as \\"Jojo\\" by Alessi. The house managers for New Mexico , Paris and Little Saint James are unknown. Where are their testimonies?If Epsteins sex-trafficking was an enterprise (which seems pretty evident right now), were they limited to prostituting teenage girls in the US or were there other branches?

Or was this another service offered by the customers, e.g they would film themselves getting a \\"massage\\" and bring the tapes home with them?Did the estate that Epstein had on the Little Saint James serve a specific purpose in the sex trafficking scheme?

The father of the girl was outraged , so Trump banned Epstein from Mar-a-lago////Visitors of Epstein would 100% know he was a sex-trafficker. Epsteins enterprise was not a by-product of hedonistic self-indulgence that he \\"shared\\" . His enterprise was always designed to be shared. This is clear from recent court docs.**a) Can we trust the depositions given by Guiffre and Ransome?**Yes. [Juan Alessi's testimony in DE-207-6](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/1328/42/giuffre-v-maxwell/) is crucial to prove this as his description of the day-to-day activities in Palm beach matches the stories given by Guiffre and Ransome in their depositions. This proves that the girls did in fact not invent false stories in order to get Jeffrey Epstein convicted.(The e-mail written by Sarah Ransome in [DE-947-1](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/1332/16/giuffre-v-maxwell/) is a separate matter because we still lack context) EDIT:  This e-mail was a red herring planted by Dershowitz**b) Visitors of Epstein would 100% know he was a sex-trafficker. Why?**From [Guiffre's deposition](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/1335/3/giuffre-v-maxwell/) we see that  Epstein had pornographic photos on open display in his home in Palm Beach , New York , New Mexico and on the Virgin Islands. It is known he featured pornographic photos of teenage girls, including Virginia Guiffre. The photos were, according to Guiffre, arranged in all homes so that any guest visiting Epstein would have seen them.  The same applies for the teenage girls that Epstein always had on hand to provide sexual services.Epstein did not hide his sex-trafficking business from anyone visiting his estate.  We can assume this from the following quotes:Q. *\\"Is Bill Clinton a witness to the sexual abuse of minors?\\"*Guiffre: *\\"Yes, he would be a witness* *because he knew what my purpose there was for Jeffrey and he visited Jeffrey's island. There's pictures of nude girls all around the house at all of his houses and it's something that Jeffrey Epstein wasn't shy about admitting to people.\\"*Source : Guiffre deposition DE 363-7 pages 153Q : *\\"How many times did somebody to have to come to an Epstein property for you to have the same assumption (context: someone who commits SA of young girls) about that person? \\"*Guiffre: *\\"I would say the first time they came to that property there is nude pictures everywhere. These are salacious acts of girls, young girls doing things to each other that would be considered child pornography.\\" If you walked foot into Jeffrey Epstein's house and you went in there and you continued to be an acquaintance of his then you would have to know what was going on there.\\"*Q. *\\"So Donald Trump was in your mind you believe a witness to the sexual abuse of minors? \\"*Guiffre : *\\" I don't think Donald Trump participated in anything. That would have to be another assumption. I never saw or witnessed Donald Trump participate in those acts, but was he in the house of Jeffrey Epstein. I've heard he has been, but I haven't seen him myself so I don't know.\\"*Source : Guiffre deposition DE 363-7 pages 152-152Q *\\"Now, the Dubins, they visited Jeffrey Epstein's property, correct?\\"* A. \\"Yes.\\"Q. *\\"And the children would see these nude photographs in the property?\\"* A. \\"Yes.\\"Q. *\\"And both the parents would?\\"* A. \\"Yes.\\"Source : Guiffre deposition DE 363-7 pages 163**c) What about travelers on the Lolita Express?**According [Sarah Ransome's deposition](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/1335/7/giuffre-v-maxwell/) Epstein had a \\"round bed\\" in full view aboard his Boeing 727. There are photos online of the interior of the Lolita express, such as the photos provided by [The Sun](https://www.thesun.ie/news/4346504/epstein-lolita-express-prince-andrew-donald-trump-private-jet/).  Epstein usually traveled with at least 2 girls. These girls had no money of their own and no housing of their own apart from what Epstein provided them. Meaning they HAD to do whatever Epstein and the guests aboard the Lolita Express told them to do. Epstein would never make an exception to this rule for anyone. Safeguarding the reputation of visitors was not Epsteins business. Selling sex was his business.**d) Epstein's enterprise was not a by-product of hedonistic self-indulgence that he \\"shared\\" . His enterprise was always designed to be shared.**Epstein did not run a sex trafficking enterprise because he was rich. He became rich on the promises of providing a sex trafficking enterprise. Epsteins wealth originated from loans provided by  JPMorgan Chase between 1998 to 2013 , around the same time he started his sex trafficking business. How did he repay these loans? By having the privilege of working as an accountant for several extremely wealthy people despite having never graduated from college. Go figure.But ignoring the financial issue this point becomes clear by looking at the sheer scale of Epsteins teenage brothel-service in Palm Beach alone. He is known to have employed around 30 teenage girls for his brothel-spa in Palm Beach, but allegations against him suggest the figure to be \\"over 100 girls\\" judging by the line of questioning in [Jeffrey Epstein's deposition](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/1335/6/giuffre-v-maxwell/).According to Juan Alessi the guests of Epstein were free to use the girls during visits. Officially , they were \\"massages\\" that were held in an upstairs spa facility in the mansion with massage table, sauna , shower and a bedroom. Juan Alessi stated that there was a \\"laundry basket full of sex toys\\" near the spa. He also stated that the bed usually had to be remade after every \\"massage\\" and that the Epstein household would place 50-60 towels per day in the laundry during certain visits.It is assumed that a log of the \\"massages\\" was kept in the Epstein household via digital means using a message system called \\"Citrix\\". If true, this would indicate that the \\"massages\\" were not offered as a gift but as something which required payment. The logs from the \\"Citrix\\" system has not been submitted as evidence in this court case on grounds involving the Fourth Amendment. Why a general search warrant for all electronic media belonging to Epstein was not approved by Florida Police is beyond my understanding.

This is like saying someone shows signs consistent with being a double amputee because they have problems picking things up. Sure, maybe they do, but Steve. *They've got both arms*, Steve.The slightly less easily dismissable one - disconnecting with others is a sign of cult behaviour. This is subtler, but runs into the same issue. Cults don't just isolate people for the hell of it, and just isolating people doesn't make you a cult. Cults isolate people because the cult leader is trying to exploit them and that's easier when there's no-one else important in their life. This requires focus, and organization, which is impossible on a broad political level. Who is in charge of liberalism to be doing the exploitation? It also requires *instruction -* cutting people out of your life because you don't want to hang out with them anymore isn't cult behaviour, because you can't be a cult of one.Basically, your issue is that matching a few points on a checklist for X doesn't make you X.","title":"CMV: Liberals erasing Trump-voting family and friends from their life is a cult-like mental illness"},{"text":"No","title":"Will the Supreme Court Stand Up to Trump?"},{"text":"They will do the exact opposite","title":"Will the Supreme Court Stand Up to Trump?"},{"text":"And you wanna hear the response that I've heard from Trump supporters in the town I live? \\"Buy up fire arms to stop the blue haired people.\\"You're coming from a perspective that people on the left are cutting out people \\"indiscriminately\\" when, more often than not, the situations are more akin to mine, that we effectively tolerated their beliefs as \\"relative being just like that\\" until it was made directly personal.

Women learn early on how to compensate for their lack of physical strength. I lived alone for years and did not needed a man to protect myself. Women are not physically stronger than men (usually), but women have greater endurance and other strengths we can use to adapt to the threat of men who dominate women physically. Using our own strengths, we can usually protect ourselves. And weapons are great equalizers if you know how to use them.You misunderstand equality. Women are not EQUIVALENT to men. We are not exactly the same. Only women can carry babies. Men tend to be stronger physically. Blah blah blah, yeah, we know. Equality means we get equal rights and opportunities under the law. It means mutual respect for our needs, wants, desires, and preferences. The fact that there are special considerations unique to men and women means we take them into consideration respectfully and give them equitable treatment. It means we are respected as equals without domination or subjugation, or forced to do things we dont want to do. We, like men, make decisions for our own lives without coercion. It means we respect each other equally. Women dont need bodyguards. We need partners committed to equal consideration in relationships, where both feel equally loved, respected, and cared for. To most women, abortion is a life-and-death issue. Women all over the world die due to pregnancy and childbirth every day. Its not just a cause; its a procedure that saves many women from premature death due to pregnancy complications. Its also protects their future fertility by, for example, removing an ectopic pregnancy that will burst the fallopian tube and cause the mother to lose both the tube and the embryo, and can result in the mother bleeding to death internally. After miscarriages, which also happen every day all over the world, if the dead embryo/fetus doesnt come out, infection and other complications can kill the mother. In a procedure called a D &amp; C, they scrape out the dead tissue so the mother doesnt die or lose her fertility due to infection. This is also called abortion even though miscarriages never result in live babies. For the life of me, I dont know how anyone can be okay with standing there doing nothing and letting a grown woman needlessly die a gruesome death, yet its happening more and more often. Pregnancy and childbirth take an enormous toll on a womans body. It is far more complicated and complex than most people are aware of. Banning abortion means WOMEN die and lose their fertility when its entirely preventable. Its a travesty that women have zero control over this. But lots of people seem to be just fine with letting this happen.So manythe majority of womensee this abortion as absolutely a life-and-death issue. And when abortion is not available and safe, pregnancy becomes a larger threat to a womans life.One solution? Stop having sex to protect yourself from pregnancy and thus prevent your own pregnancy-related death or disability. This is an entirely practical, logical, and effective way to protect ourselves when others cant be bothered to value our lives. No, Im with my husband because he respects me as an equal.

As long as Putin keeps doing what he does, Kamala Harris also wouldn't have gone to war. If Putin starts escalting the conflict, potentially even attacking the EU/NATO members then Trump - or any other US president - would actively get involved.  \\nChina - Taiwan, the US can't afford to let Taiwan fall into the hands of China. Taiwan has a monopoly on the most advanced semiconductors and as long as that monopoly stands, the US will interfere with any attempts of China invading Taiwan. Otherwise the US will lose the capability of building some of their most advanced military equipment while China potentially manages to close the gap. The facilities have a killswitch in them but who knows what China can salvage. The process of breaking the monopoly will take longer than the 4 years that Trump has.   \\nAnything in the middle east is impossible to predict. No president would actively get involved in what's happening with Israel right now because it's political suicide. And any escalation by other foreign nations is impossible to predict.  \\nKamala Harris wouldn't be any more or less likely to go to war in any of those circumstances. But Trump actually has a slightly higher risk of purposly starting WW3. We all know that he wants some radical changes to the country. We know he already very reluctantly gave up office in 2020. And going to war would be a fairly easy way for him to declare a state of emergency/martial law. That would \\"temporarily\\" give him more power and let's him curcumvent some checks that are in place that might hinder him in pushing his agenda.   \\nNow, I personally think it's unlikely but the potential exist under Trump while it wouldn't under Harris.

I had to talk to security for 2 hours and a lot of their questions boiled down to \\"I was 5\\". If a family member voted for that? I have concerns about how they see me. Let's take some more. In 2020 I worked with COVID patients. Like i saw death after death after death. Working in war zones was comparable to the fatality rates on some days. Because of our department's role in research we often were talking to people across the planet. We had it bad.We didn't have it \\"mass graves in New York bad\\".

I got one named Kumar &amp; Clark. My parents gifted me one... You have to understand that this is a 80 book... It's Harrison's Principles of Internal medicine. Fauci was an author on it. And you had that guy getting abused in your media by a pro virus political party. I had American doctors not only telling me horror stories... But some had their practice compromised around drugs that we had proven to be worse in COVID. Like hydroxychloroquine. We literally were showing massive reduction in fatality rates with cheaper drugs and you had these clowns suggesting that hyperglycaemia was an unacceptable side effect with no way to control. A million dead... And that's with how Americans count their deaths (if you caught COVID and the delirium killed you? You didn't die of COVID... Never mind that the delirium is caused by COVID. If you are not straight and openly seen as such? Your world is deadlier. Hell. I remember the racism Trump had against East Asians during COVID. And as an Indian? The racism against Kamala.

This can also exist WITHOUT being a sign of delusion, especially if its reasonable. If this person happens to be gay, or have close gay friends, or if they have had an abortion, it would be completely reasonable for them to question your trustworthiness if you voted for someone who would likely jeopardize those people.3. Again, the mere existence of a grudge does not necessitate that the person is delusional. If you murder my wife, I am 100% going to hold that against you the rest of my life, and I would not be delusional for doing so.4. Are you suggesting that if this person feels slighted by you the appropriate thing to do is nothing? No reaction?Lastly, I see you are using the Cleveland Clinic web page to get your info but you conveniently leave out the actual definition they provide:A delusion is an unshakable belief in something thats untrue.You did not address this at all. So again, if a person is delusional, they may exhibit those symptoms.

The world (and China) is moving much, much, much faster than it did 100 years ago. 20 years on the sidelines for the US represents an insurmountable disadvantage to maintaining the status quo.Assuming that really good recovery from the devastating situation we are about to endure; that doesn't necessarily mean that the US is doomed - however - this 20 year break does represent the surrender of the US as the global leader.Other civilizations have encountered this rise and fall in the past and they have endured but their position has not recovered in anything less than centuries. That is to say that the US will, without a doubt, endure from this point forward a decline in the standard of living for the vast majority of its population.And the wildest part about it is that it is entirely self inflicted by the very people (at least 2/3 of them) that will endure the coming hardship.fudge","title":"Trump Says People Criticizing Supreme Court Justices Should Be Jailed"},{"text":"I would absolutely cut out anyone out of my life if they voted for a politician who does not respect my bodily autonomy, wants me locked up, wants me unjustly deported or wants me dead.

He stayed in, so there wasn't a competitive primary (normal for a party who holds the White House).The debate in late June made it clear Biden couldn't compete in the general. Once they finally convinced him to drop out, the primary was over. They faced two terrible options. A contested convention in August, in all likelihood producing a barely-viable candidate and tremendous resentment all around. They would have had less than two months to put together a slate of possible nominees. The nominees would then be voted on by Biden's delegates from each district, not the primary voters. The first round of voting wouldn't likely have secured a nominee, so a second round of voting with the superdelegates would be required. People don't understand the role of superdelegates, and the word has become so toxic that the mere mention stirs up resentment. The candidate produced would then have two months and change to start up and run a campaign. Or they could pass the torch from an unpopular incumbent to the unpopular incumbent's also unpopular and to this point nearly-invisible VP. However, than unpopular VP would at least have the benefit of already having a campaign staffed and funded. They'd also benefit from having an extra couple of months to campaign.

In fact, they just canceled any remaining deadlines after Trump won in 2024.Also, why dont you take some time and research what actually took place on Jan 6?? Because honestly, you sound very unintelligent claiming what you claim. Its not exactly all your fault though. Unfortunately, we have a very corrupt media and they fed the public lies and still continue to do so. Why exactly do you think the government fought so hard to not release the videos and evidence that they had?? Hmmm sounds familiar.JFK, 911 &amp; Pfizer Covid vax data.By the way, Who left in Air Force One? Who was the first president elect to not arrive in Air Force One? Who was denied access to the vice presidents mansion because of remodeling? Who had the military do an about face as they drove by?? An about face to the commander in chief is a guaranteed court marshal! Who had the 21 gun solute firing in a manner that signal a foreign dignitary (per the written code of instructions for the 21 gun solute). Who was sworn in before noon, which has never been done and also violates the 20th amendment of the constitution.

This trickle-down bigotry will ultimately create a system where servility to power and social division become normalised, eroding fairness for everyone. \\nWhether Trump can mobilise popular discontent over social and economic inequalities without alienating the oligarchs who support him remains an open question. In the months ahead, a struggle will unfold among factions within Trumps circle. Economic populists such as the Republican senator Josh Hawley and the vice-president-elect, JD Vance, will differ from libertarians such as Vivek Ramaswamy and the self-interested deregulatory agenda of Elon Musk. Trumps aim isnt to lift all boats, but rather to lift enough to convince voters to tolerate the corruption, consumer scams and environmental degradation that enrich a plutocratic class.

Like theres no way that if you average it out, that Democrats are less street smart than Republicans. It just doesnt make sense in so many ways. What streets are we on? Who lives on these streets where Democrats, a highly diverse and multicultural party, are not street smart.2. Democrats being fat and ugly is a stereotype.I agree with point 2. I also think its dumb for Republicans to say were fat and ugly while red states have historically high obesity rates. As in world history. And its not a big deal but it feels like a really bad line of attack. And say what you wants, but Democrats do not usually go for appearance attacks. 3. They close you off/surprising homogeneousI think this a people thing. I grew up in a hardcore Republican small town, went to college, the big city, etc and its the same. Church kids hang out with kids from their church. Rich white people and rich white people. Hot girls and hot girls. Everyone has their own little ecosystems. Besides just being Democrats theyre also people. A certain amount of that is extremely normal and really not political at all. 4.  Are Racist and Dont Acknowledge ItThis is a tricky one because as a Latino I get all the LatinX stuff but the big difference is I know they truly mean well and are just being stupid. Like its offensive but its mostly just a social faux pas on a massive scale. In terms of racism, I think while the Democrats have probably been racist, incidentally or accidentally or maybe just outright at times, they overall seem to have far less actual prejudice.5.  Never heard they were lame and wimpy yet did pot and sex parties.Yeah this was a huge one in rural Alabama. Democrats were stereotyped as too feminine to change a tire, yet also were running around doing drugs, selling drugs and having copious amounts of premarital sex. Jumping off buildings high off mushrooms. Scared to go to war. Doing weird shit like yoga and Buddhism. Wussies.Honestly typing that out I realized the Republican stereotype of Democrats is based off an assortment of negative stereotypes about black people and hippies with a spritz of stereotypes about academics and nerds.","title":"The Confederacy Won: Why Donald Trumps Reelection Is a Win for White Supremacy, Xenophobia &amp; Hate"},{"text":"Uhhh Diddy white parties.

The other is that you are well within your right to ask anyone who you feel threatens your safety (that goes for both of you) not to attend. I think this warrants a big discussion with your partner about safety, his apparent need to invite every family member, and priorities. Remember, marriage is ultimately a compromise in and of itself. If you two can't find a way to figure out a solution to the wedding problem that works for both of you, how can you reasonably expect to be able to compromise on bigger issues down the line as a married couple. I'll say you're absolutely justified in not wanting to invite homophobic guests to your wedding, but making an executive decision by yourself is the wrong move and will set a very bad precedent for your future together.

Ugly and fat despite all being part of a coastal elite class comprised of actors, supermodels, random rich people and pop starsThis is commenting on the average person rather than the elite.

I think it comes from the propaganda on feminist and LGBT using the unsavory pictures.Close minded despite living in some of the worlds most renowned global citiesThis i've found very true. If you don't agree or follow their mindset they completely close you off. Its rare to find friend groups with diverse views and opinion in global cities. It's surprisingly homogenous. Racist despite having a super diverse coalitionThis one I agree with. There is a lot of racism in the Democrats. The ones I hate is when they have opinions and actions that are racist but they think it isn't racist cause they're Democrat or they're being nice on their terms. Great example is Latinx. Almost everyone in the Latin community didn't like it and felt it was pretentious/racist since it was imposed on them by non-Latin Progressives. A lot of the diverse coalition is born from the \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\\". If Republicans didn't accept and act with so many racist elements, the Democrats would have a much weaker coalition.

There's definitely a potent strain of isolationism in Trump's movement, and he personally seems somewhat wary of foreign entanglements, but there are competing forces that could drive him into a conflict anyway. Trump is [expected](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-foreign-policy-china-russia-iran-ukraine-8c32cdf4?st=Fne5Ty) to attempt to intimidate our adversaries with shows of military force:With the world a more dangerous place than when President-elect Donald Trump first took office, current and former advisers expect he will navigate widening conflicts by building deterrence against foreign rivals while favoring transactional policies with U.S. allies. The U.S. hasnt been feared enough overseas during the Biden administration, according to these advisers. By showcasing American economic and military might, the second Trump presidency should bring peace or, at minimum, prevent further escalation in Ukraine, the Middle East and beyond, they said. Its going to be a return to peace through strength. Deterrence is going to be restored, said Trumps former national security adviser Robert OBrien, who could play a senior role in the incoming administration. That posture is not without risk. Deterrence is hollow if Trump is unwilling to back it up with force, and acting tough can create a situation where he might feel forced to respond to a provocation. In the extreme scenario of China invading Taiwan, I don't think we can really say how he would react. War with China would be absolutely horrific, but ceding Taiwan could also have enormous consequences, from economic devastation to losing American hegemony. Any president would face a tough choice in that situation. Trump just asked Mike Waltz, who is a China hawk, to be his National Security Adviser, so he will have people around him who would urge him not to back down.","title":"CMV: The US wont be in any major direct foreign conflict for the next 4 years because Trump was elected"},{"text":"Trump won with the same amount of votes he had against Biden.

The first one is Iran. In his presidency Trump already wanted to bomb Iran but was talked out of it by his \\"adults in the room\\" generals. Now he's going to put more yes men in the administration, which means that if he gets the same idea, there won't be anyone to talk him out of it. FBI also recently discovered a murder plot by Iran against him, which he will use as an excuse if he can't find anything else. There are most likely many generals who are itching to use their newest toys against someone and Iran would be a good size target (like Iraq was in 2003). So, the military industrial complex is probably on board with this as for them it's been too long since the US has properly been involved in a war.The other one is Russia but that's a bit more complicated. So, the worry is that Trump will just give Putin whatever peace he wants in Ukraine. At worst this makes Putin bold to try an invasion somewhere else, like Baltic countries. Then by NATO commitment the US is forced to join. Putin may try to talk Trump out of it, but I would think that that would be another massive miscalculation by Putin if he thinks that the US would just abandon its most important alliance just because Trump is leading the country. I don't think scenario is anywhere near as probable as the first.The one people talk about is China on Taiwan. I seriously don't think there is much difference between Trump and other presidents there. It's of course possible but in my opinion highly improbable.

There is virtually no acceptable talk of politics in any office outside of Capitol or White House. The only reason I know who is Republican or Democrat is based solely on the few who I follow on Facebook. Discussion of politics is normally pretty taboo and work is pretty far removed from the executive and legislative branch. Everyone wants to do their job, get paid, and go home. Having the Federal government start turning leadership positions in the offices and suboffices at the operations level into appointees instead of hiring based on merit will be disastrous. In order to impress their boss, many of these directors and supervisors are going to start pushing their staff to start juking the stats to make the administration look good. Problems will be ignored or go underreported until the problem gets so bad that it can't be anymore which by that time they've already be gone and it's the next admins problem.

The boat sailed on misinformation, but nearly a decade ago.  My point is that the media can say whatever they want.  The media didn't push Biden out of his campaign, the democrats and the left did.  The media does a lot of misinformation, but it's also serves the purpose of telling people what they want to hear - and part of that is recognizing the system of values we seem to share collectively values rhetoric and false promises over action and achievement, values ranting bullshit that doesn't stop to think versus someone old enough that they may stop to think during each sentence.  The media didn't make it uncool to be a democrat, or to support Joe Biden - although they played a part.  It was also the people and the narratives we give weight to.  Very few people would honestly call themselves a supporter of our current media environment, and the legacy media is being bought up largely because it's also on its last legs.

Too many examples of them working with one party more than the other. You can say it's exactly the same, but it's not and you know it. They were caught red-handed splicing answers for Kamala, giving questions to Hillary, only asking pre-approved questions to Biden, covering up for Biden's declining faculties, covering up the Hunter Biden laptop (50 CIA agents lied and swore it was fake. It wasnt), ignoring Biden's daughter's diary where she said she was molested by her father in the shower (this is confirmed as true), staying silent when Clinton's campaign was caught spying on Trump's, lying repeatedly about statements Trump made that were proven as purposefully quoted with false context (bloodbath, 1 example of many), cherry picking unreliable sources, the entire Russia collusion hoax (which was now without a doubt a hoax with zero conformable evidence beyond hearsay).And 99% of those things about Biden and his family, I couldn't care less about. I don't care if Hunter is a crack head and I think it has no impact on Biden's character or abilities, but the fact is they lied. They lied many, many, many, times. That is undeniable by anyone with a brain and a spine. For you to pretend that Fox news (or any other company owned by Newscorp) and their constant rage baiting of the 1000 racist old men who still watch their network, is on the same level as the blatant political nepotism that has been allowed to run rampant in this country is laughable.

She doesnt need a reason. It doesnt matter who wants it or how badly. She doesnt have to do it. It is her choice.There are lots of reasons women withhold sex. They may be tired, have their period, have no timeor they may be upset with a person for voting in favor of someone who is totally fine with pregnant women bleeding to death due to pregnancy complications bc the doctors are afraid of treating her due to threats of jail, loss of license, or being charged with murder. They may just decide they dont want to have sex when they themselves could die the same way if they got pregnant. It is their right to exercise discretion when choosing sexual partners, to choose not to let someone touch their bodies.Sex is weaponized by men constantly. Sexual misbehavior is so pervasive that laws had to be made to keep men from preying on women in the workplace and public spaces. There are laws against marital rape because some husbands think its their right to rape their wives. Women leave jobs due sexual harassment and predatory behavior. Women are groped, grabbed, felt up, and otherwise sexually violated. Women have been harassed in nearly every setting by men wanting sex: home, work, restaurants, bars, grocery stores, fitness clubs, schools, religious facilities, medical facilities, libraries, public transportation, et cetera, ad nauseam. Women are taunted by men shouting sexual garbage at them, causing daily stress to women who have the audacity to be in a public place. And lets not forget how women are sometimes raped, impregnated against their will, and forced to birth the children of rapists, under the threat of bleeding out because doctors are afraid to treat them. THIS is all sexual violence. A woman deciding not to have sex is never violence.

Project 2025 is The Heritage Foundations Mandate for Leadership, which is a collection of conservative policy recommendations, written for the next conservative administration. Theyve been writing their Mandates for Leadership for *decades* (more than 40 years) and every conservative president since Reagan has implemented some or all of their policy proposals. In his first term Trump and his administration implemented almost 2/3rds of that terms Mandate for Leadership. The Heritage Foundation proudly extolls this on their website here: [Trump Administration Embraces Heritage Foundation Policy Recommendations](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) (And no, Trump and his administration cannot be considered separate entities. He is not absolved from those decisions. Presidents bring entire administrations along with them to the White House where they work together as one team. He is responsible for implementing those policy proposals.)Trump also praised the Heritage Foundation and the work they were doing at a Heritage Foundation dinner in April 2022: [This is a great group, and theyre going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do and what your movement will do when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.](https://x.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1811402883604050216) [Heres a transcript of his keynote speech at the Heritage Foundation dinner if anyone would prefer not watching the video since the video link goes to Twitter.](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-keynote-speech-in-florida-4-21-22-transcript)Project 2025 was ALWAYS the plan.

Tariffs wont work and we know this. They simply do not function the way he describes them. I am actually not convinced at this point tariffs will add jobs and in fact, will cause a loss of jobs. American labor is expensive and forcing things back to the U.S. where cheap is the most important consumer factor will accelerate the shift to automation. I dont know what you do here other than lie to voters by just telling them what they want to hear. Reality doesnt seem to matter and people are ready to surrender their rights while holding Gadsden flags.Trump resonating better with men just shows how entrenched toxic masculinity is within the male population. He is a convicted rapist, serial cheater, abuser, and about as non-alpha a man as one can be. Idolizing a man who has all these negative qualities, while watching him mentally deteriorate in real time as he throws schoolyard insults is pathetic. Trump is a weak mans strong man and we need to figure out what specifically about him draws men in. I know not all of his male voters are cool with rape, pedophilia, etc.,","title":"AOC Shares Reasons Why Her Supporters Voted for Trump"},{"text":"There was at least one guy claiming and showing some proof of hacking voting machines back in 2020","title":"Democrat Ruben Gallego wins Arizona US Senate race against Republican Kari Lake"},{"text":"Sweet Summer Idiot Child","title":"Lets ask all the people Trump hasnt paid how fair he is"},{"text":"I won't spare you shit because the Democrats pushed these people away, you can't fault them for their desperation.
