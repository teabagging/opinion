However, it was an argument based on pedantry and technicality, and not necessarily a real attempt to prove OP's core idea wrong.  If I say, \\"no one *actually* ever liked Nickleback, CMV,\\" then any strong counterexample is a good argument, and deserves a delta.  If I say, \\"nuclear weapons don't make people safer\\" and someone points out that a dangerous intersection was once destroyed to make room for a nuke silo, then it's a technicality, and I'd acknowledge the cleverness, but I don't think it deserves a delta, which is supposed to be awarded for genuinely changing the view I actually hold.There is room for interpretation here, I guess, is what I mean.

You saw 20% of the electorate voting to both protect abortion and vote for the man who caused abortion to need to be protected in the first place.

But no one, literally 0% of the people, are 100% behind every single thing each party stands for.It is perfectly possible and internally consistent for an individual to want to protect abortion rights (generally seen as \\"democrat\\") yet still vote \\"republican\\". The reason could be that after having tallied up all the things they agree/disagree with in both parties and ordering them according to what they prioritize they concluded that they like the GOP-package more.That does not mean that agree 100% with everything that party stands for.

And so does moderation. I helped moderate a fan board and our #1 rule was: Do Not Be A Jerk.

Should the world be a shark tank?Do you have any aging relatives? Have you watched them gradually fall out of touch with the latest and greatest tech to the point where they might see a message that says \\"YOUR PHONE HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER. CLICK THIS LINK TO GET HELP WITH RECOVERING YOUR DATA!\\" I have seen more and more of this happening. Should these people be taken advantage of because they are old? How about someone with dimished capacity? Perhaps a learning disability. No fault of their own. Should we feel \\n\\"ok\\" about them being scammed just because we wouldn't be?This attitude starts becoming not just an occasional abberation, but turns into a business model. Payday loans anyone? How about predatory interest rates from well known national brands. It's just a business model now, because - hey - dumb people get scammed all the time. Its their fault they are so dumb/desperate. Someone is making a buck, so yay!

This is the enshittification of capitalism. Capitalism has done amazing things for humanity. It allows us to buy a car or a house without having all the money for it. Someone takes a risk on you and makes - hopefully - a fair profit for that risk. I was able to drive and live in a nice neighborhood before I had all the money for that. Capitalism let people build those cars and houses, because those factories and home builders didn't have the money in their pockets when they started either. *Things* were produced. *Lifestyles* were improved because of capitalism. And for that production in tangible things, money was paid into the system. Banks could now loan a few more bucks for further improvements in peoples lives. So What does crypto produce? Winners and losers? Are tangible things produced? Or is it all a zero sum game? I haven't seen anything to convince me that it's not the later. Hey, if gambling is your thing and you are going in to it fully aware, good luck. But coercion and hype come into play to get people to think that it functions like a real capitalist market that produces things and in turn makes money.TLDR, cryto is enshittification of capitalism and I don't feel good or even (shrug) neutral about it.

I'm gonna go with the latter.In other words, yes, Trump and his MAGA coalition instinctively side with the villains. But this isn't anything new. It's not like, all of a sudden, these people are showing their true colors. These so-called \\"cautionary tales\\" are actually tales of exploit in the eyes of Trump followers. While an event like January 6th for instance, should have been the only cautionary tale we needed, it eventually became a sort of rallying cry for Trump and his supporters.And I think what's worse, is that the folks belonging to this movement are under the impression that *they're* the good guys. That this is a war between the forces of good versus evil, and they're on the right side of history. But the reality is, the villains in this scenario, who are almost cartoonishly corrupt, have devoted so much time, energy, and resources into persuading a large chunk of the voting population that not only is there a war in the first place, but it's a war to preserve and defend the country from a monster that is largely of their own making.I mean, I know the term gets tossed around a lot, but these are major tenets of fascism.*Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**Powerful and Continuing Nationalism**Obsession with Crime and Punishment*Obviously there are more parallels to draw, but this illustrates the point.How this reactionary, ultra nationalistic, counterrevolutionary movement is not only unified by its extreme disdain and contempt for a radical leftist scapegoat and boogeyman, but is convinced that any action is justified in the name of defending *their* country from this enemy. Hence why Judge Dredd and cartoonishly evil villains are glorified by these people.In their minds, the bad guys become the good guys because the bad guys are just doing what's necessary to protect themselves, their country, their culture, their families, their *coughs* superiority *coughs* from whatever monster of the week is threatening these important things.","title":"Trumps Fans Are Suffering From Tony Soprano Syndrome | Some conservatives are embracing the villains in what are supposed to be cautionary tales"},{"text":" Why are we all just letting this happen?Most people in our society have unwavering support in a systemic justice machine that has long since been dismantled and sold for parts. \\"Violence is not the answer\\" they will say, even as they are crushed to death by a laughing billionaire. \\"Surely there's a better way!\\"","title":"Elon Musk spent a quarter-billion dollars electing Trump, including financing mysterious 'RBG PAC'"},{"text":"Say this pic is awesome on a post in the pics subreddit and watch what will happen, simply because youre a member of this sub.","title":"Is it just me or is Reddit full of trump haters?"},{"text":"Seems like who gives a fuck to me.

Generally speaking, ones model for justice should not be a fascist invented in part to illustrate the distinction between elite impunity and the brutality that ordinary people face. (Were Dredds zero tolerance for lawbreaking evenly applied to obscenely wealthy scofflaws like Musk himself, it would surely be less appealing to him.)Musks media illiteracy is not particularly shockingit seems to be part of a broader trend tied to the rise of Donald Trump. Genre stories that are meant to highlight the dangers of fascism, cruelty, or selfishness instead end up being misinterpreted or even condemned by those who find fascism appealing or see cruelty and selfishness as aspirational virtues....As Trump reshapes the nation in his image, some of his supporters seem inclined to turn cautionary tales on their head, empathizing with villains or antiheroes to such a degree that they miss the point of these stories entirely, even when the writers make the message as clear as possible. We might call this problem Tony Soprano Syndrome, after the patron saint of flawed antihero protagonists. One undecided voter told a New York Times focus group earlier this year that Trump is the antihero, the Soprano, the Breaking Bad, the guy who does bad things, who is a bad guy but does them on behalf of the people he represents.Almost every single thing here is wrong, but its wrong in a way that illustrates the illiteracy that I am talking about. The Sopranos is by any measure one of the greatest television series of all time, focusing on the daily travails of a mob boss who tries to balance his mental health with keeping his marriage together and raising his children. But Tony is a murderer whose greed and ambition harm the people he claims to love. He is not a moral exemplar, nor is he intended to be; his selfishness helps no one else and is destructive to all around him. The same is true of Walter White, the protagonist of Breaking Bad, who at one point in the show literally looks at the camera and says of his crimes, I did it for me....Examples abound. Last year, another heavy-handed comic-book adaptation, the television series The Boysabout a covert-ops group that targets the irresponsible corporate-produced supers who kill more people than they actually savemade its criticism of fascism so overt that many of its fascist-sympathetic fans began to get upset. These fans complained that the show had gotten woke once the plot began to more plainly illustrate the political points it had been making all along, to the dismay of those fans who were living vicariously through the antagonists acts of cruelty.Similarly, the creators of the murderous Marvel Comics vigilante the Punisher have repeatedly clarified, to no avail, that, despite possessing some virtues, the character of Frank Castle is not a good guy. In addition to being a murderer, he is occasionally portrayed as a fascist. During the Civil War storyline, Castle is told off by his idol, Captain America, who describes Castle as  psychotic, fulfilling a twisted notion of justice. The Punisher creator Gerry Conway has called the embrace of Punisher iconography by real-life armed agents of the state disturbing, because the Punisher represents a failure of the Justice system. Hes supposed to indict the collapse of social moral authority and the reality [that] some people cant depend on institutions like the police or the military to act in a just and capable way.It's been evident for a while that the people idolizing these characters and stories have either never actually read/watched these shows, or have utterly failed to understand what it is they were consuming. This speaks to a far deeper cultural failure, especially with the education system and how it is seemingly unable to teach critical thinking and reasoning skills to many students.","title":"Trumps Fans Are Suffering From Tony Soprano Syndrome | Some conservatives are embracing the villains in what are supposed to be cautionary tales"},{"text":"Trump has never expressed even the slightest interest in following rule of law.","title":"Biden is considering preemptive pardons for officials and allies before Trump takes office"},{"text":"Was going to say \\"wait I've seen this one before ??\\"","title":"Nothing To Spare: GOP To Be Left With Single-Seat House Majority, Jeopardizing Trumps Agenda"},{"text":"Its so strange how many left wingers are cool with censorship","title":"Is it just me or is Reddit full of trump haters?"},{"text":"If the rule of law breaks down then there are few other options.","title":"Elon Musk bankrolled the pro-Trump troll campaign RBG pac"},{"text":"$250 Million to become the true president.

A simple majority in the house means if one or two people aren't there, you can't get anything passed.  It means if one or two \\"moderates\\" or independents who usually caucus with you but aren't die-hard allies abstain or only vote \\"present\\" or cross the aisle because they sometimes agree with the other folks on certain issues, or have pledged support for a certain position or bill in return for similar favors in return, you can't get anything passed.  It means if people travel home to be present in their district to serve constituents or make public appearances, or speak at graduations, or break ground at new construction projects, or meet with local or state officials, or business people, you can't get anything passed.  If someone has a car accident and is out for a few months, you can't get anything passed.  If your bill is very progressive and some folks in your caucus are \\"moderate\\", they won't vote for it.   All these things have happened before and will happen again.  In the senate, if you only have a simple majority, the filibuster keeps you from doing anything if the other side is adamant enough about their own positions, or just insistent enough on stonewalling everything you want to do.  The filibuster is strictly a senate invention indeed, but if you pass something with huge support in the house, the senate filibuster can still prevent it from passing in the senate and ever becoming law.  Trump will find ways to attempt what he wants through executive orders, and through circumventing or ignoring the law and constitution, and without congress enacting his policies, *just like the last time*, and even more so this time because he and his party and advisors and future cabinet members and department/agencies leaders have all been planning and plotting since he was ousted last time.  And he's not going to appoint or hire anybody who will thwart him and resist him and advise him against what he wants, like he had in his sphere last time.  If there's any damage control accomplished for the next four years, it's only going to be minor enough to keep us from racing over the precipice immediately.

Many of the other MAGAs can get the rural margins needed, but they dont juice the turnout in those areas nearly enough and they tend to get completely wiped out in the suburbs as those areas see the emulators as the extremists they are. A good way to look at this is to look at their electoral record outside 2016, 2020, and 2024 (the 3 years Trump himself has been on the ballot). In the Trump era, their electoral record outside these 3 years is downright abysmal. The one exception is 2021, but that election happened at the absolute low point for Democrats in the Biden era. Even this year, the bullet votes cast for Trump were more than his match of victory in at least WI, MI, PA and NV and this very well may have been the case in AZ, GA, and NC as well.

The problem is that there isn't any cap on how rich you can get, and eventually a system that grows and consolidates in an unregulated market centralizes naturally (larger and larger companies generating proportionally more and more profit) and becomes a source of ultimate unending wealth disparity where any form of advancing up the ladder becomes increasingly difficult because of the sheer scale of the wealth disparity and the ability to effect political change becomes intertwined with whoever is backed by larger and large [political doners.](https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/biggest-donors). Combine that with the same people having expert networks feeding them information about when to buy and sell specific stocks, and when certain laws are going to be passed...etc.At a certain point the wealthiest people have so much compared to everyone else that they can't even comprehend on a human level what it's like to live in the lower classes of society at all. There isn't even any concept they have because they are so unfathomably wealthy the access to power is just present around them at all times.When you have the level of wealth disparity like the U.S. currently has, you're going to get some kind of societal blowback from it. The US is literally known as a 'make it or break it' society because of the lack of social safety nets, and even the smaller nets are gearing up to get torn down by champions of the disregulation and dismantling of all institutional government.It doesn't seem like it's in the best interest of the wealthiest nation on the planet to allow 99.99% of the population to effectively be completely bankrupt from medical emergencies.

It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were- cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?'\\"\\n- O'Brien, *1984*","title":"Billionaire Jeff Bezos Wants to 'Help' Trump Gut Regulations | \\n\\"Shockingly another one of the richest guys on Earth wants to defund our government and scrap regulations.\\""},{"text":"They have holes that can never be filled.

And every year since then, it's exploded.  This year, there were [699 bills in 43 states, and 48 passed](https://translegislation.com/) - there weren't even 48 bills *considered* nationwide in any year prior to 2019.  What changed?  Well, looking at the rhetoric coming from a lot of American right-wing mouthpieces around anti-trans policies, you'll see a shift somewhere around 2021 towards using some of the TERF-y language that came from the UK's unique brand of bigotry - language about protecting \\"women's spaces\\" and attempts to couch their arguments in 'feminist' language - appropriating feminist vocabulary to push arguments *for* sex-based discrimination and rigid oppositional sexism.  Anti-trans bills and activists also seemed to pivot to focusing on bans or limits to trans healthcare, and efforts to discredit trans healthcare using misinterpreted or often simply incorrect data to paint our healthcare as harmful - this allows them to portray their bills as *helping* us.  Platforming 'detransitioners' (and paying them handsomely, as has been revealed in a couple of email leaks) and using quack doctors who disagree with evidence-based care (and also usually happen to disagree with the efficacy of vaccines, go figure) are common UK TERF tactics that became common here - generally, the right-wing has gotten *really* comfortable with paying incredibly dodgy people with questionable credentials to carry their message because they've figured out that sensationalism and a title will carry their message much further than careful, credible messengers (which is generally how things go in the UK, too) Speaking of the tactics behind the proliferation of anti-trans legislation, check out [this leak of emails between state legislators](https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/the-emails/) from 2019-2021, when they were pushing one particular anti-trans bill.  It's really revealing (and also, it's 2600 pages and involved a bunch of right-wing anti-trans activists talking to the legislators and to each other, so you can spend a *lot* of time combing through it and analyzing their planning and coordination)","title":"Trans Activist Chelsea Manning Uses Ladies' Room in Capitol Building to Protest Republican Bathroom Ban"},{"text":"The Left would go fucking insane.","title":"Village People founder says the group would \\"seriously consider\\" playing live at Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"Ha ha ha!!!!","title":"Steelworkers Feel 'Gut Punch' as Trump Plans to Block Takeover"},{"text":"Can you cite examples?\\nLiterally asking.","title":"Trump promises a crackdown on diversity initiatives.

There's so much shit going on that he just needs to make one crisis look like an existential threat to America and declare martial law like he has also promised. If nothing serious enough presents itself within the first year, they will manufacture a crisis. I do think if he goes about his deportation crackdown they way he's said, he'll be doing it in hopes that it causes visible flare ups of social unrest. Anything at all and he'll claim he has no choice but to declare martial law and take the reigns.Day one he'll try and declare an emergency over immigration.  Taking bets now.  I think that's the only way he actually can execute the deportation ... but I also believe that there are enough conservative benefactors who risk losing a lot of money over mass deportation so it'll never actually happen, much like the wall that was promised.  Some song and dance to show \\"hey we're'a gonn'a get'cha\\", maybe a few raids, and then a lot of bluster with no results. I fully expect him to try to seize full unchecked controll with the first news story showing someone throwing a brick through a window. Hell, if there are more assassinations or attempts like the one from this week, I think we could about guarantee he'll give it a whirl.Chances are good, but there are checks on how long he can declare anything like that for ... and per my initial point, there are too many power hungry individuals in Congress to let him have absolute authority.IMO, Vance has been laying low post-election and allowing Trump to blunder all over the place.  They'll let Trump run wild for a few months and sometime mid next year they'll stage a coup via the 25th and declare him unfit for office.

Abortion rights being one obvious example.I always found the loneliness epidemic being a male problem to be a bit silly.  All the things that isolate men do the same thing to women, and social media has made long-standing problems women face even worse for them.  Not to say there isn't a real problem with our lack of face-to-face relationships and the superficiality of the social media world, but that's not a uniquely male problem.

Open admission that they all have dirt on each other, no wonder that all toe the line.","title":"House Republicans vote to block release of Gaetz ethics report"},{"text":"Where do you even start with such a demonstrative false equivalence? Hunter Biden is not, has not, and never will be the president of the United States. Hunter Biden was excoriated and dragged through the mud for 5 years as the target of relentless partisan inquiries and investigations, media smear campaigns, political scrutiny, public harassment, which all amounted to a waste of time, because in the end, He was prosecuted for a crime the tens of thousands of Americans get away with every year. If Trump were prosecuted for lying on a gun form, his supporters would be having a collective conniption fit.Even most authorities on the matter have called the prosecution highly unusual due to how infrequently it is prosecuted in the first place, let alone including the involvement of Congressional committees, special counsels, and the DOJ.There is a massive difference between targeting the president's son in such a brazen manner and investigating a series of crimes committed by a former president, who is a serial fraud and known notoriously for his criminal misconduct and abuse of the justice system. And crimes that are all far more grievous and damning than anything Republicans could even fantasize about implicating Hunter Biden for.Not only that, but by comparison, Trump's crimes were more plentiful and subsequent investigations were backed by clearer and more incriminating evidence.This is not just a flagrant false equivalence, but also a double standard.If you compare the situations of Hunter Biden and Donald Trump side by side, you should be able to conclude that the differences are extensive. Thinking that Hunter's pardon justifies even more immunities for Trump is absurd.Hell, prior to this pardon, I didn't hear anyone trying to justify it by pointing to the rampant cronyism and favoritism that Trump legitimized after he pardoned several corrupt allies and co-conspirators, some of which he's welcomed back into his inner circle.Biden argued that raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice\\"But Trump uses this exact same language to describe the countless indictments, investigations, and lawsuits against *him*. All of which were warranted to some degree. Donald Trump has not only been exploiting his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system throughout his entire life, while evading accountability for his crimes and misconduct, but even as president, he used his executive privilege to avoid being incriminated for his blatant and frequent attempts to obstruct justice.Since then, he has been granted broad immunities by a kowtowing group of loyalists, immunities and privileges he has used to obstruct and delay the legal process.Trump has also made a number of unconstitutional threats against his political opponents and adversaries, warning them that he intends to abuse his power as president to seek retribution against them. This is a man who has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which illustrate his penchant for fraud, coercion, elusiveness and corruption.Trump has literally been charged with \\"defrauding the United States,\\" with conspiring to overturn an election, with disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans, with intimidating election officials into manipulating the vote for him, with attempting to install loyalists into positions of power within agencies like the DOJ, where they can help *him* steal the election. All of which Trump has been able to avoid convictions for due to his recent election win and his exploitation of the justice system. By contrast, Hunter was charged and actually convicted of lying on a gun form... He was also charged with not paying his taxes, which he eventually paid back.Trump has established himself as an infamous and serial cheater. He cheats on his wives, he cheats on his taxes, he lies about his wealth and the value of his properties, he even cheats at golf...And despite all this, when Joe Biden offers his son a pardon, after he was maligned for years, humiliated and scandalized, investigated by Congress, special counsel, and by the DOJ... after he became the target of relentless partisan inquiries and committee hearings, after the public harassment, the political scrutiny, the Media smear campaigns, all of which amounted to a waste of time, but eventually ended in him being prosecuted for a crime that most Americans get away with every year, a prosecution that even authorities on the matter have called highly unusual, after all of this, Donald Trump should be granted yet another immunity claim? Should be held to an even lower standard? Face less accountability?This is just like what happened during Harris's campaign. Because Donald Trump is a notorious and serial shitstirrer, because his absurdity has magically rendered him benign, because corruption, malfeasance, cronyism, obstruction of justice, the endless incoherent ramblings and emotional tirades at rallies, public events, during interviews, press conferences, via TruthSocial, etc, because his violent rhetoric and unconstitutional threats are just another day for Donald Trump, we've practically sane washed and normalized his misconduct.So the bar for Trump remains perpetually low, while his opponents are held to such a high standard that they're expected to be irreproachable by comparison.","title":"John Fetterman says Hunter Biden, Trump both deserve pardons after 'politically motivated' trials"},{"text":"We also need to point out that men who want women in the men's room are perverts.","title":"Trans Activist Chelsea Manning Uses Ladies' Room in Capitol Building to Protest Republican Bathroom Ban"},{"text":"If Trump cuts Ukraine off then I see no reason for Ukraine to listen to the US in what they target and where.","title":"Trump's plan for Ukraine comes into focus: NATO off the table and concessions on territory"},{"text":"Truly, truly: they are.

Matt Gaetz of Florida.The House took a step to effectively shut down a resolution from Democrats that would have required the public release of the report.

Like how Dr Fauci became public enemy number one after Trump mismanaged the COVID pandemic at nearly every turn.Which is why the banks and financial or business partners were to blame after he amassed unsustainable debts.Which is why he has lied about his wealth throughout his entire career, even lying to get on the Forbes list, or lying about the value of his properties.Which is why he accuses his opponents of being cheaters despite his pattern of adultery, cheating on his taxes, on his financial records, even at golf. Which is why he's always the victim, why he's always being legally persecuted and undermined by his opponents and naysayers, despite the fact that he threatens to sue anyone who hurts his precious feelings, despite the fact that he's been involved in over 4,000 legal cases himself. The list goes on and on...And despite all of this, Republicans still trust Donald Trump with their loyalty... It's absurd.That being said, if you want access to Trump's cabinet, his inner circle, even if you seek his favor, you must offer something in exchange. This is typically in the form of unconditional loyalty,  campaign contributions and donations, endorsements and flattery, political leverage, and in some cases, promises to help him subvert the election results and/or interfere in the election via massive propaganda and disinformation campaigns on social media. I'm looking at you Elon Musk. I mean, Musk turned Twitter into a MAGA propaganda platform, contributed millions to his campaign, and in return, received a director position within a made up government agency.This total capitulation and loyalty to Trump is nothing other than rampant cronyism. Come January 21st of next year, The Trump administration will begin flooding the government with people whose positions depend largely on their allegiance to the president.And through executive actions like schedule F and by way of unitary executive privilege, The Trump Administration will also be cleansing government agencies of anyone not loyal to Trump or the MAGA agenda.","title":"Trump Donors Who Give at Least $1 Million or Raise $2 Million Get Inaugural Access"},{"text":"Reddit reminds me of GameFAQs in high school, just with much broader subject matter. The same regulars posted on specific boards, you'd learn who's a regular of the boards you frequent, and then randomly notice people on other boards when you ventured out. With Reddit, I mostly hang out here and in a kebble sub I'm in for general chatter, venture out for random stuff where I also recognize some people from the smaller specific interest subs, and I'll sometimes do a double take as I see someone usually on sub x on a totally unrelated sub. On the flip side, I've gotten more than one \\"I recognize you from x sub!\\" on a totally unrelated sub.The whole social aspect of the internet is so fascinating. I see Reddit as a natural evolution of the message boards of old, where it's kinda between that and other social media. It's absolutely a social media site and even major public figures sometimes use it, but it retains more of the message board feel than most other social media sites/apps.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 5, 2024"},{"text":"Because it's in the constitution","title":"Yet another Trumpist coward too afraid to question their cult leader.

Its going to happen this time around though, and would have no matter who got elected.

I'm talking about the equivalent amount of hydrogen that it would take a vehicle to travel the same distance as a gallon of gasoline. That's what would cost $10, that's just the cost of the electricity needed to break the water down into hydrogen and oxygen. That's not even including the cost of compressing the hydrogen to usable levels, containers for the hydrogen that are insulated (think big chunks of ice on the hydrogen tank on the space shuttle), road safe (Challenger go BOOM!), and easily changeable. 2) The transmission I'm talking about is electricity transmission. That $10 electricity cost per gallon equivalent to make the hydrogen means it costs $150 for the same miles driven as a tank of gasoline (15 gallon fill-up) in your average passenger vehicle. That's the same amount of electricity it takes to power my 1 bedroom apartment for 2 months. 2 fill-ups per week means you need enough electricity per month to power that apartment for over a year. We don't have the power generation or transmission lines for that level of power needed, and if we did, where would that power come from? Fossil fuels. 3) Hydrogen may be the most abundant substance in the universe, but 99% of it is trapped in the fusion reactors we call stars. 4) Thorium reactors aren't going to happen for the same reason the US doesn't produce the lithium we need. The methods needed for refining it are huge and horribly polluting and everyone in the US has a NIMBY mentality due to the environmentalist movement. 5) I included the water vapor argument because not only is it true, but also because it's what the left will argue.

Biden was also clearly hurt by the party rallying for him to step down, which is why he tossed his endorsement to Kamala right away against Pelosis wishes.

Or also refuse to do her duties because she spends her time bullying citizens who rightfully demand positive change in America).Also, who knows what a deranged treasonous individual like MTG wants to be pardoned from. Knowing her, it could range from anything from theft, to physical assault, human trafficking, acts of terrorism, murder, or possibly even high treason.

And much of the debate has focused on the gender gap - why men, including a lot more nonwhite men than in previous years, chose to vote for Trump.  In a scene straight out of my nightmares, a lot of the mainstream discourse is pure Reddit.What I mean is, as another user put it, \\"But WHAT ABOUT MEEEEEN?\\"Let me stop the replies before they start: Men matter.  They face real issues that need to be taken seriously, and need to be addressed by our leaders.  And if you sincerely care about this, you need to pay attention here, because you've got a lot of fake allies who are hurting your cause in the name of keeping women quiet.**Crashing the conversation**This time, we'll start with our word of the day: [Derailing!](https://speak-up.org/derail/)  In a nutshell, derailing is making statements that shift away from the main point of an important conversation.  Take a look at that link for tons of examples of how this is done.  It makes the point that derailing is usually unintentional...but sometimes, it's completely intentional.So, how does derailing apply in US politics?  It's often used to prevent a real discussion, as any debate with Donald Trump has shown.  Right now, it's being used to prevent a conversation about the role sexism played in his win.I've already discussed at length the different ways sexism hurt Harris, and has hurt other female politicians.  But the dominant narrative about this has been \\"Well, Democrats should have cared about men's issues!\\"  Which...they did.  Just Google \\"Kamala Harris plans for men\\" and you'll see several examples.  Hell, Google \\"Donald Trump plans for men\\" if you want to see how much he cares about them.But the point is: This attempt to blame Harris for not caring about men isn't based in reality.  It's an attempt to shut down the conversation about sexism.  When peoples' arguments can be disproven with two seconds on Google, they haven't thought them through or are trying to cover up something darker.**What's the problem, anyway?**I'm going to repeat that men do matter, and face genuine concerns.  I feel the need to, because I'm about to critique the whole idea of 'men's issues', and want to make it clear I still care about the guys.  So, let's get down to business!I read a *lot* of articles trying to figure out the issues men feel they are facing - because a lot of people who say \\"Men have issues, too!\\" never bother to say what those issues are.  Sign of a well-meaning advocate right there.  Anyway, I ignored the ones that talked about how Democrats 'look like the womens' party', because I already addressed that in Episode 5, and this chat is supposed to be about issues, not vibes.  And I found a few that came up repeatedly:1. Mental health2. Economic opportunity3. Education4. A general sense of 'not belonging'These are all real issues, and they affect lots of men, and I don't want to suggest otherwise.  **But these aren't male-specific issues.**[I'll let the researchers do the talking on this,](https://euideas.eui.eu/2024/10/30/mens-issues-or-issues-of-the-patriarchy/) but the short version is: These \\"mens' issues\\" either affect men and women equally, are better explained by factors such as race or class, or are actively being worked on by Democrats and other left-wing parties around the world.  (And those dastardly, man-hating feminists!)  Even the [general sense of not belonging](https://www.sharp.com/health-news/why-do-so-many-men-feel-lonely) can largely be explained by sexist stereotypes of what men 'should' be, or by things that affect women at least as much such as social media and a lack of third spaces.So I think the idea of men's issues is a bit of a red herring.  To repeat myself, I'm not saying that men don't face problems.  But **they don't face problems because they're male, specifically.**  The problems they do face are actually explained by other factors, and it's Democrats (in America) taking steps to fix them.No, the fixation on men's issues is a derailing tactic.  But what's being derailed?**Have you ever noticed...**I've been on Reddit for more than nine years now.  I don't recommend it, but in that time I've noticed a disturbing trend that still exists.Go into any large thread about a woman being hurt by men in some way.  I promise you'll find plenty of people pointing out how it happens to men, too.  This is true of sexual violence, mental health challenges, having an abusive partner, being cheated on...anything, really.  (In fact, some highly-upvoted posts would have you believe that *men* have it worse than women in all of these areas, but that's a topic for another day).Do all those things happen to men?  Yes.  But isn't it strange that every time a woman posts about it happening, the conversation suddenly shifts to how hard men have it?  **This is what I mean by 'derailing'.**  On big subs, women can't even talk about their own experiences without the conversation eventually shifting to how hard men have it.  In fact, I've seen a number of people have to include a statement like \\"I know not all men do this...\\" or \\"I know this happens to men, too...\\" in a bid to avoid making the boys upset.  (Not something I'd have to do multiple times, of course!)Oh, and one more important point: The guys doing this **do not care about men who are hurting.**  They tend to be manosphere jerks, who love blaming women but do nothing to improve men's lives.  Even the ones who aren't seem to spend their energy sitting online trying to speak over women.  There's no actual effort to make things better.  If they were interested in helping, they'd probably be working with groups trying to help - like, say, the Democrats.**Talking about the issues**When a woman tries to post about abuse and the conversation becomes about how men get abused, that's derailing.When a woman loses the Presidency because of sexism and the conversation is about how she should have cared more about men *when she did and her opponent didn't*, and how she didn't care about men's issues *that affect everyone and which she was talking about regularly*, that's derailing.Way back in Episode 1, I asked why pundits are scared of an honest conversation about the role sexism played in the Presidential election.  This talk is about how they've avoided that conversation.  It sounds very nice: Men do face real issues, like everyone, and men swung drastically to Trump.  But it's derailed a vital conversation about issues that only women face.  Like the right to decide what to do with a pregnancy they don't want, which could be used to control or kill them.  Or the right to be paid the same as their male counterparts, and have the same opportunity to rise up the ladder if they want to.  Or the safety of knowing that their President doesn't shake with contempt for their gender, and can commit sexual violence against them and still win.Those issues are why women get upset about politics, guys.  And the derailing isn't helping.In closing - these conversations will go to uncomfortable places sometimes.  Your feelings do matter, and the issues you face also matter.  We're going to keep working for a better world for everyone, of every gender.But Donald Trump is President, which put a real damper on that goal.  Sexism was one of his most potent weapons, as this series has discussed.  And the *only* way we weaken sexism is by rejecting its tricks and lies.  Then we can focus on reality, and lifting up everyone.  And when we solve any one of these issues, it helps us all.Your issues matter.  Let's lessen the grip of sexism and make a better world for everyone.Yes, that was an attempt to prevent derailing in the comments.**Questions to consider**1. Do you see derailing used in other contexts, especially in politics?2. Has someone tried to derail a conversation on something really important to you?  How did you respond?3. How can we show men we do care about their needs without playing into ideas that put women down?4. Any other thoughts?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 5, 2024"},{"text":"the corruption is the pointget prepared for corruption and theft on a scale never seen","title":"An architect of Project 2025 is pressuring Republican senators to confirm Pete Hegseth"},{"text":"Anything that is close should be automatically recounted.

Looking at the [Wikipedia article for List of Counties in Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Oregon) the population adds up to 242,593 over an area of 56,019 square miles. The overall population of [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon) is 4,233,358 with a total land area of 98,381 square miles. So these 13 counties actually represent **5.7% of the population and 58.35% of the landmass**. Even when it's something non-consequential like that, they clearly can't stop lying. In terms of the Presidential election, these 13 counties broke 73/27 for Trump with [86,720 votes for him and 32,077 for Vice President Harris](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html). This would have changed Oregon's overall vote from a 57% win for Harris to a 59% win, and Idaho's vote from a 68% win for Trump to a 69% win. However, the current allocation of Representatives is roughly one Representative per ~750,000 citizens, so there is a small-ish chance that moving those counties across would give Idaho a 5th electoral vote or lose Oregon one of their 8.

Without the government a lawsuit would be meaningless. A newspaper, or rather its operators, can also be held criminally liable for the things they print. Telling them what to host or not to host on an individual basis would be censorship. Its a good thing that no one on the right has suggested doing that. It would be even better if the left felt the same way. Requiring social media to be non-discriminatory, or to accept criminal and civil liability for what their users post, would not be censorship. If a social media platform wants to ban political speech they should be free to do so, in a non-discriminatory manner. They can ban Trump for expressing his political beliefs, but they must also ban AOC for expressing hers. Singling out users who disagree with them is not just censorship, it is tyranny. If they want to have the status of a publisher, I am fine with that, then they can censor their users to their hearts content, but they must be criminally and civilly liable for whatever their users post. That means every death threat that is sent, every riot that is incited, and every reputation that is libeled through the platform, they are responsible.","title":"\\nDonald Trump, Elon Musk and the threat to press freedom"},{"text":"See, what you're doing is thinking.\\nThat's a bit out of their wheelhouse.","title":"Donald Trump Asked to Help Redraw Border Between US States"},{"text":"Ding, ding, ding!
