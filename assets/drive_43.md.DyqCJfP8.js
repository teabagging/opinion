They will commit violence or support political violence for things that are exponentially less important than an assassination attempt.

No matter why we continue to shake our heads over why this election is so close, the point is that people need to get out and vote.

But other people may be reading this exchange so I'd like to share William Gruff's excellent explanation of why Russia is proceeding so slowly.  He published this at Moon of Alabama: Knowing the Russians' clearly stated objectives (denazification, demilitarization, deNATOification), it is obvious why they are not prioritizing territory and advancing more rapidly. Advancing is not necessary for the Russians so long as the Ukrainians remain obliging enough to keep sending Nazis with NATO gear to them. It is so much easier to destroy Nazis if they come to you rather than having to go and find Nazis to kill. It is actually harder to explain why the Russians advance at all. As I see it, there are three reasons why the Russians advance at this point. First is just to push Nazi terrorists further away from innocent civilians. We all know that US backed fascist death battalions, be they in Latin America, Southeast Asia, or Eastern Europe, are most comfortable with terrorizing civilians, so the Russians are trying to create a bit of space between the innocents and the monsters. Second is that if the Ukrainians retreat, then the Russians will run out of nearby Nazis to kill and so need to advance to continue pursuing their stated objectives. Third is that the back-and-forth action we've seen in some areas allows the Russians to more efficiently exterminate Nazis. To be sure, retreat is dangerous, but not so much if it is planned in advance. Consider the sequence: The Russians rout the Nazis from one position and give brief pursuit, overrunning the position. The Nazis reorganize and reinforce and then counterattack to retake the position. Meanwhile, though, the Russians move up firepower that would otherwise be impractical, like the TOS-1 for example, and prepare sequential kill zones to be activated as their troops withdraw under covering fire. Now when the Nazi meat wave arrives, the Russian troops fall back to prepared positions with minimal engagement, drawing the Nazis into the kill zones to be obliterated. The TOS-1 is difficult to use in assaults because its range is so much shorter than other artillery, but for sanitizing prepared kill zones it is delightfully effective. In any case, if the withdrawal is planned in advance and is an expected part of the operation, then it can be accomplished with minimal, or even no, losses. Such a withdrawal is not the same as a retreat, as the risks are dramatically lower. This is what we are really seeing in many locations along the LOC where it appears the Russians are repeatedly taking a position and then being driven out. In fact the Russians are performing planned withdrawals without losses while the Nazis are getting horrifyingly mauled. This is part of why the attrition ratio is eye-wateringly appalling for the Nazis. If the Nazis stop attacking, then the Russians will have to come up with something else, but for now the Russians can continue to just consolidate territory only after the Nazis give up on trying to retake it. That might seem slow to some, but right now it is the most efficient way to denazify, demilitarize, and deNATOify. Posted by: William Gruff | May 4 2024 20:34 utc | 234This was published before Ukraine's Kursk invasion.  Ukraine obviously read this analysis and decided that it would be great to take their best soldiers and best equipment from the front and deliver them into Russia so they could be destroyed more efficiently.  Meanwhile Ukraine weakened its front so that Russia could more quickly take over the Donbas.  That was kind of Ukraine  the SMO will be over quicker and the rebuilding can begin.","title":"Jill Stein responds to an attack by Minnesota AG Keith Ellison: \\"The Democrats show up every 4 years with lavish promises, then toss them after Election Day...\\""},{"text":"Of course.

Countries which have faced conflict in the past have understandable mistrust between them and it is a realistic possibility that they if they demilitarize then the other country will take advantage and attack them. The only solution could be for some world government or much stronger force to force both countries to demilitarize which is a form of an authoritarian world government which most people are against(UN is somewhat of an example of trying this and failing).

They wanted a President elected by Congress. Still democratic as Congressional representatives are directly elected by their constituency. Why shouldn't they be entrusted to electing the head of state?\\n2. Direct election by the people.The problems seen with the former are a chummy relationship between the legislative and executive branch in which a President could get elected on deals and favors.The problems with the second are much more severe in my opinion. Direct election by the people could result in a democratic mob (tyranny of the majority) leading the country in whatever terrible and misguided direction they want. Next, the founders were weary of populism. A President that appeals directly to the people on promises and charisma can command dangerous amounts of power.The Electoral College was a compromise between the two factions. And the Electoral College is still influenced by popular vote. Therefore, despite the electoral college those concerns with the people voting for president remains as popular Presidents, wartime Presidents (George Bush post-9/11), etc. have shown to wield dangerous amounts of power, extending the powers of the executive branch far beyond anything the founders ever intended.Removing the electoral college is not a threat to democracy, but your suggestion of direct democracy IS a threat to our democracy. Congressional appointment or election is preferable to your suggestion.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"You'd have better luck telling a shark to not go after blood in the water.","title":"Hillary Clinton condemns terrible Trump assassination attempt, but he should try to calm the waters"},{"text":"I dont think even the bots over at r/politics would believe this.","title":"NAACP poll claims voters are more excited to vote for Kamala Harris in 2024 than they were for Barack Obama in 2008 ??"},{"text":"At this point the race is looking pretty stable.

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjhMYv1z0ws) for an example of what they did to Trump in the media with lie after lie to get people to hate him. [This video](https://x.com/VigilantFox/status/1823808656825000274) shows how democrats used to love Trump before he was smeared like this in the media. Recall after Trump won in 2016 he made an effort to lower the temperature and called for unity - he gave a great speech and his approval rating was on the rise. He extended an olive branch to the establishment - he included them in his decisions and appointed them to positions of power instead of putting in his own loyalists. He didn't try to prosecute his political opponents who were obviously guilty (like Hillary) let alone abuse his power to go after those who were not.Immediately though after his inauguration the media was obsessed with smearing him first going after his crowd size. Trump tried to push a message of optimism - he spoke positively about the crowd and said he couldn't believe how many people were there, he casually said that to him it looked like the biggest crowd ever for an inauguration. The media then made it their top priority to smear Trump as hated and unpopular instead of focusing on the positive unifying message that Trump was trying to advance. They did dirty tricks like post pictures from earlier in the day to make the crowd seem smaller than it was. They failed to mention or condemn the violent protests (\\"DisruptJ20\\") that caused the capitol to be locked down with very heavy security, which meant many people who wanted to go to the inauguration couldn't get in. So we can see literally on day one they started with this narrative about Trump to indoctrinate the population and create division and hatred toward him.Let's look at some other things democrats have done:* lied that he supports / praised nazis (he explicitly condemned them)* lied that he called for viol3nce if he loses the election (he was talking about economics of the auto industry)* lied that police officers were kill3d by Trump supporters on J6* lied that Trump wanted viol3nce on J6 even though he specifically said to be peaceful and had nothing to gain from viol3nce* lied that it's a threat to democracy to challenge an election through courts, public discourse, and petitions to legislative bodies as per our first amendment right* lied that Trump was a dictator who required total loyalty (false he hired many people who didn't agree with him and were the opposite of Trump loyalists)* lied about him colluding with Russia and all that nonsense* lied about his call with Ukraine and impeached him for a non-crime* lied that Trump only won in 2016 because Russia rigged the election for him* lied about him telling people to drink bl3ach* lied about him calling military suck3rs and l0sers* lied and said he was pushing Russian disinformation with the Biden laptop* lied about him wanting to start a war with Iran (documents prove it was the opposite - and then they charged him and smeared him further when he tried to defend himself to journalists)* lied repeatedly and broke the law to prosecute Trump and smear his character for non-crimes and accusations with no proof that were treated as fact* lied that his ban on immigration from some countries was a mahslum ban* lied that he called immigrants \\"ANlMALS\\"I could go on and on I am missing so many from this list. What democrats do is when Trump responds to this and attacks democrats for what they are *actually* doing, then they accuse him of being the one spreading dangerous rhetoric. If you've ever been in or known someone in an abusive relationship you know this tactic very well and it's what they've used against Trump ever since he won when he wasn't supposed to.It's also important to point out that democrats are the ones that hold the positions of greatest trust and influence in our society via their institutional power. When they say this stuff it's taken literally and seriously by a large portion of the population. Trump on the other hand is just one person who tends to talk candidly - nobody takes what he says literally or too seriously on its own. I don't think there are many people who do or believe things just because Trump said so, but there are tons of people who believe things because the democrat's trusted institutions told them so.It's also the case that truth matters. The truth can sometimes make people angry so I don't hold people responsible for that. But the democrats haven't been telling the truth - they've engaged in one blatant lie after another with the specific goal of smearing and creating hatred for their political opponents. The dishonesty and intolerance is overwhelmingly more prevalent on one side than the other and it isn't even close (as hopefully some of the examples and the timeline that I outlined above demonstrated).","title":"Trump blames Harris, Biden rhetoric for second assassination attempt"},{"text":"We felt the same way about roe.

Pruitt was a climate change denier who had sued the EPA at least 14 times as Oklahoma's Attorney General. The fossil fuel industry was a major contributor to his political campaigns. Trump also appointed Andrew Wheeler as the Deputy EPA Administrator. He succeeded Pruitt when Pruitt resigned in 2019. Wheeler was a coal lobbyist from 2009 until 2017 when he got the EPA position. Rick Perry was Trump's pick for Secretary of Energy, an interesting choice since Perry thought that the Department of Energy should be abolished.These were truly bad picks.However, most of the reasons for their endorsement seemed to be political. Trump also picked Steve Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary. And of course, his bank was responsible for foreclosing on the homes of many people during the 2008 financial crisis, including many veterans, helping to create the homelessness problem we now have in California and across the nation. And as we know, Kamala Harris chose not to prosecute him for wrong-doing at the time, even though people in her office wanted her to. Mnuchin also donated to Harris' political campaigns.I'm sad to see this endorsement. I really wish scientists would endorse left parties who take their concerns seriously. Especially climate scientists. I know they are afraid of losing their jobs over their activism and diverging from the Democrats, but they also tell us that it's do or die time right now.If they're scared of Trump, they should be all out for Jill Stein.","title":"Re: Scientific American's endorsement of Kamala Harris for president (bad trade-off obvious even in belly of the MSM)"},{"text":"Pointless email really - when Trump has literally said the exact same words against Biden or Kamala.

Whether you want to believe it's beneficial or not, having free speech does not mean you are free from the consequences of that speech. (Eg. Yelling \\"fire!\\" In a movie theater. Defamation is also a limit on free speech, etc...).And public figures should absolutely not be allowed to lie to the public. They're there to serve the public. If they're spreading lies and hate they should be removed from office.  Checks and balances should be present, but not having this has led to some really poor behavior from members of Congress, Presidents, state legislatures, and even Supreme Court justices. Ethics and mature discourse matter. They matter A LOT. These are leaders of the country. What does it say to \\"the people\\" when poor behavior and outright lying are not punished and are in some cases rewarded?

Nor with it wanting to curtail bad actors. We already do that with physical and financial crimes, as an example, so why would it be any different with people spreading lies/disinformation/misinformation that harms our society. Obviously this can be a slippery slope and that power can be used negatively but the benefit to society is an important consideration. Right now all that garbage runs wild with no accountability.

Capitalism is then exacerbating by producing high inequality.Depression and anxiety disorders are likely an overreaction of some evolved mechanism where people who have suffered some social defeat retreat and not try to challenge this defeat, as doing so immediatly would in the ancestral state perhaps be very risky. But in current conditions, this sort of social defeat is more chronic, and then leads to pathology, especially when retreat is more dysfunctional when there is not a strong tendency to incorporate everyone into social and economic activities. In egalitarian HG societies, people can get upset and sulk for a few days without problem as they soon they will soon be reincorporated into social life. In the ancestral state, the sort of social isolation many now are subjected too would be very rare and correlated with very bad outcomes, basically if you are alone and isolated from your band you will face a very high risk of death. In the case of suicidality, some analysis shows that suicide is predicted best by relative incoem and not at all by absolute income, having much less than your peers can be extremely difficult becuase they will look down on you and you will end up socially isolated and low in status, even if access to basic goods is achieved.","title":"CMV: Psychotherapy is enabling the current exploitative system"},{"text":"Musk is the lowlife immigrant the GOP fantasizes about.","title":"Elon Musk deletes X post about 'no one' attempting to assassinate Biden or Harris"},{"text":"All we've been saying is that it doesn't mean *anything* in either direction despite the left hanging onto it like a damn life raft.

Also you kinda proved my point. 4 states = 1/3 of the entire vote is hardly representative right? You can slice it any way you want... EC vs popular either individual votes or states as a whole are going to be underrepresented. You have to live with the compromise (which the EC was designed to do and admittedly is in desperate need of an update). 1. If it's a popular vote only, my point was that those four states would be the primary focus. Of course they would chase after more votes after those but every election the same states would get the attention. You'd rather spend as much money and rally time in a densely populated area rather than a low density area if you're running for a popular vote victory. This would mean these states always have their issues examined and catered to. Additionally the candidates would focus on urban, suburban, and rural in order of importance. Under this model the states with the highest populations will receive the most attention every time. There's no shot in a state like Iowa is even looked at by either candidate in this scenario. \\n2. The EC has the same issue with candidates focusing on a select group of states to win with one big difference...Every election cycle there are new swing states. Georgia used to be a solid red state, now it's up in the air. Florida used to be the definition of a swing state, now it's solid red. Demographics change and issues for each state pop up and change what the electorate needs and wants. In this case it's not the same 4 states receiving attention it's the areas of the country that are more contested requiring candidates to navigate those regional issues. 3. A popular vote doesn't bring regional issues to the nations collective attention. Fracking is an excellent point. It's important to a few states for both their economy and their own energy independence. As a larger nation we would all like to move away from fracking but PA and a few other key states forced the candidates and nation to look at the issue within the context of their region. Turns out there are a few states that still want to invest in that type of energy for good reason and now they have a voice. 4. The EC was designed to reflect Congress. The house members are representation proportionally while the senators are state direct representation. Every state gets 2 senators (direct) each states house members are different (based on population). That's 435 members used to represent the population proportion of each state and 100 to represent the states as a whole. This is directly linked to the number of electorates given to each state for the EC. As a result the EC is both based on the states population and the state as a whole. A decent compromise. Now they haven't updated the house numbers since 1920, meaning we have to use 435 members to reflect the ever-changing populations of 50 states. In my opinion this is the weakest point of the EC and or Congress as a whole. If I have criticism to the EC it's here. Overall the EC includes both direct and proportional representation where a popular vote only model ignores direct state representation rendering the wants and needs of some states irrelevant to the campaigns. The EC, specifically the proportional element, needs an update but that's far from making it a flawed system.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"So, no objective measures?(And that is not what peer review is or how it works.)","title":"Scientific American makes second-ever endorsement, backs Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Taters","title":"Bush called out on Trump-Harris: When democracy calls, you cant just roll it over to voicemail"},{"text":"What are your views?

In fact, land is a pretty great stand in for culture in many situations. In a world where we didnt protect territorial sovereignty in our union, there is nothing stopping large states from imposing tons of negative externalities on small states because representatives no longer care about garnering the small state vote. This is called tyranny of the majority, a problem that is specifically why we have a constitution in the first place. If we did away with the electoral college, there is very little stopping a New York, Texas or California president calling to tax all 50 states purely to fund California, New York or Texas projects. Because we are in the interest of protecting minorities, we balance that power by affording land votes, which at least makes national candidates try to garner support from all states rather than from a select few. That means our party platforms are more bipartisan when it comes to urban versus rural or state to state than they otherwise could be.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"If they could read I'm sure they would be upset.","title":"In its 179-year-old history, Scientific America has only endorsed two presidential candidates.

Hell, their \\"assumed status\\" makes them *extremely valuable*. And they are often **consistent* because THEIR vote actually matters. Swing states \\"swing\\" because they DON'T have a strong voice. It was created by the founding fathers for a myriad of reasons, all of which are outdated nowSTATES are outdated now? Checks and Balances are outdated now? The president was never meant to be a representative of the people. The House had that purpose. The Senate was to represent the states. And the EC was to be appointed by the states, in numbers according to state populace. It was to create *unique* voting blocks to elect these various branches of government.Would you like to argue why a single figure on the national stage should be a representative of 330 million people? Because I don't see the logic in that.  If you live in one of the majority of states that are clearly red or blue, your vote in the presidential election counts less than if you live is a swing state because all the electoral votes goes to the winner of the state whether they won by 1 vote or 100,000 votes.That's due to \\"winner take all\\" allocation of electoral votes. That's a choice of each state, not at all a function of the constitutionally outlined Electoral College.But also, not really. Sure, any **excess** vote makes such a vote \\"counts less\\". But if we had a national popular vote, the same would exist. You are simply assuming an outcome, and claiming votes in excess are \\"lesser\\". That seems a bizarre way to observe voting when we often desire stronger shows of majority, not simply *claiming* a majority  and \\"winning\\".

Those states combined still dont account for even a third of the American population. So no, candidates wouldnt be able to just focus on those.Thats not even considering that these states are not monoliths. in TX last election, there were roughly 5.9 million votes for Trump, and 5.2 million votes for Biden. So both candidates would need to fight over the votes in that state, and would need support in any other state that they could get it.And its the same for urban centers too. The top 10 most populous cities combined only account for about 10% of the population. So candidates cant just go from city to city and win the popular vote. They would have to earn suburban voters and rural voters as well.What youre suggesting would happen with the popular vote, is *actually* whats happening with the EC. Where candidates almost exclusively go to 7 swing states and appeal specifically to the voters in those states, because theyre really the only ones who matter.And you can see this reflected in the platforms of the candidates.

In his decision, Carney granted the defendants motion to dismiss, agreeing that Rundo and Boman were being selectively prosecuted, while far-left extremist groups, such as Antifa were not. Prosecuting only members of the far right and ignoring members of the far left leads to the troubling conclusion that the government believes it is permissible to physically assault and injure Trump supporters to silence speech, Carney wrote in his order.\\nThe same judge dismissed the same case against the same people multiple times, and the prosecutors would have to scramble to get it overturned on appeal because the people charged would flee the country.They had to be extradited back from Romania when prosecutors got the appeal through.

In a preregistered large-sample controlled experiment, I randomly assigned participants to receive information about the endorsement of Joe Biden by the scientific journal?*Nature*?during the COVID-19 pandemic. The endorsement message caused large reductions in stated trust in?*Nature*?among Trump supporters. This distrust lowered the demand for COVID-related information provided by?*Nature*, as evidenced by substantially reduced requests for?*Nature*?articles on vaccine efficacy when offered. The endorsement also reduced Trump supporters trust in scientists in general. The estimated effects on Biden supporters trust in?*Nature*?and scientists were positive, small and mostly statistically insignificant. I found little evidence that the endorsement changed views about Biden and Trump. These results suggest that political endorsement by scientific journals can undermine and polarize public confidence in the endorsing journals and the scientific community.","title":"\\"Vote for Kamala Harris to Support Science, Health and the Environment\\" - Scientific American endorses a candidate for President for only the second time in their history"},{"text":"This for sure","title":"Do you think Trump will win?"},{"text":"According to biden you arent black if you vote  dont vote democrat gotta love that liberal inclusion where an old white dude can deny your whole race if you dont side with him.","title":"Why are Democrats so violent and full of hate?"},{"text":" Certainly,  not more electors and representatives than counting enslaved people at full 1/1, which is what the slave states wanted.

There is a minority of Trump-voters who would like to see another system in place than the current system of democratic valuesWho? The people peddling project 2025? Because aside from the fact that Trump is using them in the same way they are attempting to use him, that minority is so small it almost isn't worth discussing. So essentially your argument could be reduced to \\"half of America is misinformed\\". Watching the debate, among the nonsense (hide yo dogs, hide yo cats), Trump is actually saying things that are factually true. CPI did increase by like 30% under Biden; Russia did attack Ukraine; Israel is at war; there is a serious issues at the southern border. And while some of these things might not affect the average voter, they also aren't particularly interested in understanding the context of the effects they see. I'm currently visiting Appalachia and seeing all the Trump signs has me wondering exactly why there could be such broad support, across virtually all demographics, for someone so deplorable. And what I've come up with is people vote for what influences them. Most people think any of the wars in the middle east/ukraine are horrible, but it has no impact on their day to day lives. What does have an impact is the price of food, housing, and energy. Those things came cheap under Trump; they have not under Biden. And the real root of the problem is that Kamala is viewed as the Biden proxy, which makes \\"stick with our policies even though we've drained your money\\" a really tough sell. Those policies may very well work; but the evidence collected so far doesn't make the null (that they don't work) all that unreasonable.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"Give his address 1st","title":"Ohio Sheriff Suggests Gathering Addresses Of Kamala Harris Backers"},{"text":"Fire time,  politics in police..no bueno","title":"Ohio Sheriff Suggests Gathering Addresses Of Kamala Harris Backers"},{"text":"The guy that tried to kill Trump wasnt going to vote for him?

You can disagree with the minority who want to keep it in place, but electoral minorities are exactly who our system of government was put in place to protect. Just because you're not in the minority who gains extra power under the system doesn't make it outdated.\\n If you live in one of the majority of states that are clearly red or blue, your vote in the presidential election counts less than if you live is a swing state because all the electoral votes goes to the winner of the state whether they won by 1 vote or 100,000 votes.So this is true, but there's a misconception baked in. The US constitution doesn't tell the states how to spend their electoral votes, only how many they get. In fact, there are a couple of states that split at least some of their electoral votes on a proportional basis. The issue here is that almost all of the states have decided that it is in their best interest to make their electoral votes an all-or-nothing affair. It is theoretically fully within the power of Cali or Texas to decide to split their electoral votes according to in-state popular vote, for example.

Marx wrote the Communist Manifesto 1848, only 17 years before the end of the civil war, and his ideals stretched across Europe and America before the USSR was a thing in 1922. Some ideas communists and liberals share are advocating for government control of the private sector, government control of education, government control of the medical industry, government control of resources, disarming the populace, higher tax rates for the upper class (like 40% or more), and national unionization of workers just to name a few.","title":"does the left actually believe in communism?"},{"text":"I have canvassed and been to a few doors where I really couldn't believe it was someone's residence.

Every election campaign comes down to basically a handful of voters in a handful of states.The Left after the backstabbing of Bernie, became \\"Vote Blue No Matter Who\\" and this led to literally every Left wing \\"progressive\\" economic position being jettisoned faster than a unstable Warp Core and the Dems literally running to the right.

Where there is corruption with corporations in bed with politicians, people must vote with their dollars against those corporations, people must know those conglomerates and cry against that consolidation of power and break their special connections with government. For politicians, people must make their opinions known and form grassroot movements to create new political capital.Always it must be organized groups otherwise persons are vulnerable as individuals to tactics such as doxxing and other coercion and vindication by the corrupt powers.Americans cannot suffer to be apathetic any longer. As times grow harder, people will wake up, but pray that it's reasoned and organized.

A state is a piece of land, or a government, but, either way, it is ultimately composed of people. Land doesn't want anything. It has no desire, no will. A government doesn't really, either. It is only the people who work in government, and the people who they work for, who have agendas, wants, needs, etc.The Electoral College was created to effectuate the 3/5 Compromise in presidential elections. Otherwise, without it, the choice would've been to let all the free (white) men vote, and the more populous North would dominate, or let the slaves in the South vote, at which point they'd vote in favor of their own freedom, or give the slave owners their proxies, in which case the slave South would dominate. The EC allowed them to count slaves, sort of, partially, and sort of let them have a vote for the president, without either letting them vote for themselves, and without letting someone else vote on their behalfs either, at least not on a one-for-one basis.When we abolished slavery, and threw the 3/5 Compromise in the dustbin of history, we should have also thrown away the EC as well.And consider this fact: under a popular vote, a candidate could win 49 of 50 states and lose the election because California voted 60/40 for a candidate.Counterpoint: It should not be possible for Clinton to win the NPV by ~3 million votes, out of ~130 million votes, and only win a single EV (maybe 3 EVs), nor should it be possible for Trump to only lose by ~3 million votes and get completely shut out, yet both of those are possible outcomes. You could just swap Trump and Clinton votes strategically across state lines, one-for-one, keeping the 130 million total the same, their 66 and 63 million individual totals the same, and keeping the total number of votes cast in each state the same, and end up with literally nearly every possible EV breakdown (except Clinton, winning the NPV, must win at least one EV, so it would not have been possible for Trump to win 538-0; and because EVs are generally assigned in blocs, it's a bit chunky, so there may be some other breakdowns that aren't possible).But again, why would any state without that size want to be in such a union.Ok, then, instead of keeping the EC, why don't we break the big states into multiple smaller states? If California is too large, let's split it into like five smaller states, and that should solve the problem, right?","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"[Sure sounds like the anti-Project 2025 ads in swing states are working!](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1835827675380023718#m)","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 16, 2024 - 50 days until election day!"},{"text":"Let me fathom a guess: they will escort him to the polls to cast his vote while in custody.","title":"??

But one thing to consider is that doing so would in practice require the unification of voting laws across the country, which would likely be a giant mess.  With the EC, the states effectively vote on the President, so how the states decide on their winner can be at least in part up to that state, particularly when it comes to things that may impact turnout.  If California makes it super easy to vote while Texas makes it a pain, and so California gets a much higher percentage of eligible voters to cast a ballot, they still both get the same say in the EC.  But if the number of voters in each state now impacts the actual result, how a state conducts its elections now arguably impacts other states, which I suspect would lead to either national voting laws (which would be a mess to implement) or even more shenanigans with state laws.  States dominated by one party would be even more incentivized to implement laws that increase voting from their preferred groups while decreasing it from others.  Texas already wants to make it harder to their urban residents to vote...imagine how much harder they'd push for that if voters in Austin could actually push a Democratic candidate over the popular vote threshold.Not saying this is a reason to keep the EC, but it is a consideration I don't think gets enough attention in these types of discussions.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"FWIW they held a virtual singalong for Biden in 2020","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 16, 2024 - 50 days until election day!"},{"text":"Soo we have Salt Lake County financial reports coming out and in one of the races it is just baffling how much the Republican is getting taken for a ride by her consultants.

What was revealed is our voting system lacks the basic accounting audit trail that a simple bank transaction has. Multiple forensics experts confirmed that voting volume was non-standard (or followed a pattern of manipulation). We were told there is zero election fraud when Democrats won, however, Texass recent audit showed an incredible number of dead people, non-state residents, and non-citizens on their voter rolls. Multiple states where Trump was agead had counting glitches overnight and suddenly the next day Biden jumped significantly to the lead.  In one forensics audit, thousands of mail in ballots had only votes for President; not a dingle other candidate in any state election, and a large portion of the mail in ballots were not folded. Add to that, multiple states deleted the electronic voting records within a few weeks for the most important election in our country (but we should hold our tax records for 7yrs). For perspective, we can agree that Obama was truly beloved by the Left. He held rallies and hosted tribe turned out en masse. \\n Nobody has ever liked Biden, yet against Trump, he pulled a significantly higher portion of counties than Obama did?! Suspicious and suspect.

It's how your state has chosen to implement it. Maine and I think Nebraska split their electoral votes by congressional district for example. In theory the state could just have you pick a slate of electors who then vote without direction, though no states do so.I would also point out that this specific criticism is basically just how democratic elections works. If you implemented a popular vote and the country as a whole shifted to be 75% in favor of one party, the votes of the remaining 25% count for next to nothing since your vote didn't have an impact. The president gets 100% of the presidency regardless of whether he wins by 1 vote or by 20 million.At the end of the day, democracy really requires a democratic body of numerous representatives in order to function. That's why the House exists.

Interests of populations are tied to the geography of the territory they live in. So for example, one of Texas main sources of wealth is oil and gas.Many other states don't rely on it. So it would be very simple for states which care about the climate crisis to pass a federal wide ban on oil extraction if the majority of the population of the country votes for it.This would disproportionately affect texans however, who would eat most of the negative consequences of the bill.Another example could be a country wide mandate to plant more trees proportinal to population. Thsi would be easily achievable in states iwth arable land, but ludicrous in arid states like Arizona.An even more ridiculous one could be the 5 most populus states voting that all other states must now pay a special tax that goes directly into their coffers.The examples are a bit farfetched, but the point is, the electoral college exists to guarantee that *territories* can protect their interests and balance them with those of other territories regardless of population dynamics.Better electoral reforms would be to get rid of first past the pole system and to encourage states to have representative voting written into their state's constitution (i.e. if your population votes 50/50 then your represnetative votes should also be evenly split as much as possible rather than all go to one).One thing to note is that, for all its flaws, the US is the most stable advanced democracy in the world so far. in the 200+ years it has existed it has had one continuous governemtn and only one existential crisis.

And a similar pattern exists all through Europe.That stability is a direct consequence of separating power by territory rather than by number of people.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"Wasn't the idea though that the US gives those countries new planes, so that they can give their F-16s to Ukraine?","title":"Biden Must Let Zelenskiy Bomb Putin to the Negotiating Table"},{"text":"By giving proportionate power to individual voters.The EC robs small states of power too.

Someone has already pointed out the incentive to join the union. You say that it isn't relevant anymore, but by the same logic, it's even more relevant today. We have a well established union that would fracture if any state left it successfully. If several states realized that the votes of their citizens didn't mean anything due to the monolithic voting trends of New York or California, they would have no incentive to *stay*. Forcing them to remain, and be subject to policies where they have no effective voice is tantamount to slavery. I would instead argue that Electoral votes should not be cast the way they are today. For example, right now, if the state of Ohio is split 60/40 blue over red, Ohio will put all their electoral votes into the blue basket, effectively nullifying the voice of the 4 out of 10 people who voted red. A better system would be to require that electoral votes are cast based on state percentile. If Ohio has 10 votes, and the state votes 60/40 blue over read, then it should cast 6 votes blue and 4 votes red. Or green or whatever party meets the percentile threshold. This way, population disparity between states would be balanced by the Electoral college system at the national level, and within each state, each voter would matter.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"When the Trump thing is over we have to deal with Elon Musk (probably at the same time honestly...)","title":"Donald Trump warns Kamala Harris is \\"killing\\" Black, Hispanic heritage"},{"text":"Realistically, its not my job to make economic policies, so I have to doubt if you are as genuinely curious (always such a tell) as you say you are.

In a popular vote based democracy the outcome is obvious. Mob rule.In a more decentralized, state-centric, system more people get what they want. Instead of the 49% minority getting completely screwed. The states where theyre 49% nationally are 90% on the state level get everything they want (on the state level). Our votes are much more powerful on a state level because more people get what they want when its a smaller pool of voters.Needing majorities in Congress, and other checks and balances on the federal level (creating a state of gridlock), empowers states, municipalities, therefore; individuals and minority groups.

Like Obama tried to, until there just wasn't enough money to buy the ads they needed.And, yes, that means the DNC and RNC are both completely corrupted by this ludicrous for profit campaign financing system. Or hadn't you noticed that BOTH parties are beholden to the 1% over the 99%...and for the past 50 years?!For example, regarding campaign financing, the GQP just ignores requests for reform. They are naked and unapologetically corrupt. Meanwhile, the DNC offers platitudes like \\"we'd need a constitutional amendment\\" which sounds like they want to fix this, but they present a solution that everyone knows will never, ever happen. This is what's known as a LIE. Everyone in the House and the Senate and the White House knows how to fix this problem. They all know it doesn't need a constitutional amendment, etc. and they all know that CU cannot be repealed because it is a purely First Amendment issue. But they all want to keep this billionaire gravy train going. Now, this is not that both parties are equal. The Democrats are much better on social issues, etc. You know, the things the billionaires actually don't care about. But there is a reason why the taxes on the 1% keep going down (and the loopholes keep increasing) no matter which party is in power...you never explained how public financing solves the problem of dark money or corporate money persuading the electorate.I just did in the post you responded to. Read it again...and again...until you understand the key words and logic of the arguments.Citizen's United still being intact.Again, read my post again until you understand it. CU is and has always been irrelevant.Once politicians are no longer paying for their own ads (through taxpayer vouchers and PSA style requirements for all broadcasters during 6-8 week election windows), the 1% will have no power over them by default. Some politicians will remain corrupt, as they always are, but we have ethics panels and laws to address that...the same ones we used to use 50+ years ago, before the age of TV ads for politicians.But right now, everyone is corrupted by default by this money because they cannot run for election without it.I hope that helps.","title":"The American dream is dead for many.

The amount of Electoral votes each state has is equal to however many senators and congresspeople that they have serving. So obviously each state has a minimum of 3 Electoral College votes because 2 senators and one representative (minimum number of representatives.) Originally they used to have the minimum of one congressional representative, and no maximum. So if your state kept getting a bigger population you kept getting more congressional representation. (Which also meant you got more electoral votes)However in 1929, it was decided that would create an unwieldy number of people in congress. And on that point, fair. So they capped it to 435 with the Permanent Apportionment Act. The problem is that means that the population numbers and the number of electoral votes have been getting further and further out of connection. While it's totally fair to make other arguments about if the founding fathers were correct to put the Electoral College in place. It's disingenuous to act like the current version of it was even what they intended. I'd actually be curious to see us at least consider if not try, restoring the Electoral College to the correct number of apportioned votes by adding the correct number of votes back in for the more populace states and seeing if that doesn't correct a lot of our problems. (Also might be less of a shock to our whole political system.)","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"But even if he meant non white immigrants, the truth is that they make up an even smaller proportion of the 13.9 percent of the total immigrant population cuz the 13.9 figure includes all immigrants across races. And if they are already citizens, why would they need to vote democrats. It makes no logical sense. It would be one thing to vote for a democrat, if you are looking to become a citizen and believe a democrat would make that pathway for you easier (but you obviously can't vote until you become a citizen so thats moot) but once you are already a citizen, why would you care. So logic dictates that immigrants MAY vote democrats, not because of immigration but because the party does not peddle racist idealogies. Plus if you break it down, the math is much more complicated. White people are the majority in the country with 52 percent of the total population (as per recent census) being white, rest being minorities from different races and ethnicities. Of the 48 point something which are minorities, many are 3rd, 4th or 5th gen so really have no incentive whatsoever to vote democrats solely for immigration reasons. They are already here, settled with all the rights and benefits of citizenship. Their reasons for voting then become multifold-economy, religious and social conservatism (abortion apparently is on reason, some Hispanics are considering voting for Trump), taxes, etc etc. And most importantly, trump gets a massive share of men, Neo nazis and white supremacists, islamophobes, anti immigrants..in his support group. Also evidenced by the very close election race. If there was some grand democrat plan of getting illegals voting, they are clearly losing cuz they don't have a massive lead at all..which means there is no such one party advantage.So the way I see it, if we believe Elon's assertion that Democrats are building an army of illegals who will turn out to be guaranteed democrat voters, then trump is building and incentivizing an army of white supremacists, Neo nazis, incels, men, radicals etc..which ensures each party's power gets balanced out and becomes just a general example of democracy-both parties attract a certain kind of voter cuz yknow Elon that's how democracies work- some demographics are catered by democrats, some by republicans and even within that, there are independents and moderates on both sides. Elon is so pitifully ignorant about democracies and demographic makeups, but confidently peddles the most extreme, close ended ideas of the future of the country.","title":"US Secret Service says it is aware of Musk post about Biden, Harris"},{"text":"Leon Skum","title":"Elon Musk deletes Twitter post about Biden, Harris assassination threats after backlash"},{"text":"I am disappointed I couldn't crack -10","title":"Trump Assassination Suspect Donated 19 Times to Democrats"},{"text":"you can just admit you don't understand marxism. this can be a learning opportunity.","title":"Kamala has no ideology - she is just part of the machine representing unelected beaurocrats who actually run the country"},{"text":"100% no doubt.

And if it is, why specifically rural voters?I'd also mention if the purpose of the electoral college is to make sure every state is heard, it's utterly failed at that goal since the EC has reduced campaigns to focusing on swing states.  This not only cuts out a huge portion of the country, including a lot of small states, but the swing states aren't even representative of the country as a whole.

Only 12% more registered Texas Democrats needed to come out for Biden in 2020 for him to take the state. Texas is not red, it's purple with massive voter suppression.Second, there can actually be a *reverse* coattails effect. Plenty of Democrats feel like their vote for president doesn't matter if they're in a \\"red\\" state, because of the electoral college. If they want to come out to get Allred in and Cruz out, that may actually close that 12% gap. As Jess Piper says, a win in red states is running. It's having a Democrat on the ticket at all. It's showing people in those states that they haven't been abandoned. You have to start somewhere.We need to take a holistic approach. If we don't get the 60 senate seats we need to get past the filibuster by 2026, then we are going to be right back here again in 2028.

What is one supposed to do if an election actually is stolen? If the ones stealing the election have a lot of institutional power and control over the media, the of course they will deny it happened, destroy evidence, and call anyone who questions the stolen election a conspiracy theorist, traitor, danger to democracy, etc. Since they destroy the evidence, they may even be able to convince people for \\"lying\\" about it being stolen since those people can't produce enough evidence. And many people who still trust these institutions will believe them and pin all of the blame on the individuals questioning the election. But it is clearly NOT anti-democratic to point out that a stolen election was stolen.**\\"The issue with this statement is that it goes off of the assumption that when you are told that an election is stolen, it is 100% factually correct. To this day there is ZERO proof it was stolen. You cannot create a conspiracy theory out of nothing, go through illegal mains of trying to 'correct' what has been done, and then plead ignorance that \\"You thought it REALLY was stolen!\\" That is not how the law works. There are processes to contending an election, and automatically claiming it was 100% stolen and then acting upon this, is not the right move. If this was the case, Mayors would stage the same attempted coups against their opposition whenever it comes to voting. Governors would. Every single person that is assigned into power through voting would be able to do this and claim it would be allowed.It is not anti-democratic to point out a stolen election was stolen.It is anti-democratic to point out an \\"Alleged\\" stolen election was stolen, illegally acting upon it without going through the correct procedures, and siccing your fans on the Capitol while having a scheme in the background going on between the President, his personal lawyer, and people he found to use as fake electors. This is not as black and white as you are making it seem.I could go on and on about your misleading claim about how \\"Democrats\\" are the ones with undemocratic action, but there's no use. At most I will say: The DNC is RIGHTFULLY allowed to choose whoever they want, especially Kamala when she is already the VP, which means she already has a backing of people who support her. That is the SAFEST choice to choose in this situation against someone like Trump who has a legitimate cult-following behind him. What you are advocating for is literally for the democrats to throw the election to Trump for free when the rights of others hang on the balance considering we already know what will happen (IE, P25, A47, RvW overturned, Presidential immunity). \\"Packing the courts\\" right, like that wasn't already done recently with Trumps appointees, like McConnell didn't allow this situation to happen to begin with.

These people are less likely to end up in positions where they can afford healthcare, more likely to take jobs without room for advancement in favor of trying to collectivize and negotiate for a more equitable distribution of the company's wealth. They fight more, because the economy is fundamentally set up in such a manner that they are a danger to the owners of business, and the owners of business in a functional sense also own the police and legal system.

I'm politically conservative\\n2. I'm becoming a conservative person\\n3. I'm pretty conservative when it comes to dating aroundThese three statements all use the word conservative but under different context. Which means that they mean differently. The first meaning they're Republicans, the second meaning they're shy or not as outgoing, the third meaning they don't like to date around and are somewhat picky when it comes to potential mates..That being said, people often don't know the varying definitions and how to communicate them. Take the word \\"love\\" for example. There's only one word, but yet you can say:   1. I love my parents/kids\\n2. I love my friends\\n3. I love my significant other.All those words use the word \\"love\\", and as said before, it depends on context. But if you look at the Greek work, there's actually three different words for love: storge, philia, and eros.Storge is love for a family. Philia is \\"brotherly\\" love, like that of a close friend. And eros is romantic love, towards a sexual partner.So the word \\"conservative\\" is the same issue where it's one word that can be used differently. And as your post put it, you have a hard time communicating the difference (and so do others)..And if you think about it deeper, to become a \\"conservative\\" means you want to preserve something of the past. So it just depends on which timeline. Some people want to preserve the 1950s, others want to preserve 2020 during COVID when most worked at home and received stimulus checks.So there has to be a reference of what you're conserving and people fall to communicate this.","title":"CMV: A lot of people dont become more conservative as they get older, its just that what it means to a liberal constantly changes and they dont fit the definition of what it used to be when they were younger."},{"text":"Right?Some surprising September polls about possible upsets in November are emphatically *not* an October surprise.","title":"October surprise: Democrats will have down-ballot reasons to cheer"},{"text":"Provide evidence of people saying Trump should be assassinated.","title":"White House condemns 'irresponsible' Elon Musk post on assassination attempt"},{"text":"But Brown tries hard to drive down the margins in areas he knows he'll lose, which is also Obama's strategy under Plouffe.

The only reason people were comfortable doing that shit was because the entire year our country was basically a GTA server. The reality is, the democrats can conduct extremism and terrorism unchecked for months on end, even when they arent holding office of the president. When the republicans have a few hours of doing the same, they get years in prison and even the president gets in trouble. If the republicans ran every institution in America and held the position of power that the democrats do, I would be a democrat. However, this is not the case and the republicans have control of basically nothing even when they are in power. Additionally, many of the actions the Democratic Party has tried to take have been anti democracy- trying to take trump off the ballot and trying to impeach him for Russian collusion despite the fbi report countering this.

My bachelors are in psych and bio and my masters is in public health. I can consume most of the mundane work in and around those fields without breaking a sweat. Yet ask me to dissect an intricate policy position and Ill be the first to tell you Im no economist let alone a political scientist. The degree to which people are in debate over long term issues that we see play out very differently than projected in the 4 years someone is president doesnt help at all. To me its tantamount to arguing over interpretation of prophesy. In physical science terms, its an open system. You can be right about something, then the political situation changes and you become wrong. The political establishment does a bad job making it clear and the bad actors use dissent and disinformation to muddy it further. So to your point, how much of a body of work will exist on policy positions regarding the office of the president or most other political roles? Between the lack of consistency in politics and the fact that academia is publish or perish, do you really see the landscape of most issues as easily researched? Just to add an important note to this, I find meta-analyses most useful in topics Im uninformed about. I think thats part of the answer, but Im not sure it covers everything. Id love to see more references to academic analysis in politics rather than news reports. I lived through the great egg debate of the 90s.

While consultants and organizers talk about the need for rural talking points and investments in rural newspaper and radio buys, this politician has deployed the most obvious strategy for making inroads with rural voters: He showed up in every county in his state.Then, he did something really remarkable: He showed up again.The attention a high-profile candidate like Fetterman has paid to rural areas of his state may begin to ease the rural inferiority complex thats been festering for decades, as rural economies have stagnated, small towns have lost population and country folks have become the butt of jokes. One 27-year-old woman in Westmoreland County, part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area that struggles against the Pennsyltucky stereotype, praised Fetterman for showing up and speaking bluntly.in conservative Westmoreland County took on the air of a party. Attendees sipped Bud Light and margaritas on an outdoor patio. Gisele Barreto Fetterman  the Second Lady of Pennsylvania who has embraced the acronym S.L.O.P.  interrupted her husband in the middle of his speech, handing him her drink while she regaled the crowd with a story about the geographic breadth of their support. And as Mr. Fetterman made the rounds, people told him they were delighted he had visited their county.Were not just silly hillbillies, said Gabrielle Keung, 27, who praised Mr. Fetterman for showing up and speaking bluntly. With Mr. Fetterman, she added, Theres no wishy-washiness.\\nOssoff in Georgia. One example of what happens when instead of spending money on advertisements you spend it on people.  \\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/30/raphael-warnock-jon-ossoff-georgia-00064109  \\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yhgdkx/the_ground_game_that_flipped_the_senate_is/  \\nWeve demonstrated since 2017 that continually investing in organizing, especially young voters, is so important, and so Im using the organization that Ive built and putting it back to work, Ossoff said in an interview with POLITICO, after launching a canvass effort in a strip mall parking lot alongside Warnock, Democratic House candidate Wade Herring and Savannah Mayor Van R. Johnson.I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, No, I already voted for these people, he said. Then, we have to explain to people, Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now youve got to go again.And youll probably have to go in December and do it one more time, he added.A post-election analysis of Ossoffs field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoffs paid relational organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become community mobilizers  a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off, Ossoff continued.Ossoffs efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor. A number of get-out-the-vote nonprofits are also involved, as Democrats look for a way to close strong after several weeks of public polling gains by GOP Senate candidates, including Walker.","title":"John Fetterman on How Harris Can Win Pennsylvania as Polls Show Dead Heat"},{"text":"My hope is that these people keep voting next year.","title":"Democrats build momentum in Texas Senate race"},{"text":"And THAT'S why the media loves him so much.","title":"With 50 days to go, Trumps message to voters is a muddled mess | \\nWith 50 days to go, Donald Trump is focused on Taylor Swift, pet-eating immigrants, debate conspiracy theories and Kamala Harris' experience at McDonalds."},{"text":"Making assassination statements are never a joke.

That means ensuring Ukraine holds and, if Ukraine is potentially about to collapse, such as Kyiv being at risk of falling, yes I would very much consider the UK going to war with Russia to try to prevent that (ideally along with allies), a bit like what Macron said a while back.Russia's aggression is an existential threat to European and to a lesser extent world security. I think Putin's indicated he's on an unstoppable path of aggression in an attempt to rebuild what he and other Russian imperial nationalists see as Russia's rightful empire and sphere of influence. Ukraine is a large and militarily quite powerful country whose collapse would be immediately catastrophic to Europe (massive refugee waves, Russian forces on a much longer border with NATO, Russia being able to conquer and integrate Ukraine into its war machine). I don't think freezing the war is an option either, Russia has shown it wants to conquer Ukraine, and past attempts to placate or appease Russia by freezing conflicts have always failed when Russia tears up the deal 5 years later to launch another surprise attack, so it's either Ukraine holds or it falls. Perhaps more importantly, weakness against Russia will signal that further aggression is possible. I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility at all that, especially if the US seems weak on Europe such as with a Trump presidency, Putin might try to test NATO's resolve by making an ambiguous play, for example a scenario I've seen discussed is occupying outlying Norwegian islands or something. If that succeeds, NATO's credible threat is gone and Russia will keep being more and more aggressive until war is the only option. Russia is a uniquely serious threat that is actively attempting to shatter international law by legitimising wars of conquest, actively trying to destroy the international order at its heart in the Euro-Atlantic area by breaking up NATO etc.To me, all other security issues, apart from maybe a Chinese invasion of Taiwan if it's looking imminent, can wait as far as the UK is concerned. I understand the US has different interests but as far as I'm concerned, the UK's and Europe's entire foreign policy might should be directed towards undermining and defeating Russia. It's an existential situation for Europe.","title":"Biden Must Let Zelenskiy Bomb Putin to the Negotiating Table"},{"text":"Leave the kids out of it.

The reality of your comment is merely evidence that my position is correct. If I have no children yet still have to pay taxes to support public education, I am incentivized to ensure that public education is better than worse, because I benefit from a better public education than a worse one. But you're right, I'm also incentivized to try to pay less tax than I otherwise would, if I perceive that I benefit more from the decrease in taxation than I do from the increased quality of public education. But the latter proposition doesn't negate the validity of the former, it merely means that the efficacy of a universal-program is proportional to the ability to opt-out of it. What would public education look like if private or home schooling was simply not an option? To address your first points, you are omitting from your calculations the benefit to the public as a whole from those who need the benefit receiving it. My argument is that someone who does not directly receive a public benefit still benefits the most from the largest number of those who need it receiving it. So, from that perspective, a universal program that reaches the most people will be better than one that means-tests it for those who \\"need it most\\", since that means-testing will ensure that some portion of \\"those who need it most\\" will not receive it because of the barrier means-testing creates. Means-testing increases both the cost to administer the program, but also increases the barriers to accessing the benefit. Take the example of school lunch programs. I would argue that means-testing students will create a scenario where some students will not qualify and either go hungry or eat a worse quality lunch (in terms of nutrition) than they otherwise would. So, making the program universal ensures those scenarios don't occur, with the assumption being that 0% hungry children is a better benefit to society than 2%. This also has the positive of eliminating any increased costs from means-testing. Your position is that by providing a benefit to someone who does not \\"need\\" it (a child that could otherwise afford to bring a lunch or will still choose to) creates so much \\"waste\\" that outweighs the benefit of the program. \\"But how can we afford to pay for *everyone's* lunch?\\" How are you measuring \\"waste\\"? If a family that could otherwise afford to provide lunch for their child utilizes a free-lunch program, then they save that money they would otherwise spend. From a societal perspective, how is this waste? Families with school-age children having more spending money sounds like a plus to me. Even if the cost of the universal program were more than the means-tested one (the cost of producing additional lunches for those that don't \\"need\\" them exceeding the savings from eliminating the administrative cost of means-testing), the additional tax burden to support such a program would need to exceed the savings in food costs for that family in order for it to not be beneficial for them. Given that any tax increase would also be shouldered by those without school-age children, it's hard to imagine that occurring.So, universal is better than means-testing for those who would qualify for means-tested benefits but cannot access them due to the barrier imposed by that means-testing. It's also better for those who do not \\"need\\" the program, but choose to use it. Let's say that there's no change for those that qualify and access it already under means-testing. So then, what of those that do not access the program? Either taxpayers without school-age children or those with that still will provide a lunch. In order for there to be waste, the additional tax burden would need to outweigh the societal benefit they receive from the program. But we've already seen that the societal benefit increases under the universal program both by those that need the benefit and are not able to access, but also by those that don't but still access it.So the production cost of the program (in this case the cost of making the lunches) would need to create such a high tax burden that it outweighs both the increase in societal benefits and the reduction of administrative costs. Economies of scale basically ensure that that doesn't happen. That's why I say that universal programs will always cost less. Because they always do. In generally, economies of scale for production costs make cutting the administrative burden of means-testing enough to make a universal program more cost-effective. But beyond that, you have to add in the increased societal benefit from more people using the program, whether they need it or not.","title":"The American dream is dead for many.

As can any individual for any reason, per the first amendment. That is NEVER going to be changed...ever.But that is not actually the problem. This is the \\"repeal Citizens United\\" lie I was talking about.Anyone can pay for ads to kill or save the environment or pro/con a candidate. The actual issue is \\"does that money corrupt the politician in question?\\"Our current system corrupts *everyone* by default. You simply cannot fund a campaign without millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to buy political ads.For years before the election, our officials need to beg for these millions. And then, even if they win, they spend most of their time begging for millions for the next election, and so on and so on. Since only the 1% and megacorporations have this kind of money to donate, that's where it comes from. And that means that every elected official must cater to these donors EXCLUSIVELY. Nothing from the 99% actually matters, as you've surely seen by now.But if politicians do not need to fundraise for ads. If they can campaign without requiring the lobbyists, etc. then they aren't compromised by default. Now, if you're a billionaire and you spend $100 million on your own ads for politician A...and politician A votes the way his/her constituents want, then you've been told to fuck off and have wasted $100 million. How many billionaires are going to continue to throw good money after bad if it actually doesn't buy them a damn thing? None, of course.And that's what Roberts was talking about regarding CU. We already can handle all of the election related laws we need. There's no need to stop someone from spending their own money in free speech. All we need is to remove the money from the campaigns themselves, which is really easy to do, and the politicians get nothing necessary from the 1%/corporations at all and, most importantly, they OWE nothing to the 1% either.I hope that clears up the important distinction here.

(And, even then, even though there was no systematic internment, there were loads of examples of discrimination and targeting of Germans, and some forced relocation.)The other important difference is that the Japanese directly and flagrantly attacked the United States soil.

We got to hear them frame the fact that the alleged assassin was reported in 2019 but then blamed a witness as their reason for not doing anything.  We heard them praising their own brilliant response, overlooking the fact it was actually only thanks to extreme luck and public involvement that they caught someone.  They whined about the already giant USSS budget not being enough and claimed all their agents are working flat out at all times, which we know is not true, and we know some of the agents are not even fit for duty.  The sheriff transparently reflected his adoration for Trump, and bragged about receiving a direct phone call from him, with fawning praise.Last week, similar red flags with the sheriff involved in the Apalachee school shooting.","title":"Ohio Sheriff Suggests Gathering Addresses Of Kamala Harris Backers"},{"text":"What?

If you dont live in the US you likely get most of your information from the internet, a vast majority of the media has a liberal bias so youll be subjected to a lot of the claims against Trump. If you speak to everyday people from all walks of life you will be pleasantly surprised to find out nobody thinks much of J6, which the media pushed so heavily. Also, many legal professionals have told me theres no standing on a lot of these cases against Trump and are just BS that will be appealed and thrown out.Secondly, as someone also not from the US but lives in the US, I appreciate the difference in States rights vs Federal rights. Its amazing to me the level of control each State has versus a sweeping Federal government control found in other countries. Local government and State government hold more control over Americans daily lives. So much so that California laws dictate how companies operate at a national level in many circumstances. The idea that Trump at the Federal level will somehow change everyones lives completely and upend the US entirely is so asinine and misinformed. He was already the President and there were less wars than there are now, so the entire argument that hed somehow subject the world to nuclear wars and an apocalypse is far fetched.Finally, one of the more important topics of this election is border security and immigration. The liberal media gaslit everyday Americans into believing there was no issue and everything is fine. Harris was in charge of the border and there are millions of people here that shouldnt be. Current administration policies have absolutely trashed some of the economics of different cities and towns across the US. That has affected the fabric of the US and also dilutes current citizens voting power in states that will receive more electoral votes based on the census numbers - irrespective of which party this favors, Democrats are diluting their own citizens voting power.I cant vote so I have no skin in the game, but as a foreigner that actually lives here and speaks to locals - there is a lot to dislike about the Democratic party. And of course the Republican party too, but you already seem to know that side based on your stance.

Here are three really common ones. First, Christian religious. It's hard to understand the importance of this if you're not from the United States, but the Christian vote is always skewed republican. This is relatively unusual to have the religious vote aligned w/ the business vote (low taxes for biz and wealthy folks, less infrastructure and social safety) instead of the social good vote. A lot of people are single issue voters and would vote republican solely because they believe it is not a women's right to choose to have an abortion.Second, Money. The Republicans have consistently lowered taxes on businesses and really rich people. Trump raised taxes on lower income earners but the Republicans still enjoy the association with lower taxes.Third, identity politics. I don't know how to explain this one except to say...a lot of people in the USA strongly associate with a political party BUT NOT the issues that party stands for. They think of it more as a way of life, or maybe a brand. And for fun, I'll throw guns in there, because the republicans get a lot of votes because they are perceived to be the pro-gun party. They are the pro gun party, too, but just like the points 1 and 2 above, this can be more about an emotional connection or connotation than a specific issue, and people will vote for republican because they believe in an abstract idea like personal freedom or a specific constitutional point like the right to bear arms. In general it is my belief that the Democrats are also too pro-gun, but I digress.I can't end the post w/o addressing racism, but it's such a big issue I'm not sure what to say. Racism isn't cornered by republicans, but there are absolutely more people in the USA who have and will again vote for Trump because of their racist beliefs than those who would vote for Kamala because of racist beliefs. Some of the things Trump did in Americans names at the Mexican border were sickening; the latest outcry about Trump saying immigrants are eating pets (while ridiculous, hilarious, crazy) has resulted in bomb threats and threats of violence against legal citizens of the USA who happen to be minority races.
