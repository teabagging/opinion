It was a speech about free speech, believe it or not. I am currently under attack. I am the news. I referenced Puerto Rico, which currently has a landfill problem in which all of their landfills are filled to the brim. I am the only person who knew about this, unfortunately. With that said, I just want to say that I love Puerto Ricans, theyre very smart people  theyre smart, theyre street smart, theyre smart enough to know when theyre being used as political fodder. Right now that is happening.I apologize to absolutely nobody, he continued. Not to the Puerto Ricans, not to the whites, not to the Blacks, not to the Palestinians, not to the Jews, and not to my own mother, who I made fun of during the set. Nobody clipped that. No headlines about me making fun of my own mother.Hinchcliffe then concluded, Perhaps that venue at that time wasnt the best fucking place to do this set at. But in any matter, to the mainstream media and to anybody trying to slander me online: Thats what I do, and thats never going to change.The comedian received an enthusiastic applause from his live audience.

It created a HUGE demand because mortgage rates dropped to nearly 2% which made the housing prices go crazy. There's been a lot of people sitting on the sidelines due to getting priced out of houses due to the combination of high mortgage rates + high house prices (housing prices stagnated at the higher prices due to the extremely low supply of housing post rate increase). So if mortgage rates drop substantially again due to him forcing rate cuts, houses will get more affordable (for the short term) but will cause housing prices to climb again. With people getting locked into low rates, it artificially chokes housing supply because once rates go up, houses become much more unaffordable due to prices stagnating from the low supply. This is why houses now are roughly the same price at a 7% mortgage rate as they were at. 2-3%. In a \\"normal\\" housing market, higher interest rates should suppress housing prices but not in our current situation.","title":"Biden funded new factories and infrastructure projects, but Trump might get to cut the ribbons"},{"text":"I dont care and I didnt ask.

Consider this, merely being elected has already cooled tensions with China, has made both sides of the Ukraine war consider peace talks, the Houthis have called a cease fire and Hamas wants one too; thats just from Trump being elected.He did make the mistake of leaving in military leadership that actively subverted his orders and didn't inform him of what they were doing so those drone strikes and such can't be ete completely on his lap although he has taken responsibility for letting Miley stay in his position. His threats of taking the fight to the cartels isnt just a war on drugs as human trafficking makes them far more money than fentanyl does now.  I believe his threats will be an impetus to make Mexico themselves take them on, but this isnt just about stemming the flow of drugs, this is about wiping out a modern day sex slave trade that is thriving in the current environment.

Once upon a time, California could sell itself as a shining alternative, attracting millions from near and abroad while serving as the epicentre of unrivalled tech and entertainment.Today that reputation is tarnished, in large part the victim of almost two decades of one-party progressive governance. Since 2000, California has lost 3.8 million residents in net domestic migration, a number equivalent to the population of Los Angeles. Once a beacon for the young and ambitious, today California ranks towards the bottom in attracting newcomers.?It is even losing middle-class educated professionals, whose exodus increased sharply between 2019 and 2021 (before a modest rebound).

Californias fertility rate, above the national average as recently as 2012, according to CDC Final Births report data, now ranks as the ninth-worst in the nation. Even immigrants, including in the last two years, seem to be going elsewhere, for places in Texas and Florida that have been portrayed by Newsom as racist hellholes.People have not stopped loving Californias climate or spectacular scenery. But they also want to make a good living and enjoy the fruits of their labour. Today, for all but a few, California is no longer the place to do that. According to recent analysis by Zen Business, Texas and Florida are now among the countrys high-growth hotspots and are also attracting many tech workers. Entertainment, Californias other large high-end industry, is also losing jobs, including at Disneys fabled Pixar, partly as production moves to other states and countries.The once magical cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco remain dystopian basket cases, with homeless encampments and chronic crime. Despite all the hype about AI, San Francisco suffers the nations highest office vacancy rate.

As she took her daughter to her classroom, she felt conflicted. I was walking through the hallways with my sunglasses on, wanting to engage with anybody and feeling a lot of anger, Louwagie tells Rolling Stone. I started to look around and be like, Whos happy right now? Whos sad right now? Who can I cry with? I didnt want to go about life as normal, I wanted to breathe for a minute with the right people.Unable to find immediate relief, Louwagie, a self-proclaimed Swiftie who lives in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota, retreated to her car where she made a 22-second TikTok calling her demographic out. Fellow white women, how are we signaling to each other now which side we are on? she said, visibly tired and physically drained after crying most of the morning. I just did school drop off and I dont trust any of these bitches anymore. Are we gonna \\\\[do\\\\] like blue friendship bracelets, are we keeping that up? Louwagie posed semi-jokingly, referencing the friendship bracelets Taylor Swift fans created in preparation for her Eras Tour to create distance and distinction from the 53 percent of white women who voted for Trump.In the days since, TikTok discourse took off around blue bracelets, and Etsy shops have exploded with merchandise, many to the sound of Paris Palomas viral song Labour a feminist chant that speaks to the ways women have been expected to show up in a patriarchal society as 24/7 baby machines. Now, white women are scrambling to purchase blue beads, charms, and ribbons, to signify their anti-Trump sentiments into wearable merch  a MAGA hat, essentially, but in reverse. Meanwhile, many Black women feel that the call to craft in the midst of political and personal uncertainty is unnecessary and performative at best.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/anti-trump-blue-bracelet-trend-1235163151/](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/anti-trump-blue-bracelet-trend-1235163151/)","title":"Are Anti-Trump Blue Bracelets a Performative Fad, or Can They Start a Movement?"},{"text":"This resulted in the $cheap gas people remember.The gas wasn't that cheap solely because oil went negative.

Among Huckabees leading evangelical backers is?[Pastor John Hagee](http://www.jhm.org/ME2/Default.asp), head of a Pentecostal congregation in San Antonio, Texas, with 18,000 members and the executive director of Christians United for Israel, a national lobbying group that organizes against a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine crisis and in favor of a military strike on Iran.?Hagees zealous support for Israel is kindled by his belief that Jesus will one day return to biblical Israel to usher in a kingdom of Heaven on Earth. As soon as Jesus sits on his throne hes gonna rule the world with a rod of iron, Hagee told his congregation in a sermon this December. That means hes gonna make the ACLU do what he wants them to. That means youre not gonna have to ask if you can pray in public school. We will live by the law of God and no other law.?Huckabee made a pilgrimage to Hagees Cornerstone Church just one week after the pastors anti-ACLU jeremiad. During the first of two sermons Huckabee delivered there, he was greeted with a thunderous standing ovation. The candidate returned the sentiment, hailing his gracious host, Hagee, as one of the great Christian leaders of our nation.?Huckabee has also welcomed the endorsement of Tim LaHaye, the co-author of the bestselling?*Left Behind*?pulp fiction series, which tells of the coming apocalyptic battle between followers of Jesus and forces of Satan. Paige Patterson, president of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, where Huckabee earned his degree in divinity, is an outspoken believer in End Times theology as well.

People also want to be done with the status quo, so you decided \\"hey, you know who would rock? The Cheney family who have been in politics since the 70s\\". People don't believe that the DNC is listening or cares about their concerns, so they decided that keeping Biden in the race even when internal polling showed him getting his ass kicked until the last second was a good call. Then, instead of letting the people choose the candidate, they ran the VP who isn't even on the Wikipedia for the 2020 democratic primary because she did so poorly. People wanted the war in Gaza to be done. So instead Biden said he was a Zionist and Harris refused to pledge to end arms shipments to Israel. Progressives didn't lose this election. Moderates who refuse to pay attention to what the rest of the country obviously want lost this election. Stupid ass moderate politics lost this election. So get off your high horse and maybe, just maybe, you will learn something about listening instead of just assuming you are right because a bunch of braindead political consultants from the 90s think the same way you do.Edit: it's fun watching the voting just showing how smug moderates are after losing the popular vote.","title":"Anyone who thought trump is anti war is a fucking moron"},{"text":"This is where we are losing.

Militia: composition and classes\\n(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.(b) The classes of the militia are(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.Not to mention none of that matters for gun rights.1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2C53.(a) The Amendments prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clauses text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2C22.(b) The prefatory clause comports with the Courts interpretation of the operative clause. The militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens militia would be preserved. Pp. 22C28.(c) The Courts interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28C30.(d) The Second Amendments drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30C32.(e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Courts conclusion. Pp. 32C47.We have court cases going all the way back to 1822 with Bliss vs Commonwealth reaffirming our individual right to keep and bear arms.Here's an excerpt from that decision.If, therefore, the act in question imposes any restraint on the right, immaterial what appellation may be given to the act, whether it be an act regulating the manner of bearing arms or any other, the consequence, in reference to the constitution, is precisely the same, and its collision with that instrument equally obvious.And can there be entertained a reasonable doubt but the provisions of the act import a restraint on the right of the citizens to bear arms? The court apprehends not. **The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it**, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.Nunn v. Georgia (1846)The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!","title":"Trump-Appointed Judge Overturns Illinois Assault Weapons Ban"},{"text":"This is nonsense and is a thinly veiled attempt to dehumanize Palestinians and declare their lives don't matter, justifying whatever atrocities and war crimes you can imagine.\\nThere was one election 18 years ago when the majority of people in Gaza weren't even old enough to vote.

Running a comeback campaign to secure a second term in 2024, he primed his supporters to once again challenge the democratic process in the event of another loss, all while spewing more misinformation about everything from post-birth abortions to pet-eating immigrants, none of which had any basis in reality.But now that Trump has defeated Vice President Kamala Harris and started appointing a Cabinet, some disappointed Democrats are turning to the kind of conspiracies they had long condemned from MAGA influencers. Most strikingly, some have pushed the unfounded claim that Trump or the GOP may have stolen votes from Harris, beginning to solidify a BlueAnon truther movement with parallels to the far-right QAnon extremism that Trump has routinely elevated from within his base.These rumblings began last Tuesday as election night results moved steadily in favor of Trump, who for the first time in three national contests was on track to win not just the electoral college but the popular vote. (His past underperformance of Biden and Hillary Clinton by this metric inspired many of his false accusations of fraud and voting by undocumented migrants.) Because many ballots had yet to be counted, particularly in blue west coast states with mail-in voting, and Harris trailed Bidens totals, highly visible social media users began to raise questions about 15 or 20 million missing votes, and called on Harris not to concede. These misleading posts were viewed millions of times.Even as Harris continued to receive more votes through the following week, closing the popular vote gap with Trump, the depressed Democratic turnout saw thousands of Dems signing a Change.org petition demanding an investigation and recount of the 2024 election, citing the erroneous 15-20 million figure and arguing, The election results DO NOT add up, and it seems that they were somehow tampered with illegally.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/blueanon-election-conspiracy-theories-elon-musk-1235162374/](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/blueanon-election-conspiracy-theories-elon-musk-1235162374/)","title":"BlueAnon Conspiracy Theories Explode as Libs Confront Another Trump Term"},{"text":"Did he finally transition?

Yes social media is sometimes discussed, but that's still not the whole picture. Alternative news sources, as well as news agregators are factors. We've known for a while that people are fed up with the status quo, are increasingly distrustful of institutions and just tired or economic turmoil. This mindset (and a great deal of complacency) made them look for alternative and convenient news sources. \\nThe election results showed us that we are in a post fact society, and those who are still reading the NYT, the Atlantic and other legacy media, are being left behind. Most of them failed in this cycle to explain and predict this outcome. Probably because until now we've not taken people seriously who live in this alternate reality. I'm guilty of this too.

This was with the current makeup, so I guess it's possible but unlikely. Texas isn't going to like having to follow what California says is legal or illegal and vice versa. Now Printz v US is a different story, but could legitimately cause a constitutional convention or a civil war. Under that decision, under the 10th amendment, states have no obligation to enforce federal law. So if there is a federal abortion ban, a state can refuse to enforce it, keep any records, or give resources to help with federal government. This was effectually blunt any federal enforcement of laws that a state disagrees with. We'll see the same if the massive deportation.

We have now locked in a scenario that means we hit 2C, especially with Trumps official Clean water and Air policy being 'De-regulation'. That's it for humanity homie. 2C means a billion, with a B, dead humans. 1 in 7 people around the world die at 2C, and while many of them will be in Africa, India and China. Several million will be dead in the US at minimum, especially in the south.The reason I say that it, is that each doubling of temperature is faster than the last. The first doubling took until the mid 90s. The second doubling took 30 years, the next doubling of temp will take a decade or less most likely. At 4C global average temp change there are less than 1 Billion humans alive. Far less. Might be less than the current population of the US.The current doubling period will finish between now and the mid 2030s. The next one would be complete by 2050, a year I will have the misfortune to live to see otherwise.The thing about a billion people dying is that it leaves another billion or two as refugees from the climate. What do you think will happen to a world with a billion or two people looking to flee to safe harbors? Bodily autonomy won't be a thing any more. Food scarcity will be huge.

I believed Trump was the anti-war candidate so I voted for him.  I have three sons, 16-14-12.  Two of them of military age over the next four years.  I love and respect the military, but what I don't want is my kids at risk for an increasingly war hungry democratic party who just seem to want to fight with *somebody*.  I don't want world war because the democrats want to build and sell tanks and missiles all over the world.Also, I work in the American timber industry, when I heard him talk about trade tariffs on Rogan I perked the fuck up.  All this to say what I love about it here is that these people are FAR more accepting of centrism.  I can say I voted for him because I don't want war and I liked his economic policies, and people around here are TOTALLY cool with that.

Also, the fact (not a rumor) that Trump has called Zelensky and not Putin since winning.  According to Russia itself, Trump has yet to reach out. The Washington Post reported that a conversation did take place, but in their own reporting described it more as Trump warning Putin not to escalate the war further.  The Russian government denies this phone call happened. Israel may be a factor in this also, with Trump reportedly enraged about an Iranian plot to assassinate him.  Iran provides weapons like Shihad drones to Russia for the Ukrainian war. You can't be pro-iranian and also soft on Ukraine. They're ultimately two fronts in the same war. This all culminates into a trend that doesn't look particularly good for Russia.  That being said, Trump is pretty chaotic. So, well see.

The court apprehends not. **The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it**, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.Nunn v. Georgia (1846)The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!","title":"Trump-Appointed Judge Overturns Illinois Assault Weapons Ban"},{"text":"See in my point of view it's not case closed.\\nBut do go on of how I'm wrong and \\"case closed\\"\\nThe magats are truly scary people","title":"Trump-Appointed Judge Overturns Illinois Assault Weapons Ban"},{"text":"They are truly dangerous and unstable.

In 2016, many Democrats believed that Trumps attack on trade policies was core to his victory. As a result, the Biden-Harris administration pursued Trump-like policies on trade, none of which seem to have made a significant difference in increasing the union vote share, reducing Trumps likelihood of victory, or stemming the flow of working-class voters out of the Democratic Party.Now, again, various parts of the Democratic coalition are seeking to define the partys loss. But what do we actually know about why the Democrats were defeated? There are still theories forming, but on todays episode of Good on Paper, I talk with the former Republican strategist and current host of The Bulwark Podcast, Tim Miller about the postelection narratives jockeying for power.Read more and listen here: [https://theatln.tc/tVJO8O9l](https://theatln.tc/tVJO8O9l)?","title":"A Former Republican Strategist on Why Harris Lost"},{"text":"??","title":"Am I missing something?"},{"text":"Sadly the average American voter is too dumb to understand harm mitigation/reduction.Anyone who didnt vote for Kamala because they were mad at the administration and thought there was no difference between her and Trump on this issue is in for a rude awakening.

They left the space totally uncontested. Trump was promising to bring prices down. No matter what he said he was going to do to make that happen, people voted for it on that promise alone. On the dems side, they didnt make a big enough deal about providing an alternative to Trumps promise. The only thing they could have offered that might be as or more appealing that what Trump was saying to them is that theyd push to increase wages and income for the middle and working class. Arguably, this is why they lost. Dems went with a standard neoliberal approach that promised a bunch of small improvements across the board, but none that would have ultimately caused any major shift in the fiscal conditions for these people. Not one simple and obvious enough for most voters to comprehend anyways. Yeah union reform and other shit like that were in her plans, but they werent walking around promising people to find a way for them to make more money without having to change their jobs, or having to spike the economy just to bring prices back down  all to solve the issue of workers wages being mostly stagnant for decades. Doesnt matter how much of it you can realistically get done. What matters is making the people feel heard and giving them a direct reason to vote for you. Whichever way you want to go about it, the biggest direct reason is that most people keep seeing their ability to afford things and their purchasing power continuing to shrink year after year even while the economy is doing better than ever. Whichever party gave the most people the hope that they could do something about that was the one that was gonna win. Frankly? The democrats should have known better and they failed catastrophically by not seeing it.","title":"High grocery prices helped Trump win Michigan.

Currently 4k+ votes in favor of repealing Ranked Choice Voting, a move pushed by republicans who got burned by it twice: first time because it helped re-elect Murkowski after they tried to primary her and ran a second Republican candidate in hopes of evicting her from senate for her 'treason against the party' in the form of a vote to convict Donald Trump; and the second time was with Peltola becoming the first democratic representative of the state in the House.

After looking at the sub, not really, but the ballot measure pairs the repeal of RCV together with the repeal of open primaries, which people have an issue with.While Alaska might save RCV in the state, as only 80% of the ballots have been counted, Republicans pulled the same trick with a ballot measure in Missouri. It is poised to join about a dozen of other Republican-leaning states after its voters approved a state constitution amendment to ban ranked-choice voting.

I'd actually argue that talking about what is included in each service detracts from the point. I never looked at these numbers before today C it was just a logical assumption C but how exactly can you argue that the penalty enforcement system is more cost-efficient?no one goes to jail because they didn't pay the TV license. It's theoretically possible to go to jail for not paying a court issued fine but this happens astonishingly rarelyI know that Liz Truss shared some misinformation about it, but people are indeed put in custody (even if temporary, i.e., they're in jail, not prison) as a result of not paying. Sure, it's indirect, because technically it's their willing refusal to pay, but that's similar to saying no one died of COVID because they technically died of respiratory failure. That's a false cause fallacy and it's bordering on equivocation.Either way, my statement about the 60m being able to be put to better use isn't negated by that. The gist is that it's wasted money. Alternatively, you could frame this in a way favoring law enforcement, if you prefer:Police officers have more important things to do with their time than act as collections officers. or favoring the media as a service in general:This money could be used to fund projects that appeal to a wider audience.Because the license fee has existed since 1946 and the BBC remains an effective and well run media institution.Okay, but your entire argument in your original post hinges on the new media landscape, which has not existed since 1946. Paid streaming services have fundamentally altered the way that media is consumed and financed. Just because something has existed since 1946, that has no bearing on its prospective success.**Public funding is precisely what allows it to be an effective and well run media institution.** Netflix and the like operate on penetration/loss-leader pricing. They have to run on years of revenue loss so that they can \\"disrupt\\" the industry by undercutting existing systems. Then they replace (privatize) the service that already existed and once they have captive consumers, they increase their prices. The collective cost of streaming services now exceeds that of cable. A similar situation happened with Uber etc. as well (I think that particular situation may be different in the UK, but that's not the point).As I understand it, your argument would accelerate this change in media in the UK.Surely the fairest manner is to only charge the people that use it?Apart from my aforementioned argument about enforcement costs, **that's simply not how societies and public goods function**. Public goods do not operate in the same way that private, consumer goods do. Following this line of thinking would negate the purpose of any shared societal resource:* I should only pay for the parts of the road that I drive on\\n* I don't drive, so I shouldn't pay for roads at all\\n* I only drink bottled water, so I shouldn't pay for water sanitation\\n* I'll die before I reach retirement age, so I shouldn't contribute to the pension fundto name a few.I hope this demonstrates why I see this as egoistic and short-sighted.For simplicity of argument, let's isolate the problem to only be about news. I feel it's important to clarify, to understand what exactly the pain point is: **Do you agree that impartial, high-quality news is a public good?**If no, how exactly should this service be provided? Privatization leads to profit-chasing, which leads to sensationalism and polarization. In the age of misinformation, societies need a collective truth, and quality information is a public good.If yes, I truly do not understand the problem you would have with everyone sharing the costs of it. Perhaps the way I framed it wasn't optimal, either. To be clear, I am arguing purely from a conceptual standpoint, divorced from the precise projects being funded and payment structure. It could, e.g., be folded into existing tax structures instead of being a monthly fee, or it could take another form. As already mentioned, we could consider only news as the media in question for simplicity's sake, since I think that is the clearest case of the value of public media.","title":"CMV: Not paying the TV Licence fee is now a perfectly reasonable consumer choice (UK Post)"},{"text":"Or that the population pays attention to any of it.

These people are vicious animals who did horrifying crimes C and I hope you guys post that, because thats my position, Mr Rubio told the activists.Mr Rubio is then asked about the civilian death toll in Gaza, which he blamed squarely on the terror group.Hamas knew that \\\\[Oct 7\\\\] was going to lead to this, so Hamas has to stop building their military installations underneath hospitals, Mr Rubio continued.The activist interjects, questioning whether Mr Rubio cares about how many people had died in Gaza, to which he says: I care, I think its horrifying, I think its terrible, and I think Hamas is 100 per cent to blame make sure you post that please.The video was filmed in December, around two months after the Oct 7 attacks. Since then, Mr Rubio has said that a ceasefire should only occur if Hamas surrenders and releases every hostage.Mr Rubio was challenged by the same activist group in March about the then Gaza death toll of 32,000, a figure that was provided by the enclaves Hamas-run health ministry.He said the number was a lie and called on Hamas to surrender so that the people there can stop suffering.Mr Rubio repeatedly clashed with Mr Trump when the pair?[ran for the Republican presidential nomination](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/07/17/watch-how-trump-former-foes-changed-their-minds/)?in 2016, notably mocking the size of Mr Trumps hands and his spray tan.He later backed Mr Trump in the 2016 race for the White House and served as a foreign policy adviser during his unsuccessful election campaign in 2020.His comments, should they form the basis of the?[Trump administrations foreign policy](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/11/donald-trump-cabinet-picks-latest-news/), would represent a marked shift from the White Houses current position.Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has repeatedly attempted to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Joe Biden, the outgoing president, urged Benjamin Netanyahu to move on and move towards a ceasefire in Gaza after the IDF?[killed Hamass leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/17/hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-killed/)?last month.Mr Trumps position has been more ambiguous. The president-elect has called himself a protector of Israel and suggested it should strike Irans nuclear facilities after it faced a barrage of missiles launched by Tehran on Oct 1.But he has also stated he wants to see an end to the conflict in Gaza and Lebanon before taking office in January, and made repeated calls for Israel to end the war quickly.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/12/marco-rubio-trump-secretary-of-state-hamas-vicious-animals/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/12/marco-rubio-trump-secretary-of-state-hamas-vicious-animals/)","title":"Marco Rubio C set to be Trumps secretary of state C calls Hamas vicious animals"},{"text":"until its from DJT's mouth, this is all speculation or false leaks.

They should have a right to adequate shelter, food/water, and safety while awaiting deportation. I don't really think in terms of rights though. Christians in the US have a duty to ensure undocumented individuals, especially at-risk women and children, are cared for while here. However, our leaders have a duty to enforce laws, protect the common good and American workers, and ensure national cohesion, and thus they have a duty to remove these individuals as quickly as possible. I do not believe in asylum rights as currently construed. They have become far broader than anyone ever envisioned and are now contrary to justice. Poor economic conditions in one's home country, for example, do not entitle him to a place in someone else's community.

To a certain extends politicians always stretch the truth, and to a certain extend, debate prep always tells you to ignore the question and say what you want to say, but it used to always be slightly tethered to reality.If we as voters decide to reward the politicians who promises us the magic wand, your own personal unicorn to cuddle with and a free dragon ride instead of costly airfare, that's a problem on its own. At that point, it really doesn't matter if Democrats are also able to find their own magical promises. Voting for magical free-floating solutions that won't happen because they can't because they literally don't exist is kinda pointless.So, to me the million dollar question is: How do we re-tether voting to reality? Trump literally had a free pass on his most outrageous things (\\"That's just how he speaks, he doesn't mean it\\") and simultaneously got to collect on a \\"concept of a plan\\" how to improve the voter's life. He failed to \\"Repeal &amp; Replace\\" Obamacare, or to let \\"Mexico pay for the wall\\", but somehow he is still perceived as the guy to \\"get things done\\". Some of these things, like \\"Infrastructure Week\\" were actually done *by Biden* and no one cared anymore.If Trump just won on one set of sound plans - plans I dislike but that are inherently plausible and could work - I would worry less.

Though the House can impeach the President, I doubt a Republican controlled Senate would have the trial and definitely wouldnt vote for conviction or any punishment even if, by some miracle they did, they held an impeachment vote.","title":"Elizabeth Warren and CNN Accuse Trump of Breaking the Law, As Second Term Hysteria Begins"},{"text":"Jesus y'all are lost and pathetic.","title":"The Confederacy Won: Why Donald Trumps Reelection Is a Win for White Supremacy, Xenophobia &amp; Hate"},{"text":"Has to be physically restrained from using a nuke like he publicly tried multiple times during his first term.It's a legitimate concern that the people who did this in Season 1 aren't going to be back for Season 2.

Essentially elevator pitch politics.\\n* Be a personality, preferably one that keeps ticking off the other side.\\n* Don't be seen as a politician, elite or established order.In short: most voters don't have the interest or attention span to keep up with politics, so the message needs to be short and something Average Joe can really connect with. It also requires someone like Bernie: someone who isn't seen as part of the established elite and knows how to drive home a message. Dems have a lot of good politicians, but those won't win the hearts of voters.The biggest issue the Dems seem to have, is that they always go for safe. People like Bernie are seen as way too radical and are shoved aside, while he's probably THE example of a candidate that could beat Trump at the polls convincingly. Maybe someone like AOC could work as far as delivering a message goes, but I fear she would already be seen by many voters as \\"elite\\" (not that the Dems would ever try a woman again, let alone someone they would consider far too radical).","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"Just think of this as Fantasy Football or Fantasy Cabinet positions","title":"Who Would You Like to See as Trump's Press Secretary?"},{"text":"He was effective at fucking over any democratic candidate they put up this election.","title":"Biden and Trump Prepare for the Most Cringe Meeting in Politics"},{"text":"Skinless ass ~~kissing~~ ^licking cowards.There I fixed it for you","title":"Trump plans to nominate Rubio for secretary of State"},{"text":"Vivian still doesn't love you, Elon.","title":"Trumps stunning comeback victory has cured America of the woke mind virus"},{"text":"Vance and Trump were duly elected to their positions, thus Vance is inaugurated VP and then becomes president.

Populists **cannot** win an educated vote.  Bernie even lost a good chunk of progressives to Biden in 2020 *because of populism*.  If there's no demographic greater than 10% of voters that will accept a populist on the ticket, how the heck do you intend them to win a presidency?

That would have served as an economic foil to counter the populism on the right. The right decided they were ok with a wrecked economy if the de-inflation it caused made their lives easier  by making their paychecks stretch further. If the left had offered a different way to make their money go further (I.e. pushing for progressive economic reform targeting the wage gap and wealth inequality) they would have probably come very close to winning, at the very least, if not won outright.","title":"Judge to rule on the fate of Trump's criminal hush money conviction"},{"text":"Isolationism?

At best, they may have watched the debate and part of the convention.  And the biggest news out of the convention was probably the protestors.People get their impression of \\"Democrats\\" from their everyday interactions.  And to the right and center, we are all \\"Democrats.\\"  They do not care that you claim to be \\"progressive,\\" or \\"Socialist,\\" or \\"Left.\\"  We are all the same.So when you look at for example, that Harris transgender prisoners ad. It's not about the prisoners.  The tag line is \\"Harris is for they/them.\\"  Because the thrust of the ad is not so much that gender reassignment surgery for prisoners is bad policy.  It's basically that left wing \\"wokeism\\" has gone amok.  The end is not \\"Check out this dumb ass policy,\\" or even \\"Harris likes transgender people\\"  The use of \\"they/them\\" there is deliberate.You only have to think back a couple of years where  everyone was adding their preferred pronouns to their social media profiles.  We all know a lot of people hated that shit.  It spawned a thousand lazy shitty jokes of \\"I identify as a watermelon\\" or whatnot.  I am not saying people should not have emphasized pronouns or whatever.  I think we should try to make the internet a safe space for trans people.  Just that we should be prepared to own what we do.The problem is that most of us online don't view ourselves as spokespeople for the DNC or any other group.  And the most actively online people are usually farther left than the mainstream and consider themselves \\"progressive\\" or just their own left wing thing rather than Democrats.So we are often just as willing to buy into right-wing FUD as Trump supporters are.  When they say \\"Democrats fucked up by doing X\\" people are like yeah, they sure did.  That is why it is so easy for them to divide and conquer.They take some of the worst takes and online excessive shit from anyone on the left, spin it in their favor, spit it back out, and half the left will agree with them.To me, the impression anyone objective would get from just cruising about online is that we do care a lot about pronouns, we do call Republicans bigots and racists constantly, reddit is a huge left wing echo chamber, and when we talk about comic issues, it's almost always from a Sociakist perspective where we attack people just fir being rich.  Like it's not \\"Elon Musk did a shitty thing.\\"  It's \\"Elon Musk is a billionaire so if course he is a shitty person who does shitty things.\\"The general reddit/internet left perspective is considerably farther left than middle America.  It's also not as unified as people think, it's just that they shut down any dissenting voices.  Don't get me wrong.  The right wing is no better.  That's the internet for you.  Everyone wants clicks and updates and ragebait works.  We don't have to get into why the internet can be bad, we all get it.But we are being incredibly delusional.  We have our own echo chambers, we spew tons of misinformation, we have a Bernie cult is honestly as scary as the worst of the Trump cult but no one says anything about them because they are on the same side, whereas any conservative not-particularly-Trumpy view will get down voted to hell.Internet left is not as that much different than internet right.  And internet left lost.  Even if you hate Harris and mainstream Democrats, you still lost.  You didn't even finish second.So yeah, the unpopularity of the \\"Democrat\\" message is really the unpopularity of the left on Social Media, not a speech Harris makes with Cheney.  So we have to figure out how we will respond, and not get distracted by Trump spitting misinformation.","title":"Trump: Democrats made big mistake getting Cheneys involved"},{"text":" Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and youre never coming round","title":"Migrants in Mexico on way to US 'feeling down' after Harris loss, Trump win: report"},{"text":"SS: [link to article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14069059/fema-worker-marni-washington-fired-breaks-silence-trump-voting-hurricane-victims.html) for more details\\"The FEMA boss who was fired after ordering volunteers [not to approach homes displaying Trump ](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14063933/FEMA-Marni-Washington-avoid-Florida-homes-Trump-signs-fired.html)signs in [Florida](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/florida/index.html) after [Hurricane Milton](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/hurricane-milton/index.html)?has insisted her edict 'was not isolated' and also happened in [North Carolina](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/north-carolina/index.html).??Speaking out for the first time since she was fired,?Marn'i Washington accused the?[Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14068861/fema-republicans-mass-firings-hurricane-trump-signs.html)?of 'lying' about the scandal, and making her the scapegoat of a wider practice.?Washington was blasted publicly and lost her job after a text chain was leaked that showed her instructing colleagues to 'avoid' houses that had Trump signs in their yards.?Washington told [DailyMail.com](http://DailyMail.com) she is seeking an attorney and is 'at risk' as a result of the backlash she's received.

The scheme came to be known as the Pence Card. By June 2024, dozens of Republican state officials and Trump associates had been indicted in four states for their alleged involvement. The federal Smith special counsel investigation is investigating Trumps role in the events. According to testimony Trump was aware of the fake electors scheme, and knew that Eastmans plan for Pence to obstruct the certification of electoral votes was a violation of the Electoral Count Act.The case is still open and Arizonas DA says she isnt dropping it, but Im sure trump will do everything he can to make sure she does.

They have done nothing to reach out with policies that would benefit middle class families who are holding on by a thread, instead they bring up hip hop stars to twerk on stage and clings to hyper left voters. Most people are in the middle and they turned a deaf ear to the population that propelled Clinton and Obama to 2 term presidencies.  The Dems have no one to blame but themselves, and as long as they clings to fringe voting block and identity politics we will continue to lose. Leaning on the LGBTQ and black women to propel us to victory is a losing strategy, theyre just arent enough votes to counteract the people who dont like the direction the country is heading (their words, not mine). The fact that such a large swath of Latino and Black men who voted for Trump should be a wake call for the party.  I have friends who always voted Dem, 2 black guys and 1 Latino voted for Trump because of identity politics leaving them feeling unseen and being taken for granted. They were concerned about the debt (which is what actually cause inflation) the drastic spending on illegal immigrants(this coming from my Latino buddy who went through the proper immigration procedures) along with violent offenders who sneak in with those who need help and my other buddies feeling like they are used as pawns to push agendas they dont agree with. I truly believe this wasnt just a middle class turn out for Trump, but other voting blocks going against the crazy ass policies my party wants to write into law.  We have left half of this country feeling horrible about how they are  by a vocal minority and how men are now Satan and are the problem with every ill this country suffers from.  They said F you to that rhetoric that made their voices heard in a massive way, and the response only helps drive home how out of touch and fringe my party has become. I couldnt vote for Trump because I dont like his policies, but this year was the first Ive ever thought about voting non-dem because of the complete fuckery the party has turned into.If you want to be mad at a party for being white supremacist and racist and whatever fucked up statements being thrown around this chat is exactly why the republicans swept this election. This party literally sounds like the people who cried after Biden one and stormed the capital.  Its disgusting and we have no one to blame but ourselves.

Harvard decision and in spite of our civil rights laws forbidding the inverse of those practices (e.g., affirmative \\"white\\" hiring). For \\"woke\\" leaders and thinkers, these programs -- which only exist because of asymmetrical applications of discrimination laws -- are the lynchpin of civil/cultural efforts to rejigger the playing field and compensate for historical adversities. I'll give you a more specific example. During the George Floyd \\"racial reckoning\\", you often heard the claim that it was a public health imperative to train more black doctors because evidence showed that when black doctors treated black patients, there were fewer bad health outcomes. The standard explanation for why black doctors were underrepresented in the first place despite these purported benefits to patients was, of course, racism and historical structural disadvantages -- and no institution could risk not doing something at the height of the zeitgeist. This resulted in many med schools dropping/lowering MCAT standards, pass-fail USMLE evaluations, and mandatory DEI/medical racism classes to enroll and graduate more black medical students (at least some of whom do not have the skill or ability to be competent doctors). Meanwhile, to be considered at top medical schools, white and Asian students had (and still have) to earn far higher grades and test scores than their peers. Until SFA v. Harvard (which still allows some breathing room for racially privileged admissions), they had no legal recourse for disparate admissions treatment, unlike their minority peers. But as was recently discovered, at least with regards to the claim that more black doctors would reduce black infant mortality, the evidence was complete junk anyways.

The idea post-civil war was that there had to be a process by which the executive could be held accountable by our representatives, but not one that was so easy that it could be abused and cause a total standstill of the executive branch. Much of the legal framework the justices reference is in light of the divisions following the civil war, where both sides were trying to strike a balance with a system that allowed for proper representation and not exile of fully half the country. The idea also in some of the arguments being made about presidential immunity etc is that if both the north and the south voted for a president that it doesnt make sense to say but he was a general in the war, he is disqualified!The process of democracy manifests the peoples voice, and the SC is of the opinion that this bypasses whatever restrictions may be placed on the ability of an individual to hold any other office in govt bc the popular vote demonstrates that person isnt viewed as an insurrectionists, or that perception is so split that fully half the country should be denied their proper representation they voted for.

The hardest part for so many people to understand is how often the Democrats leave working class and marginalized Americans in the dust.  Many people are desperate to make ends meet, and the Harris campaign, so incredibly out of touch with the needs of their own base, led their announcement of their campaign platform with tax breaks and credits for a small section of middle class Americans already most of the way to having the capital of owning their own business or buying a house.","title":"King, Jackson and Obama Had a Dream.

However, several verses in the New Testament reflect Jesus' teachings on wealth, generosity, and social justice, which some interpret as being critical of certain aspects of capitalism:1. **Matthew 19:24**: *\\"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\\"*\\n2. **Matthew 6:24**: *\\"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\\"*\\n3. **Luke 12:15**: *\\"Then he said to them, 'Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.'\\"*\\n4. **James 5:1-6**: *\\"Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you. Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.\\"*\\n5. **Acts 4:32-35**: *\\"All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And Gods grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.\\"*\\n6. **Luke 16:13**: *\\"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\\"*These verses emphasize themes such as the dangers of wealth, the importance of generosity and community support, and the need to prioritize spiritual values over material ones. While they do not directly address capitalism, they highlight principles that some people might see as being in tension with capitalist ideals.","title":"Trump has only one master, and it's not Jesus Christ"},{"text":"Because in 4 short years they/them almost destroyed the greatest country ever created.

Eventually, when a fascist movement runs out of external enemies, the leaders will look inward and declare certain group members to be enemies. The number of people considered to be Party members is quickly whittled down to only a core group, and then the movement implodes.You expressed doubt in the Leaders abilities? Enemy. You didnt stand when his anthem was played? Enemy. You didnt cheer as much as the guy next to you? Enemy. You didnt fly his flag outside your home during the prescribed time? Enemy. Your child says something in school that doesnt align to the Partys beliefs? Well, *someone* taught him to think for himself, and that person is now an enemy of the state; round up the parents.Having that enemy is always required for such movements becausewithout forced, brutal conformitythe People begin to focus on the leadership and what they *arent* providing (and theres *always* something not being done to the satisfaction of everyone because thats just the nature of any society; theres no such thing as a perfect government, and this is especially true in a society where nonconformist ideas arent allowed). This threatens the movement itself by opening minds to the possibility that others might be better suited for leadership.To be clear, this isnt restricted to fascist movements. I know we use that term as a catch-all these days (I do it, too), but Id argue that every *authoritarian* movement requires the constant purging of nonconformists from its ranks, and both history and current events agree.We need only look to Russia, North Korea, or Iran for proof; we dont even need Nazi Germany to prove this theory, although Nazi Germany is still an excellent example. First it was one class of Jewish people and the Nazis political opponents. Soon it was other groups who didnt fit into the Party. Finally, when all their external enemies were either locked up or had been murdered, they turned their attention inward (and, to be honest, they were doing this all along as well).This is why I believe a form of democracywith universal suffrageis the only long-term government that can survive (especially in the modern era). Sure, you can brutalize a population for a long, long time, but your authoritarian government will always be unstable; always one unforeseen event away from collapse. Democracy can deal with these collapses by not only anticipating them with rules written in stone, but by mandating that they happen at set intervals (elections) and ensuring that everyone agrees on the rules (i.e., mostly that everyone has a chance to govern every so often if they can win an election, so the focus becomes *politics*, not insurrection; its a peaceful form of war).I dont believe that the MAGA faithful value democracy. Their leader certainly does not. Although Ive disagreed with many leaders during my time on this Earth, this is really the first time weve had a *truly* anti-democratic movement (rather than one that merely *flirts* with authoritarianism) take power (twice), and i think version 2 is going to make version 1 look like a picnic.","title":"Biden wants Americans to \\"bring down the temperature\\"  but MAGA will not let that happen: In conversations with Republican voters, we learned why they shun unity"},{"text":"I knew my numbers were off.

It is the end of one era and the beginning of the authoritarian era. Biden invested in the American people via policy in things like IRA and chips act. Trump invested in propaganda infrastructure along with Elon. The American public is no longer voting on policy benefit analysis but on emotional reality. Trump controls the mechanism people use to understand their reality, tv, all sorts of digital media, multiple social networks. No amount of academic peer reviewed studies, data, rhetoric will change those perceptions. Anyone who says we dont live in a deeply bigoted country has never lived in it as a minority.
