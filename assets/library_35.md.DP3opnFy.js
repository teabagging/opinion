By suppressing the House Ethics Committee investigation that reportedly has evidence of Gaetz doing such a thing, Johnson has shown that he's far more outraged at the possibility that a man might face consequences for this behavior. To be fair to Tapper, it's doubtful he's genuinely surprised at Johnson's priorities. Instead, the issue here is that Johnson loves to tell other people, especially women and LGBTQ people, that they are sinful for having far more ordinary sex lives. Worse, he built his career on using the law to force his rules for sexual \\"morality\\" on others, even arguing that laws against homosexuality, abortion, and divorce are necessary to prevent \\"sexual anarchy.\\" \\n \\n On the surface, that sounds like hypocrisy. But what's going on is far darker. Covering for a man accused of sexual abuse of a minor is not just normal for the Christian right, but so rote that it can be considered a tradition of the faith. Johnson is a Southern Baptist, the same denomination that saw a report released two years ago documenting how the church kept a \\"secret list of more than 700 abusive pastors\\" that they largely chose to protect, often while blaming the often-underage victims for \\"tempting\\" them. In one instant, a teenaged victim \\"was forced to apologize in front of the church\\" for being pregnant, but forbidden from naming the pastor that had raped her. When activists first tried to force transparency on the church, the Southern Baptist Convention's lawyer, Augie Boto, accused them of conspiring as part of \\"a satanic scheme.\\"\\n \\n Johnson's views on sexual morality come from what critics of the religious right have deemed \\"purity culture.\\" In my March report on the sprawling network of ex-evangelicals and other anti-fundamentalism activists, the experts repeatedly emphasized that, within purity culture, responsibility for sexual restraint is put mostly and often wholly on the shoulders of women and girls. Sometimes, there are half-baked attempts to claim they want men to control themselves, but that's more a P.R. move than a sincere effort. Far more common in the religious right is a belief that men are incapable of controlling their desires. If sexual \\"sin\\" happens  even if it's outright violence  the fingers are pointed directly at the girl or woman for not being \\"modest\\" enough.","title":"How Mike Johnson's Christian \\"morality\\" provides cover for Matt Gaetz"},{"text":"I think he is not picking the most qualified.

Those who pine for third parties - if the Green party were serious, it would have played the same game as the Christian Nationalists - it had decades to grow, but their insistence on only entering the presidential race makes their motives highly suspect.

But there is a native word for sex: ??. (which normally means to stick) This is the dictionary definition: ()   ? ??(Խ)??.This usage of the word is very vulgar, but it has been around for ages.

But note these words are considered all old-fashioned now, and have been replaced by loanwords.The reason for these words disappearing so rapidly can be explained with the rapid collapse of the Korean caste system in the late 19th centruy - mid 20th century. These vulgar words were associated with lower social class, and vulgar words were considered a symbol of the lower class. But as the caste system collapsed and everyone became \\"the equal higher class\\", people refrained from using those words. At the same time, western influence was rushing in rapidly.

All Republicans plus Manchin voted against him. Its **Embry Kidd**; he failed to disclose two cases involving child sex crimes where he was accused of being too lenient. From [Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3051438/biden-judicial-nominee-failed-to-disclose-rulings/):1. *U.S. v. DHaiti* pertained to a case in which the defendant, a male who was a cheerleading coach at a central Florida High school, was arrested in 2022 for possession of child pornography. The defendant, in one instance, reached his hands up a minors sports bra and fondled her. Kidd elected to release the defendant based on his high character, ties to the community, and lack of criminal history. The order was reversed by a district judge, and the defendant was ultimately sentenced to 29 years in prison.2. *U.S. v. King* related to a convicted sex offender charged with receipt and possession of child sex abuse material. Kidd issued an order restricting only some of the defendants usage of the internet and devices. Kidd told the defendant all thats been presented is that you downloaded images and that you had them on your phone, that you admitted to having them and initially ordered his release based on limited risk of danger to the community. An FBI special agent later testified about the defendants attraction to a child at a restaurant. The order was reversed by a district judge, and the defendant was ultimately sentenced to about 24 years in prison.If this is all accurate (I know the *Washington Examiner* is a biased paper), I probably wouldnt have voted for him either. Child sex crimes are serious offenses.**EDIT:** The cases are discussed in the [Nomination Hearing](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/06/05/2024/nominations) starting at 1:01:20. Also see [Written Questions and Responses](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-06-05_-_qfr_responses_-_kidd.pdf). The *Washington Examiner* story is accurate, though it misses some details which actually make Kidds decisions look even worse in my opinion.

Right now, S America is one of the few places on Earth to mine Lithium. So its likely that Xi already controls the Lithium extraction in S America. In addition, China is the largest producer of rare-earth metals which are crucial for electric cars (aka Musk). Although every country has deposits, not all of them are profitable. The main reason is environmental concerns. Is Musk about to start mining here? Totally possible but most likely it will be too expensive and unprofitable.

NATO has placed eFPs along its eastern flank, made up of members from the entire alliance. There are a couple thousand American soldiers in the Baltics. America leads eFP Poland and 2CR is permanently stationed around Orszysz.Its not a matter of whether its enough to stop Russia, its that an invasion of the Baltics and Poland will automatically draw Russia into a full blown war with NATO, and most importantly, the USA. That would be suicidal for Russia, which is why people say that the level of deterrence there is enough.?This is the scenario that the West wants to see with Ukraine post-war.

People don't cross that political divide often, especially for national elections. The people most receptive to racism and sexism were pulled into the Republican Party years ago, as part of the southern strategy and the push further into the right-wing fringe to gain more voters. Once in the cult of Republicanism, they will support women and POC running as Republicans because they are members of the cult.This article shows what the election results from Blue states show, the Democratic voters didn't vote. If you are blaming racism or sexism as the cause, you are saying that Democrats won't vote for a Democrat who is a POC or woman. The fact that MTG and Boebert were sent back as representatives shows Republicans have no issues voting for women. You managed to use a full bingo card of terms, but didn't show how any apply to my comment.

When you hand wave and declare those potential voters didn't vote because they are racist or sexist, you are ascribing things to them and making character assumptions based on no evidence. There is no evidence that Democrats stayed home due to sexism and racism, but there is plenty of evidence that neoliberalism has hollowed out the Democratic Party as more of the poor and working class are disillusioned by an economic system that abuses them while a political party that ignores them instead of helping them. There is also plenty of evidence that disillusioned people don't vote.","title":"Weak turnout in key cities hurt Harris in the 'blue wall' states More people voted in 2024 than in 2020 in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but that growth came from pro-Trump areas."},{"text":"No, but the buck famously stops at the presidents desk.","title":"Stocking up on 6 months of food like the Trump presidency = doomsday"},{"text":"I think you just got sued.","title":"Breaking Now: Trump Appoints Linda McMahon as Education Secretary Amid Plans to Dissolve Education Department"},{"text":"\\"RINO\\"s are about to start hamstringing some things, either outright, or by appearing incompetent.","title":"GOP No-Shows Help Dems Push Through Biden Judicial Nominees"},{"text":"Yeah, totally the same as buying shares and options","title":"LA enacts sanctuary city ordinance to prepare for potential mass deportations under Trump"},{"text":"The Deep State is a bullshit conspiracy leveraged against feeble minded dips.

Instead of fostering widespread prosperity, it often results in a widening wealth gap and slower growth for the majority of the population. Economic policies that prioritize investment in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and direct assistance to low- and middle-income individuals tend to lead to more sustainable and inclusive growth. Just look at other nations with higher taxes on the wealthy and strong social safety nets (e.g., the Scandinavian countries) and you will see a stark contrast. These countries tend to have higher economic growth, lower levels of inequality, and stronger public services. They combine progressive taxation with investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which benefits society as a whole, rather than relying solely on wealth accumulation at the top.

Very perceptive","title":"Russia Appears to Have Finally Lost It"},{"text":"However, concern is high among some Republicans about the political downsides of such cuts, which would affect programs that provide support for at least 70 million low-income Americans, and some people familiar with the talks stressed that discussions are preliminary.I dont think that passing just an extension of tax cuts that shows on paper an increase in the deficit [is] going to be challenging, said one GOP tax adviser. But the other side of the coin is, you start to add things to reduce the deficit, and that gets politically more challenging.The discussions center on Trumps 2017 tax bill, which lowered taxes for the vast majority of Americans. Major portions of that law are set to expire at the end of next year, and extending those provisions  as Trump has proposed  would add more than $4 trillion to the already soaring national debt over the next decade, according to congressional bookkeepers. The debt exceeds $36 trillion now. Trump also campaigned on a bevy of new tax cuts  such as ending taxes on tips and overtime  which tack trillions more onto the overall price tag.While Republican leaders support extending the tax cuts, many are concerned that the resulting loss of revenue would further increase borrowing, so the hunt for savings is on: In addition to social safety net programs, many Republicans are also looking to repurpose clean energy funds approved by Democrats. Trumps tariff plans could also raise additional revenue. But those ideas may prove unworkable or insufficient to fully account for the cost of a sweeping new tax package.Republicans warn that Medicaid spending has ballooned in the wake of the Affordable Care Acts expansion, saying that the programs structure puts outsize pressure on the federal budget. While states administer the program, the federal government provides matching payments that heavily subsidize it.House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) told reporters Wednesday that a responsible and reasonable work requirement for Medicaid benefits resembling the one that already exists for food stamps could yield about $100 billion in savings. He also said another $160 billion in reduced costs could come from checking Medicaid eligibility more than once per year.I feel like there are some common-sense, reasonable things that almost 90 percent of the American people would say, Thats got to change, Arrington said.One influential conservative think tank, the Paragon Health Institute, published a July paper outlining some additional Medicaid changes that it said would cut federal deficits by more than $500 billion over a decade.Republicans are also discussing stripping presidential authority to recalculate benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food stamp program known as SNAP, lawmakers say. The 2017 farm bill allowed the White House to increase benefits even if doing so raised the national debt. Republicans argue that if they eliminate that authority and hem in SNAP benefits  which increase automatically with inflation  that should count as reducing the deficit by tens of billions of dollars, according to some estimates.Limiting what food items SNAP recipients can purchase with benefits would also reduce costs. House Republicans have pushed a similar proposal in recent spending bills.One GOP tax adviser said lawmakers were looking at broadening work requirements for SNAP eligibility, something the conservative Heritage Foundations Project 2025 playbook recommends.More than 70 million people receive health benefits through Medicaid. One plan considered by the Senate in 2017 would have lowered Medicaid enrollment by 15 million people, with most of them unlikely to find alternate health coverage, according to projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Youll have to see the details of what theyre proposing, but most of these achieve their savings not by stopping waste but instead by preventing eligible people from successfully signing up by creating so much red tape, said Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. What weve seen in some states that have tried this is a significant portion of the eligible population unable to successfully enroll, without health care.The politics of federal safety net programs have frequently splintered the GOP coalition. Some GOP aides and policy experts predict cuts to Medicaid and food stamps will ultimately be jettisoned from any tax bill, particularly if the legislation also has a cut in the corporate tax rate.Some of them are looking at Medicaid and food stamps. When you talk about spending, that is the place they immediately go, said one GOP policy adviser. But Im not sure they want the headlines about paying for tax cuts by cutting those programs.While Trump vowed to protect Medicaid as a candidate during his 2016 presidential bid, the first Trump administration allowed 13 GOP-led states to add work requirements to their Medicaid programs, a controversial change that was the focus of legal battles. The requirements only took full effect in one state, Arkansas, for a five-month period when about 18,000 people were dropped from the program.The Biden administration rescinded approval for those states work requirements, with liberals citing evidence that the initiatives created new administrative burdens and arguing that it jeopardized enrollees health. But the new Trump administration could again issue waivers that allow states to impose work requirements on enrollees, say current and former officials.Please engage in actual discussion, and save the platitudes for the bar.","title":"Trump allies eye overhauling Medicaid, food stamps in tax legislation"},{"text":"Insanity.","title":"These women really think that r*pe will escalate under Trump.

But that is simply a political slogan designed to justify efforts to eliminate the ability of U.S. citizens to sponsor their parents, siblings or adult children for immigration The 16-year-old Friedrich Trump, who spoke little English, would not have hopped on a ship and came to America without a family member already in place to help him. In 1885, when Friedrich immigrated, he joined his sister Katherine, who had immigrated to New York a year earlier, according to Gwenda Blair. Friedrich went back to Germany and fell in love with Elizabeth Christ, who eventually became Donald Trumps grandmother. Elizabeth Christ Trump immigrated to America with Friedrich and one of their children was Fred Trump, Donald Trumps father.These statements say that donolds grandpa was able to get in through his sister and his wife was able to get in through him The same pattern of an earlier family member helping another close relative can be seen with Donald Trumps mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who many people may be surprised to learn was an immigrant. Mary Anne MacLeods sister was married and lived in Queens. That allowed Mary Anne to immigrate to America from Scotland in 1930Then donolds mother got into America because of her sister.

Cops/military/ICE/whatever stopping you on the regular to ask for your papers, racist neighbors turning you in on the regular...it's going to be uncool for you.There's a woman who was verbally harassed in an airport bathroom by other women who thought she was a man (because of a medical condition affecting her looks). The irony of it was she herself was a supporter of anti-trans bathroom laws, and she was being accused of being trans. It turns out that when we don't make an issue of this shit, we...don't make an issue of this shit. People might wonder about the woman next to them in the bathroom, but maybe they don't say anything. They might wonder if their Latino neighbors are legal, but they just mutter it to themselves. Once we make it a legal issue, a popular issue that we're all openly addressing, those barriers drop. Now we can point to the \\"women only\\" sign with the legal code that's posted in the bathroom. We have a form we can fill out to turn in those neighbors. We've made people angry about these non-issues *and given them tools*, and angry people with tools tend not to be really discriminate about who they use them on. *You may be one of the \\"good ones,\\" but no one has any way of knowing that.*Being an immigrant and shouting in the streets, \\"Deport all the illegal immigrants\\" amounts to shouting, \\"Deport all the people who look just like me!

Bed space in detention is very limited in proportion to the number of illegal aliens (and legal yet possibly deportable aliens). There are 600 IJs. The line is very, very long, and detained aliens go first. If there's no bed space, the alien is \\"non-detained\\" and might see an IJ in a few years, after which he has married a US citizen and has a couple of kids...which, with an approved I-601A, makes him eligible for permanent residency. Absent that, and if his asylum claim is denied, then he will likely be ordered removed. Then, his docket officer (or HQ for some countries) will arrange to get a travel document. You don't need it for certain Central American countries, but you do for pretty much everywhere else. Southeast Asia? Certain African countries? Central/West Asia? China? Russia? It ain't gonna happen unless the alien is wanted for a crime back home and they actually want to get their pound of flesh (most of the time they're just happy to be rid of him). Even South Korea and the UK can be difficult to get a TD from. Meanwhile the clock is ticking, and you cannot hold an alien indefinitely if he is cooperating to the best of his ability. Within six months he will usually have to be released, most often at less than 90 days, unless you can accomplish everything above and get him deported...and that's not even taking into account the Board of Immigration Appeals or US District Court of Appeals.So yeah, Trump talks a big game, and both sides, generally ignorant of the process, believe him.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Time to bust out the bleach...can we get light, a strong light in there?!","title":"Just in time for Trump to appoint antivaxxers in all Medical cabinets."},{"text":"1.

My question to OP is this, how? How do you do determine someone is an unauthorized immigrant? How do you deport them? Explain the logistics of it to me. You might well say, theres nothing wrong with building a colony on the moon and sending unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime there. Ok, cool, lets agree theres nothing wrong with that. Whats next? Do you see what Im getting at? My adult daughter is adopted and of Mexican descent. She has birthright citizenship granted to her via the 14th Amendment to the Constitution (for now at least). She also has a learning disability and some mental health issues which make it difficult for her to communicate at times. What happens if she gets pulled over and accused of committing a crime? Youve said committed a crime, but I assume you mean, been convicted of committing a crime in a court of law, right? How does she prove she isnt an unauthorized  immigrant? She isnt married and has no children how do I find out shes in lockup and about to face deportation so I can bring the documentation needed for her trial? I was once in family court (I was a foster parent for many years) and one of the adult members of the family involved in the case didnt show up in court one day. The commissioner (like a judge) demanded to know where this person was and the bailiff informed them that this person had been pulled over for a traffic infraction and is now in ICE custody and there was little chance wed ever see them again. That was the end of the case, this member of the family was just gone, totally beyond the reach of the State Court. Do you really think theres nothing wrong with that? What about the people in that family who were left behind? I cant tell you much about them but I can tell you it had a major impact on their lives.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Been a while since Franken though.

Gas controls the price of everything, farm equipment and transportation of goods need gas so when gas goes down food goes down.Average inflation rate per year under Obama was about 1.75%, Trump was about 1.9%, Biden so far is about 5.67%. I do agree price gouging is an issue.I dont think tariffs will be applied to food because a considerable portion of Trumps campaign was built on groceries being too expensive. But I guess you never know since he doesnt have to worry about reelection this time.And illegal immigrants dont make up a big of a part of the agricultural industry as you think. Most commercial farms are large scale and everything from planting to harvesting is done with heavy machinery.

However, I suspect that the deportations will be far less than some people now are fantasizing that they might be.  key idea due process is still a thing in the usa, and until it isn't, \\"deportation\\" will be slow.   i'm not taking a view here one way or another on the correctness or ethics of the proposed deportations - i'm just saying that IF they are to happen, they might not be as sweeping or fast as some are envisioning.Here's why:1.  identification.  how do you identify an \\"illegal?\\"  if somebody comes up to you and asks you for proof of citizenship, what obligation do you have to furnish it?   if the government accuses somebody of a crime, they need to furnish proof - in this case, negative proof.    each case needs to be brought before a judge and tried on its merits.  there simply arent enough judges for the numbers.2.  deport to where, exactly?  a guatemalan travels through mexico and enters the us illegally. this is a common pattern.    they burn their guatemalan passport and refuse to indicate their home country.  what country is under obligation to take them back?   guatemala only is the answer.  you might think that it's \\"mexico\\" in this case, but it isn't - just ask GB vis a vis france and the people trying to get into the uk from france via boat.3.  any illegal immigrant who applied within the last year to the usa can apply for asylum status. this can't be undone.  4.  foreign criminals can be deported.  but, this is not new.5.  ironically, one way that might actually make things go smoother is to pay mexico or some other country to take people.  but, this also has issues.    \\ni get that some people are imaging the texas national guard pulling up to home depot parking lots with buses and driving those to the mexican border.  but, unless the us turns into a full-on fascist state, this just won't happen legally.    get one us citizen in there by accident, and that's a very serious violation.","title":"Trump plans the largest deportation ever.

Cowboy Bebop is a Sci-fi show focused on a rag tag team of bounty hunters. The character writing is extremely compelling, the action is similar to that of a 90s movie mixed with some spaceship dogfighting, and the animation is gorgeous.\\n2. Monster (2004) is about a Japanese brain surgeon living in post cold war Germany who finds out that a young boy whose life he saved turned into a horrifying serial killer. So, the doctor vows to kill the Monster he inadvertently created. Genuinely the best written show/manga I've ever seen, it's a fantastic mystery thriller.\\n3. My Hero Academia is about a high school student named Deku who lives in a world where half of the population have quirks (i.e. superpowers). He wasn't born with any quirk, but due to his bravery in trying to save another student, he runs into the world's number 1 hero who passes down his quirk to Deku. So the show is about Deku learning to control his newfound abilities while villains plot to upend society as a whole. Really good action, a fun variety of characters, &amp; a general good time until the consequences start to ramp up towards the end of the series. \\n4. Star Trek: The Next Generation is a Sci-Fi show set in the far future about a space crew who explores the Galaxy looking for the unknown. The show can be both intentionally &amp; very unintentionally hilarious with its campy action &amp; bad special effects. But the real neat &amp; potatoes are the philosophical discussions. Topics about what defines life, what inherent rights do all sentient beings deserve, and so on. \\n5. Arcane is mostly focused on two sisters who find themselves caught up in the unrest of a city dealing with power struggles between the ultra rich &amp; the poor. I don't want to give toomuch away since imo it's vest experienced blind. The show uses brand new animation techniques that make it breath takingly gorgeous and this show has stellar writing. Season 2 is currently airing so it's a great time to get into it.\\n6. Psych is a buddy cop show about a a guy who's observation skills are so good, he cons people &amp; the police into thinking he's psychic. Just a laid back mystery comedy where you can turn your brain off &amp; enjoy yourself. \\n7. Pantheon is an animated show about how the world would react to the technology of being able to transfer a human mind into a computer. It goes deep into the ditches about how world governments, corporations, &amp; individuals caught up in this would handle such a revelation. A very fascinating &amp; underrated show. I hope one of these might pique your interest.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 19, 2024"},{"text":"Thats absolutely horrific.

Personally, I don't see the huge difference between past Republicans and Trump that some others do. I see a much bigger difference between the Democrats of yesteryear and the Democrats of today.

We are people who support each other.So when I heard that people who call themselves Somalis signed an agreement with Ethiopia, many people reached out to me and said I needed to talk to the U.S. government. They asked, what would the U.S. government do? My answer was that the U.S. government will do what we tell the U.S. government to do. That is the confidence we need to have as Somalis. We live in this country. This is the country where we pay taxes. This is the country that has elected a woman from your community.

May peace be upon you. This is the speech. It could be worse, but it sounds pretty close to \\"I'm loyal to Somalia\\". Though the port deal is complicated, we can't pretend it's not. During her recent speech, Omar spoke assertively about her role in American foreign affairs, despite lacking any formal role in foreign policy; she was removed from the House Committee on Foreign Affairs last year by Republicans for what she has said were trumped-up charges of antisemitism. When I heard that people who call themselves Somalis signed an agreement with Ethiopia, many people reached out to me and said I needed to talk to the U.S. government. They asked, What would the U.S. government do? My answer was that the U.S. government will do what we tell the U.S. government to do. That is the confidence we need to have as Somalis.In an email to the Reformer, Omar said the attacks are disingenuous attempts to malign my character and question my loyalty to my home, America.(Shortly after taking office in 2019, Omar faced criticism for seeming to accuse supporters of Israel of dual loyalties.)\\nAnother article that called out the mistranslation:\\nThe second part of the speech accurately translates to the following:When we heard the other day that some Somali peopleor who claim to be Somalissigned an agreement with Ethiopia, many people called me and said to me, Ilhan, you should talk to the U.S. government. Whats the U.S. government going to do about this?My answer was that the U.S. government would do what we ask it to do. We should have this kind of confidence in ourselves as Somalis. We live in this country, we are taxpayers. This is the country where one of your own is sitting in Congress. As long as I am in Congress, no one can take Somalias sea, and the U.S. government wont support others to rob us. Dont stress over it, Minnesotans.Omar defended herself in a series of social media posts after news of her speech spread.Its not only slanted but completely off, she said in a January 28 post on X, but I wouldnt expect more from these propagandists. I pray for them and for their sanity.She added that no nation can survive if an unrecognized government within its borders negotiates leasing land with other countries without the consent of its federal government. Somalis in Somalia and in the diaspora are united in that effort and I stand in solidarity with them, Omar continued in her post.","title":"Donald Trump set to recognise African state as official country (Somaliland), says ex-Tory minister after holding talks"},{"text":"To be fair, the article is from October 24th.","title":"Trump's rambling speeches raise questions about mental decline  Has America just put a dementia patient in the Oval Office?"},{"text":"No shit.

Only immigration agencies (ICE, CBP) can enforce immigration law, aside from the 287g program through ICE.As far as committing a crime. Most aliens are arrested for driving without a valid license. They still have to get to work, church, go to the doctor, grocery store, and so on. We'd be pissed if they weren't working. If they have kids they're taking kids to school. Consider that US citizens do the exact same thing every day, clearly they have the same lack of respect for the law. Why should it be any different? A US citizen didn't necessarily earn citizenship, I was born here, and my family came here about 400 years ago (without visas or greencards). Also consider that once upon a time, the Mexican border was much further north...if you're Texan, Californian, New Mexican, Arizonan, then your ancestors were themselves Mexican citizens. The border moved.But, I can agree that it's \\"less wrong\\" to deport an unaccompanied adult alien for committing a crime than one who has a family, or who has committed no crime.Asylum law requires applying for asylum in a safe country. If Mexico is a safe country, then how come there's not a lot of American migration there? Do you want to live in Mexico? I sure as hell don't. Some countries and political entities also do not entertain asylum claims. It sounds funny to say it, but Hong Kong is one notable place that doesn't grant asylum to anyone, they will refer you to mainland China for that (where the chance is slightly greater than 0%).If someone is too dangerous to be allowed in the US, then they shouldn't be released from jail. It's not any better that his victims will be in whatever country he's deported to. Is it okay if he murders, rapes, or assaults someone as long as it doesn't take place on US soil? Is it okay if he drives drunk and kills someone as long as it's not on an American road? Is selling dope okay as long as it's sold elsewhere?

I absolutely understand if nobody believes this is true, but as someone who used to agree with you I think its important to share.  My partner and I live in Philly.   Were both men.   Im white, hes Black.  In 2020, on the EXACT DAY that PA was officially called for Biden, we had a run in with some neighbors.    We were on the couch watching tv, and some kids were being loud outside.  Nothing crazy.  Suddenly it went from the sound of playing to a child literally screaming help, help!I was out the door first while he got clothes on.   A new neighbor across the street had his child by the hair and was punching them repeatedly.   I dont mean backhanding, or slapping, I mean winding up over the shoulder and punching this screaming, crying, bloody child.    Within a few seconds half the neighborhood was on their stoop, everyone ( I assume) dialing 911.   Many people, including my partner filmed while I and a few others got the guy off the child.   The kid was covered in blood, the guys hands were covered in blood, there was blood on the sidewalk.   We waited for the officers to arrive.  Finally, a patrol car shows up.   Two officers in thin blue line face masks get out of the car and immediately rush my partner, the only black man present ( its port Richmond, if you know the city then you know this neighborhood is super white).  Its only after the entire neighborhood erupts and points out the bloody belligerent man, screaming the N word at my partner, that they realize they misread the situation.   But wait, there is more.   Soooo much more.   As it would happen, one of the two officers KNOWS HIM.   She takes him and the child inside, and cleans him up.   Then she comes back outside and tells the crowd that there are no children present inside of the house.  Again, the neighborhood erupts.  We just watched the kid go inside the house.   At this point shes blatantly lying to a large number of witnesses.  She decides to deal with this by telling everyone to go inside or she was going to start making arrests.   Almost everyone complies, and to the best of my knowledge, that child was left alone with the man who was beating him bloody that night.  Cut to the next day.   Im not dropping this, so I go with one of our neighbors to the precinct.   When we describe the situation and the location, what do you know, they dont have ANY RECORD OF THE CALLS.   We watched the entire block all make the same 911 call at the same time but somehow they have no record.  In fact, the only, single record she has from the block the previous night was about a disorderly black male.   Thats right, the only complaint they logged was about my bf, who intentionally minimized his involvement and let the rest of us handle it.   So I said but how can this be, so many people called and we all witnessed it and spoke to the officers.  And do you know what that old pig told me?   She said well the building does have really old phone lines.  I watched an entire department knowingly bury child abuse to protect someone they knew.   And thats the reason that Im now on team ACAB.Edit:   Two bonus shorts that also helped to inform my opinion.   [We had an officer in Philly who was openly covered in Nazi tattoos](https://www.phillyvoice.com/former-philly-cop-nazi-tattoo-ian-hans-lichterman-navy-yard-police/amp/).

Additionally, we had a guy put a Punisher \\nlogo on his service weapon.  You know, the logo of a character who uses guns to kill criminals in mass in his pursuit of justice.   This is who they are.  The ones who stand up get fired or harassed out of the force, and the others are all ok with it.   And these are just a few of the stories that have directly touched my life.

According to exit polls, some 70% of voters said they made their minds up months ago. By that logic alone, the people who were likely swayed by the late-game messaging that occurred since the debate seems the minority of voters, 30% or less. Thats usually how it is, actually. Im not saying that is not enough to swing the electorate one way or the other, not at all, but I dont agree that her messaging was really that bad. We see this happen in close elections all the time. A handful of swing state voters (as few as 240,000) could have given her a victory instead, across WI, PA, and MI. A fraction of a percent here or there would have been all it took to beat Trump electorally, and it seems his popular vote margin is on track to fall below 2% as the last of the votes are reported. I think if she had more time to break through the media bubbles she could have easily won over many of those 30% of voters. Another measly 2% bump was literally with the margin of error for polling and would have made a Harris victory much more likely.Considering she still came that close, even after speed running a campaign and digging herself out of record low approval ratings to boot, she managed to nearly win. In a year when every incumbent party on earth was punished by voters over inflation. As the first ever nominated black woman in the U.S. to run for our highest office. The loss is disappointing to many, yes, but I fail to see how you can say she had poor messaging when she nearly won after everything else that was standing against her and managed one of the most unprecedented comebacks in all of presidential campaign history. It could have been much worse given how much odds seemed to tip in favor of Trump after Bidens debate appearance.","title":"Swing voters went for Donald Trump because of trans rights issues, poll finds"},{"text":"Well this post will surely leap u into karma heaven.

This fearmongering tactic is kinda how Youngkin won the governorship in VA. It played out this year with trans sports.That said, the feeling of the economic issues that the global post COVID inflation causes was certainly felt. The culture war bullshit was flooding in to create the outrage to keep the subject on that instead of the economy where the Democrats had a better platform (tax cuts for the rich and tariffs are not a cost of living improvement for the working class nor net total job creators).","title":"The narrative that \\"woke\\" politics is why Trump won is nonsense"},{"text":"I'm all for recounting anything that seems suspicious but a blog with four posts from some random ass guy with zero evidence for his claims or credentials should be taken with so much salt that molluscs go extinct.","title":"Trump did not win a majority of popular votes"},{"text":"This is so fucking weird, shes using this as a threat?!

In retrospect, yes, Biden should have refused to run for a second term, which put democrats in a tough spot this election, but there are still some roadblocks in place for Republicans come next term.Looking at the last eight years alone, two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.Contrarily, the Trump/MAGA coalition has had four years to prepare an agenda that will bring about a crisis of incompetence at every level government, and pave the way for Republicans to consolidate power. If Trump won in 2020, the midterms would have probably been more favorable for Democrats though. and judging by the shit show in the house the last two years, the GOP would have probably been even more powerless due to the Republican factionalism we've seen.Also, a second consecutive Trump presidency would have completely tarnished his legacy, considering that it was always going to be an uphill battle no matter who won in 2020.Inflationary issues, economic fallout from the pandemic, foreign conflicts, increased immigration, all of these things would have still occurred under a 2020 Trump presidency. (If you're skeptical about that last one, remember that there was a massive slowdown in immigration due to the pandemic, and subsequent migration/asylum restrictions). And judging by Trump's previous economic and foreign policy record, which was disastrous mind you, it's very likely that some of these issues would have been exacerbated by another Trump term.However, precisely because Biden is sandwiched between two Trump terms, his admin can forever be scapegoated by Republicans for any and all problems that may arise over the next four years. Whereas, if Trump won in 2020, Republicans would have, realistically, no one to blame but themselves. That probably wouldn't stop them from finding some way to blame Democrats though. What's really unnerving is the fact that Donald Trump will be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. He'll take credit for everything he can take credit for, and he'll blame others for everything he can avoid taking responsibility for.History is repeating itself. At the end of the last two Republican administrations, an economic crisis emerged, both times a Democrat stepped into office and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. And in the midst of this fallout, Republicans took advantage of the opportunity to turn crisis into campaign talking points.Donald Trump inherited a growing economy in 2017, and he left office in 2020 with the economy in tatters.Under Trump the national debt exploded.Under Trump Republicans passed tax cuts legislation that permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations, legislation that is estimated to cost the government trillions. During his first presidency, Trump instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. While his tariff proposals for his next administration are estimated to be far more economically damaging for Americans. While he was president, Trump pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His administration hamstringed the labor movement, made it more difficult for workers to unionize, weakened labor regulations and protections, reduced overtime pay eligibility, and implemented policies that generally favored employers over employees, taking power away from unions. Trump also mishandled the pandemic at nearly every turn, and was responsible, in no small part, for encouraging Republicans to politicize every aspect of COVID. The culture wars that ensued divided Americans during a time of crisis.It can't be emphasized enough that all of these things and more contributed to economic issues that extended into the Biden administration.In terms of his foreign policy, and I'll have to make this as brief as I can, he also cozied up to the world's autocrats and dictators, and escalated conflicts in multiple theaters. In fact, during Trump's presidency, Congress had to pass not one, but two historic war powers resolutions due to Trump's dangerous interventionism and his actions that directly led to increased provocations in multiple foreign regions. Trump weakened our alliances, emboldened our enemies, withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, abandoned our Kurdish allies, aided the Kremlin agenda and Russian proxy wars, sought to weaken NATO, rescind Russian sanctions, encouraged Russian cyber attacks, crippled our ability to act as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians, made allies with the Saudi crown Prince and emboldened and intervened in his violent, warmongering agenda in Yemen. Trump literally negotiated with terrorists, caved into the Taliban's pressures, made concessions that were dubious at best, and provided no Afghanistan withdrawal or evacuation plan for the next administration. And this doesn't even scratch the surface. Unfortunately, the fallout from all of this will be blamed on Biden in perpetuity, but ironically, if it were not for Biden winning in 2020, the outcomes under Trump would have been far far worse. That's the silver lining here I suppose, and maybe, considering everything, it's thinner than I imagined.It's a shame that such a large percentage of the American electorate does not make politically informed decisions, that they care more about their immediate circumstances than knowing anything I've mentioned previously about Trump's record.Walter Lippman, one of the most influential journalists in American history, called the general public an \\"irrational force,\\" nearly a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever.*Feelings* are what got Trump elected, and although there might be some of us looking forward to the next Trump administration crashing and burning, let's instead hope that Republicans run into enough obstacles, that any challenges or threats to democracy are met with the appropriate guardrails, and that the ramifications of a second Trump term are just critical enough to encourage Americans to make politically informed decisions moving forward.Edit: if you're going to respond, read the whole comment, don't just respond to the second or third paragraph and miss the part that addresses your response.

That said, here's how it plays out.A criminal is anyone who breaks the law. Any person who is inside the US without going through the legal immigration process is therefore a criminal. Any person who helps them live in the US is aiding and abetting criminal actions.Trump is going after everyone who got to the US outside legal channels, along with their families who support them.He will declare a national emergency based on the \\"out of control invasion\\" of illegals pouring into the US, then he will use that declaration to activate and nationalize National Guard troops everywhere. The emergency declaration will also provide the basis for his new Executive Order that authorizes detention of \\"illegal immigrant threats\\". Local authorities will round up immigrants/families, hand them over to Guard troops, and the Guard will move the detainees to camps.The camps will be built, maintained, and guarded by Active Duty troops. Trump will direct the military branches to re-allocate funds from their operational budgets to fund the construction, maintenance, and support activities around the camps. The camps may start at military bases, but the military will quickly outrun their ability to contain the vast number of detainees on bases so we'll see internment camps like with Japanese-Americans in WWII. See Executive Order 9066.Military air, sea, and land transportation will be used to move the detainees to their nation of origin. If nations refuse to accept their citizens back, Trump will cut off legal immigration from that nation as retaliation.EO 9066 authorized the detention of actual US citizens. There's even less difficulty for Trump to implement his own Executive Order for non-US citizens. De-naturalization will be expected for US Citizen families who unlawfully support their illegal immigrant relations.Yes, it will be litigated. And in the 4 to 6 years it takes to litigate this BS into historical dust, millions of lives will be ruined.The cruelty is the point.","title":"Trump plans the largest deportation ever.

Voting for cloture on a Senate Bill means ending debate on it. For that, the Senate currently needs 60 votes when it comes to legislation. There are exceptions (judicial appointments, reconciliation bills).The process of the Senate works like this: The Majority Leader requests that cloture is invoked, the Chair calls for unanimous consent - if it is not given, the Chair calls for a vote. If 60 Senators vote in favor of invoking cloture, the bill proceeds to a vote on the Senate floor, where it can be passed by a regular majority.At this specific juncture - when the Chair \\"rules\\" on what to do, based on precedent (previous rulings on that matter) and the Senate rules - a single Senator can interject, and appeal the rule of the Chair - the Chair can be overruled by a majority of Senators - so 50+1 are needed in a Senate with full attendance. The appeal has a content - so a Senator can appeal the 60-vote-rule down to 55, or 51 or whatever they like and that new (and now most recent) precedent becomes the new rule (until it is changed, that is) if it gathers a majority of Senators present.No Senate rules package or anything else prevents the Senate from doing that.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 19, 2024"},{"text":"There he goes, acting like he is the dictator.

But overall there is a negative impact on the labor market and economy due to a number of factors. One is that undocumented immigrants take jobs that are largely in sectors like construction, child care and elder care, areas where native U.S. workers are less likely to seek work, Khanna says.Peter Simon, a teaching professor of economics at Northeastern, notes that the sectors where undocumented immigrants mostly find employment are vital to the U.S. economy, which is largely driven by the service industry, not agriculture or manufacturing.People who build houses, people who are in lawn care, people who do daycare, people who put on roofs  all of these kinds of services are just going to go, Simon says. Youre not going to be able to find a plumber, an electrician or anybody who can do this kind of work.The sudden absence of these low-paid yet invaluable workers would highlight something many Americans are not always willing to acknowledge, says Madhavi Venkatesan, an assistant teaching professor of economics at Northeastern.When we have individuals here who are undocumented and completely vulnerable and are inelastic in terms of their labor supply  and you see people taking advantage of them, what the deportation actually highlights, to the extent that it impacts sectors of this economy, is how much weve benefited because we choose to be exploitive, Venkatesan says. The economic impacts that we face will highlight the type of people weve allowed ourselves to become.Mass deportation would hit the child care industry particularly hard, Khanna says, which could cause massive ripple effects nationwide for the labor force participation of native women who rely on these child care centers.Workers in those industries who are citizens would also be affected by mass deportation.Imagine a construction site where a lot of construction workers are undocumented immigrants, and the supervisor of all these workers is a native worker, Khanna says. When all the workers go away, then you dont need the supervisor either, so this can have a negative impact on native workers employment in this way because these are complementary labor inputs.The sudden loss of millions of people could also impact local economies because there would be fewer people who are eating at local restaurants and paying for goods and services provided by local businesses.It will trickle down very quickly. It wont just trickle down; it will flood down pretty quickly in terms of the loss of GDP, Simon says. Thats whats going to cost the country. Our growth rate right now is not bad. Its around 3% or 4%, which is historically about average but lately its above average. Thats going to take a hit, and were going to feel the difference.Can Musk and Ramaswamy slim down the federal government? Public policy experts weigh in on Trumps task force proposal\\nCoupled with the birth rate in the U.S. sitting lower than what is needed to maintain the countrys workforce and Trumps proposed tariffs that could hike prices for consumers, Simon says it wouldnt take long before the country finds itself in a recession.These tariffs and this deporting idea, its just going to exacerbate what could be a bad situation already, Simon says.","title":"How Trumps Mass Deportation Plan Would Impact the Economy"},{"text":"And the dumbing down of America will go into overdrive.","title":"Trump taps former WWE CEO Linda McMahon as education secretary"},{"text":"Absolutely.

The craziest legislation will probably not be enacted but many will still be hurt along the way.

And I hope that people dont lose heart and stop volunteering and donating, because either maintaining or flipping all those state and local Democratic seats is an **unalloyed good thing.** The less power Rs have down ballot the better.What I think is happening: Trump is Evil Mirror Verse Obama in how he can get people to come out and vote for him. When people want to throw da bums out because eggs cost too much, they are thinking of POTUS and maybe Senate, and maaaaybe the House, but their own State Senator? Hes a good guy. Or shes a good challenger. Because I think people hear Democrats and think POTUS or Senate or maybe AOC or Hakeem Jeffries or someone else prominent in the House. They dont think of their city council person or county supervisor.And that ties in with people liking Democratic policies but not the Democratic brand. I think that state and local politicians just dont get the brand tied to them as much.Finally Im so grateful that we arent doing what we did in the Obama years, neglecting statehouses and governorships. This is going to be *vital* if we have to put up with Trump and his clown car for four more years. Governors of big, profitable blue states like CA and IL are in a position to throw their weight around, and I think McConnell and Thune, if not Trump, realize this.

All former ottoman subjects and the first thing they did after independence was go genocide somebody. It is in the nature of nation states to do this.Would you refuse to recognize Bulgaria's independence from the Ottoman Empire because of their expulsion of Romanians and Turks in their borders? Or would you recognize their independence but reprimand them and try to hold them to account for their actions separately?Nationalism is a paradox. The process by which nations build states for themselves almost always involves denying a state to others.

This bill failed to pass the House on November 12, but the House is planning to take it up again starting November 18.H.R. 9495, the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act, purports to stop bad actors from using nonprofit organizations to fund terrorism, as is already prohibited under current law. It also includes some laudable provisions to extend tax deadlines for those unlawfully or wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad.But H.R. 9495 goes much, much farther, building on provisions in previous legislation, H.R. 6408, to empower the Secretary of Treasury to designate 501(c) organizations as terrorist supporting organizations and revoke their tax-exempt status with minimal due process. It would allow the Secretary to bring such accusations without disclosing the evidence behind them and would place the burden of proof on the organization to disprove the allegations. The potential for overreach, subjective application, and abuse of this authority is enormous, and the consequences for organizations and the people they serve cannot be overstated.

How does going along not violate your sense of self? A couple of years ago, I read this book called They Thought They Were Free. And its just about ordinary Germans who joined the Nazi Party. One book can only tell you so much, but what really struck me from it is just the role of very petty resentments. You dont think too much about the global picture. And youre just pissed at those condescending or richer than you people over there.And its bit by bit. And your idea of yourself is in relationship to the people you think have already wronged you, or the ways in which you feel your life has been unfair. And I mean, where it all ends up going, of course, was Nazi Germany  and Im Jewish  is, it is what it is. But what is so chilling about that book was how many political movements, the incentives of these just ordinary members of the party could describe.*margaret atwood:* Yeah, I think thats entirely right. And theres something that we always leave out of these kinds of conversations, which is, its fun.Its fun to sit at the guillotine and watch these people that you resent getting their heads chopped off. There were wild street dances over that, dancing the Carmagnole and singing this song about ha, ha, ha, got them back.So it is a street party, in some way, banding together with like-minded people and feeling youve accomplished something, especially if people tell you that this thing that youre doing is basically good. Its very potent. And if it werent fun on some level, people wouldnt do it. Isnt that a terrible thing, to say that its fun? But I dont know whether you read Bill Bufords essay on joining football hooligan gangs.*ezra klein:* Mm-hmm, its an amazing book.*margaret atwood:* The adrenaline, you know, the exhilaration, the feeling that I havent had this much fun since, like, forever. Im just having  I feel so alive, hitting people in the nose, et cetera. And people describe the sort of battle energy that comes over them. And there is a real adrenaline rush that happens.

Even though Harris ran a fantastic campaign and proposed multiple reforms, it was an uphill battle.Trump was framed as the candidate of change. But I think a lot of people are seeing they fucked up. A very common Google search after Trump won was \\"Can I switch my vote?\\"Trump won a lot of Gen Z men. And the thing about young voters is that they're an erratic and unpredictable voting demographic. And Trump went to mediums that Harris didn't touch, like right wing podcasts. And because of that, a narrative was made about her to Gen Z voters that wasn't true. And even the leftist podcasts often lambasted her, too. And even if they did say \\"Hey, you should vote for her\\", it was more \\"Harris sucks, but don't let the incompetent Mussolini wannabe in government\\".I think Harris' biggest \\"mistake\\", so to speak, was running as an incumbent. But it's like, it would probably be almost worse for her to campaign as the party of change, because it would mean that she basically would have to character assassinate the President she served under, which looks a lot worse.Honestly, Democrats did amazing for an incumbent party. Usually when a party loses, especially in a time like this of unprecedented COVID inflation, they lose a lot worse. We lost a few House and Senate seats, but it's not a landslide majority.(On the theory that Trump cheated, I'm sort of agnostic on it. I think there's a solid chance, but it's not something I'm going to gamble all my chips in.

Why Dont Teenage Boys Care?"},{"text":"I haven't read the rest of the comments but here is my input. The issue with mass deportations of any size is that of resources and legality. Resources- Right now it takes a team of ICE agents a full day of 8-10 people to apprehend 7 people for deportation.  That is not including the people involved in transportation,  judges, jails etc. Just ICE agents. A single airplane flight full will cost $125,000. Issues of where do you hold these people? How many agents could you have? How long would it take? How do you feed that many people? An average for a deportation from apprehension to actual deportation is 30 days. Large scale forced movement of people is extremely hard.  We've seen it before.  Razor wire camps, train cars full of people? So there's the cost to consider.  Now your point is that people who have broken the laws ought to be deported. Perhaps so, but it's not cheap. It generally  hurts the economy, and is more complicated than most anyone would suspect.Legality- immigration code is the most extensive and complex code in the entire legal system apart from tax code.  We do not have nearly enough immigration judges or councilors.  Most of the issues with legal immigration has to do with a lack of legal practitioners to move the process along.  So, since regular lawyers and judges can't just jump into cases around immigration,  that starkly limits your options. What we are left with is if you want to do it right,  i.e humanely and legally,  it'll require resources.  Many many more resources.  It is far more effective to address the causes of immigration and delineating paths to legal citizenship, then to spend billions of dollars on a way to pay to kick people out.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"The purpose of the military is to defend the country, not to invade other countries.
