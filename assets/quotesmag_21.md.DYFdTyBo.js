This same polling also indicated that there were gettable votes from disaffected Republicans. The lets save democracy messaging with Cheney was aimed at those Republican voters. It was never a move to the right by the campaign in general. It drives me crazy that people dont understand that a campaign is supposed to do what Harris did to appeal to different constituencies.

When was the last time that happened? The New Deal? These days plenty of Americans will vote against their interests. No good deed goes unpunished.I asked chatGPT: What happened to the politicians who voted for the ACA (Obamacare)?The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 had significant political repercussions for its supporters. In the subsequent midterm elections, many Democratic lawmakers who voted for the ACA faced electoral challenges:* **House of Representatives:** In the 2010 midterm elections, Democrats lost 63 seats, resulting in a shift of control to the Republicans. This substantial loss was partly attributed to backlash against the ACA.*    **Senate:** Democrats experienced a net loss of six seats in the Senate during the same election cycle, reducing their majority. These outcomes suggest that a significant number of legislators who supported the ACA were not reelected in 2010. The ACA's unpopularity at the time contributed to these electoral defeats. However, it's important to note that public opinion on the ACA has evolved over time, with favorability increasing in subsequent years. --According to a report from the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Democratic Party has lost a net total of 13 Governorships and 816 state legislative seats since President Obama entered office, the most of any president since Dwight Eisenhower.https://www.quorum.us/data-driven-insights/under-obama-democrats-suffer-largest-loss-in-power-since-eisenhower/","title":"I Watched Orbn Destroy Hungarys Democracy.

Absolutely no politics bleed into my Bluesky feed because I explicitly do not like it on there, and early on, I trained my feed to focus on my interests only. There really isn't anything else bleeding into my Bluesky feed unlike on Twitter. Twitter, I tried really hard to keep it on the same things I have on Bluesky, but a *LOT* of politics bleeds into the feed (Like if I had 10 tweets on my screen, 7 of them are related to US politics, the remaining 3 are the stuff I'm interested in), even when I go out of my way to avoid all politics on Twitter.It feels like Twitter is forcing people to get involved in politics and forcefeeding it down the users' throats. Those people who are trying to avoid it then get angry because they're being forced to deal with it and then you have people on there point and say, \\"See? They can't handle opposing viewpoints because they're snowflakes\\". No, I don't like seeing politics on my feed at all because I have to deal with it to some extent during work.

The so called \\"rent-cap\\" in Biden's proposal was a qualification added to a *tax break* given to landlords, any landlord in the country would be free to raise rents higher they simply would not be given the tax break.Literally on the white house site itself and people still get it wrong[President Biden is calling on Congress to pass legislation presenting corporate landlords with a basic choice: either cap rent increases on existing units to no more than 5% or lose valuable federal tax breaks. ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/16/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-major-new-actions-to-lower-housing-costs-by-limiting-rent-increases-and-building-more-homes/)Even the reasoning for it is laid out in explicit detailUnder President Bidens plan, corporate landlords, beginning this year and for the next two years, would only be able to take advantage of faster depreciation write-offs available to owners of rental housing if they keep annual rent increases to no more than 5% each year. This would apply to landlords with over 50 units in their portfolio, covering more than 20 million units across the country. It would include an exception for new construction and substantial renovation or rehabilitation. *The policy is a bridge to rents stabilizing as President Bidens plan to build more takes hold.*They even address concerns about it suppressing supply!The President believes that this combination of anti-gouging policies and historic levels of support to build more affordable housing effectively balances the needs of tenants without limiting incentives for more supply.

But in a private meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in June 1982, Biden appeared to support the brutality of the invasion even more than the Israeli government.**As Bidens colleagues grilled Begin over Israels disproportionate use of force, including by targeting civilians with cluster bomb munitions, Begin said Biden rose and delivered a very impassioned speech defending the invasion. Begin said he was shocked at how passionately Biden supported Israels invasion when Biden said he would go even further than Israel, adding that hed forcefully fend off anyone who sought to invade his country, even if that meant killing women or children. Begin said, I disassociated myself from these remarks, adding: I said to him: No, sir; attention must be paid. According to our values, it is forbidden to hurt women and children, even in war. Sometimes there are casualties among the civilian population as well. But it is forbidden to aspire to this. This is a yardstick of human civilisation, not to hurt civilians.**The comments were striking from Begin, who had been notorious as a leader of the Irgun, a militant group that carried out some of the worst acts of ethnic cleansing accompanying the creation of the state of Israel, including the 1948 Deir Yassin massacre.*","title":"White House Staffers to Biden: You Are Running Out of Time on Gaza"},{"text":"Sounds good.","title":"Sanctuary cities must be punished financially"},{"text":"In CA we were offered free coffee!

People overwhelmingly support things such as RCV and universal healthcare.  They just feel (often without thinking) that Dems (or frequently ANY politicians) aren't on their side because they don't talk like them or act like them.  This is why figures like AOC and Fetterman have achieved such success politically.But what I'm suggesting is that people need to make electoral reform their #1 issue when voting for *any candidate whatsoever* in a primary.  If we can do this one thing, there can be room for multiple parties and coalitions that can deliver the rest of our progressive agenda.We tend to scapegoat parties and politicians when the responsibility lies with the electorate.I strongly disagree.  The onus is on the politicians to convince voters to vote for them.

While I absolutely respect the right of people in a democracy to vote for whomever they choose, I find the idealism of third-party advocates surprisingly na?ve. There is nothing preventing a progressive liberal candidate from seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party for any positionfrom school board to president. The American political system is open, and weve seen how a populist candidate like Donald Trump managed to seize control of the Republican Party, even against the wishes of its traditional leadership, simply because he won the votes. The same pathway is available to anyone, including progressive liberals, who believe their message can resonate with the electorate. That is the reality of the American system.The na?vet lies in believing that the American electorate is overwhelmingly amenable to democratic socialism or the broader progressive platform advocated by the liberal left. This simply does not reflect the current political reality. Recently, voters rejected one of the most labor-friendly administrations in decades, opting instead for a government that is openly hostile to workers rights. The gains unions and workers have made are now at risk of being rolled back, federal employees will likely face layoffs and weakened unions, and the ACA along with other social safety nets are poised to be undermined. The working class is on the brink of facing harsher conditions under these policies.This is not the behavior of an electorate that broadly supports democratic socialism. It reflects the complex and often contradictory priorities of the American voter, where progressive ideals struggle to gain widespread traction.We tend to scapegoat parties and politicians when the responsibility lies with the electorate. There is absolutely no barrier to any liberal progressive candidate seeking any position up for election, if they are not successful, it is the will of the people.","title":"A harsh reality about third parties and electoral reform"},{"text":" she couldnt rail against the previous administrationBiden did an amazing job navigating a recovery, but now we have to pivot to building up the working and middle class.

COVID largely caused the inflation that likely was the main factor in the 2024 election loss for Harris, all other hand wringing aside.  Affordable college is a bit of a two edged sword. Only 37% of Americans over 25 have a college degree.  The other 2/3rds see loan forgiveness or college grants as an elitist give away.  All the people that paid off their college with hard work also feel cheated, regardless of how much more affordable it was years ago.  More training for high-tech, high-paying jobs?  Again, those 2/3 would rather have good pay for hard blue color labor that they see as a virtue.  Many at the bottom only a few dollars above minimum see hiking the minimum as lowering their status since their wage will stay the same.  They want to see LOTS of manufacturing jobs that don't require a college degree.  They think the knowledge economy is a sham and good jobs are purposefully being exported abroad (in that they may not be totally wrong).  Many have religious beliefs that conflict with the progressive agenda.  I myself am an agnostic, but many will vote knowingly for hypocrites on this issue, because at least their beliefs are getting lip service and aren't being told they are naive and ignorant or all religions are equal (yes, they want a special place for Christianity).

The irony would be comical if it wasn't so tragic.What you conveniently omit is the documented Russian involvement: FSB officers advising Yanukovych, Russian troops entering Crimea during the parliamentary proceedings, and the immediate appearance of Russian military equipment in Donbas. The MH17 tragedy alone - shot down by a Russian BUK missile - exposes the level of Russian military involvement you're trying to deny.Every major democracy and international observer recognized the new government's legitimacy. The UN General Assembly repeatedly rejected Russia's claims. These aren't propaganda points - they're documented facts from multiple independent sources and court proceedings.

It can also serve as a cautionary tail, while Trump and the republican party are laying down strikingly similar foundations for an authoritarian takeover. \\nBut the final part cannot be taken too seriously, because in fact nothing has proven to work to weaken Orbn yet. The leftist populist  agenda items in particular did not work because Orbn has hijacked those topics, but is also successfully re-framing the narrative. As an example inflation levels in Hungary have been some of the worst, but Orbn manages to tell the story that he is the one fighting inflation while the global powers are generating it by financing the war in Ukraine. The author's recommensations require that there's still a somewhat healthy democracy in place with a fair media and judicial system to support it, which is not the case. I also think it is naive to look at this as a left-right issue. The populace will have to recognize at some point that the authoritarian leader does not have its interests aligned with the rest of the country.

Biden makes one or two fuck ups (or has some differing opinions on things, like the Israel-Palestine War) and Democratic voters stayed home as a silent form of protest even after he dropped out.Like yeah, hes doesnt share the same opinions as you. Yeah, your student loans may have not been forgiven, and yeah, he fucked up when it came to the Afghanistan pullout. But, he did good with the time he had in office and set the economy on a better path.Trump is a convicted felon, a man who is responsible for the government shutdowns during his presidency, a man who fucked the economy and dropped the ball so hard when it came with to the pandemic. A man who implemented his own tax code so that middle class would pay more during a potential democratic presidency (and wrote it so that itd expire in 2025). A man who tear gassed the American people to take a photo op with the bible. And especially, a man who appointed a conservative majority on SCOTUS for decades to come. Hes the reason why abortion rights are on the line.Kamala is the opposite of him, and unlike him, had an economic plan that wouldve benefited everyone. She wouldve given every woman the right to an abortion. She wouldve appointed two new democratic justices on the Supreme Court to balance it out.

Something like 7 million less voters came out in 2024 compared to 2020, and thats fundamentally due to a fact that people flat out didn't like Harris, and i suspect its in no small part due to her running to the right, campaigning with Liz and Dick Cheney, shutting up Tim Walz, claiming she would put Republicans on her cabinet, and then saying that she wouldn't change anything from Biden. This at a time where the average American is being priced out of living with high grocery and high rent prices. You can scream until your blue in the face that Harris would have had fixes, but thats also what Biden promised with alot of things only for them to either get forgotten about or watered down to essentially nothing. California was the exceptions i was talking about, in every other state where Progressive ballot initiatives were proposed, they passed, Minimum wage increases in Alaska and Missouri, Expanded sick leave in those states again and including Nebraska, State constitutional rights to abortion in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and New York, rejection of school vouchers in Colorado, Kentucky and Nebraska, Alaska banning anti-union captive audience meetings and Oregon voted to protect cannabis workers rights to unionize.

In doing so, they initially pushed through candidates who could not win the general election, but this put the Republican Party in a position where they could ignore them and lose in the general election, or they could move towards them and get candidates who could survive in the general election.The end result was that a lot of them got elected and started influencing the party in their direction, and when Trump went into the 2016 primary, these kinds of voters were now a large contingent of the Republican Party, and they are the ones who got Trump through the primary.","title":"Bernie Sanders floats the idea of progressive grassroot campaigns electorally challenging both the Democratic and Republican parties."},{"text":"What's this glass of water's stance on the Jones Act?","title":"Democrats are still processing their defeat: Three factions are competing to explain the party to itself"},{"text":"Yeah, OP did not follow the news","title":"Biden's legacy is Donald Trump."},{"text":"Never forget how they were willing to destroy your life because of a mask and a vaccine","title":"I Cant Forget What Was Done to Us During the Pandemic"},{"text":"Here's the issue though...\\"White Outgroup Intolerance and Declining Support for American Democracy.\\" Their study finds a correlation between white American's intolerance, and support for authoritarian rule.

If a judge stays a law from going into effect, it may not happen for ages.  That's huge for protecting peoples' rights.  (Though the real issue isn't Congress, with a close House and the filibuster still existing; it's Republican state governments).  So we want good people making these rulings, not MAGA stooges.Second, even if one judge doesn't give us the ruling we want, we can appeal it up to the next level.  That buys us even more time to change the situation in Washington/the states and overturn these laws while they're challenged.Third, I think this question comes from a big misconception about the Supreme Court.* Is the Supreme Court bad?  Yes, absolutely.* Do they have too much power?  Yep!* Are they a magic rubber stamp that lets Trump do what he wants and ignore the Constitution?  **Not even close!**If they were going to let Trump become a dictator, they would have done so in 2020 when he was an incumbent, had the Justice Department on his side, and was raising arguments that he should've been allowed to stay in power.  SCOTUS - with those same six conservative Justices we have now - said no to every one of his arguments.They also could've done it in 2023, with *Moore vs. Harper*.  Remember when Reddit was in a non-stop panic over that case?  It would've let state legislatures (largely run by Republicans) ignore the results of elections and choose their own Presidential electors.  Well, SCOTUS said no, quite decisively.This Court has a legal philosophy and a logic to its decisions.  It's a terrible, harmful logic, but it's not just \\"Republicans get to do whatever they want\\".  And that idea is not only false, it kills activism to make things better.  Why bother electing good leaders if there's a magic Court that will let Trump do everything?  Why volunteer when the Court will just snap their fingers and take it all away?  But that's not how it works.So to answer the original question...yes.  These judges will slow down a lot of the GOP's agenda, which is a bigger deal than Trump's vanity bullshit.  It's enormously important that these judges got confirmed, and I hope we fill as many seats as possible the next month and a bit.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 23, 2024"},{"text":"US Party","title":"Bernie Sanders floats the idea of progressive grassroot campaigns electorally challenging both the Democratic and Republican parties."},{"text":" Is it a cheap point?

Candidate filing is on December 5th and 6th, the primary is January 28th, and the general is April Fools' Day.[Here's the field of battle, with the 2024 Presidential results.](https://twitter.com/MappingFL/status/18603922168305623660)  (Side note, I'm trying to find this user on Bluesky and coming up short; if anyone knows his handle please let me know).Big picture, it voted for Trump by 37.2 points, and hasn't elected a Dem since 1990 (and that particular Dem would *not* be at home in today's party).  However, there are some interesting things under the hood here.  Every district in Florida shifted right from 2020, unsurprisingly.  However, this district shifted the least.  It'll end up being pretty important in any future statewide wins.  This shift is largely being powered by Pensacola, the biggest city, and its suburbs.  Long a bastion of Christian conservatism, it's becoming more diverse and [actually voted for Biden in 2020.](https://urbanstats.org/article.html?longname=Pensacola+city%2C+Florida%2C+USA&amp;s=GctBPij4w9D5iFs)  But that's about it as far as Dem areas go here.  There's also a chance to make progress in Okaloosa County, where cities like Fort Walton Beach, Destin, and Crestview are actually shifting pretty nicely.  (One interesting trend from 2020 was vacation hotspots shifting blue rapidly; not sure if that continued in 2024 but it's worth noting).  Finally, that light-blue swoosh in Escambia County is a fun one - that area contains [the majority-Black small town of Century,](https://urbanstats.org/article.html?longname=Century+town%2C+Florida%2C+USA&amp;s=GctBPij4w9D5iFs) which may be small but it's the kind of place we can't forget about.  Rural Black areas had some rough shifts on November 5th, remember.This is a very red district, and I'm not gonna promise the moon.  Victory would involve literally everything going right and then some.  I'm not going to talk about what the ideal candidate or strategy would look like, because in a district like this it's a victory just to find a candidate.  But I hope we'll get out there and volunteer hard for any Dem that does run.  Not just in case the unthinkable happens, but so we can start building inroads that could lead to some wins in Florida.I know the road is hard, but we don't have the luxury of giving up anywhere.  I'll be watching this one with interest.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 23, 2024"},{"text":"This look a lot like what a scammer would say.","title":"Leftist thinks Kamala is sending them codes "},{"text":"No one, that's why labor has been getting shit on for the last 45 years.","title":"Chris Murphy Wants Democrats to Break Up With Neoliberalism The Democratic senator speaks out about the future of his party."},{"text":"Not true at all.

The world is being screwy because what makes change, the real engine that powers the wheel on the motorcycle of fuck you let's do something new is people who are educated, pushed into a minority, and are in a situation they have free time on their hands. this does not look like how any of the world, especially the United States, looks right now. wages are supposed to have increased with inflation and technically they did if you look at the numbers a certain way like an economist does, but it isn't a measure that is useful because people with equivalent wages today versus say the '60s don't have anywhere near as much education or free time and this is not the fault of the youth today you know going out and getting a cell phone and what not. The rent is too damn high. The cost of food is too damn high. what's going on is since the greed is good era in 1980 with Ronald Reagan hit up the moral majority which is all the Evangelical Catholics and greed actually became good. it became a virtue to extract more wealth from a stagnant market by using technology. a stagnant market was seen as a stagnant market and not as a stable market. anything that wasn't constantly growing was seen as dying, not as economic and social stability. The ultimate outcome of these attitudes is surge pricing and all of that crap that Amazon pulls and Uber pulls and now waymo pulls and every resource extraction device (company) is pulling is the technology becomes easier and easier to implement. The people who implement this type of pricing scheme don't see it as evil unstabilizing society, they see it as getting a raise because they've caused their company to make more money. their company isn't trying to be stable no if you're implementing surge pricing your company is mining the public for stability in exchange for profit. this doesn't end well, this can't end well! this is causing collapse from the center, the middle class, and the expense of that collapse is on the backs of the poor in the laborers, as well as on the backs of the very skilled laborers like doctors and nurses that are becoming interchangeable parts to externalized management companies (insurance company) that are limiting them to 7 to 8 minutes of patient and having to see 10:15-20 patients a day to even break even after all of the costs are included. Doctors end up spending extra time writing up their notes until 7, 8, 9pm or later at night. sure they make a lot of money, but doctors are leaving Dr Hood because they cannot deal with being effectively a fast food fry chef for common ailments ( at least with respect to a GP) and even the specialists are doing their trade in an assembly line fashion. well it might be more \\" efficient \\" to manage Dr resources ( their time and burn out) this way but it doesn't make a quality product it makes a bulk product and more is not always better... More often is not good. apologies for my speech to text ramble but this... I've been thinking about this a whole hell of a lot for the past decade and I I'm watching the world break and it is breaking my heart I can't help the youth of of the world these days... there's no just regular coffee shop they can go to hang out at and maybe meet somebody 5-10 years older and and get a bit of mentorship from or even just make connections with Pierce in their own age to create new ideas or ventures. The money is there but there's no need for anything genuinely new because everything is so efficient nobody has time for anything novel anymore. it used to be you could eventually get a house and have a bookshelf and start collecting books but that is a pipe dream now. if owning books like actual real books is outside of feasibility for the middle class this does not bode well for the rest of society. sure there's digital books but you can screw a digital books remotely in a lot of cases ( yes there are tons of ways around getting screwed with, but like I mentioned earlier with voting it probably doesn't occur to most people this is something they have to actively defend. I don't know who's going to be the first to really screw with readers but it's going to happen soon if it hasn't happened already and that's bad that's really bad because after they come for the readers they're coming for somebody else and that group probably includes you.","title":"Chris Murphy Wants Democrats to Break Up With Neoliberalism The Democratic senator speaks out about the future of his party."},{"text":"Its difficult to feel compassion for people that would sell out their and everybody elses civil rights for a better economy but didnt bother to actually read any of the free publicly available articles about Trumps policies and so will end up with neither.","title":"Democrats lost youth support this election.

Your statement is not the full story, though.The reason that  Palestine is under ICC jurisdiction:  For purposes of the Statute of Rome, Palestine is considered a nation separate from Israel and a separate nation that explicitly chose to become a \\"nation party\\" to the Statute of Rome, choice being key.In the case of Palestine, however, the concept of choosing to be a \\"nation\\" party is fuzzy because,  regardless of what should be, \\"Palestine\\" is not in fact a separate nation for all purposes, but is located within, and \\"ruled\\" by, the nation of Israel. What exactly Palestine's being considered a separate nation party to the Statute of Rome means as to ICC jurisdiction over Israel/Israelis perhaps is a separate issue.The ICC can issue all the warrants it want, but a warrant that is not enforced is potentally an embarrassment, but nothing more and Benny doesn't seem to embarrass easily. Only nations that have chosen to become parties to the Statute of Rome have any obligation to even attempt to enforce the warrant. Be all that as it may, the edit to my original post was not about the jurisdiction of the ICC in general or even the whole story as to Palestine and Israel. The point of the edit was only what I thought it clearly stated--that, FWIW, neither Israel nor the US is likely recognize any ICC ruling about Israel/Israeli (or about the US/any USian).

The battle the IDF has been waging against a literal terrorist group who willingly martyrs their own people is an important piece of this tragic situation. Hamas could've laid down their arms months ago and returned all the hostages. Instead they continued lobbing rockets into Israel - many of them landing within their own boarders - while hiding behind civilian infrastructure (which isn't protected according to the Geneva Convention). How else is Israel supposed to respond when it's tried to make peace with the Palestinians many times since it was established in 1948? They made peace with Saudi Arabia, Jordon, and Egypt yet still has to deal with violence from Palestinian extremists. The larger geopolitical battle is against Iran and its other proxies: Hezbollah / Houthis. At this point it doesn't seem like Hamas ever supported a 2 state solution.I acknowledge that the illegal settlements in the West Bank are problematic but Israel withdraw from Gaza in 2006. Much of the billions of dollars in international aid was stolen to fund Hamas and enrich leaders like Sinwar who spent years living the high life in Qatar after Israel released him from prison.","title":"Bernie Sanders Lost Vote to Block Arms for Israel, Says U.S. Is Funding the Starvation of Children in Gaza"},{"text":"I was stuck in California and couldnt attend my mothers Michigan funeral.  Nor could my sister in Texas.  Mom did not die of COVID but was completely alone.  My brother and other sister who lived in Michigan could only talk to her from outside her Brookdale Nursing Home window.  Mom wasnt lonely though.  True story:  my mom did have visitors but they had all previously passed away.  My dad, my grandmother Luella, my deceased uncle were all in my moms room.  She told me many times previously to the pandemic that she saw Luella on a bench outside her rooms window.  But I knew she was close to the end when Luella was standing next to her.  I called her and mom asked me if I wanted to speak with Luella.  Yes, Id love to! I responded without hesitation.  My own daughter squeezed my arm.  Mom called out to my deceased grandmother holding the landline phone to her chest and asked Luella if she wanted to speak with me.   I have to say my heart was beating really fast.  I truly started to believe that she would want to talk.  She was so real to my mom.  But my mom said, Luella is too tired to speak with you now.  And then my mom said she was too busy making mashed potatoes ( obviously this was not happening) to talk to me.  She had too much company in her room.  This was when I found out about everyone else in the room.  My mom died about one month after this call.  I believe her.  Maybe not about the mashed potatoes but everything else was true.  They came for her.  Or mom was just so fucking lonely from the lack of human contact during lockdown.  That her brain did this for her.  Im crying again.  Sorry.  I miss my mom.

They were headquartered at the Jordanian border town of Karameh, which Israel targeted during the Battle of Karameh in 1968, leading to a surge of Arab support for the fedayeen. The PLO's strength grew, and by early 1970, leftist groups within the PLO began calling for the overthrow of Jordan's Hashemite monarchy, leading to violent clashes in June 1970. Hussein hesitated to oust them from the country, but continued PLO activities in Jordan culminated in the Dawson's Field hijackings of 6 September 1970. This involved the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) seizing three civilian passenger flights and forcing their landing in the Jordanian city of Zarqa, where they took foreign nationals as hostages and blew up the planes in front of international press. Hussein saw this as the last straw and ordered the Jordanian Army to take action.[10]On 17 September 1970, the Jordanian Army surrounded cities with a significant PLO presence, including Amman and Irbid, and began targeting fedayeen posts that were operating from Palestinian refugee camps. The next day, 10,000 Syrian troops bearing Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) markings began an invasion by advancing towards Irbid, which the fedayeen had occupied and declared to be a \\"liberated\\" city. On 22 September, the Syrians withdrew from Irbid after suffering heavy losses to a coordinated aerialCground offensive by the Jordanians. Mounting pressure from other Arab countries, such as Iraq, led Hussein to halt his offensive. On 13 October, he signed an agreement with Arafat to regulate the fedayeen's presence in Jordan. However, the Jordanian military attacked again in January 1971, and the fedayeen were driven out of the cities, one by one, until 2,000 surrendered after they were encircled during the Ajlun offensive on 23 July, formally marking the end of the conflict.[11]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September","title":"Bernie Sanders Lost Vote to Block Arms for Israel, Says U.S. Is Funding the Starvation of Children in Gaza"},{"text":"okay.","title":"Democrats rally behind first out transgender member of Congress, decry Republican attacks"},{"text":"It would take a lot but it could happen","title":"Reasons for hope as Democrats prevent Trump-led red wave in state races | Democrats"},{"text":"Do we have to pull the AIPAC candidate map?","title":"Bernie Sanders Lost Vote to Block Arms for Israel, Says U.S. Is Funding the Starvation of Children in Gaza"},{"text":"Biggest transfer of wealth to the 1% in our lifetime *so far!*","title":"Bidens Chief Economist Processes the Election With Confusion, Guilt"},{"text":"You're right i suppose","title":"Reasons for hope as Democrats prevent Trump-led red wave in state races | Democrats"},{"text":"As nice as this sounds it will never happen nor should it necessarily occur.

While there are very few trans people, forcing them to use a bathroom that aligns with their biological gender would prevent the heterosexuals from claiming they are a different gender and then using whatever bathroom they want. It's more of a preventative than a solution to a problem that has no real solution other than the prosecution of said rapists.In most cases, when an individual goes to the bathroom, they are not going to check the gender of everyone in the bathroom before they do their business. However, if someone does try to commit a sexual crime in the ladies bathroom, having a law stating they are not allowed to be in there will make prosecution of the criminal easier.

Also, and I know this is going to be controversial, but Im just not into pissing off the few billionaires actually on our side (or not fucked up enough to commit to MAGA). I get it, billionaires in general are unethical. But balancing ethics and practicality are important. All that said, the real power is with whoever can effectively hijack the right-wing disinformation network and leverage it to break through to uneducated/low-info voters.

Stupid!\\"But, like, there was NOTHING stopping Democrats from running on the \\"eggs are too expensive\\" platform. They COULD have made that a major talking point at their most important public events like the debate. They were told REPEATEDLY that this was a dynamic among the voters. But instead they sneered and said anyone who cares about egg prices is stupid. This is just the party posting its own L's.They briefly saw success for *a few days* when they suggested going after price-gougers, then they instantly dropped that whole plank of the platform, quietly started sharpening the knives for Lina Kahn, and treated Liz Cheney like she was VP.Here's the reality: the eggs thing is a microcosm of this election's whole dynamic. People thought eggs are too expensive. Harris said \\"no they aren't, the economy is great, I won't change it, vote for me.\\" Trump said \\"fuck yeah they're too expensive, and we're gonna deport people about it.\\"NEITHER platform is good, but only ONE platform even acknowledged there was a problem.It's the same across the board. This is why Harris lost the working class.The working class is angry and economically insecure. It doesn't matter that inflation has slowed when *prices still haven't come down.* Harris said \\"you're wrong, everything's fine.\\" Trump said \\"fuck yeah, you're right to be angry, let's burn the motherfucker down.\\"So for voters that were likely to vote for Harris, a large enough number of them shrugged, took the \\"nothing will change\\" message at face value (as they should,) and stayed home. Harris wouldn't even acknowledge what the working class' problems are, and instead tried these soft-pedal Diet Republican policies like \\"tax credits for your boss at the HVAC company\\" and \\"grandma gets to have healthcare when she's dying, but fuck *your* healthcare still.\\"Meanwhile, anyone who would even conceive of voting for Trump heard \\"you're right to be angry, and burning shit down counts as change, right?\\" and got engaged for election day.This is the same dynamic that made and continues to make Bernie Sanders such a popular figure. The Democrats will not win elections by promising that nothing will change and that they'll be like the Republicans. If someone wanted to vote for a Republican, they'd be voting for a Republican. And people who WANT to vote for Democrats **don't like seeing the Democrats cozying up with Republicans and agreeing with them.**This is the third time in as many elections the DNC should have learned this lesson. They actively refuse to learn it.

I read it and looked into it. I did recognize some of the cases. Sorry about these other guys giving you a hard time. I dont agree with you but I wont demonize you for it even if you provide no evidence at all. (Controversial, I know). Im more concerned with your reasoning to be honest. As long as that is relatively sound, I dont care about how good Exhibit A is, to be frank. I just asked because people who have no evidence to back up their worldview often have poor arguments too. Im glad you do actually base your opinion on something tangible. Even if we disagree on how we interpret the information, I respect your opinion and will assume that you have good reasons and intentions behind your viewpoint, as I would hope you would continue to do for me. The only caveat I would put forward here is the following argument: it is actually fairly common for sex criminals to claim they belong to some victimized groups like gay or trans people to avoid facing the full accountability for their illegal behaviors. As such, Im not sure in how many of these cases it is fair to say that their identifying as trans (whether they really believe it or not) had a determinative impact on their behaviors. There is a strong case to be made for any of these that the people in question had other glaring mental health issues aside from or in addition to being trans/having gender dysphoria. In that sense, I personally still dont think there is enough evidence to support the idea that trans people are any more or less likely to commit these crimes than any other demographic. That means it can still happen of course, but given how few trans people there really are, Im not sure that forcing them to use the bathrooms of their biological gender makes a significant difference in how often this occurs or not, given that the vast majority of sex crimes (in bathrooms or elsewhere) are still being by cisgender heterosexuals. Edit for clarity: to be clear, on the section above, I wasnt implying you believe that at all! Just bringing it up to get it out of the way for by question below.

He won in 2004 which was well after the Patriot Act was implemented and a year after we had invaded Iraq. You are claiming that both of these things turned off voters, yet they did not turn off enough to lose the general election. Because if they had, Bush would not have won again. I am not saying there were no repurcussions, and I think you just have a list of talking points you are trying to hit right now. Obama continued a lot of our foreign policy and won in 2012 again. Trump promised to avoid \\"World War III\\" against Clinton in 2016 which is way different than \\"I won't fund Israel\\" when it comes to what Americans fear/care about. This is verifiably false, Jewish communities that leaned for trump much more than they did in 2020 is a great example of how Dems made the same miscalculation you are making.Except it isn't \\"verifiably false.\\" I would actually love for you to come up with numbers demonstrating this. Every exit poll from 2020 I can find lists not enough data for Jewish voters, and for 2024 it shows 78% broke for Harris. You're also disregarding the fact that both candidates had pretty pro-Israel stances here. So, why would Jewish people break hard for either candidate? Had one taken a staunchly anti-Israel stance, I can see that happening because again, AIPAC and other groups would be like hyenas waiting to leverage that. If your assessment was correct, the election results would have turned out differently. What happened to the blue wall? Again, you are missing the point *entirely.* I am saying that the election results, based on actual data and not what you are simply assuming, ranked our foreign policy as a low priority for many voters. Near the bottom fairly consistently. There are many many many other issues besides Israel and Palestine that people considered and your refusal to acknowledge is astounding, actually. To say that things like the economy (which was consistently ranked well above Foreign Policy by exit polls) had no impact on \\"blue wall\\" states is absurd. Retooling foreign policy, and specifically Israel/Palestine, is not the only difference between progressives and neo-liberalism. Moderate Republicans are not even what I am talking about courting. Independents (aka people who don't go online and discuss this and don't describe themselves as centrists, MAGA, etc) do not even think about it.edit: I will say that I do think that Harris needed to be far more progressive and her walking around with Liz Cheney thinking it would sway Republicans was stupid. 100% we are in alignment there. I just don't think that Israel was the lynch pin for this whole thing and had the chance to backfire. and there were 'safer' progressive wagers she refused to make because she tried to appeal to corporate donors and those mythical Republicans. Had she FULLY committed to a Progressive platform, and picked up a lot of those (leftists + working class independents mostly) voters, then also threw in a more pro-Palestinian approach, that would make more far more sense and probably would have paid off a lot.","title":"White House Staffers to Biden: You Are Running Out of Time on Gaza"},{"text":"I have no idea how all that works so I dont care about downvotes myself","title":"first time seeing criticism on the left wing upvoted outside of this sub. feels good."},{"text":"Just stop, youre not helping your case.","title":"Democrats rally behind first out transgender member of Congress, decry Republican attacks"},{"text":"Yep I'm in.

Incentive for Lenders:* Lenders in a no-interest system would need to find alternative ways to incentivize lending, as they wouldnt make profits from interest payments. Some possible incentives could include:\\n   * **Government Subsidies**: Governments could offer subsidies or tax incentives to lenders to make lending without interest more attractive.\\n   * **Social Good or Reciprocity**: In certain communities or systems, lending without interest might be seen as a service to the community or a reciprocal arrangement where lenders help others without expecting a financial return.\\n   * **Collateral or Asset Sharing**: Lenders might request collateral or agree on profit-sharing mechanisms tied to the loaned amount (e.g., the borrower could share part of the profit from a business investment that was funded by the loan).# 5. Risk Mitigation:* Since theres no interest to cushion the risk of lending, lenders may require **collateral** or **guarantees** from borrowers to reduce their exposure to default. Collateral could include property, equipment, or other valuable assets that could be claimed if the borrower fails to repay.\\n* In some systems, **peer-to-peer lending** or **mutual aid networks** could be the primary lending model, where risk is shared collectively, or communities may rely on social guarantees (e.g., a borrowers reputation or connections).# 6. Types of Loans in a No-Interest System:* **Personal Loans**: Individuals borrow from banks, financial institutions, or peer networks without any interest.\\n* **Business Loans**: Entrepreneurs may receive financing for projects without paying interest, but may share profits, offer collateral, or agree to other terms.\\n* **Social/Community Lending**: In some societies or systems, lending could be rooted in solidarity, where individuals or organizations provide funds without interest, often based on trust or community support.# 7. Economic Implications:* **Reduced Debt Burden**: Borrowers are not burdened by growing interest payments, making it easier to pay off their loans and reducing the overall level of debt in the economy.\\n* **Economic Equality**: It could lead to a more equitable financial system, as wealthier individuals or entities wouldnt profit from lending, potentially allowing for more wealth distribution.\\n* **Potential for Inflationary Pressures**: Without interest as a balancing force, there might be a need for other tools (such as taxes, money supply controls, or profit-sharing models) to keep the economy from overheating.\\n* **Risk of Default**: With no interest acting as a buffer or incentive for lenders to manage risk, the system would need to have stronger safeguards to avoid widespread defaults or unpaid loans.# Conclusion:In a no-interest loan system, the core idea is that the lender only expects to be repaid the same amount they lent, with no additional cost. While this could reduce the debt burden for borrowers, it would require new incentives, safeguards, and systems to make lending sustainable and attractive for lenders, and to ensure that the economy remains stable.","title":"Is usury (or lending at any interest) the root of most of our economic problems?"},{"text":"I asked Chap GPT how loans would work in a system with no interest. In a system with no interest on loans, the basic principles of lending and borrowing would still apply, but the financial arrangements would be structured quite differently compared to traditional interest-based loans. Heres how it could work:# 1. Loan Amount (Principal):* The borrower would still receive a certain amount of money, known as the **principal**, from the lender. The key difference is that the lender would not receive any extra money over the course of the loan, which is typically the interest.# 2. Repayment Terms:* **Fixed Payments**: The borrower would agree to repay the loan over a set period of time in equal installments. Each installment would consist of a portion of the principal amount and potentially a small administrative fee to cover the lender's operational costs. The repayment terms would be based on the time frame agreed upon in the loan agreement.\\n* **Lump-Sum Payments**: Alternatively, the borrower could repay the loan in a lump sum after a specified period (e.g., after one year, or at the end of a project or investment).# 3. No Interest, No Extra Cost:* **No Interest Charges**: The borrower would not be required to pay any interest, so the total repayment amount would be exactly equal to the original loan amount (the principal). The lender would not receive more than they lent.\\n* **Potential Fees**: While interest is absent, there could still be **fees** involved, such as application fees, late payment penalties, or transaction costs. These would be used to cover the lenders costs but would not act as \\"interest\\" or additional profit.","title":"Is usury (or lending at any interest) the root of most of our economic problems?"},{"text":"It is the only adult way forward.

The point is that these issues are not the crucial issues that people say they are. Despite not liking the Patriot Act, despite not wanting more American interventionism, they still voted for the person championing it. *because it doesn't matter to most people either way.* People saying \\"Why are we involved?\\" does not mean they will change their vote based on the policy approach.However, interest groups such as the AIPAC which actually *do* have influence over our politicians care. They literally injected $15m to primary out Cori Bush because of her stance after Oct 7th. Trump appealed to that sentiment with anti-war messaging just as he did in 2016Except for Trump repeatedly saying he will allow Israel to simply finish the job. His \\"anti-war messaging\\" was that both Clinton and Harris would cause World War III. Not that America should cut funding to Israel. This isn't me saying \\"you should've voted for Harris because Trump will be worse.\\" This is pointing out that despite Donald Trump being even more (or at least, on equal footing with Biden/Harris just more open about it) hawkish about this, including being the one who recognized Jurasalem as the capital of Israel, he won the Presidency.These issues are not heavily weighted in most voter's minds when casting their vote. So, to act like Biden was afraid of backlash when the person who *actually endorsed it* received no political repurcussions for it seems misguided. On the contrary, he probably received quite a boost based on how much of his cabinet is explicitly Zionist.So, again, I will say that most people have a different set of concerns so the political fallout of being pro-Israel is minimal while there is a large upside from groups like the AIPAC. \\n its silly to describe that the events after 9/11 made people pro-warI also think this sort of tells me you missed my point.

Yes, it's true that Harris only won NJ by some 6% while Biden and Hillary both won it by about 16% in 2020 and 2016, respectively. Here's a deeper dive into why that's the case. * Trump net gain of votes from 2020 to 2024: 83,258\\n* Harris net **loss** of votes from 2020 to 2024: 390,322 \\n* Total NJ turnout between 2024 and 2020: -286,864So Trump saw a measly improvement of about 83,000 votes while Harris underperformed Biden by a whopping 390,000. On top of that, 287,000 less people voted in NJ as a whole this year than in 2020. That alone is enough to jack up percentage margins and make NJ *look* redder, but that's not enough to say that it's becoming a swing state. Furthermore, let's look at individual counties. Passaic County made headlines for going to a Republican (by 2.8%) for the first time since it went to HW Bush in 1992, and because Biden had won the county by 16% in 2020. * Trump net gain of votes from 2020 to 2024: 8,946\\n* Harris net **loss** of votes from 2020 to 2024: 33,942\\n* Third party net gains from 2020 to 2024: 5,729\\n* Total county turnout between 2024 and 2020: -19,267","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 23, 2024"},{"text":"The page is locked.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 23, 2024"},{"text":"The % of people suffering has not significantly changed compared to 2016 or 2012 or 2008 or 2004 etc etc. It's better than the pandemic, but the same people suffering before the pandemic are still struggling.","title":"Democrats lost youth support this election.

In the context of virology, this often involves altering a virus to make it more transmissible, pathogenic, or able to infect different hosts, with the goal of understanding its mechanisms and behaviors.**Objectives of Gain-of-Function Research**1. **Understand Pathogen Evolution**:? Researchers can study how a virus might naturally evolve to become more dangerous, helping to predict and mitigate future pandemics.2. **Vaccine Development**:? By studying enhanced versions of a virus, scientists can identify vulnerabilities that can be targeted by vaccines or therapeutics.3. **Testing Preparedness**:? GOF research can reveal weaknesses in existing public health responses or antiviral drugs, encouraging better preparedness for outbreaks.4. **Understanding Transmission**:? Experiments can show how viruses adapt to new hosts (e.g., jumping from animals to humans) or improve their ability to spread.**Methods in GOF Research**? **Genetic Engineering**: Introducing mutations to a viruss genome to study changes in function.? **Recombination**: Combining genes from different strains to assess their effects on infectivity or virulence.? **Environmental Selection**: Exposing a virus to specific conditions to encourage adaptation.**Benefits**? **Improved Surveillance**: Identifying mutations that increase risk allows monitoring for these changes in natural populations.? **Therapeutic Targets**: Understanding mechanisms of virulence and immune evasion can guide the development of drugs and vaccines.? **Insights into Viral Behavior**: Researchers can uncover mechanisms of host specificity, replication, and transmission.**Risks**? **Accidental Release**: A modified pathogen could escape the lab and pose a public health risk.? **Dual Use Concerns**: Knowledge and techniques from GOF research could potentially be misused to create biological weapons.? **Unintended Consequences**: A mutation could lead to unpredictable and more dangerous outcomes.**Regulation and Controversy**GOF research is controversial due to the potential risks involved. In many countries, strict biosafety and bioethics protocols regulate such research. For example:? **Biosafety Levels (BSL)**: GOF research on highly pathogenic viruses is typically conducted in BSL-3 or BSL-4 labs, which have strict containment measures.? **Debates on Moratoriums**: Some argue for limiting or banning GOF research due to its risks, while others emphasize its importance for scientific advancement and pandemic preparedness.If youd like more in-depth information about GOF research or its applications, let me know!","title":"THANK GOD we have a new FDA Director, THANK GOD. \\"Virtually everything you were told about COVID was a lie, and I have the evidence right in front of me.\\" One of the last guys, he's at Pfizer now.

My family has ran a homestead for 15 years now, so i have a fair bit of experience with farming practices. Let me also preface this by saying that i believe big aggriculture is brutal and unethical its also very clear that precious few farms or processing facilities couldnt give a whit about the animals. However, its really important for you (as a consumer) to realize that large farms are multi million dollar facilities that run at a loss, and most farmers die deeply in debt. Yes, its on basis of cost because they are already getting as much farm subsidy from the government as they can get, they have already sold the product, and overproduction will kill prices, cause disease issues, and cause overcrowding issues beyond what already exists. That means another loan has to be taken out for half a million to build a new facility, it has to be built, and then buyers need to be found. So you probably ask why we produce on such a level then? Several reasons. \\n1) most farms have quotas set by their corporate landowners or government. Oftentimes both. \\n2) not producing enough can cause food shortages. Sure if everyone produces just enough or maybe a little more, then its ok right? Well what happens when the next Boars Head happens? Huge amounts of food have to he taken off the market and the rest of the surplus fills the void. Even if its not the same product. Big agg sucks, because it has to be ruthlessly efficient. Its already operating on razor thin margins that get wiped out regularly. Do i support this? No. There are almost certainly better more sustainable ways to go about this. Is it gonna happen? No corporate money in it, no government money in it, and i damn well know none of yall are willing to pay the increase in cost.Tldr; the answer is farming is FUCKING expensive, super dangerous, and has a terrible work life balance.","title":"CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing"},{"text":"Unfortunately yes.

Why do I say that? Well, theyre great for when you dont drive long distances at a time, and have a charging station installed at home. Not to mention the cars themselves are very expensive, and installation of the charging station is expensive as well. You also need to live close enough to an EV repair shop, which isnt as common as gas vehicle repair shops are now. My cousin is a lifelong Californian and owns an auto repair shop, the most successful and popular in the county, but he doesnt do electric vehicles.Electric vehicles are terrible for long-haul road trips. They will run out of juice, and it takes a long time to recharge them, as is the nature of lithium batteries. If the cars were built with easily removable batteries, and every gas station had a reserve of batteries charging at all times that you could exchange for your depleted one for a small fee, it could be a solution. However, as it stands, electric vehicles are not viable for multi-hour trips.And I say this as someone who enjoys electric vehicles. Theyre silent, smooth, and often feel like they come from the future, what with all the extra features companies like Tesla tack on to them. With my way of life, if I had the money, Id buy an electric vehicle in a heartbeat, and Im not an environment freak. I just dont tend to do road trips, and it would save me a buttload and a half on gasoline. God knows it would have helped my father, who would forget to refill his tank whenever he was running out of gas, and would get on in the morning to go to work only to find he may not even have enough fuel to reach the gas station.

Public perception was that Clinton held a commanding lead before many states even held their votes. this could be seen as the democratic establishment choosing the candidate instead of letting the people decide in state votes. it's not literally \\"the DNC\\" but the people who were superdelegates are all party bigwigs and made up the majority of important DNC membership so it's basically the same thing. The backlash against this was so strong, it caused a rules change at the convention where Bernie lost, to prevent the same thing from happening again. Now superdelegates are awarded based on state primary results in the first round (at the convention) and then are free to vote for whomever if there's a second round.there's also the angle where the DNC was broke and basically took a huge loan from the Clinton campaign in exchange for some control of DNC's role in that primary season, but it's not clear what, if any, decisions were made differently by the DNC as a result that would have hurt Bernie.Theres also the fact that questions for the debate were given to Hilary Clinton ahead of time, not only that Clinton had been given the keys to the DNCs official finances ahead of the primary. Donna Brazile was pretty open about this: heres a read: https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774/ The agreementsigned by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Eliasspecified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the partys finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.I had been wondering why it was that I couldnt write a press release without passing it by Brooklyn. Well, here was the answer.Ultimately though, Bernie Sanders was a direct threat to corporate profits. Of course, the corporate media had a vested interest in insuring he wasnt elected. This was seen in their portrayal of Bernie with things as innocuous as changing the tint of his skin color to make him seem unhealthier in images, to put in out lies, to incredibly misleading graphics making Hillary appear ahead in races she was losing.None of this should be surprising, the DNC would rather lose an election that be taken over by an outsider who challenges their status quo.","title":"Bernie Sanders Lost Vote to Block Arms for Israel, Says U.S. Is Funding the Starvation of Children in Gaza"},{"text":"His legacy is handing our democracy over to facists.","title":"Biden aims to Trump-proof his legacy with policy blitz in final days"},{"text":"Thats right and the average person can feel if the economy is doing well.

It isn't in dispute and it is because Hamas just takes it and then lets people starve anyway. Israel considers aid entering Gaza to be \\"re-supplying the enemy\\"* This is evident by the fact that the US doesn't just directly provide the Aid (The [US sort of tried](https://apnews.com/article/pier-military-gaza-war-humanitarian-aid-76ff45e7ef81ae68a75ac269daaa0dd3) but there were \\"security problems\\").

Among the notable findings: 62% of Jewish voters would support the United States withholding shipment of some weapons to Israel until Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agrees to an American proposal for an immediate ceasefire.Source: https://forward.com/news/672886/american-jews-israel-arms-embargo-poll/Democratic pollster James Zogby sent countless memos to Vice President Kamala Harris campaign warning about her liabilities over Gaza.These guys didnt get it at all, they were playing to a narrow base of the people they know best, said Zogby, who claimed he sent Harris and the Biden administration memos on their vulnerabilities over the war until I got tired of writing them and they got tired of reading them.Source: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/08/kamala-harris-democrats-rebukes-00188594Biden and his admin violating USs Leahy Law - literally going out of their way to break our law to keep that unconditional support to Israel:A U.S. State Department official who quit this week said on Thursday her resignation was precipitated by an administration report to Congress that she said falsely stated Israel was not blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza, prompting her to resign in protest of President Joe Bidens Israel policy.https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-state-department-official-resigns-says-us-report-gaza-inaccurate-2024-05-30/Blinken told Congress, We do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting aid, even though the U.S. Agency for International Development and others had determined that Israel had broken the law.The U.S. governments two foremost authorities on humanitarian assistance concluded this spring that Israel had deliberately blocked deliveries of food and medicine into Gaza.The U.S. Agency for International Development delivered its assessment to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the State Departments refugees bureau made its stance known to top diplomats in late April. Their conclusion was explosive because U.S. law requires the government to cut off weapons shipments to countries that prevent the delivery of U.S.-backed humanitarian aid. Israel has been largely dependent on American bombs and other weapons in Gaza since Hamas Oct. 7 attacks.But Blinken and the administration of President Joe Biden did not accept either finding. Days later, on May 10, Blinken delivered a carefully worded statement to Congress that said, We do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance.Prior to his report, USAID had sent Blinken a detailed 17-page memo on Israels conduct. The memo described instances of Israeli interference with aid efforts, including killing aid workers, razing agricultural structures, bombing ambulances and hospitals, sitting on supply depots and routinely turning away trucks full of food and medicine.https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken","title":"Bernie Sanders Lost Vote to Block Arms for Israel, Says U.S. Is Funding the Starvation of Children in Gaza"},{"text":"Why would Netanyahu care what Biden wants when he only has 2 months left in office?

That is why they have to fight because there is a mad man with a gun pointed at them demanding they disarm themselves. The fighting in the Donbas is a result of Putin arming paramilitary groups in the region with artillery.

The US is far more worse and sinister than Russia. The difference between the two is that the US pretends to have all those qualities. Sure we have diversity here, maybe even equality and equal opportunity in most respects, and in general, freedom. And Ill concede that sure, Russia lacks in most parts in those areas. But the degree to which the US is the most violent imperialist country we have ever seen in history, in my opinion, washes all those great qualities. If you think we have a democracy in this country, I just have one thing to say to you, AIPAC. 99% of the politicians in our government are bought out by AIPAC, for Israeli interests. Theres no reason America should fight and die, much less even care, for Israel. And yet, so much talk is being given by politicians about Israels security. This is because of AIPAC, they funnel hundreds of millions of dollars into elections to ensure Israel is put first before America. And what happens if youre anti-Israel, the AIPAC lobby can ensure that you dont get elected by funding your own opponent, by smearing you, by manipulating! I dont know what your definition of a democracy is, but this is not what it looks like to me. And you dont have to take my word for it, a few congressman who arent funded by AIPAC have documented this too. Theres nothing patriotic about having a foreign lobby so heavily embedded in our governments system that it is not America first anymore. Onto the Imperialist perspective, its easy to see many of those qualities you list as Western are largely a part of US society, however, the US becomes a hypocrite to those values when it tries to force it down the throats of over governments. When it tries to bully other countries by military force, when the CIA covertly deposes foreign leaders when its not in the US interests (64 documented covert regime change operations)! You might say, oh theyre trying to take down dictatorships and terrible humans, let me point you to one such instance, Iran 1953, the democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh declares that he is going to nationalize Irans oil industry so that they can make money off their own oil without Western involvement. What happens next? MI6 and CIA overthrow him and install a puppet monarchy that will do anything they want. The US is a bully in the global atmosphere and is personally responsible for MILLIONS of death around the world. You remember when they sanctioned Iraq in the 1990s? I dont know why its so hard to see but sanctions dont affect the elites at the heads of the government, it affects the people. ONE MILLION Iraqi children died as a result from those sanctions. This is just another example of the US bullying other countries and using sanctions and intimidation and military force to get their own way, this is shown through the US insistence that Ukraine be a part of NATO (this insistence is not for Ukraines protection, its for tightening a noose around Russias neck). Imagine if China put nuclear missiles on the Mexican border with Texas. We have the Monroe Doctrine that no foreign powers can come into our territory, Russia is reacting in the same way to US and NATO aggression. Sure Putin isnt particularly a good guy, but on this issue, I support him 100% against US hegemony and imperialism.

Archaeologists Make Unexpected Discovery in Medieval Warrior Monk Burials](https://scitechdaily.com/women-were-knights-too-archaeologists-make-unexpected-discovery-in-medieval-warrior-monk-burials/) Skull Found in the Archeological Site of Zorita de Los Canes\\nA study of medieval warrior monks at Zorita de los Canes castle revealed their high-society diet and violent deaths, including the unexpected discovery of a female warrior among them, expanding our understanding of gender roles in historical military orders. Skull found in the archeological site of Zorita de los Canes.  A collaborative study conducted by the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) and the Max Planck Institute analyzed the remains of 25 individuals interred from the 12th to 15th centuries at the Zorita de los Canes castle in Guadalajara. The team exhumed these remains from the castles graveyard, allowing them to determine the diet, lifestyle, and causes of death of the warrior monks who belonged to the Order of Calatrava. The results, published in the journal Scientific Reports, have determined that 23 of the individuals died in battle and that the knights of the order followed a diet typical of medieval high society, with a considerable intake of animal protein and marine fish, in an area far from the coast. Unexpectedly, Carme Rissech, a researcher at the URV, identified the remains of a woman among the warrior monks. Situated on one of the turns in the Tagus River as it flows through the province of Guadalajara, the remains of the castle of Zorita de los Canes are still standing on the same hill where the emir Mohammed I of Cordova ordered it to be built in 852. The fortress, built to defend the emirate from Christian attacks, changed hands twice until it was definitively conquered by the knights of the Order of the Temple in 1124. Fifty years later, Alfonso VIII of Castile ceded the fortress to the recently founded Order of Calatrava, a Cistercian military and religious order, who were tasked with defending the border, at that time delimited by the Tagus, from Almohad incursions. **MONBONES Project Insights** When Carme Rissech, a researcher at the URVs Department of Basic Medical Sciences, was told that they were sending her the remains of the Calatrava knights, she couldnt quite believe that they were actually knights. As part of the MONBONES project, which studies diet and lifestyle in monasteries during the Middle Ages, her project partners analyzed the presence of carbon isotopes 14 and nitrogen 15 in the bones of the 25 individuals. They also studied animal remains, found around the castle, which complemented the information provided by the isotopes and helped them to work out the habits of the people who lived in the castle between the 12th and 15th centuries. Once she got the remains in the laboratory, Rissech studied them to determine the age, sex, morphology, and health of the individuals and to determine their lifestyle and causes of death. Of the 25 skeletons studied, 23 showed marks compatible with violent death. These were mainly penetrating puncture wounds and blunt force injuries and were found on the parts of the body that were most vulnerable to and unprotected from the weapons of the time. We observed many lesions on the upper part of the skull, the cheeks, and the inner part of the pelvis, which is consistent with the hypothesis that we are dealing with warriors, explains Rissech. It was by studying the bone proportions that she realized that among the warriors there was a woman. Typically, the skeletons of men and women have specific characteristics that differentiate them. The morphology of the facial bones and the pelvis, are the most obvious examples, explains Rissech. In some individuals, these characteristics may not be decisive when it comes to determining sex, but in the case of these remains, there was little room for error. Who was this woman? Was she part of the order? Did she have the same status as the other knights? **Debating the Female Warriors Role** On the one hand, the womans injuries led the research team to believe that she participated and died in battle, as there was no sign of bone regrowth in her injuries. She may have died in a manner very similar to that of male knights, and it is likely that she was wearing some kind of armor or chain mail, says Rissech. On the other hand, she did not have the same dietary indicators as some of the individuals analyzed: We observed a lower level of protein consumption in the case of this woman, which could indicate lower status in the social group, he says. Some researchers have hypothesized that she was a servant who would have been called upon to join the knights in defending the castle if the need arose, but the URV researcher does not think so: Her work as a servant would have left signs on her bones, indicators of certain types of physical activity that we could now identify. In contrast, her skeleton did show attributes similar to those of the other warrior monks, whose job required them to train in the use of the sword, an activity that leaves verifiable marks which were also observed on the womans bones. I believe that these remains belong to a female warrior, but further analysis is needed to determine to what extent this woman is contemporary with the other knights, says Rissech. According to the researcher, we should picture her as a warrior of about forty years of age, just under five feet tall, neither stocky nor slender, and skillful with a sword. The research also involved researchers from the University of Barcelona and the archaeologists who led the excavations. It is part of the MONBONES project, which takes a multidisciplinary approach involving zooarchaeology, anthropology, documentary research, and molecular analysis to offer a new historical perspective on the way of life, diet, health, economy, and society in monasteries from the 14th to the 19th centuries.!ping EUROPE&amp;HISTORY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Religion is the cancer of humanity.","title":"You live in Satans kingdom"},{"text":"\\"ohh pls senpai putin, i will stop resisting, your rape hurt less if i just let you do it\\".

I feel in the earth, I smell it in the sea to shining sea, all the rights that founded us are lost, for none now live who remember...It began with the forging of the great Presidents. Four were given to the Whigs. The earliest, wisest and fairest of all parties. 16 to the Democrats, great statesmen and craftsmen of good policy. And 19, 19 were given to the Republicans, who above all else, desired power! ('cept Lincoln, he cool.) For within these Presidents were bound the will and strength to govern these United States. But they were all of them deceived, for another was made. Deep in the land of New York, in the heights of Trump Tower, the Dark Lord Donald forged in secret a MAGA movement. And into this movement, he poured his bluster, his narcissism and his will to dominate all life.One man to rule them all.One by one, the free states of the US fell to the power of Trump, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of Democrats and independents voted against the movement of MAGA, and on the very slopes of The Hill, they voted for the freedom of all Americans. Victory was near, but the power of Trump could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Joe Biden, son of Delaware, took up his state's honor.Donald, the enemy of the free peoples of the US, was defeated. The Presidency passed to Biden, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the Oval office has a will of its own. It betrayed Biden to dementia.Voters: \\"Hold a party primary! HOLD IT!\\" Biden: \\"No.\\"And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand days, the Presidency passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.It came to the VP Kamala, who took it deep into the west coast. And there it consumed him. The candidacy gave to Kamala unnatural energized campaign. For three months it deluded our minds, and in the Oval office, it waited. Donald crept back into the states of the union. Rumor grew of a shadow in Florida, whispers of a Project 25, and the Oval Office perceived its time had come. It abandoned Kamala, but then something happened that the Office did not intend.

Vacated by CPI(ML)L MLA Sudama Prasad, who got elected to Lok Sabha from Bhojpur. He used to get Vaishya votes, but it didn't happen this time as the party's candidate was Raju Yadav. BJP candidate was gangster Sunil Pandey's son Vishal Prashant.Ramgarh: family seat of RJD Bihar prez Jagdanand Singh (a Rajput), vacated by his son after he got elected to Lok Sabha from Buxar constituency. Three way contest between NDA, BSP, and MGB. Since MGB's candidate was Jagdanand Singh's other son, the Yadav vote defected to BSP (whose candidate was Satish Yadav). RJD stood at #3, BJP won narrowly.Belaganj: family seat of Surendra Yadav, who got elected to Lok Sabha from Jehanabad constituency. His son was the RJD candidate, and JDU's candidate was also a Yadav, causing a split in the Yadav vote. Jan Suraaj (which got 17k votes) took away Muslim votes, but the margin is big enough (about 21k) that it didn't matter, JDU would've won anyway. Jan Suraaj's candidate was Mohammad Amjad.Imamganj: Jitan Ram Manjhi's family seat (vacated by him as he got elected to Lok Sabha from Gaya). His daughter-in-law is the NDA candidate. RJD had fielded a Manjhi too. Jan Suraaj fielded Jitendra Paswan. Chirag Paswan didn't campaign here, so the divide that already exists between the Mahadalit Manjhis and upper Dalit Paswans got widened, Chirag and Jitan Ram Manjhi had in fact publicly made statements against each other after SC's order on sub-classification came out in August.The Paswan vote went to JSP, and this seat saw the best performance by them (they got 37k votes).

If you live in a solid red district, run in that primary. If you live in a solid blue district, run in that primary. Most of these people in most of these places have NEVER run a real campaign before, because they haven't had to. Let's put their names to the test.3. Put your name on the ballot running for that party. Get elected. Switch en masse across the country with your fellow political pirates. Announce the new party.4. Repeat. It will keep working, even if you get outed for pursuing this strategy. Just keep blind-side primarying them, even the \\"good ones,\\" all across the country. Some of these gigs even pay pretty well.This is what the populists at the turn of the 20th century did, and it worked so well that we got their campaign proposals wrapped up in a package with a bow.
