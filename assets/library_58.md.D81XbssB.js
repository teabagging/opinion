I think cutting inflation is an end goal, not a policy  so that doesnt really count. The rest of the ideas are a little vague but Id note that Im not sure how tariffs will make it easier and cheaper for companies to operate in America. If they import anything, and virtually every product on the market involves something sourced from China, then they will have higher costs, which they will pass on to consumers. Like you and me. Your 401 k was probably at a record high even before the election because of Bidens strong economy, but may continue to benefit from his policies. For lower income folks, I wonder if he can deliver on any of those promises because he had four years, two of which with a majority in Congress and never did manage to secure the border or get Mexico to pay for the wall. He did get tax cuts for the wealthy which increased the national debt by more than any other president, and resulted in you and I (unless youre a tax cheat like Trump) paying for trillions in interest on the debt each year.   He did not repeal or replace Obamacare either, another campaign promise broken. But boy, one things for certain, if we have an international crisis that affects us all like Covid, I hope he doesnt practice wishful thinking and denialism and leave us to crazy strategies like injecting bleach. Because we all saw how he was the leader back then, and small businesses had to close down and lay off employees because of his botched response while we had a 9/11 every day. Those job losses really hurt us and many of those businesses never came back. And to help us out of the whole he created, he just printed money and recklessly gave money to companies that didnt need it through the paycheck protection program and stimulus checks that he personally signed. And you know what pumping money into the economy does, dont you?

Trumps tariffs and the pandemic DIRECTLY CAUSED the inflation we've felt the past few years. The tariffs caused massive spikes in pricing in targeted industries, most notably construction. Then the pandemic fucked up logistics worldwide, making things even harder to get. The crackdown on migrant labor plus some hard winters with late frosts and low food prices caused a lot of farmers to simply sell their land and do something else. This land was bought up by developers in 2020/2021, and then \\"mid-level\\" houses were built, but like $400-500k, not enough to make up for the years we weren't really making houses, but enough to raise surrounding property values significantly. That boom trickled over to rent prices, so housing greatly increased in cost from 2018-2022. That was the bulk of the inflation we felt,  and it was set in motion by trump.But then the farmers that got out of the game actually caused food prices to increase, plus a couple company specific shutdowns of large producers in 2021 and 2022 from the pandemic. That screwed up logistics some more. Everything was pointed towards a full on recession. But Biden's policies actually avoided that. The US had rebuilt faster and better than the rest of the world. Inflation is back down, the fed is lowering rates, GDP is up, unemployment is low enough it's almost a problem, and overall, the economy is on sound footing.You might not have felt that yet. And if that's the case... don't really worry about it, because the tariffs coming will fuck things up again and you'll see massive inflation again, although likely targetted until 2027 or 2028.Cause and effect aren't always immediate. Some effects aren't felt for years. Biden's investment in infrastructure will be paying dividends for decades.","title":"Trump is on the verge of announcing RFK Jr. for Health and Human Services secretary"},{"text":"I actually think that RFK stands more of a chance than Gaetz or Gabbard.

Meanwhile, Russian forces are making costly-but-steady progress in Ukraines east, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces are stretched to the breaking point.With Trump packing his prospective cabinet with MAGA loyalists and surrounding himself with radicals who parrot Russian talking points, how he hopes to end the war in Ukraine is unclear. Trumps policy decisions are often capricious, but he does have a history of making good on pledges to end American support for allies.Trumps promise to end the war was a centerpiece of his foreign policy pitch during the 2024 election campaign.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-plan-putin-1235166560/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-plan-putin-1235166560/)","title":"Trumps Peace Plan for Ukraine Looks Like Putins Victory"},{"text":"I think you just made their case","title":"Want to understand why Trump won in 2024?

People often joke that hes the poor mans idea of a rich man. Theres something that FEELS working class to him. Hes not refined, he doesnt really think about what hes going to say, he speaks off the cuff and so on and so on.Kamala and the democrats as a whole think through what they say, they dont want to over promise, they dont want to offend. They seem calculated and cold. Very corporate. Logically theyre obviously better than Trump but for many voters the Democratic candidates feel too rehearsed and too safe. That makes them feel unrepeatable and for a lot of voters that makes trusting them more difficult. Most voters do not vote on policy or really care or know about the policy. They vote on the feelings the candidate gives them. Trumps schtick and his personality is actually very authentically him. He doesnt put on a mask really. Yes he lies, but thats not a mask. I mean he doesnt really mask his personality much at all. Its one reason why something like Joe Rogan is so vital. He has an incredible reach for an audience and the long format gives listeners time to get to know the candidate as a person not a political talking point. Add in the fact that democrats (not really Kamala) kept telling voters that the economy was better than ever and their financial burdens werent real and its no wonder why they trusted Trump more. The issues of trust had less to do with Kamala herself and more to do with the Democratic Party feeling too buttoned up. Too perfect. Not responding well to criticisms or observations that dont paint them as perfect (Economy, Bidens mental decline etc.). The issue was much bigger than Kamala tbh, it was a complete rejection of the 2010s era of the Democratic Party and how they (and the voters) conducted ourselves. But all of those frustrations with Democrats were projected onto Kamala some fair and others not.We can argue policy as much as wed like. This isnt about logic or facts or policy its about emotions and who feels more genuine and Democrats need to really reflect on why Trump feels more genuine in comparison. Were a party of mostly college educated coastal elites. We talk down to voters and call them stupid for not voting like we do.

It seems he will be.Last week, Kennedy told The Washington Post that the president has asked me to clean up corruption and conflicts at the agencies and to end the chronic disease epidemic.He wants measurable results in two years and to return those agencies to their long traditions of gold-standard evidence-based science and medicine, he added.Kennedy also bragged at a separate event that Trump had promised him control of the public health agencies, which are HHS and its sub-agencies, CDC, FDA, NIH, and a few others  and then also the USDA.The conspiracy theorist gained infamy as one of the most prominent peddlers of the false claim that vaccines are the root cause of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Kennedy has also suggested that vaccine research is responsible for the creation of diseases like AIDS, the Spanish Flu, and Lyme disease.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-trump-pick-health-human-services-secretary-1235166608/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-trump-pick-health-human-services-secretary-1235166608/)","title":"Trump Picks RFK Jr. to Run Dept. of Health and Human Services"},{"text":"Or those highly qualified and distinguished employees leave.

In almost all situations in which abortion is an option, the woman's choice is not withheld. Anyone with a minimum of education knows exactly what the path to pregnancy is and knows that contraceptive methods are subject to failure. What the pro-choice camp cowardly advocates is to ignore that the woman had already made her choice when she decided to engage in conduct that could potentially lead to pregnancy, so they change the focus, putting the moment of choice to an arbitrary point during the pregnancy, in order to allow murder so that people do not have to face their responsibilities and the consequences of the choices they made. They should be named pro irresponsibility camp.\\nIn the case of rape, this does not apply. The woman had her freedom of choice, her autonomy as an individual violated, and although I consider abortion an abomination, I also consider torture an abomination, and forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy resulting from rape to term is grotesque to me. Yes, the unborn child is innocent of the father's crime, and allowing abortion in this situation is disturbing and horrible, but torturing another human being seems just as disturbing and horrible to me, and this is a compromise I am willing to accept because the ultimate goal is that there will be no more rapes, SO THIS TERRIBLE CHOICE WILL NO LONGER BE NECESSARY.?Unlike the pro-life camp, I am not willing to mask the horrible choice I am making by trying to disqualify the embryo, the fetus, from its identity as a human being, so I will not do rhetorical pirouettes to avoid using the correct term for what I am defending: murder. Because the awareness of this terrible choice should serve as additional motivation for adopting ALL necessary measures to ensure that rapes never occur again. This long exposition is to demonstrate that IN MY VIEW and among many in the pro-life camp?abortion should be an exceptional option, only for desperate situations, not a banality as defended by the hypocritical pro-choice camp, who if they had an ounce of intellectual honesty and courage would use the term pro-murder.?\\nIf a person does not want children, there are extremely effective measures to avoid this, but almost all people do not consider the most effective measure that exists to be convenient or acceptable and prefer the option of murder. And to continue thinking they are a good person, they do everything they can to dehumanize the fetus, so that they do not have to face the truth, that they are committing murder.\\nIn the same way, abortion in situations where the pregnancy represents a risk to the mother's life also seems acceptable to me, since it is the choice whether one person will die or whether two people will die. I do not see how it is possible to maintain that the mother should carry the pregnancy to term no matter the circumstances, and no one can honestly claim to be pro-life if they irresponsibly want to put the mother's life at risk.","title":"LGBTQ+ couples are racing to get married before Donald Trump takes office"},{"text":"First woman White House Chief of Staff!

Through his Open Society Foundations, the second-biggest philanthropic institution in the United States, he funds a multitude of explicitly left-wing causes. Soros lifetime spending through OSF ($32 billion) vastly outpaces that of the libertarian Koch brothers ($2 billion). Yet while both Soros and the Kochs are regularly subjected to hoary and conspiratorial vilifications by their political adversaries, the Kochs receive none of the deference Soros gets from the mainstream media.The political effect is greater than even his 32 billion spent, because a lot of that is lobbying to coerce states to issue grants, which then return to his orgs for his own projects, so it snowballs.Case in point:...In 2017, a group of Republican senators?wrote?to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asking him to **investigate how the United States Agency for International Development, which has disbursed grants to OSF, has worked to impress left-leaning policies on sovereign nations, regardless of their desire for self-determination.** Irrespective of the validity of these claims, Soros leaves himself open to such accusations by engaging as such a prominent partisan actor in the United States.","title":"Inside Billionaire takeover of Trump's Administration"},{"text":"John Bolton has belatedly endorsed Harris, see https://www.mediaite.com/tv/john-bolton-calls-on-fbi-to-investigate-trump-nominees-matt-gaetz-tulsi-gabbard-a-serious-threat-to-our-national-security/ so apparently the takeover is not working, otherwise push and tighten and fix John put the billionaire imperialist plutocracys bolt on everything would see no problem.","title":"Inside Billionaire takeover of Trump's Administration"},{"text":"To be fair, I dont see people actually talking like that in the US.

People need to get over their differences in ideology and unite on the issues that affect everyone: globalization and the disparity in wealth, and the ever increasing push for the digitalization of everything. Im sure there are more but they are the ones that immediately came to my mind. The parasites pushing the division now openly mock our collective stupidity and it seems like we take the bait every time. We need to take responsibility for passively allowing the people in power to conduct a controlled demolition of nature and humanity. This shit has been happening since babylon, probably before, and we continue falling in the same traps, which ultimately benefit the psychopathic minority that seems to get off on causing pain and suffering. Once the fourth industrial revolution is fully implemented there will be no chance to escape: even those capable of living off grid will eventually be swallowed by the beast. I chose not to have children because i doubt that humanity will get its shit together, but i am still willing to risk my life in an effort to completely change the way we live and become less dependent on the system that will imprison future generations in a dystopian hellscape. As fred hampton said, if you aint willing to die, you aint a revolutionary. Id imagine we need millions of people in the US alone to adopt this mindset, or all efforts to bring about meaningful change will be futile. I assume people do not see that that their childrens future is essentially hopeless because of the stress of their daily lives, but from where I stand this is the only issue that people should focus on. If people cant get over their petty differences to ensure the future actually has something to live for, and acknowledge the necessity to cooperate with others like mature adults in order to confront this assault, then i doubt there is any issue capable of achieving the widespread unity that would be needed to topple the beast. It wouldnt be easy, and the parasites will meet any opposition with horrific force, but i dont see any other way to bring about meaningful change. Our ancestors, and ourselves, have dug quite the hole to hide our heads in. It wont be easy to climb out. The good thing i have witnessed since covid is that most people know something is off. I dont know if it was hubris, or that the plan had to be rushed, but the parasites have exposed themselves more-so than I witnessed in my lifetime. This is the morsel of hope that i cling to: they will do something so sloppy and insulting that is powerful enough to unite the masses. In the meantime, i will continue building relationships with my neighbors, and focus my efforts on helping those that the system has abused the most.","title":"Divide &amp; conquer"},{"text":" Im going to let him go wild on health, Im going to let him go wild on the food, Im going to let him go wild on medicines, - Trump","title":"Trump expected to select Robert F.

Since he's a congressman from Florida, a State with a Republican governor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis) he will probably just put another Republican in his seat for now. The problem will come down the road whenever people in Florida get a chance to vote on who will permanently hold that seat. Incumbents typically have a higher chance of winning reelection, but if Trump continues to nominate existing Congress people he's going to tank the GOP's chances at holding the House in the midterms. Since people thrown into those seats won't have the same name recognition that an actual incumbent gets from having run for office multiple times.Google says DeSantis has already announced plans for a special election to replace both the Congressman (Gaetz) and the Senator (Rubio): https://www.newsweek.com/ron-desantis-florida-special-election-update-matt-gaetz-attorney-general-1985747But until then, he can pick their replacements.

Like obviously if I put a 2% tariff on bananas it's different than a 50% tariff on all fruit.So let's look at specific ones and see their impact https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/business/trump-tariffs-washing-machines.html Research to be released on Monday by the economists Aaron Flaaen, of the Fed, and Ali Hortacsu and Felix Tintelnot, of Chicago, estimates that consumers bore between 125 percent and 225 percent of the costs of the washing machine tariffs. The authors calculate that the tariffs brought in $82 million to the United States Treasury, while raising consumer prices by $1.5 billion.\\nThe new tariffs ended a yearslong decline in the price of washers in the United States, which rose about $86 per unit because of the tariffs last year, the authors calculate. But tariffs also raised prices for dryers, largely because manufacturers of laundry equipment used the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices on things that were not, in fact, affected by the tariffs.Consumers, Mr. Tintelnot noted in an interview, often shop for a new washer and dryer at the same time. Their costs are similar. Rather than raise prices by 20 percent on washers and throwing off that balance  no one likes an unbalanced washing machine  companies instead raised both washer and dryer prices, by 11.5 percent each\\nWhat's important to note is that this is **on purpose**[The explicit, written, intentional purpose of those tariffs was to increase the cost to consumers and stop the steady doldrum of price declines caused by foreign competitorsin official documents to Congress announcing the tariff, Trump said this duty will provide an impetus for **importers to increase their prices, thereby relieving the downward pressure on prices** that has led to a decline in domestic washer producers' financial performance.](https://www.apricitas.io/p/universal-tariffs-are-universally)Prices were going down, that was seen as an issue to the manufacturers (but of course, not to the poor customers benefiting from cheaper machines) and the tariffs are implemented to make prices go higher. \\n \\nYou can see a nice graph in there of how washing machine prices were impacted and this is *with* them being split amongst dryers some.And again, this harm tends to hit lower earning people the mostTo consumers, a tariff on goods that can realistically only come from imports ends up as effectively a high and poorly structured sales tax. No state in the US imposes a sales tax rate of 10% even when you account for the average burden of local sales taxes, so the low end of Trumps universal tariff proposals would be extremely high relative to current tax rates. It is also imposed on a random subset of items that happen to come from overseas, treating mangoes as if they are cancer-causing poisons like cigarettes where the government can justify high sales taxes to reduce social harms. Most importantly, the taxes only hit goods and exclude servicesthus low-income Americans who spend a much higher share of their income on goods (including basic foodstuffs) would be hit the hardest by universal tariffs.","title":"For those wondering what Trump's new tariff regime will be like, read about the ones he imposed last time around."},{"text":"Umknowing Trump, I think he would likely try to install Gaetz anyway.","title":"Matt Gaetz Is Trumps Way Of Humiliating Senate Republicans"},{"text":"It was a used car that passed for the credit.

I mean, full Project 2025/Agenda 47 and they do everything else they've said they'd do; arrest opposition, utilize our armed forces against citizens on American soil, completely dismantle the government, mass firings/layoffs of all government employees, etc. Top that off with national abortion bans, defunding social security, repealing government healthcare plans, higher education becomes a legend of the past, the Department of Education is sunset and states will oversee their own education. **TL;DR - One religion. One leader. One party. One government. One country. That type of thing. If that's the case, we'll have more in common with modern day Russia than the United States just a decade ago.** **B.)** They simply create a hot mess. Think 2016 - 2020. Trump had inherited a strong economy, growing jobs, and more. Sure, they can try to ban abortion, repeal healthcare, destroy our country's already struggling educational system, but they will have obstacles in the way and priorities they need to tackle first. Cleaning the kitchen when the stove is on fire will only result in the house burning down, if you catch my drift.They have to focus on global conflicts involving Russia/Ukraine/North Korea and China/Taiwan, they have to focus on our economy still recovering from lack of leadership during the early pandemic, they have \\"millions\\" of illegal immigrants from around the world they have to deport without spending any money. On top of that, they'll have opposition from every Democrat in the House and Senate, and even some of their own party, as well as legal groups, federal judges, and more they'll have to wade through.**TL;DR - We'll waste a lot of time and a lot of money, just to be set back a decade.*C.)** Either Trump (or a Trump proxy) upsets another nation, or we enter into a civil war, and an adversary finds it to be an opportune time to attack the United States. We enter into WWIII and witness the downfall of the empire formerly known as The United States of America. We'll all literately be too focus on staying alive that no one will care what the Republicans could've accomplished, because there will be nothing left for them to mess up.**TL;DR - Actions have consequences, we enter into WWIII.**   \\nI think **B** is the most reasonable. However... we've never had someone try to steal an election. We've never had an insurrection like we did in 2020. We've never had a convicted felon and rapist elected as President. The word \\"unprecedented\\" was thrown around a lot since 2016, and then even more after the 2020 election and January 6th, and more than ever after this election. \\"Unprecedented\\" meaning \\"never done or known before.\\" As in, we can all guess but literately no one knows.","title":"What Could a MAGA Government Accomplish?"},{"text":"Will it?","title":"Trump Aims a Wrecking Ball at Climate Policy"},{"text":"Good.

Whats left of America is then Trump ordering the military to invade and take them back leading to a civil war.Realistically, I think America just slowly rots and decays over the next 4 years. They slowly add new lines into bills allowing Republicans to freely redraw all district lines across the country so they will never lose an election ever again. At that point, you'll see blue states withhold funding to the rest of the country in hopes Trump's admin realizes civil unrest over doing that might lead to a lot of moderate and Republican voters turning on them too. So they drop it and Democrats hopefully win the next election.Which means if a Democrat wins in 2028 they'll be spending 4 years once again trying to fix literally every single little thing Trump's team shattered into billions of pieces so they get little done and America with its goldfish memory re-elects the Republicans in 2032 to cause even more catastrophic damage.","title":"Trump's pick for top intel job has been accused of 'traitorous' parroting of Russian propaganda"},{"text":"You think so?

There are many people who are up in arms about the Gabbard apointment, which was somewhat inevitable: there are people who will argue about whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, and with much the same effect on the sun actually rising.The important point is not that she was appointed. It is that she was appointed *instead of someone much worse*. Those sorts of people are readily available within the repub orbit. A Bolton, or a Bannon, or a Nuland, or even a Cotton or a Scott, for example. He could have seriously **laid waste** with this appointment, if he truly let his inner nehilist run wild.One would think that the dems would understand this, since they don't believe in change at all, other than perhaps the tiniest possible incremental change, in the smallest possible baby steps. She is incrementally better than many of the choices that I personally had feared, and brings some actual real-world competencies to the task. Therefore, I'm cautiously optimistic.Trump may be taking this time through more seriously than his first outing. Some, though not all, of his appointments do show a better use of *someone's* judgment, within the repub hall of horrors.I think that he's keeping his powder dry, to focus on getting his chosen chainsaw/blunt object in place as AG. The lawfare that will result from that choice will be Biblical in scope.

So sure, it's assembled here, but the parts might not be, and those parts all get tariffed\\nAnd, if they were to move to a wholely US based supply chain (which would be practically impossible), they would also be competing with everyone else for those limited production materials, as well as having to pay a higher price due to the higher wages of US workers.

The FDA removed a law that required follow up appointments after that pill (to make getting abortions easier across state lines). So, the fetus died, but without a follow up appointments was still in the woman as dead tissue. She went septic after a few weeks but was terrified to go to the doctor in Georgia because she thought it would still be an abortion.

He wanted Kelly who is a Trump loyalist. Trump called Thune a \\"RINO\\" or \\"Republican in Name Only\\" - meaning that he is closer to a Democrat, but that is not true in any way. Thune is a Republican, but he is not an extremist, so yes, there is some hope there that he will not back down to what Trump wants all the time.Yes, the Senate wants to do their jobs. They are the ones who vote on appointees, like the AG of the US, and other very, critically, important positions. They do not want Trump to over-reach his power, by using recess appointments, where he can bypass the Senate debate about someone he wants to put in office. Kelly was willing to allow the recess appointments, the rest of the Senate was not.Yes, the Senate has to worry about their jobs and keeping the majority. In two years we have mid-terms, and in those elections, there are, I think, 13 seats up for grabs. If the Senate goes crazy pushing everything Trump wants through to law, most of them will lose their seats and they want to avoid that at all cost. Politics is a slow burn game, not a hurry up and do everything all at once.  Trump does not understand that, so he is trying to get a bunch of things shoved through at one time, on his first day in office, and he is not going to get to do most of it.As far as anything happening to Trump, the alternative is JD Vance and he is much sharper than Trump is, but he is about as likeable as a rubbing your crotch on a cactus. The danger with him is that he is sneaky smart and eloquent, and would be able to make more traction on Project 2025 than Trump will.  Trump is going to fire every single one of the people he has already appointed, most of them before this time next year. There is little he enjoys more than firing people, and that will keep his administration dysfunctional. Vance would not have that problem.There is hope over the next 4 years. We have mid-terms coming up and we need everyone to get out a vote. We need to give Congress back to the Democrats so they can stall Trump's hostile takeover of the government. We have good people on both side of the aisle in both Chambers of Congress. Not everyone is a Trump loyalist who is chomping at the bit to crash the economy and send us into another Great Depression. There are some very intelligent and powerful people in Washington DC who can beat Trump behind the scenes. They will have to concede some lower end losses, but they can keep most everything else the same as it is today. Whether or not they WILL do it, is another story, but don't lose hope. At the end of the day, most of the people in Congress do not care who you voted for, if you call them, they will try their best to help you. I am as scared about the next 4 years as anyone. But, I am a straight, white, male, in Texas, and I honestly do not have a lot to worry about personally. My concern is for my wife and kids and what kind of world we are creating, and leaving behind, for them. Trump has made it okay for racist, misogynist, homophobic asshats to crawl out of the woodwork and openly scream their bullshit from the rooftops.All we can do is fight the fight in front of us. We have to vote. We have to educate, not only ourselves, but those around us. We have to be the example of what we want the world to be. It is going to be easy to give into hate and depression over these next few years, but you have to fight it. It will get better.","title":"Something hopefully"},{"text":"He means it would devastate their EV sales, not their sales in general.

The Gaetz pick, in particular, drew immediate derision. Gaetz will never get confirmed, an unnamed Republican senator told Fox News. Senator John Cornyn rolled his eyes and let out an audible snort, while Gaetzs Republican House colleagues reportedly gasped when they heard the news: [https://theatln.tc/W4p3V0LR](https://theatln.tc/W4p3V0LR)Maybe the Senate caucus really will draw the line somewhereperhaps at Gaetz, perhaps at one or both of Gabbard and Hegseth. But there is something disconcertingly familiar in the confident yet carefully hedged assertions that the old-line GOP will stop this madness. It is exactly what Republicans said would stop Trump from receiving the nomination in 2015, from winning the presidency in 2016, and from reclaiming the partys leadership after the ignominy of January 6. I dont think hes a serious candidate, Senator Lisa Murkowski said yesterday, of Gaetz. That is almost a verbatim repetition of what elected Republicans once said about Trump.At every step along the way, Republican elites have assumed that they could stop Trump later. But when the decisive moment arrived, they discovered that the cost of confrontation had gotten higher, not lower. Opening a breach with a man whom the base had come to admire, and then worship, would imperil their?*own*?ambitions, not just Trumps....Old-guard Republicans appear to be in the middle stage of a familiar Trump-era progression. It begins *Hed never do it* before moving on to *Well stop him if he tries* and finally settling on *There was nothing we could have done anyway*. As they advance through these stages, they will cede Trump more and more power, which will only vindicate their ultimate fatalism.

(Among Harris voters)6% - Kamala Harris24% Joe Biden53% Neither, it was just a bad year for Democrats17% Not sureI tend to agree in general. The original sin was Biden not stepping aside last year, so you could make an argument it is 90% his fault, but it's impossible to say what would have happened with a full Dem primary. Harris likely would not have won, but that other candidate still probably wouldn't have truly separated themselves from Biden. Harris almost needed to throw Biden under the bus and she was never gonna do that, especially as part of his administration.I probably blame Harris the least. She wasn't the best candidate, but I thought she did pretty well considering the circumstances. It's easy to nitpick now about not doing interviews sooner, not doing Rogan, involving too many celebrities, etc. but Trump made far worse campaign errors. She did really well with the big things like the DNC speech, the second debate and the Fox News interview. I don't think anyone realized how much of an uphill climb the Dems had due to inflation and the border.Regardless of what you think about Harris, you'll never convince me she wasn't an upgrade over post-debate Biden.

Reading the rest of your comment it seems pretty clear that you don't actually know what Biden did. I seriously suggesting reading through the subreddit:/r/WhatBidenHasDone/Open borders? StupidNot really a thing. Borders have always been guarded and policies for the most part have not changed in decades except for each president upping the amount of money for the border. Multiple presidents have granted amnesty to immigrants from Reagan to Bush Sr to Clinton, but certainly not Biden. You might be confused because Biden \\"closed the border\\" or more accurately shut down the border by executive order on June 4th of this year if illegal border crossings reached 2,500 immigrants. But you have to understand that it really meant shut down processing of amnesty seekers at the border and that the border wasn't open before that (you could never just walk or drive in without being stopped). Furthermore the reason why Biden did this by executive order is because congress wouldn't pass a bill that gave Biden the funds to protect the border and the reason congress wouldn't do it is because Trump told them to block any border bill (even the Republican one the senate made) since if Biden fixed the border problem Trump would have nothing to run on. So blame Trump for our border problems.  Print Heaps of Cash? Stupid.Not only did Biden not do this, to suggest that any president could belays an basic ignorance of how our government works. The treasury is only allowed to print money for two reasons. First is to replace old and damaged money, and second is to give to the Federal Reserve to lend out to banks who pay a certain interest rate the Federal Reserve sets to borrow that money. So when Trump says \\"don't worry, America will always be able to pay its debts because the government can simply print more money.\\" he is absolutely wrong. Debts in the US are paid for by bonds, specifically US treasury bills.  Say that riots are protests? StupidYou mean the protests/riots that happened under Trump? Who cares what anyone calls them? And is that any dumber than Republicans pretending that January 6th were just some dumb tourists?  Having Biden in public? Stupid.What now? Your arguments are getting weaker and weaker here, so much so I have no idea what you trying to say. You think the president of the United States shouldn't be seen in public? LOL. Maybe you missed it but the election this year wasn't even between Biden versus Trump, it was Harris versus Trump. So you can take your imagined gripes with Biden and shove them, because none of them justify giving a monkey a shotgun.","title":"US: Donald Trump Hints At Constitution-Breaking 3rd Term As President.

I'm trying to say what he said. Tell me what you think about what he said? (He references a table in this quote but you can get the gist of his argument without it.) I've bolded the important bits, should be pretty easy to skim.\\\\--By contrast, the median sample size in individual polls in these states is 800 voters. **In a 49-49 race in a poll of 800 people  assuming 2 percent goes to third parties  the theoretical margin of error for**?[**the difference between Trump and Harris**](https://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/MOEFranklin.pdf)?**is 6 points.** If that sounds higher than youre expecting, thats because the margin of error thats usually reported in polls is only for one candidates vote share. For instance, in a poll of 800 people, Trumps margin of error is about 3 points, as is Harriss. However, basically every vote that isnt a vote for Trump is a vote for Harris. If Trump gets 52 percent of the vote instead of 49, that implies Harris will receive 46 percent.[1](https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state#footnote-1-151049884)?**So the margin of error on the difference separating Trump and Harris is 6.*What this means is that if pollsters are doing honest work, we should see a lot more outliers than we do**  even if people?[love to complain about them on Twitter](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trust-a-pollster-more-when-it-publishes).In our database as of this afternoons model run, **there were 249 polls in the seven battleground states** that met Silver Bulletin standards and did at least some of their fieldwork in October.[2](https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state#footnote-2-151049884)?**How many of them showed the race in either direction within 2.5 percentage points**[**3**](https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state#footnote-3-151049884)**, close enough that you could basically call it a tie?*Well, 193 of them did, or 78 percent. Thats way more than you should get in theory**  even if the candidates are actually exactly tied in all seven states, which they almost certainly arent.Theres more detail on this in the table below. Using?[this margin of error formula](https://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/MOEFranklin.pdf), I calculated the likelihood that a poll should show the race within 2.5 points. This depends greatly on the sample size. For a poll of 400 people, the smallest sample size in our October swing state database, the chances that it will hit this close to the mark are only about 40 percent. For the largest sample, 5686 voters, its almost 95 percent instead. But most state polls are toward the lower end of this range, surveying between 600 and 1200 voters. **All told, wed expect 55 percent of the polls to show a result within 2.5 points in a tied race.**?**Instead, almost 80 percent of them did.**?How unlikely is that?**Based on a**?[**binomial distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution)?** which assumes that all polls are independent of one another, which theoretically they should be  its**?realllllllllllllly?**unlikely.

City of Detroit?(3d Jud. Ct. Wayne Cnty. Nov. 13, 2020)](https://electioncases.osu.edu/case/costantino-v-city-of-detroit/)?C In denying the plaintiffs preliminary injunction, the court found that the plaintiffs claims of fraud would unlikely prevail on the merits. The court noted that many plaintiffs failed to include crucial information in their allegations, such as locations of alleged misconduct, frequency of alleged misconduct, names of those involved in alleged misconduct, and so on. Overall, the court found the plaintiffs claims of fraud to be speculative, filled with guess-work, and often unsubstantiated. Moreover, defendants provided a sufficient amount of evidence to convince the court that they had acted within the law. This decision was affirmed by the Michigan Court of Appeals on Nov. 16, 2020, and by the Michigan Supreme Court on Nov. 23, 2020. Even in cases where 'standing' is the issue, Standing is **kind of fucking important.**For example, [Gohmert v Pence](https://electioncases.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Gohmert-v-Pence-Doc37.pdf) was a lawsuit where the court had to decide whether to throw out the *entire electoral count act* on the grounds that a single congressman said \\"If Pence follows the elector count act and counts the legitimate electors, I won't be allowed to cast my vote in a congressional session to declare trump the winner.\\"That is clown shit. That is nonsense. The point of standing is that you need to have a particularized injury to sue, because otherwise anyone can sue for anything, like Gohmert tried to do here.The court didn't throw it out on 'political questions doctrine' they threw it out because the relief he was asking for was absurd and he did not have the standing to ask for such an absurd relief.?One of them, Thomas Jefferson, literally did it in the election in which he was elected president. So you're just wrong.Just falsehoods upon falsehoods from you.Jefferson did not reject a slate of legitimate electors. During the count one of the clerks noted an oddity in the Georgia ballot. Jefferson, acting in his role, chose to count that ballot despite the oddity. This causes you to think \\"Aha, see, jeffeerson cheated too so it is fine if my guy did\\"But the thing is, Jefferson didn't 'cheat'. The 'irregularity' is that the electors in Georgia, a state that everyone agreed Jefferson had won, decided to put their signatures on the envelope, rather than putting them on the ballot.That's it. He was shown the irregularity, talked with the clerk and they went 'no reason to delay this simply because they sent their ballot in [weird](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/01/05/no-thomas-jefferson-didnt-rig-the-1800-vote-count/).You would know this if you spent two seconds learning anything about the claims you make.","title":"CMV: The US military is about to become trump's personal plaything"},{"text":"Yeah, and they only go after low hanging fruit.
