Their own Hadiths Most Muslims assume that Muhammad would never have allowed rape.?However, here is an incriminating authentic hadith that clearly implies that after a battle Muhammad?allowed his soldiers to rape the female captives of the war booty who?were alloted to them:Abu Sirma said to Abu Said al Khadri (Allah he pleased with him):?0 Abu Said, did you hear Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) mentioning al-azl??He said: Yes, and added: We went out with Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the?expedition to the Bil Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them,?for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them.?So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing azl (Withdrawing the male sexual?organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas?Allahs Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him),?and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it,?for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born. ?[Sahih Muslim, Book 008, Number 3371]This could be called the Rape Hadith. The Arab women were not the soldiers wives because they intended to ransom them, and permission to rape is implied because Muhammad?does not say, Rape is haram, rape is forbidden by Allah,?when he was given the perfect opportunity to do so. Instead, Muhammad explains that they dont need to use any contraceptive methods,?because a child will only be born if it is destined to be born.[sources ](https://counteringislamism.wordpress.com/rape/)[sources ](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/world/middleeast/isis-enshrines-a-theology-of-rape.html)\\n[sources ](https://www.scribd.com/document/96963641/Rape-and-Looting-Are-Eternal-Laws-of-Allah)","title":"Do not trust Elon or Trump."},{"text":"I used RES extension (Reddit Enhancement Suite) to tag all the users from that article.","title":"Mike Johnson now has the votes to become speaker on the FIRST ballot, reaching 218 after two congressmen - Self and Normal"},{"text":"Because it is.

Usually, one would expect your family to be part of your \\"tribe\\"\\nBut social media has turned that on its head. It's not hard to find people complaining about parents / grandparents due to differing political beliefs, catalyzed by social media.\\nAnd, at some point, if you are part of several intersecting and disjoint \\"tribes\\", isn't that just having ideas? As a concrete example, there's a large number of people who are pro-Palestine, anti-China, and a large number who are pro-Palestine, pro-China.\\nWhile you could consider this membership in two tribes - just how many tribes can one be part of before it's no longer \\"tribalism\\"?\\nMoreover, in the past, it was much more common to identify as a Republican or a Democrat, and go with policies just based on the party that proposed them. Now we're seeing a huge surge of people who identify with neither, and demand that the Democrats do more to appeal to them, rather than falling in line and voting for \\"their team\\".\\n A conception of good must be widely held abolitionists, gay marriage ... changed public conceptions of morality\\nThis is just factually incorrect. Tolerance and progress often come *after* legislative changes, when people have time to adjust to the new status quo. Had abolition movements really changed the moral framework of the majority, before legal reforms (don't forget - there literally was a war that enforced their will), subsequent attempts to re institute slavery, like debt Peonage, Jim Crow laws, segregation, wouldn't have happened.\\nGay rights are contested even now - with many Southern states arguing that it should be legal to outlaw on a religious basis. Had the hearts and minds truly been convinced? been the precursor to gay marriage, this wouldn't follow.\\nI'd like to dig a step deeper here too. Is \\"benefit of the majority\\" always relevant? At its height, the Nazi party had ~38% popularity, a plurality. If, hypothetically, it had been even higher (i.e 90%) would that make what they did okay? Would opposing them, and standing against the status quo, be \\"unproductive\\"?\\n*Even if* by the time real change has been enacted, 50%+ have been convinced, every step until that point, there was a minority who believes in a certain conception of justice, against the wills most people. Were they wrong to spread these beliefs?\\n Unproductive discussion outweighs productive discussion?\\nThat's going to always be true - social media or not. As they say \\"talk is cheap\\". Add in that click bait/ rage bait? is profitable, and the general volume of content on the internet, and you'll be able to observe lots of useless fluff. But amongst that fluff is gold.\\nOne can say that before, the 2 factions were significantly stronger and agreed on more. But also, before social media, a supermajority of the nation was completely fine with invading a country halfway across the world, to seize nuclear weapons that didn't exist, and murdering, directly or indirectly, hundreds of thousands of people.?\\nI don't think the fact that there was more \\"respectful agreement\\" is a positive, if it can lead to much abhorrent conditions.\\n Dispassionate conversation\\nIs this productive? Having beliefs that you stand for is not a bad thing. If you were to try and argue that slavery is good, I would disagree most vehemently. Passionate speech is convincing.?\\n Shared search for better understanding\\nAgain - center is not inherently better. If we argue about the pros and cons of slavery, it is not a better conversation or I cede ground, and try to genuinely see the merits of slavery. It is not a \\"shared search\\". A better, more productive conversation is one sided - where I convince you AWAY from slavery, outright. Using evidence is one form of persuasion - and one that's frequently used (death counts, costs, other statistics are frequently used by one set-in-stone side to try to convince the other)\\n Less logical fallacies, etc\\nThe ends justify the means.

Your and other's insightful contributions are forcing me to be more clear and specific.people can't have these discussions anyway and they must be able to be had reliably on the internet1. Most people, not all people. 2. My argument is not that they must be able to have those conversations on social media or the internet broadly. In the example I gave of this forum, you can see firsthand positions move on political topics, and hell... it happens every single day here reliably.Apologies, which example are you referring to?Otherwise, this gives me hope. But this subreddit is still a tiny sliver of social media political discussion. I'm sure not all examples are as bad as the one I cited in another comment thread about how \\"CMV: white people countries are more racist\\". To me, even if the poster changed their mind, that conversation is unproductive as a whole. Although that judgment puts me in a difficult position; how do people come to informed conclusions then? My first thought would be - informed, dispassionate, digestible, etc. discussion of these questions (or less loaded, but related questions) modeled by experts or otherwise more educated individuals.","title":"CMV: Social media, including Reddit, does not reliably produce productive political discussion"},{"text":"Next to the photocopier.","title":"Donald Trump fumes over flag flying at half-staff to honor Jimmy Carter during inauguration"},{"text":"Those things are not inherent to political discussion.\\"unwaivering adherence and partisanship\\" I would say is exemplified throughout human political history. \\"unwaivering adherence and partisanship\\" is also a product of cognitive biases at work. To that extent, these traits are inherent to human nature, and so they are commonplace in political discussions, especially so on social media. Quickly - \\"unwaivering\\" doesn't necessarily mean someone has said they won't consider other views. Rather, I could roughly define it as someone who, because of cognitive biases, including partisan bias and tribalism, effectively is not considering other stances in a charitable and reasonably dispassionate manner. They may wholeheartedly think they are, but their actions show to a group of reasonable people across the political spectrum, that they are not. Now, that doesn't mean that \\"unwaivering adherence and partisanship\\" are impossible to bypass. As you rightly point out, there are many people who are open to reconsider their stances. However, the traits that cause someone to be willing to reconsider their stance/be open-minded/dispassionate/etc. are less likely to be nurtured, promoted and otherwise incentivized on social media. At least the mainstream systems/platforms I'm aware of.(compromise) (...) that's in no way needed for a political discussion to be fruitfulI'm not sure what I think about this. However, if I needed to commit to a view, according to my definition of productive (see most recent comment with [throwawayhq222](/user/throwawayhq222/)) I would agree that compromise is not always needed for a political discussion to be fruitful.Introducting doubt and fresh perspectives isn't that difficult. We needn't proof during a conversation either, that the conversation hasn't shifted perspectives or views even if they aren't loudly decalred and in the case of this sub, awarded a Delta.Could you clarify what you mean here? My fault, but also if you could tie it in to how my argument fails or is lacking, my pleb brain is getting maxed out here.\\"Introducting doubt and fresh perspectives isn't that difficult.\\" - You're right it's not difficult to introduce a contrary political idea to someone, and maybe even doubt. But, it is difficult on social media to get the majority of people to reconsider their stances, moreso if the political issue is controversial, there are partisan/tribal divides.

In fact, having a large proportion of citizens not vote is very normal, as roughly 30-40% of Americans did not vote in the 2024 election.Pointing out people who didnt vote as an argument against the validity of the vote is pretty corny. You do bring up one good point though  there was no option to stay a territory.  However, any inference about the lack of a territory option is pure speculation.  We do have verifiable facts regarding how many people preferred statehood to independence or free association.  Maybe this is an indication of people just thinking statehood is the least of two evils and being a territory is preferable, maybe this is an indication that statehood is becoming a more popular idea as time progresses.  The truth is that the majority of people that voted looked at that poll and said statehood is the best option; if you have any actual data to back up the theory you proposed Id love to see it, but right now the vote is the closest to an actual poll we have that I know of.","title":"CMV: The territories should be given either 1 voting member each or a at large voting member to the US House of representatives"},{"text":"If they convicted Hillary for committing campaign finance violations like the FEC did I would not have as much of a problem with this case.","title":"Donald Trump's Hush Money Trial Judge Sets Sentencing Date for 10 Days Before Presidential Inauguration"},{"text":"Bullshit that it's bigotry.

It clearly states that only states get voting representation in Congress. This isnt some arbitrary rule, its fundamental to our federal system.Third, your subject to laws argument falls flat. Plenty of people are subject to U.S. laws without congressional representation, think of U.S. citizens living abroad or even children. Should we give them all voting members too?Fourth, the just move argument isnt as ridiculous as you claim. Unlike colonial times, there are no legal barriers for territorial residents to move to states. Many do exactly that. Your what if they like where they are point is irrelevant. Liking where you live doesnt entitle you to change the constitutional structure of government.Finally, your emotional appeal ignores practical realities.

They were linked to white supremacist ideologies [2].2002:\\nA string of domestic violence cases resulted in several Fort Bragg soldiers murdering their spouses within weeks of returning from deployment.

If elected, Poilievre said he plans to speed up approvals to build oil refineries, liquefied natural gas plants, nuclear facilities and hydro power. Canada has the ability to grow its electricity surplus with the US, helping to run the data centers that are essential to its booming artificial intelligence sector, he added. If you look at the history of President Trump, he negotiates very aggressively and he likes to win, but in the end, he doesnt appear to have a problem if his counterparty also wins, Poilievre said. And so I think that we can get a great deal that will make both countries safer, richer, and stronger. But Trump should also be aware that Canada currently sells its oil and gas to the US at enormous discounts, Poilievre told Peterson.  [] The discount exists because Canada has few alternatives. Theres only one oil-export pipeline that goes to an ocean port in British Columbia, and the country is only now developing a liquefied natural gas industry with the capacity to ship large quantities of gas to Asia. So most of the fuel goes south.  [] Poilievre argued that Trump has reason to be annoyed with US deficits with China and Mexico  from a mercantilist point of view  because they siphon away American jobs. But the trade gap with Canada is different, the Conservative leader said, because its driven by the sale of commodities that Canada has and the US needs, and actually supports American jobs where theyre processed downstream. The last thing he should want to do is to block the underpriced Canadian energy from going into his marketplace, he continued, appealing to Trump. In fact, what I would encourage him to do is to approve the Keystone pipeline, he added, referring to a long-running Keystone XL project designed to ferry some 800,000 barrels a day from Albertas oil sands to southeast Nebraska, where it would link up with existing pipelines. President Joe Biden revoked a key permit for that project after taking office in 2021, effectively killing it. Trump is in favor of Keystone XL, but there has been no sign yet that South Bow Corp., owner of the Keystone system, would want to revive it. # Lost Jobs If Trump somehow stopped Canadas trade surplus with the US immediately, American workers at refineries would lose their jobs and consumers would pay higher prices, Poilievre said. He argued that Canada should instead ramp up extraction of resources such as critical minerals that so both countries can get richer while weaning themselves off supplies from unfriendly states like China. Poilievre added that hes held talks with the conservative leaders of hydrocarbon-rich provinces Alberta and Saskatchewan, asking them to be ready to expedite resource project approvals. \\n Poilievre said he would address US concerns about border trafficking and military spending, adding that a Conservative government would invest the planned gains of his energy-exporting strategy in Arctic security. Trump has long complained the US is being shortchanged by allies, and Canada is currently far short of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization goal to spend 2% of gross domestic product on defense. I can fund a more robust military and continental defense if I have more free trade with the greatest economy the world has ever seen  and we can both win, he said.!ping CanFurther readings:https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/liberal-caucus-chairs-to-talk-trudeau-today-pm-chairing-canada-u-s-cabinet-meeting-sources-1.7163957https://globalnews.ca/news/10941556/justin-trudea-more-calls-to-resign-liberals/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-top-liberal-mps-to-discuss-how-to-amp-up-pressure-on-trudeau-to-reveal/https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-trum-elizabeth-may-1.7422629","title":"Great Deal: Trudeaus Conservative Rival Makes Energy Pitch to Trump"},{"text":"https://youtu.be/ICd5DiZmuig?t=157&amp;si=5yuIOPmiJYbZkQftBill Barr saying that he doesnt care how hes remembered","title":"Judge rejects Trump's motion to dismiss hush money case, sets sentencing for Jan. 10"},{"text":"omg. is this real","title":"As usual, Trump took a tragedy and made it about himself."},{"text":"Aquino was a really, really weird dude.

Biden greatly reduced illegal border crossings by giving immigrants carte blanche to come in here through the CBP One app. The Republicans liked to call it illegal during the campaign, but it was 100% legal. So the Republicans have to define what immigration they like, and what immigration they don't like. Can everyone come here as long as they pass a background check? Or can anyone come here as long as they're not from South America, a Spanish-speaking country, or a country with high amounts of terrorism?Krishnan and Ramaswamy both seem to want unlimited immigration from India with no caps.

For our purpose: determining what is 'the good' today, I would take a leap and say:judging historic peoples against our modern conceptions of morality isn't useful. Indeed, what is good, is dependent on the definition of that time. Because of that, a conception of good must be widely held during the time in question. The work that abolitionists did, gay marriage advocates, and what others like them do, is to change public conceptions of morality. Once abolitionists changed public conceptions of morality, slavery finally became immoral (after thousands of years). This is probably the weakest point of my argument, as I'm not even sure I'm fully confident in this assertion.^(1) (although I'm not sure about different places within the same time period). \\"It's very, very hard to measure this - especially when social media has negative effects completely unrelated to politics.\\"I agree. However, I think we can make a reasonable approximation. Do you? I think the subjectivity of morality debate aside, there is wide agreement on the amount of negatives that come out of the internet, although I'm more confident in specifying *social media*, that the positives are outweighed by the negatives. Would you agree?Even if not, my argument is not that the negatives outweigh the positives, but that unproductive political discussion greatly outweighs productive political discussion. I may, however, need to revise my definition of productive (remove the good) part. With that 'good' concept removed, \\"productive\\" would include: dispassionate conversation, evidence that the discussion is a shared search for better understandings, less logical fallacies and cognitive biases...\\", and potentially more.","title":"CMV: Social media, including Reddit, does not reliably produce productive political discussion"},{"text":"Nobody is angry ?? like I said, I wish you a full and speedy recovery","title":"Judge has ordered Trump to appear for sentencing in the New York hush money case on Jan. 10, shortly before inauguration."},{"text":"U guys should be protesting NOW!

Articles with bs headlines like this that appear so much on this sub are a huge part of the problem.I lived overseas for five years before coming back to the states this past summer. I followed this sub pretty religiously post 1/6/21. After (financially) being forced to take a job in a MAGA town I continued to follow this sub. I was at least 75% certain that Id be drinking conservative tears out of my coffee cup on the morning of November 7. Obviously didnt happen.

After that, its hard to believe headlines like this when I can see the truth with my own eyes and ears. Many of the people in this town are not the caricatures we make them out to be; just like we dont all have blue hair and drink almond milk. As long as I dont mention names/trigger words then I can get coworkers to agree with me on many things. As soon as they hear that trigger though its over. They are indoctrinated plain and simple. Now my point: had I still been living overseas and not been doing my current job, then I also would be indoctrinated because Id probably forget my disappointment on the morning of November 7 and start buying into this copium clickbait.

It's hard to nail down exactly how many people are \\"racist\\" because it's so hard to define, but I'll take a terrible stab at it. First of all, racism is prejudice in action against a particular ethnic demographic. That can take shape as prejudiced assumptions about people, or specific actions motivated by your prejudice. A good harmless example is the idea that \\"black people's favorite food is watermelon\\" is racist, and it would also be racist to try to sell watermelon to black people because you're convinced black people love watermelon.A non-racist would say \\"yeah that's the literal definition of prejudice in action\\", while a racist person might downplay the prejudice, or even justify the prejudice. A racist person usually understands that racism is socially unacceptable, so they don't want to be called racist, so they're strongly motivated to downplay racism. Non-racist people usually understand that everybody makes decisions based on their bias (discrimination), and if somebody is making a consistent series of racist decisions, then they're likely operating on racist bias. Shorthand we just say they're racist.There's an important question that gallup asked people in 2019; which is the bigger problem in america today, seeing discrimination where it doesn't exist, or not-seeing discrimination where it does exist.You can probably see where this is going. 75% of republicans said that the bigger problem is people seeing discrimination where it doesn't exist. 75% of democrats said that the bigger problem is people ignoring discrimination where it does exist.Consider also that most democrats are mixed race or other minority groups that experience discrimination, and you can see that the democrats are probably rather better equipped to identify discriminatory/racist behavior.So my tenuous but justified connection is that 75% of republicans are at least comfortable with ignoring discrimination that they think just isn't discriminatory enough. They're basically saying people who experience discrimination are liars. They're literally being prejudiced against people in the process of downplaying the discrimination that those people experience. That consistent effort to downplay discrimination is why the majority of MAGA are racists. According to the poll 25% of republicans aren't waving off discrimination, but the other 75% are happy to hide behind them.https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/04/09/race-in-america-2019/","title":"In the GOP Civil War over Immigration, Both Sides Are Racists"},{"text":"Yup.","title":"Surveillance State in 3... 2... 1..."},{"text":"Russian traitors would also be an appropriate label","title":"Don't do what McCarthy did: Moderate GOP members urge Johnson not to deal with partys far-right"},{"text":"So you think they should not have to pay any taxes, have our militarys security guarantee, but on top of that, you think they should get congressional representation lol.

They were not only criticized by the losers of the arrangement, but a large enough part of the voters, too. In reality, the values are older and if the values codified in the 18th century were a response to policy (which to a degree they were, of course), they were that to European policy of the early modern era, before the US was even founded. The US constitution was largely written based on those values, as you know.Also, the various civil rights movements largely *happened* because of that liberalism; elsewhere they might've well been simply crushed because there is no democracy (not that they didn't try the same here).So yes, I will argue that those values are very much the basis of Western culture and society.","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"Dude gets convicted of 34 felonies, threatens the judges family, becomes president, gets sentenced anyway, oops the judge decides he wont even have to face any consequences and can zoom into a felony sentencing hearing.?Fuck this country.

I don't necessarily think that is the same. But someone just saying racist stuff to say it because they are racist. Can't say I've ever seen that.

It's specifically with WITCH companies that mass apply for visas and then rent their hires out to other companies. They don't even have individuals in mind when they apply for H1Bs. This disincentivizes being picky for quality. They only care about filling seats. And to add insult to injury, these are the individuals that everyone in IT knows as H1B hires because unlike FTE hires these guys end up spending 3-12 months at a time at a different company.This is the opposite of how FTE H1Bs works where a company has to pay a premium to sponsor a specific individual. They do their own due diligence just like they would with a normal hire. You can [see from the data](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/h1b-workers/) that H1Bs normally get paid around the same or higher salaries as their domestic counterparts (similar title/geographic job market). The median H1B salary is ~$135k. Cognizant's median H1B application is ~$100k. It's worth noting that even with Cognizant and the other WITCH consulting firms H1B pay is still higher than domestic by ~3% when you control for job title and geographic job market.","title":"Elon Musk - Clear Conflict of Interest on the Visa Issue"},{"text":"Two tier system.?\\nWe were just born poor.?","title":"Trump to be sentenced in hush money case 10 January"},{"text":"\\"The Dems are all giddy\\"Proceeds to layout exactly why they're all \\"giddy\\".","title":"Trump is classless"},{"text":"But this election may have actually been the most fraudulent with all the voter suppression tactics, MAGA people working as election officials, and unregistering of active voters.","title":"Republicans' trust in accuracy of US elections jumps after Trump's win, AP-NORC poll finds"},{"text":"Sentences in general can include a lot of things including jail, fines, probation, community service, mandatory meetings (like dui can have to attend AA classes), suspension of drivers license.

Justice Juan Merchan is favoring an unconditional discharge, which is a reasonable yet unusual sentence. a *conditional* discharge requires a judge to determine that imprisonment nor probation are appropriate. as I stated [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1da97km/if_you_woke_up_july_11th_as_judge_juan_merchan/l7kplje/), incarceration is \\"not unassailable\\" and probation \\"presents similar questions\\" regarding Trump's status as president. a conditional discharge seems acceptable, but it requires the court to impose certain conditions  say, paying restitution. the distinction between an unconditional discharge and a conditional discharge is \\"proper purpose\\" for a condition. requirements, such as maintaining employment, are not necessarily applicable to the presidentit is worth noting that, on a less technical level, Merchan's decision places Trump in an unenviable position. Trump could request an appellate court pause his sentencing swiftly, prolonging his legal peril, or he could choose to accept the sentencing and appeal it later with the presumption that the Supreme Court would be favorable. there is no political benefit for him in appear in court and fight a taxing legal battle, however. his spokesman, [Steven Cheung](https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-trumps-hush-money-case-expected-sentence-unconditional/story?id=116706931), suggested that Trump will opt for the former, thereby limiting yet extending his claims of persecution that he has courted for nearly two years. the lack of a clearly superior choice will certainly lead to Trump expressing his frustration in unusual ways over the next several days, including a statement he made in the last hour condemning his litigative opponents","title":"Trump must be sentenced in hush money criminal case on Jan. 10, judge rules"},{"text":"One of the few truths Trump told us: \\"When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same.

The average doctor in America who runs for office could almost certainly afford to litigate a lawsuit challenging the result all the way to the end.  (Source:  I'm a fairly expensive lawyer, and I think I could do a better job than most of the lawyers these people actually hire, but I still can't imagine charging more than a couple hundred thousand to take such a case to trial.  Even if the lawyers they're hiring are hugely overcharging them--and they probably are--I can't imagine the bill exceeding the single-digit millions to dispute any election below the presidency.)I don't see any need to postulate some great conspiracy to explain why Republicans are suing to overturn elections.  Election fraud is a hot topic on the right so more of them are thinking about it.  The more Republicans think about election fraud, the more Republicans convince themselves they're personally victims of election fraud.  And as the number of Republicans who think they're victims of election fraud rises, so too does the number of Republicans who both think they're victims and can afford to file suit out of their own pocket.I'm sure most of the suits are funded by some mix of the relevant campaign's remaining cash and the candidate's own money.  There may also be donations from a few conservative PACs in there somewhere, too, but it's not necessary to invoke them to explain most of what we're seeing.","title":"South Korean President Yoon's team claims immunity from insurrection charges, citing Trump ruling"},{"text":"they're the same as the headlines of the progressives that we're going to come around and vote for Kamala in the same as the headlines of Republicans that were going to vote for her because they were sick of Trump It was all just a headline and nothing more. you can turn off the news.

My point is if you were in the Army, chances are you've been through Bragg for something. And if you were airborne or spec ops, you have been through Bragg a lot.  I've been all around Bragg via land and air. All the landing and drop zones. All the tank trails. Many of the buildings. And I still probably haven't seen 10% of what's there.  I had a TS clearance. It might have gotten me into places that others couldn't, but I wouldn't have known the difference at the time. When everybody you roll with walks the same line, you dont pay attention. Nothing really made me stop and think wow that's Top Secret except for one place. It's called the Red Roof Inn. It's a large multi building red tile roof compound out in the woods near Pope. Never known or even heard talk of somebody going there. That's not even the cool part. Us as USAF C130 aircrew conducting massive training ops almost daily. We were under no circumstances allowed to fly within 1 nautical mile of the Red Roof Inn. It wasn't like it was out of the way, either. We had to go out of our way a lot to avoid it. \\nI've been told it's Deltas playground. I have seen parts of the place light up at night when we are on NVGs. I knew alot of people. Sat in alot of cool mission prep briefings, laid out all the simulated plans based on Ft.Braggs layout. The sat images. Drop and LZs. We knew what time of year and what lakes to low level flight over to see the most titties as possible. Yes we fly that low in a C130. Never saw or actually knew or heard first hand account of anything real. Wish I did. That goes for UAPs also. I have 2,500 plus flight hours. Most of those hours at all the places you would expect to see some shit. Alot on night vision. So you see everything.

Racism in western countries makes it clear that they dislike, hate and hope to keep certain racist down for their own benefit and need. Also I like to incline the reported deaths based on hate and color is higher in western countries. I think I rather be disliked then threaten with violent death...I'll take the xenophobic ideals over Racism anyday","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"Moderate Republicans are plentiful in Congress.

Justice Juan Merchan denied Trump's motion to dismiss the case due to his presidential election victory. The judge said the Republican president-elect may appear for sentencing either in-person or virtually. In Trump's second motion to dismiss the case filed since his May conviction, his defense lawyers argued that having the case hang over him during his presidency would impede his ability to govern. Trump's first motion - which argued the case ran afoul of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity - was unsuccessful. Trump was initially scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, but Merchan pushed that back indefinitely after Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. Prosecutors with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, which brought the case, said there were measures short of the \\"extreme remedy\\" of overturning the jury's verdict that could assuage Trump's concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president. They suggested several options for Merchan, including delaying the sentencing until Trump, 78, leaves the White House in 2029, or guaranteeing a sentence that would not involve prison time. The prosecutors also said the judge could simply terminate the case with a notation that Trump was never sentenced and that his conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed on appeal. They said a similar approach was used in cases where a defendant dies after being convicted but before being sentenced. The case stemmed from a $130,000 payment that Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. The payment was for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she has said she had a decade earlier with Trump, who denies it.","title":"Trump must be sentenced in hush money criminal case on Jan. 10, judge rules"},{"text":"Fat Donny doesn't care if the things he says are true or not.

Trump, who has announced plans to attend Carter's memorial service in Washington on Jan. 9, took issue in a Truth Social post on Friday with the flags remaining in the mourning position during his swearing-in ceremony. \\"The Democrats are all 'giddy' about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at 'half mast' during my Inauguration,\\" Trump said, employing a term frequently used for the lowered position when the flag is on a ship.\\n\\"They think its so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they dont love our Country, they only think about themselves,\\" Trump said. Trump said that due to Carter's death last week the American flag would \\"for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President, be at half mast.\\" \\"Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it. Lets see how it plays out,\\" he said. **White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House had no plans to reconsider the decision.**","title":"Trump complains that US flags will be half-staff on his inauguration day"},{"text":"No, drink your 38,629 varieties of IPA.","title":"Republicans Fail to Elect Speaker on First Vote"},{"text":"Sure I like Trump.

I also think you're using WWII as a template for what WWIII would look like. One huge difference, though, is the economic reliance didn't exist amongst the players in WWII that exist between China and the US.Like here you say:?China has way more manufacturing capability than the USWhat you're looking at is China's output capacity. But what you're missing is China lacks a lot of natural resources and component parts which it has to import in order to take advantage of its manufacturing scale, and a naval blockade alone stops those inputs from coming in.China, in order to be competitive, pegs its currency to the dollar. It holds trillions of dollars in T-bonds in order to make the peg work. On top of that, it holds dollar dominated assets and all of that would be a huge blow.All of international trade uses the dollar - so economic sanctions would make it really hard for China to have a functioning economy. Its internal consumption and purchasing power isn't enough to make up for access to the US and European markets, not even close. This isn't even getting into the loss of international investment.China, for decades, have been trying to de-dollarize the international economy but can't. When you look at what China imports from the US - agriculture, machine and mechanical appliances/equipment, you realize that the whole \\"China dominates manufacturing\\" trope forgets that it's interdependent. The question is it harder to re-vamp in the US or elsewhere, or harder to get a consumer base to sell the things in? What if critical components for the manufacturing can't be imported, is there enough IP knowledge in China to recreate it? How will they feed themselves?We haven't gotten into the fact that the ruling party's entire legitimacy has been placed on perpetual economic growth. That's why the Chinese government subsidize as much as they do - creating entire ghost cities - because they can't stop economic growth.

But both socio-political and economic liberalism are very deep-seated values of the West, and only very few are in direct opposition to those. These liberties are essentially non-racist; it's impossible to combine the ideas of equal rights and racial superiority. Modern interpretations of antiracism and other such stuff miss the basic level of non-racism - for example in every Western nation *racism is a crime*. You must not, by law, discriminate by race. I'm not saying we're perfect in any way, that discrimination doesn't happen because it's illegal. Or that there aren't like systemic racism and such modern concepts. But I am saying the vast majority of people believe in fundamental liberties for all people. Discrimination exists even if it's illegal; but it's illegal because there's widespread acceptance of the idea that discrimination is wrong. The rest, I think, is nuance; for example, what gives you the right to live in the country. Again, it isn't to say it doesn't matter or anything of the sort, but *fundamentally* Western liberal, democratic values are non-racist.In fact, I think almost everyone, perhaps especially the more radical voters (both on the left and the right) are genuinely worried that those liberties are not being fulfilled. Some think the reason is racist oppression, others maybe that immigrants are not participating fairly or whatever. I think either side of that discussion is neither completely correct nor completely wrong. A part of the anti-Islamic sentiment also is for the very reason that Islamic countries / cultures are currently so opposed to Western individual liberalism. The clearest example of this is perhaps how women are viewed/treated. There's discussion here, for example, about Muslim girls being forcibly married (for example, underaged girls are sent to like Iraq to marry some second cousin because the families have decided so) and of course the so-called honor violence.","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"Here we go again","title":"Republicans Fail to Elect Speaker on First Vote"},{"text":"This headline is incorrect.

He managed to win the popular vote, which is wild.And I seriously doubt the Trump voter-base cares all that much about the finer points of the H-1B visa program. If they are not taking your job specifically, and billionaires are telling them the program is good for businesses, that base is probably on-board. So maybe Trump has lost a portion of his engineer voters, but I'm not sure how many of those he had anyways. If you are working a 9-5 close to minimum wage, in the middle of the country, it's going to be tough to get on board with the idea that H-1B visas are hurting you. And I doubt that more than one or two percent of the Trump voters are particularly moved by the idea that the H-1B visa program is like \\"slave\\" labor. It's harder to sympathize with someone who has it better than you do. And even if they feel like they are locked into a company like \\"X\\", and are making below the average salary for their roles, they are still making more than the average American.","title":"Trump Fans Are Finding Out How Much He Actually Cares About Them | Spoiler alert: Its not a lot."},{"text":"Oh look we're rewarding losers again.

A lot of other things he says at face value are wrong or lies. Most people who are paying attention already know that Trump's policy proposals are bullshit and his promises are impossible.  But it's hard to tell people they are being played, gullible, or stupid without sounding condescending. But that's the truth. So how do you tell people that the things they want to believe are wrong?So then you might say, oh well Trump may not be a competent policy-maker but he is a persuasive and inspiring speaker...he talks to and appeals to the common people. But if you say that, then it's hard to ignore that how much of his rhetoric is filled with racism and hate. The claim that the Democrats alienate people is undermined by the fact that Trump literally calls people childish nicknames and makes other baseless accusations about liberals, trans people, immigrants and any other minority group they dislike etc. You can't get more alienating than falsely accusing an entire ethnic group of eating dogs and cats on national television. It's also undermined by the fact that Democrats have actually been pretty bipartisan with the moderate right. The main message of the Democrats has been very clearly that Trump and MAGA is the problem and a threat to democracy...not your \\"everyday\\" conservatives. So much so that it probably hurt their credibility with progressives. The claim that Trump is a unifying figure is of course one of the most absurd lies I have ever heard...he can't even unite his own party behind a house speaker. But obviously Democrats still lost. People wanted change. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people are very low information voters and voted for change without understanding what kind of change they were voting for. Democrats didn't really offer a lot of change.

Their mission is to use communication and influence tactics to shape the opinions and actions of foreign audiences in a way that supports U.S. interests and objectives.  They do this through a variety of methods, sometimes during conflicts and sometimes during peacetime.\\n#\\nImagine them as a team of expert communicators who use carefully crafted messages to persuade people. For instance, during a conflict, they might drop leaflets from airplanes encouraging enemy soldiers to surrender or providing civilians with safety information. They might also set up radio stations broadcasting news and entertainment programs with subtle messages that promote U.S. interests or encourage resistance against hostile forces.\\n#\\nIn today's digital age, the 4th POG also utilizes social media to influence perceptions and behaviors. This could involve creating online campaigns that promote peace and democracy or spread information about humanitarian aid efforts.\\n#\\nIn more traditional settings, they might use loudspeakers from vehicles or aircraft to communicate with local populations, persuade enemy troops to surrender, or provide instructions on how to stay safe.  They might also produce television programs or videos that highlight the positive actions of U.S. forces or counter enemy propaganda.\\n#\\nThe 4th POG also engages in activities that build relationships and foster trust. They might organize cultural events like concerts and sports events to connect with local communities or even participate in negotiations and mediation efforts to reduce conflict and promote peace.\\n#\\nUltimately, the 4th Psychological Operations Group plays a crucial role in achieving U.S. strategic goals by using communication and influence to shape the behavior of foreign audiences.

Heres a summary of their mission:- **Mission**: To conduct psychological operations (PSYOP) to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and individuals in a manner favorable to the United States and its allies.**Example Missions:**1. **Leaflet Drops**: During conflicts, POG units might produce and distribute leaflets over enemy territory. These leaflets could:\\n   - Encourage enemy soldiers to surrender, offering safe passage or rewards.\\n   - Provide information to civilians on how to stay safe during conflict, like instructions to move to safe zones or how to recognize friendly forces.2. **Radio Broadcasts**: \\n   - Setting up radio stations to broadcast messages to influence local populations or enemy forces. This could include:\\n     - News programs that subtly promote U.S. or allied interests.\\n     - Music or entertainment programs interspersed with strategic messages.\\n     - Direct calls for enemy forces to defect or for civilians to resist enemy forces.3. **Social Media Campaigns**: In modern warfare:\\n   - Utilizing social media platforms to influence perceptions and behaviors. Examples include:\\n     - Creating viral campaigns to promote peace, democracy, or resistance against oppressive regimes.\\n     - Disseminating information about humanitarian aid efforts to foster goodwill.4. **Loudspeaker Operations**: \\n   - Using loudspeakers from ground vehicles or aircraft to:\\n     - Persuade enemy troops to surrender or provide information on how to do so safely.\\n     - Communicate with civilians, giving instructions on safety or assistance.5. **Television and Video Content**: \\n   - Producing and broadcasting television programs or videos that:\\n     - Highlight positive actions by coalition forces or the benefits of cooperation with U.S. forces.\\n     - Counter enemy propaganda with factual reporting or by showcasing the failures of the opposing side.6. **Cultural Events**: \\n   - Organizing or supporting cultural events like concerts, art shows, or sports events in conflict zones to:\\n     - Build rapport with local populations.\\n     - Demonstrate the commitment to cultural preservation and peace.7. **Negotiations and Mediation**: \\n   - Sometimes, POG members might engage in direct psychological operations through:\\n     - Negotiating with local leaders or factions to reduce conflict or facilitate humanitarian efforts.\\n     - Mediating between conflicting parties to achieve ceasefires or peace agreements.8. **Training and Support**: \\n   - Training indigenous forces or populations in communication strategies to:\\n     - Help local governments or groups communicate effectively with their people.\\n     - Support the development of media outlets that promote stability and U.S. interests.These examples illustrate how psychological operations can be conducted to support broader military objectives, influence foreign audiences, and contribute to strategic goals without direct combat. Remember, these operations are always conducted within the legal and ethical frameworks set by international law and U.S. military regulations.","title":"Whats in Fort Bragg?"},{"text":"What is disgraceful about bracelets.
