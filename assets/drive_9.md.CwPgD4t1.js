The share of solar power in total production rose from 3.4% in the same period of 2023. There are over 3.2 GW installed in photovoltaic parks in Romania, of which 1.63 GW in industrial parks and 1.61 GW in prosumer capacities, according to the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association quoted by Economedia.ro in July 2024. More will be added in the coming years. The countrys target is 11.1 GW in photovoltaic capacities, of which 6.1 GW in parks and 5GW in rooftop installations, by 2030. However, the share of the total output of green (hydro, wind, and solar) power in total decreased significantly in Romania, to 50.3% in H1 this year from 54.4% in the same period of 2023 in the context of 9.5% y/y lower total electricity output (27.25TWh in H1 this year). The plunge in total and green power output in Romania was driven by the lower amounts delivered by the hydropower plants (mainly Hidroelectrica): -24.1% y/y to 31.7% of the total from 37.7% of the total. The plunge was mainly due to lower debit on the Danube this year.  In H1, Romanias electricity output was close to its consumption after the country exported 9.4% of its production in the same period last year. Total consumption edged up a slim 0.8% y/y to 24.8TWh with similar growth rates in both residential and non-residential segments.!ping ECO&amp;EUROPE","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Stewart Gilligan Griffin","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Im glad conservatives have discovered raw milk, and I hope they drink a lot of it!","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The problem is that if you did that right now by shutting down commercial news media nothing would change except for the most annoying uproar.

Not great. Theres a good few reasons you can point to.Injuries are a big one, I think. WR1 and 2 have been hurt since pretty much the start of the season, I still think were missing some OL starters and our secondary has a few players out. Not a great place to start a season when youre throwing to your WR3 to WR5.Our defence kinda sucks. The line is full of young players and I have confidence that theyll improve over the season, but they cant tackle for shit. Just look at that pick 6 Love threw - that should have been a safety, but instead of tackling him, the DL just fucking shoved him? Our secondary couldnt cover a child, less said about them the better. I think, frankly, this is probably on our new DC, Chris Shula, and so I am dearly hoping hes a one-and-done.The drafts have been good, but 2024 marks the 1st first round pick we have made in eight years and its starting to show. Thats a lot of talent on other teams, and while it got us a Super Bowl, were still paying for it.Ultimately, I think were gonna need to do a sorta-rebuild soon enough, but we at least have some of the pieces in place. DL is sorted for a while with all the young players. Nacua, Corum and Williams make for a decent enough offensive corp - and I hope to be able to add Whittington to that list, he looked good when he played - but our secondary is abysmal, our offensive line needs fresh blood, we could probably do with a better TE and another good receiver. Even then, the question of what after Stafford looms over us.At least we probably have a top 5 pick next year and a proven ability to find talent in the later rounds. Thats a start.!ping NFL","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Sorry, Italian government don't understand \\"longterm\\" or \\"cost-benefit analysis\\".

And when I read a fictional novel or watch a movie, I see truths about humanity embedded within it.

It would greatly expand the number of cases handled by law enforcement and the courts. Proving that someone used a bot in an online forum would also require substantial technical expertise and investigations. Authorities would need to pay for digital forensics experts to trace IP addresses, analyze bot behavior, and link their activity to specific individuals. Backlogged courts already lead to delays in all types of cases. Adding a large number of bot-related offenses to the docket would mean longer waiting times for everyone seeking justice.

If the people at the top get a break then it will trickle down to the common folk in savings at the grocery store, gas pump etc.  That may have been the case back in the 80s when not everything was owned by just a few megacorporation.  Now companies have no reason to lower prices because there is virtually no competition.  When you have the top 2 or three businesses owned by the same megacorporation in every category thats the very definition of monopoly.  Sure the FTC can step in and try to do something about it but theyre about as effect as a gnat trying to stop a dam wall from breaking. What winds up happening is these companies and billionaires take these tax breaks.  Then they RAISE prices.  They have to raise prices to keep posting record profits each year to appease their stakeholders.  Any profit that is not higher than the last year's is seen as a failure of the company even though they are posting new record profits every quarter.  We saw this especially during covid and the years following it.  All these companies got loans and breaks from the government but kept prices high.  Trickle down economics doesn't work and I'm not sure it ever has.  Its basically like communism.  It sounds good on paper.  Everyone has their basic needs met.

Wealth inequality is an absolutely useless stat that can be caused by positive and negative circumstances: everyone becoming richer but at different rates which is good universally (also where we are) can both widen and narrow the gap, everyone becoming poorer at different rates which is universally bad can also expand or shrink the gap, and the top and the bottom moving counter to each other can also do the same and can be good or bad.

Even when factoring in the extremely unlikely event that she'd be able to increase corporate tax rates given that the Senate may very well go 51-49 in favor of the GOP, considering what competitive seats are up for grabs.If she extends those tax cuts for those making under $400k, her plan will increase the deficit by $1.5-2.6 trillion in the next decade.    Whereas, if she lets them expire, we make net revenue year over year, even when factoring in various cuts and credits she's hinted at giving.  Essentially, letting the cuts expire will take more money from the \\"middle\\" and \\"upper middle\\" class (nevermind that those distinctions are nonsensical in and of themselves) than she wants to give back.Therefore, extending the cuts while she wants to do everything she says is stupidity of the highest magnitude and is likely to scuttle her career.  She's not extending the cuts; not when they make her own agenda harder to pass and fund.  This is *only* factoring in her tax plan, she also plans to expand government spending a fair deal, which means that her *tax plan alone* increasing the deficit like this would balloon the deficit tremendously when factoring everything else.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk speaking at a Trump Rally in PA is the greatest gift you could possibly give to the Democratic Party."},{"text":"Aww that ol cognitive dissonance is really doing a number on you huh?","title":"Canadians three times more positive about Kamala Harris than Donald Trump, survey says"},{"text":"Bemusement aside, that possibility presents a MASSIVE LIABILITY!!","title":"Kamala Harris teleprompter goes out and its brutal as she tries to talk on her own"},{"text":"Not in the primaries she didnt get any..","title":"Kamala Harris hits back at childless attacks on Call Her Daddy podcast: This is not the 1950s anymore"},{"text":"I guess she has been skipping her whole career then, because anything unscripted is repetitive word salad!

Certain items or services may be increasing much higher in certain states/regions due to other factors that you might not be accounting for. For examples, all of my utility bills (electricity, gas, water) are the same now as theyve always been for the past 10 years or so with the exception of my internet billit increased by over 40% earlier this year after Congress failed to reauthorize the Affordable Connectivity Plan that gave people under a certain income level a discount on their internet service. And as far as groceries go, I have been shopping the same grocery store for 20+ years and have been using their app for at least the last 10, so its very easy for me to go back and look at prices I was paying at a certain point vs now. The price of *most* groceries have definitely increased since the pandemic (meat, prepackaged/prepared foods like cereal, frozen foods, chips/snacks, soda, toiletries/paper towels, pet food/treats), while a few have stayed the same (milk, produce, eggs). There are certain things that I just dont buy anymore because theyve increased so much, like ground beef. I used to be able to buy a 3 lb package of it for $11.99, but now its $17.99Cthats a 50% increase.Interestingly enough, that grocery store chain that Ive shopped at for the past 20+ years (Kroger) is in the midst of a federal lawsuit from the FTC to block them from a planned merger with Albertsons. In a deposition given by the CEO of Kroger, he admitted both that inflation is always good for a business like theirs, and that they had kept prices artificially high during and after the pandemic strictly to increase their profits and make their shareholders happy. Both their and Albertsons profits have grown exponentially over the past several years, despite Albertsons claiming it needed the merger because it was struggling financially. The spokespeople for both companies have claimed that the merger will result in lower prices for consumers, but in testimony the Kroger CEO also admitted that those \\"lower prices\\" will be higher than they would be if they dont complete the merger, and also threatened that they would have to raise prices if the government continued their lawsuit in order to cover their increased legal bills. So basically, the increased prices at the grocery storesat least for the store I shop athas nothing to do with the government and everything to do with corporate greed.","title":"CMV: People are letting Politics and Social Media ruin a pretty good economic run"},{"text":"If you want to be honest, you should admit he wants to cut taxes for everyone.

For the U.S. semiconductor industry to flourish in the long-term, it must be able to develop innovative and commercially competitive technologies to sustainably produce materials and manufacture chips in a way that protects the environment and local communities. To accomplish this, CHIPS for America anticipates up to $100 million in funding to award recipients that develop university-led, industry-informed, collaborations about artificial intelligence-powered autonomous experimentation (AI/AE) relevant to sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The full text of the NOI can be found here.  \\n...  \\nAI/AE has emerged as a potentially game-changing approach to accelerating materials research and development. AI/AE combines automated synthesis and characterization tools with an AI planner to determine the next round of an experimental campaign, vastly accelerating the design of new materials and the acquisition of materials data. In enabling federated research across multiple locations, AI/AE can create opportunities for collaborations across established research universities, emerging research institutions, industry, and national laboratories.CHIPS for America C with its programs spanning manufacturing incentives and multiple areas of research and development C is uniquely positioned to work with stakeholders across federal, state, and local government, industry, academia and research institutions, labor unions, and environmental groups to investigate, commercialize, and advance solutions in this space. Addressing sustainability challenges also presents an opportunity to better engage universities, including emerging research institutions, to conduct high-impact semiconductor R&amp;D and to grow semiconductor research talent.  \\n...  \\nThrough this anticipated funding opportunity, CHIPS for America will support the sustainability of the U.S. semiconductor industry while recognizing the ongoing demand for improving microelectronics power, performance, area, and cost metrics. The competition will also aim to expand the participation of universities, including emerging research institutions, and their graduates in the semiconductor research and development (R&amp;D) ecosystem. The notice of funding opportunity is expected to be released later this year.Statement fromU.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo:Right now, new semiconductor materials often take years to be production-ready and are incredibly resource-intensive. If were going to quickly build up Americas semiconductor manufacturing base, in a way thats sustainable over the long term in the face of increasing threats from the climate crisis, we need to leverage AI to help develop sustainable material processes quickly. With this new program, the Biden-Harris Administration will harness the vast capabilities of AI to unleash the full potential of our workers and innovators, while building a more secure and enduring domestic semiconductor industry, said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration to Invest up to $100 Million to Accelerate R&amp;D and AI Technologies for Sustainable Semiconductor Materials | Expected Investment Builds on CHIPS for Americas Sustainability Commitments to Workers, Stakeholders, and Industry"},{"text":"Just because it's not clear to me that people in the thread don't know this. Nobody has ever voted explicitly against funding FEMA emergency services. On september 25th, some republicans did vote against a continuing resolution spending bill, which would fund the government between september 30th and december 20th 2024. The approved $20B for FEMA emergency funding for this period represents approximately 1.18% of the estimated 1.7 trillion approved for those 3 months. The actually interesting thing here if we're focusing on FEMA specifically is that at some point a supplementary $10B for FEMA emergency funding was in the bill but was removed before a vote. I can find quotes of both republicans and democrats complaining about this removal but i cannot find anybody on record explaining the removal. If anybody can find that I'd appreciate it. Being specific about who did what why can be very helpful when explaining why things happen. Any republican hearing \\"they voted against fema funding\\" because of a no vote in a 1.7T ongoing resolution knows that opinion is worthless, but hearing that \\"senator x\\" insisted on removal of an additional 0.6% in spending to fund necessary disaster relief during hurricane helene may actually vote against senator x.","title":"Why Biden"},{"text":"All carrot, no stick.

Gore*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore)? Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), was a landmark decision of **the United States Supreme Court** on December 12, 2000, that settled a recount dispute in Florida's 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. On December 8, the Florida Supreme Court had ordered a statewide recount of all undervotes, over 61,000 ballots that the vote tabulation machines had missed. The Bush campaign immediately asked the **U.S. Supreme Court** to stay the decision and halt the recount. Justice Antonin Scalia, contending that all the manual recounts being performed in Florida's counties were illegitimate, urged his colleagues to grant the stay immediately. On December 9, the five conservative justices on the Court granted the stay, with Scalia citing \\"irreparable harm\\" that could befall Bush, as the recounts would cast \\"a needless and unjustified cloud\\" over Bush's legitimacy. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that \\"counting every legally cast vote cannot constitute irreparable harm.\\" Oral arguments were scheduled for December 11. In a 5C4 per curiam decision, the Court ruled, strictly on equal protection grounds, that the recount be stopped. Specifically, it held that the use of different standards of counting in different counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution; the case had also been argued on Article II jurisdictional grounds, which found favor with only Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and William Rehnquist.And why was that a big deal? Because - The Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore was among the most controversial in U.S. history, as it allowed Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris's vote certification to stand, giving Bush Florida's 25 electoral votes. Florida's votes gave Bush, the Republican nominee, 271 electoral votes, one more than the 270 required to win the Electoral College. This meant the defeat of Democratic candidate Al Gore, who received 266 electoral votes. Media organizations later analyzed the ballots and found that, under specified criteria, the original, limited recount of undervotes of several large counties would have resulted in a Bush victory, though **a statewide recount would have shown that Gore received the most votes**, according to the Florida Ballot Project. Florida later retired the punch-card voting machines that produced the ballots disputed in the case.","title":"Democrats demand answers on Alitos removal from Supreme Court Jan. 6 opinion"},{"text":"I quite respect you for that.

Keep in mind that they don't offer benefits such as a 401k plan and insurance. A part-time job means you're barely surviving financially if no one else is helping you. The number of full-time jobs are decreasing and that's very concerning when most of them are being automated or outsourced so businesses can pay less.Wage increases are in certain sectors. This has nothing to do with everyone else receiving \\"a pay raise.\\" How much? Is it enough to keep up with inflation? If not, then this is barely a positive.Interest rates are still pretty high compared to 5 years ago. That means business, auto, and mortgage loans are paying huge on interest along with the principal. Interest rates were near 0 before Biden took office.Housing affordability is at an all-time low. Home prices are well over double in value, and it's becoming much more difficult to buy one. Also, rent will keep on increasing and a lot of tenants are being priced out. We have so much debt that it's insane. Our debt keeps on increasing in the trillions and credit card debt is over 1 trillion. Besides for upper-middle class and the top 1%, most people are doing pretty bad and are struggling.It's pretty clear that \\"politics\\" and \\"social media\\" aren't warping reality.

While he was president, Trump was hesitant to send aid to areas where people voted against him, such as wildfire-stricken California, according to two former White House staffers.Mark Harvey, Trumps senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council, who said that Trump didnt want to send wildfire aid to California in 2018 because the state voted Democratic. But after Harvey showed him voting data from Orange County, California, showing more Trump supporters there than in all of Iowa, Trump changed his mind.We went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas  to show him these are people who voted for you, Harvey, who recently endorsed Kamala Harris along with other?GOP national security figures.Former White House Homeland Security adviser Oliva Troye concurred, saying that she would field calls from local politicians around the country asking for disaster relief because Trump refused to provide aid, leading her to frequently ask Vice President Mike Pence to pressure the president. She warned that Trump will play politics with disaster aid again if he returns to the White House.Its not going to be about that American voter out there who isnt even really paying attention to politics, and their house is gone, and the president of the United States is judging them for how they voted, and they didnt even vote, Troye said.Trump eagerly sent aid to Florida in 2019 after Hurricane Michael hit the states Panhandle, according to Florida Governor Ron DeSantiss autobiography,?The Courage to Be Free.?They\\nlove me in the Panhandle, Trump told DeSantis after he asked for federal assistance.I must have won 90 percent of the vote out there.

They see this as a long term solution to a 4 decade old problem caused by Reagan and Clinton (admittedly many are confused on which of these two are to blame but its both).

Obama &amp; Clinton were clearly more successful presidents by any measure. And Obama absolutely had more of an impact on policy &amp; the country than Biden did. Bidens biggest achievements were a couple of deficit financed bills in a time of inflation and high interest rates so taking out trillions in new debt while interest rates are at multi decade highs. Great achievement. And there is not much he leaves behind like the ACA or the TCJA or Medicare part D, etc.","title":"CMV: Joe Biden will go down in history as the best democratic president since LBJ"},{"text":"Pennsylvania!

Some of this can be attributed to integration into larger American society. The 2nd, 3rd generation Hispanics dont really have connections with their ancestral countries and are not going to care as much about deporting migrants, etc. etc. Mike Madrid is an excellent writer about these topics. Also, the wider public messaging and adoption of socially progressive issues by the Democratic Party has probably alienated some of these socially conservative voters as well.

They might abstain from voting for Trump, but only because they dont like him as a person, not because they disagree with his reactionary stances.  The fact that both Haley and Trump arguably represent the exact same policy is concerning, because it implies a largely-calcified conservative electorate.  This is proof that the predicted fragmentation of the GOP in the post-Trump era is a fantasy, and that reactionary policies will continue to dominate.Critically, this also forces the Democratic Party further to the right.  If Harris wins on the backs of a few split-ticket Republican voters, shell have every incentive to avoid any major progressive policies (like voting rights reform, substantive tax increases, or Medicare for All), to try and maintain what effectively amounts to a net centrist voter coalition.  While this may not seem significant, it runs a serious risk of alienating a large fraction of the left-wing base, which could incite a potential Bernie-esque progressive challenger in the 2028 primaries.Just seems short-sighted, and itll be hard to draw enthusiasm in 2028 without Trump and (hopefully!) abortion on the ballot.","title":"Kamala Harris Rally Crowd Cheers Mike Pence, Dick Cheney"},{"text":"Politicizing a disaster is like the 20th lowest thing to which hell stoop to win.","title":"North Carolinas second-largest newspaper condemns Trump for ridiculous Helene response falsehoods"},{"text":"I'm looking forward to her loss this year.

Which *completely* ignores all the work done in political science and political philosophy on nationalism by people like [Benedict Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_Communities), [Ernest Gellner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gellner%27s_theory_of_nationalism)[Azar Gat](https://www.amazon.com/Nations-History-Political-Ethnicity-Nationalism/dp/1107400023), [Richard Rorty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achieving_Our_Country) and so many more. Nationalism is more than just the prelude to the World Wars - it's also a part of the French and American Revolutions, the decolonisation movements, the 1848 'Spring of Nations' and most recently Ukraine's resistance against Russia. This is not to totally defend or glaze over nationalism (I actually don't consider myself a nationalist). Even this more nuanced conception has its own issues and pitfalls, as many authors acknowledge and explore (and some have even tried to deal with them). But it is a more complex idea than so many of its popular liberal/left-wing Western detractors paint it as, and also one more important to people and thus worth taking seriously, imo.","title":"The Power of Liberal Nationalism C \\"If they are to successfully defend democracy in multiethnic societies, liberals must stop conflating nationalism with nativism and ethnonationalism, seize the flag, and arm themselves with emotionally compelling national-democratic narratives.\\""},{"text":"Every time I hear this theory, i can't help but think the logic goes something like this -   \\n\\"Hey, you know all that evil shit we did?

Not to mention I havent heard her doing away with any of the programs already in place? Maybe I need to be caught up. Im just not seeing her divergence from the status quo from Dems alongside her continued statements of wanting to support the middle class, canceling debt will do that. Ive not heard the arguments against the subsidy and for first time home buyers alongside supporting getting corporations out of the home buying spree seem like good initiatives but may harm home owners if / when prices drop. Happy to hear why the $25k is bad tho. I do agree we need to balance the budget but we havent had one of those since Clinton lol with the corporate tax increase, wealth tax on unrealized gains (which I believe shouldnt be taxed unless used to secure a loan or other liquid asset as at that moment it becomes realized), alongside the bottom up middle out growth of the economy I would imagine we would see an increase in tax revenue from a growing robust economy.

For example, despite strong support for Catholicism, same-sex marriage has been legalized in most of Latin America. Another aspect in Trumps strong showing among Latinos is the Covid stimulus checks, which he delayed so as to get his signature on them. Among low-information voters, the belief persists that Trump personally helped them out.

Next is student loan aid, I think paying 10,000 dollars to me is nonsense. This is coming from someone with 80,000 in loans from my masters program. I think the best way would be the SAVE program that Biden implemented to help borrowers. Spending 380 billion to help college graduates (40% of the adult population) is unfair and a tax on the remaining 60%. Next is the $25,000 dollar tax credit, if youre on this sub you know subsidies are hardly helpful in this case. This is a supply issue and democrats have to stop this carrot and carrot methodology implementing their policies. If cities dont restructure their zoning code then punish them. Stop handing out billions in free money when were 2+ trillion in deficit every year. What I do support is a government option which both Kamala and Biden abandoned. The child tax credit, the promotion of a 50,000 dollar business tax credit for small owners, and promoting more housing supply through tax credits. As liberal as Obama was he never solved every problem with more deficit spending. He was willing to bend his policies to support a somewhat balanced budget.

All that needed to happen was Netanyahu needed to agree to it. But he didnt. So here we are.Its not Biden and Harriss fault that Netanyahu is a piece of shit. Hes the Israeli version of Trump.

Yeah, theres no promise not to mass deport, but its definitely a trend in Hispanic support for Trump that they think theyre not the ones Trump is out to get, it must be some other group. Even with some deportations, the other factors (social conservatism, opposition to abortion, association of Democrats with socialism etc) lead communities to an uneasy cognitive dissonance. A similar case is the Iraqi Christians in Michigan who supported Trump, and though they were dismayed [their relatives were deported anyway](https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/iraqi-christians-face-deportation-conned-trump), also [continue to support Trump](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/despite-deportation-campaign-michigan-iraqi-christians-still-backing-trump). The promised deportation target of 10 million will definitely shake things up.\\n2. I think the Trump campaign has laid out the path to mass deportations more clearly. By making it an explicit campaign promise (its also in the Agenda 47 that Trump points to as his real plan and not just Project 2025), he can claim that the American people have voted for it. So that will make it very hard for civil society to force him to U-turn on it, unlike his family separation policy which he backed down on. Project 2025 outlines ways in which the Trump executive branch can become much more powerful and facilitate mass deportations without much hope of legislative or judicial oversight.https://preview.redd.it/6rfaphqsa8td1.jpeg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db441e2fe6dd44e38df92eea3558f6e58e8132e5","title":"The Democrats Hispanic Voter Problem Deepens"},{"text":"Americans' obsession with \\"independent\\" labels continues to be moronic.","title":"GOP looks to avoid disaster in Nebraska Senate race"},{"text":"Investing for the sake of down ballot races is fine (including the state legislature to stop a GOP supermajority) but my point it to not pin your hopes on Nebraska senate flipping when senate seats in OH, MT, TX and FL are much more determinative","title":"GOP looks to avoid disaster in Nebraska Senate race"},{"text":"They may be,  but my guess is that those folks in Appalachia will make sure to get out to vote.","title":"Are Dems Slow-Walking Hurricane Relief To Suppress GOP Votes?"},{"text":"It looks like LBJ was responsible for a lot of mass slaughter in Vietnam.

I imagine the thinking there is that even *cats* hate 'liberal cat ladies' so they want Trump to win so they can be liberated? whatever.This lady had been in the waiting room for five minutes before she started loudly huffing. She got up and started stomping around and muttering to herself at 8 minutes. At 10 minutes she groaned and grouched her way up to the front desk to yell at the people there, slamming her hand down on the counter part. When that didn't work she whipped her phone out and loudly complained about the terrible service. When *that* didn't work she dramatically threw herself onto a chair and made loud, woe-is-me sighs for the next twenty minutes before getting up and Karening her ass back to the front desk again.Whatever she yelled about got her handed something, and she was instantly all smiles and soft words, profuse thank you, complete 180 on behavior. I fear if she's anyone's Mother-in-Law.Intellectually I know not all Trump supporters act like this but this was exactly what I picture them acting as, all day every day, if given the chance to be around strangers who won't run and tell on them to their Pastor, or something.

It would be too late to replace him on ballots, many Trump voters wouldnt switch to another Republican, and the Republican Party would be rudderless at the worst possible time. - The Biden administration brokers a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, freeing the hostages and allowing aid to flow into Gaza. - One or more conservative Supreme Court justices dies, boosting Democratic turnout across many states.

I genuinely don't know where people are getting this idea from that nationalism just means \\"liking your country\\", I mean maybe it *can* mean that, but that's such an expansive definition it's virtually meaningless, the vast majority of the world to some extent identifies with and likes their country.

His administration keeps trying to shift the blame with ridiculous lies about corporate greed causing shrinkflation, his two biggest bogeymen. As far as foreign policy goes, he's on the right side of things but has felt largely ineffectual. Like it or not, having multiple wars start on his watch after his predecessor saw none is not a good look, especially when he keeps backtracking on promises not to escalate.Finally, he seems to have a serious problem with freedom of speech, and has gone to significant lengths to suppress it, everything from direct collusion with social media companies to jailing people for memes to an ill-fated disinformation board.

Democrats might also start thinking how much them believing to have the BIPOC vote guaranteed for several decades was just as a result of them being in the process of actually stepping into mainstream American society after gaining full civil rights.

This drives up the deficit, and in the short term can boost the economy. While in the office, republicans tend to not say much about the deficit, they tend to raise the debt ceiling without making a fuss about it, and they write tax cuts that will expire after they leave office, that wont be renewed by Dems if they win the election. This drives inflation and make Dems look terrible. When Dems are in office, republicans decry the spending and welfare state and bash the democrats for raising taxes, even though Dems tend to leave the office with reduced debt, and a healthier economy. During Democratic tenure in office, the republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling, to the point of shutting down the government to get their way and make democrats look bad. It is a terrible strategy for our economy, but it wins elections for republicans and widens the wealth gap by making taxes lower for the wealthy, freeing up assets for big businesses to buy, and effectively placing the blame on democrats. http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/thom-hartmann/two-santas-strategy-gop-used-economic-scam-manipulate-americans-40-years/","title":"CMV: Trump is literally going to ruin democracy"},{"text":"Carter absolutely lived his convictions.He was not a good President.","title":"CMV: Joe Biden will go down in history as the best democratic president since LBJ"},{"text":"if it's worth anything I thought similarly about myself, and it was a bit of a learning process to apply a filter to what I'm saying but was well worth ityou'd be surprised how combative some conversations can get (only if you want them to be) when arguing with Trump supporters.Tbh it's probably not a good use of time but I want someone to prove that there are reasonable ones out there","title":"And the Dems will stop promoting protectionism inshallah"},{"text":"Also, from what we recently learned from Katrina, are willing to use a disaster to take away your rights.","title":"Are Dems Slow-Walking Hurricane Relief To Suppress GOP Votes?"},{"text":"Yep.

This is their explanation for why democrats do better than expected in off-year elections: Trump isn't on the ticket! But when Trump's there, everything's different. So they build it into their models. The polls assume it.It's absolutely correct that Trump did inspire huge red turnout in both 2016 and 2020, despite tepid enthusiasm among a lot of GOP voters. But it certainly seems to me that there's a big, big psychological difference between turning out for him twice and turning out for him three times, and there's a huge psychological difference between turning out for him after he won and turning out for him after he lost. (There's also a case to be made that both 2016 and 2020 were weird. The big 2016 GOP turnout was fervent anti-Hilary rather than pro-Trump, and in 2020, everything was so exaggerated and enflamed, the whole country was frenzying.)  \\nRemember that MAGA is a minority within republican voters. A large chunk of GOP voters outright loathe him. Earlier they might have held their nose and voted for him anyway (many to get rid of Roe, which is gone now), but I think it's very hasty to just assume it'll happen again in the same numbers. And for the \\"normie\\" GOP voters, the people who sorta care but sorta don't? I just don't see much motivating them to actually get out to the polls.  \\nRemember that politics and polling and media people were absolutely traumatized by 2016.

That's kind of part of a president's job, and Biden did that. Meanwhile, corporate profits are at an all-time high, and stock buybacks have increased.

The surveillance programs he revealed were authorized under laws like the Patriot Act and reviewed by the FISA courts, ensuring they operated within a legal framework designed to protect national security. These programs targeted metadata, not content, which doesnt fall under traditional 4th Amendment protections. While some courts have raised concerns about specific practices, there is no definitive legal consensus, and national security must take priority when defending against terrorism.While I understand the argument that Snowden highlighted important privacy concerns, I strongly oppose the idea of labeling him a hero. His decision to unilaterally reveal classified information was not only illegal but also selfish and arrogant. By acting outside of established democratic processeswithout consulting Congress or the American peopleSnowden placed his own judgment above that of the elected representatives and legal institutions tasked with balancing national security and civil liberties. This kind of behavior is fundamentally undemocratic and contrary to the principles of American governance, where no single individual should assume the right to decide what is in the publics best interest.Moreover, his actions endangered national security, compromised intelligence efforts, and aided our adversaries. True heroes work within the system to enact positive change without jeopardizing lives or national securitySnowdens actions did the opposite.His choice to seek asylum in Russiaa country with a poor record on human rightsraises further questions about his motives. If Snowden were truly committed to freedom and transparency, why would he choose to live in a nation known for suppressing dissent and restricting personal liberties? This decision undermines his narrative and suggests that self-interest, rather than pure altruism, may have influenced his actions.","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"I am Canadian so it is a bit different here, but the economy is also doing great today, but the average Candians and those poorer than him are definitely doing worse than they were doing a few years ago.

The reason why is because the US does not manufacture the overwhelming majority of things we consume. Your clothing? Your electronics? Your kitchen appliances? A sizable portion of the food in stores? The semiconductors we put in cars or appliances? The Phone Im using to type this very comment?All manufactured overseas, and therefore subject to Trumps proposed 20% tariffs. For the average consumer, the amount of tax they save through lower taxes will not outweigh the amount that their costs at the store or online shoot up by. This is also where the argument that tax cuts are designed to benefit corporations and the wealthy comes in As an example, Elon Musk makes about $200 million in one month JUST from the income he gets paid to him, so about $2.4 billion per year (not including asset sales, capital gains, property taxes, etc.).  For a single tax filer, any earned income over $609,350 is taxed at the current highest bracket rate of 37%. To make the math easier, by taking $2.4 billion and putting against the full 0.37 tax rate, and you get a tax bill of about  $888 Million. Decrease that tax rate by even just 1%, and that tax bill drops to $864 Million, which equals a saved amount of $24 Million in cash that wouldve otherwise gone to taxes. (Again, this is just on his earned income from his businesses no other form of tax is included, nor are deductions being included). The average American household saved about $5,000.00 from Trumps tax cuts. On even just a 1% decrease to the top income bracket rate (which wouldnt even impact the overwhelming majority of Americans anyways) Elon Musk would save an extra $24 Million in cash. Who really benefits?","title":"CMV: Elon Musk speaking at a Trump Rally in PA is the greatest gift you could possibly give to the Democratic Party."},{"text":"The issue is that you're comparing existing countries to some kind of platonic ideal that doesn't exist.

The Recovery Act in 09 opened up CRAZY subsidies for solar and wind, but not\\nnuclear. This artificially deflated the cost of solar and wind and allowed them to connect to the grid, with backup provided by natural gas, which was in the midst of its first fracking boom.The [head of GE](https://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2011/04/08/the-unholy-marriage-of-ge-and-president-obama-at-the-altar-of-industrial-policy/) sat on Obamas economic council that helped to craft the Recovery Act. GE sells large gas turbines. And they knew that for every watt of wind and solar a developer puts on a grid, there had to be 4 watts of traditional, dispatchable generation (like natural gas) behind it. The GOP may have started deregulation of the electric markets in the 80s, but the Democrats have run with it to more-or-less force traditional utilities into an electric market called either Independent System Operators (ISOs) or Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).The ISOs/RTOs conduct market auctions for their areas to procure generation resources to then be placed in the dispatch queue for use by customers. There are no rules or weights assigned to how reliable or unreliable a source may be; it is based purely on their bid price.With Obamas artificially cheap renewables and natural gas being cheap, and the significantly added regulations that nuclear has that no other source has, renewables and gas started beating perfectly good nuke plants in the market auctions, despite their not great reliability during winter and extended periods of bad weather. And without a power purchase agreement in place for these nuke plants, they had no customers and were forced to close.The renewazealots use this claim to say renewables are so much cheaper than nuke! On a perfectly sunny 80 degree day with not a cloud in sight and brand new panels, yeah, thats true. But the second the weather turns foul, it shuts off and drops like a rock, which skyrockets electric prices.And neither Obama, nor Biden, nor Harris, nor Walz have done or are proposing to do anything to fix the market rules that led to this problem in the first place.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Bringing Back Clean Nuclear Energy, Creating Clean Energy Union Jobs Across the Midwest"},{"text":"This is all because they don't want to look bad when Trump does it again.

A lot of people like their city for its unique culture and history, they're proud of it, but rarely do they think their city should inherently be independent and sovereign and a hard line be drawn between people of that city and people of other places, and that there should be some kind of complex citizenship process to become a 'true' resident of your city. They don't think their family should be subject to its own laws and other families different laws, or that their religion should have its own laws (well ok, quite a few religious extremists around the world do think so, but we tend to view that as bad). I think it's unique that it's the consensus that the nation is special and more important than other things, and this is where we draw the line.","title":"The Power of Liberal Nationalism C \\"If they are to successfully defend democracy in multiethnic societies, liberals must stop conflating nationalism with nativism and ethnonationalism, seize the flag, and arm themselves with emotionally compelling national-democratic narratives.\\""},{"text":"Idiots will still believe it and talking about it weeks from now.","title":"Right-Wingers Heartbroken by Picture of Little Girl Who Doesnt Exist | \\nAn AI-generated image has been used to attack the Biden-Harris administration over its response to Hurricane Helene"},{"text":"The cheapest gallon where I live is 9 lol.","title":"CMV: People are letting Politics and Social Media ruin a pretty good economic run"},{"text":"You got a source for this claim hoss?

Now the left will claim the elections got stolen. Ingerson Lockwood's 1896 novel about the last US president comes to mind and a character called Baron Trump.Why would they have invested so much in building a character that personifies the worst of the US such as greed. And at the same time the opposition pushes for what the left hand of the beast wants, open borders, inflation, rise in crimes. So maybe it goes the other way?A terrorist attack on US soil blamed on Iranian operatives that slipped inside the nation due to Biden /Kamala open borders. But perhaps it was orchestrated by Israel all along to get the US to bomb Iran, remember 9/11 and USS Liberty.In the end martial law is brought to the US and war in the middle east escalates. Meanwhile China, Russia and NK misbehave. WW3 seems inevitable. maybe some nukes are launched.Then the aliens arrive and rapture, I mean abduct most Christians that believe in this doctrine, not to take them to heaven but to eat them.

And its worth reading on to fully understand why.Posting what follows is apparently enough to get you banned on worldnews. When are people going to wake up to the scale of our ongoing problem? The people complaining about censorship seem to be doing a lot of the attempted censoringTLDR version: Support Israel. Youre supporting Liberalism around the world and the citizens of Gaza that are committed to peace when you do.Here is the long version:This is a good time to be grateful to be a US citizen or otherwise living long distances away from large concentrations of people that hold beliefs that lead them down the path of taking waging jihad on as their sincere life project. Every mile buys a measure of safety.People wonder why Mossad and the IDF are so incredibly capable and the US spends so much money arming them. Look at who their nextdoor neighbors are. Look at their neighbors patterns of behavior and look at the things they say and do around the world. These are very persistent folks.Necessity is the mother of invention. Look at what the US and Israel invent - Iron Dome. A shield for civilians that launches defensive missiles to protect civilians at significant cost to them as taxpayers. Look at what Israels neighbors invent. Tunnels under civilians to use them as shields for their leaders.What possible necessity are some of these people providing for that justifies their very specific types of inventions? There are plenty of good people that will remain very committed to the protect and defend mission regardless of cost - it is a necessity. But what are we going to do about the problem that is making us all work this hard for, spend so much money on, and sacrifice so much for?And why isnt it obvious to everyone that if Sinwar were a good guy hed be up waving a white flag over his head to every news station he could find? Thats what a good guy does if he is surrounded like this. He would have done it a long time ago. He could stop Netanyahu in his tracks in an instant, and yet he seems incapable of doing the only obvious thing to do? Who else hid in a bunker like this? Who was his enemy? And what was he trying to do?This is getting beyond concerning that people cant seem to see that. It is very fortunate Israel is capable of defending itself and has the US as the worlds closest neighbor no matter the distance in miles. These people are very persistent at exploiting vulnerabilities But fortunately it looks like they will never be persistent enough.No one is trying to start a regional war on the good guy team. That isnt anyones grand aspiration or project. But it may not be avoidable forever. Thats just reality when confronted with this particular situation. We do our absolute best to make the most of a terrible hand others dealt. Netanyahu is a very imperfect man, but his moral clarity, eloquence, and decisiveness are unbelievable attributes for Israel in this moment.Fortunately, this time - Netanyahu is Churchill, the US is France, and the initial invasion only claimed 1,200 lives. There is very regrettably a serious problem in Europe with Ukraine under invasion from Russia, but thank God for NATO. Nothing like a bit of self-interest to keep Europe in the gameIts time to wake up here people. Liberalism is under threat everywhere you look. All it takes to beat it back is for the world to back Israel in this moment. Theyre not going to go crazy. They are the only people Id trust not to abuse the kind of power they hold in this moment - they are the survivors of the holocaust. That teaches you things about life.I apologize for the long rant, but this is truly getting absurd. France is asking to stop arming Israel now? Were back to Vichy government days while Britain has another Chamberlain moment.This stuff matters. Life matters. Freedom matters. We need to take the reminder, set down our distractions, and do it with much less violence this time. The Jews are leading the way. This is our chance to finally trust and do right by them. This is how you pay them back - by letting them save you.Most selfish people in the world? Try most generous.All they want, and all they have ever wanted, is to live in peace with their neighbors. Why is this so hard for us to see? We really need to address that problem.Please feel free to share this, its exactly what the bad guys dont want to have happen.To the all the Israelis, Jews, Palestinians, Lebanese, Yemenis, Iranians, Christians, other Muslims, and many others committed to the causes of liberty, security, and liberalism around the world: Aleichem shalom.

DOE,?through its Loan Programs Office?(LPO), announced the closing of a loan guarantee of up to $1.52 billion under the Inflation Reduction Acts Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment?(EIR) program to Holtec Palisades to help?finance the restoration and resumption of service of an 800-MW nuclear generating station in Covert Township, Michigan. This represents a first of a kind effort by DOE to restart an American nuclear power plantgenerating carbon pollution-free energy and saving and expanding a union workforce in Michigan while helping strengthen Americas nuclear energy sector and advance core climate and domestic energy goals. The USDA also announced more than $1.3 billion in Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program awards for two rural electric cooperativesCCWolverine Power Cooperative and Hoosier EnergyCCto reduce the cost of electricity passed on to their members for clean power from Holtec Palisades and other clean energy sources. These awards reinforce the Administrations approach to achieving widespread deployment of advanced nuclear as described in the updated Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Advanced Nuclear report, also just announced by DOE, as well as supporting a more prosperous future for rural communities by accelerating the transition to clean energy, keeping monthly bills low for American families, and investing in a strong rural workforce.  \\n...  \\nThe Palisades Nuclear Plant, which ceased operations in May 2022, will be brought back online and upgraded to produce clean baseload power until at least 2051, subject to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing approvals. The NRC also issued new guidance to ensure the restart is performed safely and to high standards. Once complete, this project will be the first recommissioning of a retired nuclear power plant in U.S. historyunderscoring President Biden and Vice President Harris deep commitment to retaining and creating clean power jobs and advancing the U.S. nuclear industry while tackling the climate crisis and helping to achieve our domestic greenhouse gas reduction goals.  \\n...  \\nThe restart of Holtec Palisades is projected to create or retain up to 600 high-quality jobs in MichiganCCmany of them filled by workers who have been at the plant for more than 20 yearsCCwith approximately 45% of the workforce at the site being good-paying union labor upon restart.?In addition to the workers supported by the facilitys restart, the loan guarantee will support more than 1,000 jobs during the facilitys regularly scheduled refueling and maintenance periods every 18 months. Holtec Palisades has a project labor agreement in place with 15 trade unions that are supporting the project.  In addition, the plant restart will also help fight the climate crisis with an anticipated 4.47 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions avoided per year for a total of 111 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions during the projected 25 years of operationsan amount roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of 882,000 homes. Reducing fossil fuel-based electricity generation also reduces other harmful pollution that is often released during the process and can cause or contribute to local health impacts.  Once operational, the Palisades Nuclear Plant will provide reliable, clean firm power generation around-the-clock with zero emissionsCCa vital addition to Midcontinent Independent System Operators (MISO) resource mix as coal plants are retired. Holtec Palisades has already signed long-term Power Purchase Agreements for the full power output with rural electric co-ops Wolverine Power Cooperative and Hoosier Energy who serve rural communities in Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. This will significantly reduce Hoosiers climate pollution and put Wolverine on track to reach 100 percent carbon-free energy before 2030, allowing rural communities across Michigan to lower their carbon footprint from grid-connected energy to zero.  USDAs investments will help lower energy costs for rural communities. As non-profit wholesale electric suppliers owned by their customers/members, Wolverine and Hoosier Energy will pass 100% of the New ERA grant funds directly through to the homes and businesses served by their member electric cooperatives. This means that every dollar will go straight to the communities they serve, helping to reduce wholesale power costs, provide community benefits and keep electricity reliable and affordable.  \\n...*Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Program*This announcement marks the first closing of a loan guarantee through the?Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment?(EIR) program under Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Section 1706, first authorized and appropriated by President Bidens historic Inflation Reduction Act. EIR can?finance projects that retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations or enable operating energy infrastructure to avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions. Holtec Palisades will repower existing energy infrastructure that has been nonoperational and support reinvestment in the community, underscoring the Biden-Harris Administrations deep commitment to ensuring no community is left behind as we build Americas clean energy future. As of September 30, 2024, $64.89 billion in Advanced Nuclear projects have submitted applications or are expected to submit applications in the next 120 days: $12.09 billion in Section 1703 projects and $52.8 billion in Section 1706 (EIR) projects.*USDA New ERA Funding Will Lower Rural Energy Costs*Today [September 30th], USDA is announcing that the Wolverine Power Cooperative is being awarded more than $650 million in New ERA financing to purchase approximately 435 MW of clean, carbon-free wholesale energy from the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant to serve its members throughout rural Michigan. The project is also expected to support key initiatives such as low-income community solar, skilled trades training, agricultural investments and energy efficiency programs, which will benefit the members and communities it serves for decades to come. Hoosier Energy is being awarded more than $675 million to lower the cost of purchasing approximately 370 MW of clean energy from the restart of Palisades Nuclear Plant and approximately 250 MW of solar energy to serve their members in Illinois and Indiana. The investment is expected to create nearly 800 short- and long-term jobs and provide annual estimated cost savings of $35 million to Hoosier Energy members. The project is also expected to allow Hoosier to invest in local cooperative community grant programs, increase investment and enrollment in critical training and safety programs, and grow university partnerships and scholarships. It will also expand highly effective energy efficiency and demand-side management programming for cooperative consumers, farmers, and agribusiness. USDAs New ERA program, together with the Powering Affordable Clean Energy (PACE) program and other clean energy investments in the Biden-Harris Administrations Inflation Reduction Act, make up the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936. USDA expects to continue making New ERA\\nand Powering Affordable Clean Energy (PACE) program awards in the coming months.  \\n...  Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:Nuclear power is Americas largest source of carbon-free of electricity, supporting hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the country and will play a critical role in tackling the climate crisis and protecting public health and the environment from its impacts, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. Under President Biden and Vice President Harris leadership, DOE and our partners across the federal government are working around the clock to ensure this vital source of clean electricityand the vibrant workforce it supportscontinues to power our nation for generations to come.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Bringing Back Clean Nuclear Energy, Creating Clean Energy Union Jobs Across the Midwest"},{"text":"And the 0.03 are elderly and morbidly obese.","title":"\\"I CAN'T DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hate how no one wants to acknowledge this fucking pandemic!!!!! oh my god!!!!!! i leave the internet and everyone is saying it's \\" over \\" while cases are SKY FUCKING HIGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am losing my tether to reality and i don't know what to do to get it back.\\""},{"text":"Most of those people are our parents who told us growing up not to trust people online.

Furthermore, this is also a fallacy of scale, where \\"wages are up\\" does not imply \\"wages are up enough to counteract inflation, which is also up\\".  If wages are up 10% and inflation is up 15%, then wages are down in absolute terms.2) Again, fallacy of division.  **Some** people are spending more on non-essentials.

But it also resulted in a cumulative 21% inflation over the last 4 years...which means if your groceries cost $100 in 2020, they cost $121 in 2024.  Meanwhile your paycheck likely did not keep pace...One estimate puts wage increases at [17% since 2020](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/wage-to-inflation-index/)...which means you are losing ground to inflation.  So while it looks like you are making more money, you are losing your ability to purchase goods and services.","title":"CMV: People are letting Politics and Social Media ruin a pretty good economic run"},{"text":"In other words, sore loser will continue to be sore loser.","title":"Rep.

We even see stuff like some folks feeling distaste for \\"free speech\\" or at least not wanting to be too enthusiastic about it, and being sceptical of folks who talk about it a lot, just because of the \\"free speech warriors\\" on the right. And while some of the left wing dislike of \\"liberalism\\" is just due to some on the far left being explicitly anti liberal in their politics, I'd wager that there's also some progressives whose politics aren't really inherently \\"illiberal\\" but who have become wary of the word \\"liberal\\" due to that trend of folks on the online right saying stuff like \\"actually I'm a liberal, I didn't move to the right, the other side just moved too far to the left and left me behind\\" and such","title":"The Power of Liberal Nationalism C \\"If they are to successfully defend democracy in multiethnic societies, liberals must stop conflating nationalism with nativism and ethnonationalism, seize the flag, and arm themselves with emotionally compelling national-democratic narratives.\\""},{"text":"Cats are major predators of snakes as well, they're just also major predators of other things too, so it's not mentioned that much.

Controlled opposition is fun this election."},{"text":"This is an example of the logical fallacy \\"affirming the consequent\\", or, simply, \\"(A therefore B) implies (B therefore A)\\".As someone who agrees with you in a general sense (a lot less people would be poor if those people budgeted better), there are still many cases where people budget great and are still poor.  These cases generally occur when a person made choices in their life that land them in a position, based on many factors, including skills (or lack thereof), education (or lack thereof), location, and so on, where their expenses are too high of a percentage of their income.A common argument is that wage hikes drive price increases, but that line of argumentation is also affirming the consequent: higher wages almost always drive price increases (causing people to have more money but also pay more for things), but price increases are very seldom driven by wage hikes.  It's definitely possible, likely, and the case more often than not, that prices increase due to supply chain price increases and do not end up benefitting workers.In an environment where inflation has risen prices by well over 10% (I haven't done the math, but it was 8% for 1 of those 3 years so 10% is not a lofty bar) cumulative across roughly 3 years, wages also need to rise by that amount, except they (mostly) haven't, and they particularly haven't for low-income people.  So if you're paying 10% more for things but not making 10% more income, especially when you started with low margins anyway due to not having a great high-paying job in the first place, you're not doing great.","title":"CMV: People are letting Politics and Social Media ruin a pretty good economic run"},{"text":"Why should we be afraid of a largely asymptomatic virus with a 99.97% survival rate?","title":"\\"I CAN'T DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hate how no one wants to acknowledge this fucking pandemic!!!!! oh my god!!!!!! i leave the internet and everyone is saying it's \\" over \\" while cases are SKY FUCKING HIGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am losing my tether to reality and i don't know what to do to get it back.\\""},{"text":"Theyre like but like imagine how sad it would be if she did exist and it was all bidens fault!

That is also a fundamentally liberal concept.I often think referring back to American Revolutionary Documents as primacy sources is replacing evidence for ideology, but quite literally the preamble of the Declaration of Independence covers this. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.And the same is covered in [The Declaration of the Rights of Man](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/rightsof.asp) completed during the French Revolution.Now does that create a contradiction?  Yeah lol.  All universalist politics contains tension between the ends and the means.  Heres the truth about how men are created equal so how do we get there?Unironically, discussing how to reconcile national bodies and universal liberal ideals is the same argument.That Stalin and Trotsky had between Socialism in One Country and Global Revolution.

But then the stuff that gets effectively seen as good patriotism, and the folks supporting it, lean heavily towards the urbane cosmopolitan distaste for any positive imagery/aesthetics/rhetoric etc, while they seem to often just have a base level distaste and distrust towards anyone who is loudly patriotic in a positive way even if they aren't being exclusive or trying to put any groups down with it.

I will focus on different issues from your perspective.You seem to think Kamala needs to be more capable of changing the culture.No president comes into office and changes the nation's culture just by being there. However, every president actively influences the tone, tenor, and topics of public discourse based on how they present themselves and what they speak about.One reason we have toxic public discourse currently is that so many political leaders are focused on 'othering' their opponents. Another is that much of our political leaders' public discourse has focused on issues from a less-than-human perspective.  There is also the theme of framing everything in negative terms.Some of these reasons is amply seen in how Trump and the GOP talk about Democrats as enemies of the nation. Many Democrats have joined this fight, speaking the same way about the GOP and its adherents.The second is something Biden has repeatedly done when talking about the economy. While factually correct, his focus on the raw indexes that showed economic improvement was irrelevant to the lived experiences of most Americans. He's gotten better at that recently, but he did it repeatedly throughout his presidency.Kamala and Walz specifically avoid othering political opponents, insisting on framing issues from the viewpoint of lived experiences rather than raw data and being positive while recognizing problems that must be addressed.While all of these are stylistic choices rather than policy positions - they are stylistic choices that, if continued during her presidency, will significantly influence the culture of our political discourse.If changing the toxicity of public discourse is important, then there is ample reason to vote for Harris precisely because she is demonstrating that she can and will do this very thing.","title":"CMV: You're not voting for Kamala, you're voting against Donald."},{"text":"Thank you for kind words.

Part of the funding announced today will make water infrastructure in rural areas more resilient to the impacts of climate change and severe weather.The Department is investing $1.3 billion to support projects in 30 states. The investments advance President Bidens Investing in America agenda to grow the American economy from the middle out and bottom up.  \\n...*Strengthening Rural Water Infrastructure*During the event in Jeannette, Deputy Secretary Torres Small highlighted that Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County is receiving a $14 million loan under the Water and Waste Disposal Loans and Grants. Funding will be used to improve the City of Jeannette's combined sewer system and eliminate the sanitary sewer overflows for the community.In total, USDA is investing $443 million today through the Water and Waste Disposal Loans and Grants program to expand access to clean and reliable drinking water, sanitary waste disposal and storm water drainage for people in 24 states.More than $30 million of todays investments will help utilities rebuild and strengthen water infrastructure after facing natural disasters and severe weather in California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Montana, New York, Oklahoma and Texas.The agency is helping state and local governments, private nonprofits and federally recognized Tribes build or improve rural wastewater systems. Other examples of todays investments are below.* In Montana, Gardiner Park County Water District will use a $162,000 grant to replace more than 600 feet of water main pipes that were destroyed by flooding of the Yellowstone River in June 2022. The replacement pipes will be upsized to better support the community's water system.\\n* In Wisconsin, Village of Sharon will use more than $3 million in loan and grant funding to make upgrades to its wastewater collection system and wastewater treatment facility. Funding will be used to purchase new phosphorus treatment equipment that will help meet new water quality standards and improve the sites flood protection measures. These improvements will strengthen the villages wastewater infrastructure to combat high intensity rain events that have previously caused major flooding and resulted in sanitary sewer backups.Funding under both programs benefit will help people living in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.*Delivering Clean, Reliable Energy*USDA is also providing $852 million in funding through the Electric Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program to help utility providers and electric cooperatives build and improve electric infrastructure and smart-grid technologies in 14 states.These projects will help ensure everyone in rural areas has access to reliable electricity to increase economic opportunity and improve quality of life. For example:* In North Carolina, Surry-Yadkin EMC will use a $35 million loan to build and improve more than 200 miles of powerline that will connect nearly 2,000 consumers to reliable electricity. Nearly $3 million of this loan will be used to support smart grid technologies.\\n* The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority Generation-Utah LLC will use a $31 million loan to build a solar farm that will provide access to clean energy for people in San Jaun, Utah, and approximately 26,000 Native Americans in the Navajo Nation near Red Mesa, Arizona.Funding will benefit Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and healthcare; and high-speed internet access in rural, Tribal and high-poverty areas. Visit the Rural Data Gateway to learn how and where these investments are impacting rural America.  \\n...Statement from Deputy Secretary Torres Small:Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration and USDA have taken action to create good-paying jobs by making sure every community can benefit from safe drinking water and a reliable electric grid that lowers bills for hardworking families. Todays $1.3 billion investment in over 100 rural water and electric infrastructure projects is a continuation of that commitment, Deputy Secretary Torres Small said. These projects will ensure that rural Americans have access to reliable, affordable energy and clean water no matter where they live. In the face of climate change, resilient power grids and strong water infrastructure are even more critical to building resilient rural communities and maintaining strong local economies.&amp;nbsp;If you're interested in what infrastructure projects are in your state check out [Invest.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Invests in Rural Projects to Strengthen American Infrastructure and Create Good-Paying Jobs in 30 States"},{"text":"In both cases, nothing would have passed because of a filibuster threat unless concessions were made.","title":"Big Oil Urges Trump Not to Gut Bidens Climate Law"},{"text":"3rd: Why haven't you died and gone to hell, yet?","title":"Democrats demand answers on Alitos removal from Supreme Court Jan. 6 opinion"},{"text":"On todays episode of Itss OK When We Do It","title":"Musk makes joke about being dark MAGA.

Excerpt: Oil companies are conveying an unlikely message to the GOP and its presidential candidate: Spare President Bidens signature climate law. At least the parts that benefit the oil industry. In discussions with former President Trumps campaign and his allies in Congress, oil giants including Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and Occidental Petroleum have extolled the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act. Many in the fossil-fuel industry opposed the law when it passed in 2022 but have come to love provisions that earmark billions of dollars for low-carbon energy projects they are betting on. Some executives in the largely pro-Trump oil industry are worried the former president, if re-elected, would side with conservative lawmakers who want to gut the IRA. They fear losing tax credits vital for their investments in renewable fuel, carbon capture and hydrogen, costly technologies requiring U.S. support to survive their early years.  At a Houston fundraiser for Trump in May, Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub took her case directly to the candidate, saying tax credits propping up the companys huge investments in technology to collect carbon directly from the air should be preserved, people familiar with the matter said. The company is building its first $1.3 billion direct-air capture plant in West Texas and aims to erect dozens more in the coming years.","title":"Big Oil Urges Trump Not to Gut Bidens Climate Law"},{"text":"It seems like those living in Trump world need padded cells.

And their employees largely did not see any pay increases as a result of those profits, which is one of the major motivations of the current longshoremen strike.

What about average rent? What about grocery costs?  Has the wage increases been at that same percentage increase or better?The economy is great for those who earn well above average, households with multiple higher incomes, etc.  the issue is that its not the majority.  Personally my monthly costs have increased approximately by 1.5 - 1.6x from 2019 to now.  My wages have increased 1.25x, so Im at a net negative between costs and wage increases.  These include things like housing, groceries, insurance, etc.Im using 2019 as a reference due to being pre-covid.  This is not a uniquely American thing, its happening across the world.  I also dont think it has a huge deal to do with the current political stuff, its just the rebound from COVID times mixed with a bit of corporate greed.  Housing had a huge impact to supply and demand.  Essentially everything did as production ramped way down but that didnt stop the need/demand.  The lowest end of wages went up (a good thing) but also threw in a bit of extra labor costs.So now most people may have higher income than before but their income related to the actual cost of everything has went down.  The thing is, the cost of goods do not seem to be coming down or even pausing (I see things in the grocery store constantly going up in price) and annual raises are sticking to the same percentages that they always have.So, please address inflation in believing how wonderful the economy is and address how that would impact the average earner in America.Last, It seems as if you are trying to directly attribute the good things like increased wages and low unemployment to the current administration but you are not giving them the same responsibility for the insane increase in costs.  Personally, seeing as to how things are worldwide phenomenon, Im not tying either to the current US admin nor do I believe that either candidate can magically fix it.
