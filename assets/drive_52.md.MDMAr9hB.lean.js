There's little incentive to stay sane (and non-corrupt) if you can't lose regardless.Here in Colorado, I'd be fine with our current Democrats maintaining control indefinitely, as long as, *if* they were to go off the deep end, there were sane Republicans around who could actually win.It'd be fine with me if that resulted from the Democrats splitting into two parties or the Republicans collapsing and some new party forming, but either way we'd end up with some sort of conservative party.

While in theory democrats want people to be more equal financially, they basically make it impossible for your standard person to become an entrepreneur. Let me give you my real-life example. 10 years ago we were broke as a joke and massively in debt, but I got a decent tax return and had a few grand from selling a car, and i wanted to open a barber shop with my hubby. We only had $10,000, but my minimal business knowledge, I thought we could do it if we bought super cheap equipment and only set up one station. We opened in a very republican little city that had minimal regulations for opening this type of business. We opened (including our first month rent and security deposit) for under $7000. 6 years down the road we decided to open out second shop. We thought we knew what we were doing, as our first shop had been so painless and easy. So we entered into the lease agreement and began working on opening. This democratic city had so many rules!!! As barbershops are licensed in the same category as salons that deal with toxic nail product fumes, this city required a crazy expensive fan (it cost $15000 with installation). We knew we would have to add sinks to get the barbershop license, but the other city did not require an architect to do the plans, this city did. After hunting around  the cheapest architect we could find cost $8000. Due to it being an architect doing the work, he had to do things in a more by the rules fashion and we had to dig into the cement foundation which required 3 different inspections and permits through the city. In our last shop we had just run the plumbing on the outside of the walls, no permits required. Cost of tearing up the concrete, redoing plumbing and refinishing $20,000. And of course, everything has to be done by licensed  commercial contractors as permits were required. The end result is it cost of over $75,000 to open the second shop. We could afford it, because the first shop does so well, but if we had started this endeavor with our our initial $10,000 from 2014 we would have been screwed out of the gate and my hubby would have had to be a barber for someone else for the rest of his life. So while it may seem like democrats are looking out for everyone, all of these safeties they put in place, (like needless fans that don't apply to our business, requiring an architect to add sinks, ect) are really keeping the lower end of the middle class or poorer people in a place they will never be able to crawl out of.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"It sounds like you go to an improv show and the audience is shouting out suggestions for the scene.

Objectively our economy, per capita and median, beats the snot out of them - so our balance here is *mostly right*, even if there is always room for improvement.Liberals will sometime look longingly at the absolute richest corners of touristy Europe while not really accounting overall life throughout the continent. Which would be like judging the US soul by rich areas of Boston / NY / California.Some push and pull between ease of doing business v quality of life stuff is perfectly fine and healthy, given that the culture / competitive advantage / root of American prosperity is in its innovation.Its kind of reductive to say conservative answers are only tax cuts - because you could reduce liberal answer to redistribution to a few poor people via deficit spending through the Fed; an entity that is not structurally set up to do that.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"Tell me youre uneducated without telling me youre uneducated.

I was thinking more about Newsom and Whitmer, but this goes for anyone who might have thought about running in a truly open primary.  Sure, add Kelly, Beshear, Buttigieg, Shapiro, etc. too.They all have every reason to want her to win, thus coalescing behind her quickly.  Because if Trump is elected, I'm really NOT sanguine about how free and open the 2028 elections will be.Now, of course, if she wins, and there isn't a disaster of some kind, 2028 is probably off the table for any of them to really run.  (Despite what a lot of people were saying about \\"we should have held a really open primary this time\\", that would have gone against REALLY long-standing precedent of \\"the incumbent is the presumptive nominee, unless he chooses not to run\\". AND, it would have been an early signal of the Dems lacking faith in their own president, which frankly would not have been a good look, even if it was true.)But most of them are pretty young, and 2032 is not the worst election for most of them to aim for. Most of the major contenders amongst the Dems are young enough that 2032 is perfectly doable.  (I just looked up Newsom; I didn't realize he was only 56. Good lord, he's my age. What have I been doing with my life?)Buttigieg really needs to get elected to a federal office, and show some governing chops on a bigger stage.  Him moving to Michigan was a good move, as he wasn't going to become a rep or senator from Indiana, but he might in Michigan.  (Or, succeed Whitmer as governor?)Newsom and Whitmer are both in their second terms as governor.  If they can't move into the Senate (depending on what seats are likely to be open or contestable at what times), then they could plausibly be given Secretary roles that would bolster their experience and set them up for a presidential run.  Shapiro is in his first term and can retain his position until 2030, if my math is correct.  (Or jump to a Senate seat if that comes open or makes sense.)This speculation is just on top of the idea that Harris as VP was best-positioned to seamlessly slide into the Biden reelection effort, war-chest and all. And I think the idea that \\"the VP is there to succeed the president, if necessary\\" played into the acceptance of her doing that, albeit in the role of candidate.  Otherwise, after being VP... in THEORY, she could at some point go for the Senate again, I guess.  The other big option would be a federal judge position (hell, even a SCOTUS position; the model there is Pres. Taft, who went on to be the chief justice of the SCOTUS after his presidency).","title":"What More Do You People Want from Kamala Harris?"},{"text":"I would pay good money to see this happen lol","title":"Incredible moment as biden wears trump hat...dems must be furious lol"},{"text":"TX going blue would shut out any chance of victory by itself.

The groups that still do think he is good at business and like reaganomics, so they just want a conservative platform that doesnt raise taxes on corporations I think the problem is its hard to punch back on those three in a way that is needle moving. To address the first one you have to get people to understand global inflation and price gouging - the latter has become a bigger message for dems but the first is hard to get people to understand if they arent already paying attention to global economics.The second is tough because the dems dont want to oversell the fact theyre still pretty pro-corporation because it would turn off a big part of their base more. That and you have to teach people what a mixed economy isAnd the third should be easier and they hit on it (republicans adding to deficit all the time, etc.) but conceptually its hard to get people off a philosophy theyve been sold for 40 years.

The theory is really simple...the economy is a relationship between consumers, workers, and producers. The economy depends on consumers/workers purchasing products and services. If the workers can't afford to consume, then the economy shrinks and the producers are not incentivized to produce anymore, leading to failure. I suppose it's sort of a confusing concept because there really isn't a clear or agreed definition of when capitalism has failed. Is it when the economy starts shrinking? Is it when a certain percentage of the population lives in abject poverty? Is it when the state itself fails? Examples of each of these already exist in the global economy. I think for most people across the world, late-stage capitalism exists already. The third world has been and continues to be stripped of it's resources by wealthy countries with almost no wealth transfer back to those people. Billions live in abject poverty, while in some way still contributing to the market economy owned mostly by a relative few in other countries. Workers (but also sadly kids and slaves) in the Congo strip cobalt for batteries for products they can never afford...it is totally dependent on western consumers. On the flip side, the outsourced labor is also undermining the western economy...it suppresses the price of labor in the developed world. So yes, the west has cheap consumer goods but only because of this even cheaper labor in the third world. But at the same time, costs of necessary goods like housing, medical care, and food are rising. But there are worrying trends in the western world as well. Obviously rising inequality is a commonly referenced statistic, but I think just as worrying is the consumer debt. It indicates that consumers can't really afford the lifestyle that is currently fueling the economic growth...and as the share of wealth of younger generations shrink that will only get worse. [https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/consumer-debt-study/](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/consumer-debt-study/)In other words, capitalism only seems like it's working because people tend to focus only on the western economies. But for most people around the world, capitalism has already failed them. And even the successful western economies are a house of cards... most of the wall street economic growth is not built on real value, it's speculative investment. And all of that is before we even address the issue of limited natural resources and climate change across the Earth. And I know the most common response that you might already be thinking is \\"yeah but everyone's life is better than it was 200 years ago, even for the starving kids in Africa.\\" And first, I don't think that's obviously true...people died from starvation in the past due to lack of resources...today they starve to death even when there is not a lack of resources. For those people it is a distinction without merit.  Two, the trend is in many cases is reversing, and three, I don't think that's the best metric anyway. It doesn't really tell us how sustainable that is.How many more generations before the house of cards falls? Or maybe it won't, or maybe it will morph into something else. Asking us to change your mind by telling the future isn't reasonable. But perspective is warranted. Capitalism as we know it is only a few hundred years old... in the span of the human race it is but a flash in the pan. Do you think history will view that flash as a success? Or will they view it as a foolish and immoral waste of resources?","title":"CMV: \\"Late Stage Capitalism\\" Doesn't Exist"},{"text":"I just wrote back to your other comment on this haha, Im sorry for making it confusing. My opinion is that we need more people with a cultural awareness of black experiences and while that may feel unfair at first or help some rich black students, its not going to take their tests or earn their degrees for them, and once we have that knowledge to make accommodations (or not, but at least with consideration of what we dont know if were not black), thats how we get to a place where everyone has an equal access to succeed. I dont think we should be guaranteeing anyones success or giving people better grades or performance reviews because of race, but I do think we need to establish an environment where we know how race may affect them. In white culture we tend to care more about feelings because the brutal truth can be hard to hear and it may not matter, but for black kids they may need that because they feel they cant risk it. Sometimes in performance reviews, a black manager can seem too hard on people, when their feedback is helpful and wouldnt be considered offensive in their other relationships, but its blunt and that can be shocking to someone who is used to people softening those blows. That may not even be a real example of an issue, but its things like that where once we incorporate our differences, we can be more fair. And it needs to happen on both sides, I think we can all probably be better at listening more and compromising or being more open minded. The other thing that I read once was how most professional athletes are born in certain months because theyre bigger and at young ages a year can make a huge difference. When you are highlighted as talented at a young age, you get better coaching and more attention. Is that unfair to the summer babies, like me? Yes. But I dont need to be a professional athlete to be successful. So where some men may not get into a college they would have before, but the process overall is more fair, I think thats when we have to recognize that admission to that school isnt stopping them from being successful unless they let it. We still have control over our futures.","title":"cmv: Affirmative Action has only been supported for so long because it privileged a majority of people at the expense of a minority."},{"text":"It always seemed odd to me that they tucked Kamala away into a cupboard for 4 years when she always seemed very sharp and articulate in her speeches to me.

Younger cohorts are often stereotyped as being lazy, entitled or self-obsessed C and have been for centuries.  Evidence shows newer generations do, indeed, measure highly on traits that their older counterparts might consider as a sign of weakness. Yet experts also believe that Baby Boomers (born roughly between 1946 and 1964) and Gen X (born between 1965 and 1980) might be judging the generations that succeed them much too harshly, and measuring them against standards that have long ceased to be the norm.One 2010 study that examined millennials graduating university between 2004 and 2008 showed that they had more traits associated with low resilience than people who graduated before 1987. Other research has demonstrated that neuroticism and a need for recognition have increased in younger generations, while one 2012 study suggested that youth are more self-centered than they were in the past.\\nYet for many experts, these measures dont point to younger generations being weaker than older ones. Instead, they are simply ways of judging a generation shaped by a modern and technologically-focused society by the standards of decades ago.

But thats inextricably tied to race in America. And race, as well as gender or disabilities, as separate considerations they all have their own impacts too. When you have intersectionality, its more complicated than just any one of those things. Race is a physical attribute, caused by vitamin deficiencies in certain geographies when skin was too dark and damage in others when skin was too light. It has as much impact as different colored hair or height. The difference is we have made it socially relevant in our history, which means there are cultural differences that have evolved from having people separate. Our daily lives and how we work or communicate are all following the traditions that were established by one culture and expecting all others to conform. In some ways, yes that would make sense but in others it doesnt, there may be a better way to do something that isnt traditional and we just are very slow to see that. For example, whats business professional? Does what you wear really have an impact on how smart you might be at finding a solution to offer in the market? No, but our standards of professionalism are engrained in us and were not willing to recognize where they came from. Race affects a lot more than we realize, not in the hateful or intentionally discriminatory way that people talk about, but much more in the minute details of how we relate, communicate, get things done, etc because we werent all being raised in the same culture. I said before that I didnt used to feel this way, and what changed my mind was when I managed people who werent white and I saw how different things happened for them than me. And again, it wasnt on purpose, but what was most frustrating was how difficult it was just to try and have a discussion or ask questions, I realized we focus on the implication that we are racist instead of listening and making an effort to understand or make accommodations that could help them be more successful too. Its hard to explain, and I know it might not make sense if you havent witnessed the same thing, but I think both sides of these arguments could gain a lot if there was a greater willingness to understand each others perspective rather than be right.","title":"cmv: Affirmative Action has only been supported for so long because it privileged a majority of people at the expense of a minority."},{"text":"Ok that's over the line.

If there are women who participate proportionately in the decision making processes of the school, then I dont think women should still need affirmative action, except I dont think thats the case. Im a white girl, I dont think we need it and I think its embarrassing that weve benefited the most from it. I used to see affirmative action differently, similarly to the OP here, but after working in my industry for a while and became involved in our own recruiting and management/executive processes, Ive learned there is a lot of unintentional bullshit that happens and thats why I think it is still a productive policy for minorities. My family has a lot of white men in it, I want them to have opportunities and be successful too. My opinions arent stemming from any negative feelings towards them. And race/gender are not disabilities, but to me its similar to people who have them. Almost everyone I know has glasses or contacts and wouldnt be able to do their jobs or read the slides in class without them, yet we dont consider ourselves disabled due to poor eyesight because its very well accommodated for. If I own a business or run a school, Id want the best people and not selecting them because of poor eye sight would be doing both them and myself a disservice. Giving them glasses, initially, may seem unfair to people who dont need them, but it really is correcting an unfairness that was preventing others from having access to the same opportunities for success. Glasses wont make someone get a bonus or guarantee a 4.0, they still would need to earn that just like everyone else, glasses just gives them the opportunity to compete. I understand not everyone shares my view either, but what Ive noticed in sports, businesses, etc. that even more people compete, it makes everyone better, including those who may feel disadvantaged by letting more people in. Representation is important because we dont know what we dont know, having a voice that knows helps us know what accommodations we need to consider to be able to attract the best talent for our own success. And when you have more people from different backgrounds involved in designing or advising, you provide more value to your customers and can make more money that also benefits everyone. I say that, not to try and convince you Im right or youre wrong, but because somewhere in this debate and in our politics in general, weve seemed to have dehumanized people with different opinions. Hopefully if anything, Id just want you to understand that when someone supports affirmative action, it doesnt equate to a bitterness towards white men. For some, Im sure it does, but I think both sides want fair access to opportunity and both sides want to see everyone succeed, we can have the same goals and values but just have different opinions on what the best way is to achieve them.","title":"cmv: Affirmative Action has only been supported for so long because it privileged a majority of people at the expense of a minority."},{"text":"If you went to Yale like JD Vance, then the fraternities are for killing people","title":"Kamala Harris and Linsey Davis (the unbiased moderator) were sorority sisters!"},{"text":"People who were already voting trump or Harris pre debate it changed nothing.But to undecided voters, the clear bias against Trump moved the needle with some.","title":"NEW POLL: Kamala Harris Won the Debateyet It's Trump Who Gained a Point in Voter Support"},{"text":" And I guarantee you the same people who complained that \\"no one voted for her to be the candidate\\" would be dead against a special Republican Primary election if Trump were to die between now and election day.

I can still picture in my mind the image of him sitting in a classroom in Florida reading to children when a Secret Service agent leaned in to inform him of the first plane then later of the second plane, at which point he left and hurried to Air Force One. In a national emergency such as that Air Force One becomes essentially a flying bunker so one could say Bush did go into a bunker that day. Even if he had been in the White House at the time it would have made sense for him to enter the White House bunker, if not evacuate completely, as at the time it was unknown just how many planes may have been hijacked nor what the targets of any hijacked planes may be and the White House would have been a definite potential target. IIRC Flight 93 is believed to have been heading towards either the White House or Capital Building before the passengers fought back and the plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. They are trying to claim Biden entered a bunker on 9/11 when their own guy actually did go into the White House bunker and hide when there were peaceful protests outside of the White House.Harris wasn't even in a federal position of any sort at the time and wasn't known to really anyone while Biden was a Senator and probably wasn't well known outside of his constituency. Neither had any role in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.Trump didn't do a damned thing to help people that day or in the days following. He spent the day calling news stations boasting that he now owned the tallest building in Manhattan wich was a lie) and lying about seeing Muslims dancing in the streets after the attacks. It was something like a week later before he visited Ground Zero and that was only for a photoshoot centering himself then he left immediately.It was bad enough that these people tried blaming Obama for 9/11 when he didn't take office until 7 and a half years later but to blame Biden/Harris when they didn't take office until 20 years later is beyond ridiculous.I know it's hard to believe it's been 23 years since that fateful day but it's not hard to remember who the president was at the time.If we want to talk about celebrities going to Ground Zero and actually helping then we have to talk about Steve Buscemi. When he got word about the attacks he joined back up with the men and women of his former fire station (he was a firefighter with the FDNY before he entered acting) and spent days actually helping save lives at Ground Zero. There are very few photos of him there and he rarely talks about it because he didn't go there for himself, he went there to help others. Trump went to there a week later just to take photos to make himself look good then left, he helped no one but himself. He is incapable of doing anything for anyone else if there isn't a clear benefit for him in doing so. Selfless actions aren't something he is capable of.","title":"These people think Biden and Harris were president and vice president when 9/11 happened."},{"text":"Ah verbiage might be our differentiator here.

You are a good, better, worse, bad, person because of who you are, not because of what you do. And you definitely should get privileges based on that, even if that means turning a universal right into one by taking it away from others. The moral aspect of the hierarchy exists solely to excuse the social one, and the inevitable injustice that it creates. There will always be some principle supposedly underpinning this hierarchy, usually religious (god made humans unequal and some people better than others) , some form of social darwinism (oligarchs justifying their power and the way they use it because they believe they are smarter / fitter / ... / than normal people) or pseudoscience (the endless series of \\"racial sciences\\").People who adhere to it do so because it allows them to see themselves as both morally superior and having a higher social status than groups they already look down on or dislike. In times of economic stress, this provides an alternative to the actual social hierarchy (which is based on wealth). The deal is always that they can set themselves up above those they dislike, and in return they don't challenge the rich and powerful doing the same to them. The basis of a reactionary movement is a rejection of the principle of fundamental equality, which is why you see so many groups (religious fundamentalists, misogynists, racists, oligarchs, ...) with completely different interests allying within it: all of them have some rationale that places them on a pedestal, and they resent the fact that society doesn't (wholly) reflect that. This rejection of equality is also why these movements inevitably turn against democracy, which is built on this principle, and why they especially hate those institutions (human rights, civil rights, social services, the rule of law, ...) that preserve or promote equality, however imperfectly. It might not even strictly adhere to the worldview that they purport is superior but they understand why they deviate.Just so. The classic example with misogyny in a religious context is that you'll have women who are objectively being oppressed but still look down on other women, for example those whom they see as sexually promiscuous.

The main difference between the groups is the first is an entirely passive, identity-based? group based on inherent biological characteristics wherein the only choice the members made was a choice to NOT do certain stuff. In the second, the members are in that group, not because of any biological characteristics or other external factors, but because they chose to become a member of that group (specifically they chose to spread the 'kill all pedophiles' message).Also, it usually isn't the pedophile we need to worry about anyway.

I have a hard time believing it's a mental disorder when it primarily affects men.

For me, it's hard to imagine being kind or respectful to someone who feels attraction towards children - male or female. Even if they are not offending. It's probably the most depraved thing a human being can do. Personally, if I found myself having pedophilic tendencies, I wouldn't be able to live with myself and I don't understand how anyone could even continue living like that.I think pedophiles should be removed from society, better save than sorry.","title":"CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly"},{"text":"Kopmala absolutely killed her in 2020","title":"Democrats who urged Biden to exit race say Harris is exceeding expectations"},{"text":"It's wild to me that things have just inversed into Republicans all yelling that America is some terrible country.

(Trump era) Rep leadership has a problem of lacking any actual international policy or concept of the US's role on the international stage.Neither are great, but one is terrible.I don't view Trump as much of an ally.  if Republican sentiment becomes \\"The Jews are mindcontrolling the US govt to send away their hard earned taxpayer money in a forever conflict\\" Trump will flip on a dime. I don't think there's any principle behind any position Trump takes, Israel included. I don't think he knows any history, any stats, any laws of armed conflict. Trump only knows what his fanbase believes on any given day, and it's also all he cares about.another important point is Ukraine Russia.  \\nOFC i care more about israel in the immediate sense, but on the global stage Trump's lack of principle and shallow approach to international policy WILL weaken the west in general, including Israel in the long term. Russia violated a nuclear disarmament treaty and is currently abusing its status as a nuclear state to swallow its disarmed neighbor.  \\nthis is a HORRIBLE precedent. it would create a geopolitical reality where nuclear aggressors can bully their neighbors with impunity. good luck preventing nuclear proliferation in this geopolitical environment.even more importantly, it is a violation of the US's commitment to Ukraine. Trump doesn't give a flying fuck about the US's role in maintaining a rules based international order. he will allow the entire infrastructure the US has painstakingly built over 80 years to collapse, and he will do it for no purpose more principled than that ignorant people will clap when he boasts about it.If the US can just ignore defensive treaties with allies when it's inconvenient for them, that's not good for Israel. Israel is also a part of this infrastructure. weakening it weakens Israel as well.most importantly, I believe Trump will weaken the US internally. he already has.  \\nTrump attempted to illegally take over the US government. He undermines every american institution he touches. He's just bad for America.I like the US. I feel like we're fortunate to be living in a world where the dominant world power is the one that has the US constitution as its moral compass. I'd like that to continue, but it won't if the US tears itself apart over a would-be dictator instead of keeping its eye on the ball.Trump MAY be marginally better for Israel in the short term, but even that's up in the air when you get into the nitty gritty.

By that logic, collective punishment was used not just by the Nazis, but by the allied powers, who killed exponentially more German and Japanese civilians during WW2 than Israel has killed in Palestine in 80 years. However, even if we do accept that this is a form of collective punishment (which it isnt), Palestinians embrace collective punishment as part of their worldview and to reject it would be a form of western chauvinism and imperialism.On the question of segregation, similarly, virtually every country is guilty of this form of segregation in the sense that border controls which treat foreigners differently from citizens exists. Arab Israelis dont face those restrictions, only populations made up largely of enemy combatants and their constituents. In this way the better analog is Britain in Malaya.In terms of ethnic cleansing, widespread population transfers were practiced after WW2 to assure for ethnic stability in redrawn borders. Denial of the same tools to Israel in 1946 was merely a continuation of the same historical dehumanization of Jews which led to the Holocaust in the first place. Had Israel been seen as equal to Poland, Romania, Hungary, and other Nazi collaborator states which were allowed to then purge their German-speaking populations, the current conflict could not exist, and Palestinians would enjoy a homeland. In Jordan.In terms of indiscriminate violence, Israel takes more efforts to avoid civilian casualties than any military active in a war zone bar none. Hamas frequently fights out of uniform and using women and children as combatants, and furthermore, Palestine believes that local populations are complicit in the actions of their political leadership, so the concept of civilian is largely one being imported from the west.Your claim about many historians is risibly false and there is no serious argument that Israel is not a democratic nation.In terms of the denial of statehood, there are more than a dozen Arab Muslim states which came into existence at approximately the same time as Israel. Hamas and its western supporters feel that there absolutely needs to be one more, and a second Holocaust is needed to accomplish that. Israel has a right to self defense, up to and including the removal of enemy populations that seek to destabilize it. Insofar as this is similar to what Nazi Germany did, its as Nazi Germany was - like Israel, the US, Russia, etc., a sovereign state which fought a war.","title":"CMV: Many ppl dont wanna see how similar Nazi rethoric and actions are similar if not identical to israels treatment of palestinians and muslims.

That's absurd.Pedophiles *are* in a unique situation compared to other mental disorders, and sure that's because they're uniquely dangerous when untreated, but that's the *exact* reason society needs to change the way the disorder itself (not the act of offending) is talked about. It's bad enough trying to exist in society and seek help with a mood or personality disorder, but as someone who's dealt with plenty of stigma and hate for being bipolar, the idea of having pedophilic urges still sends a chill down my spine. Being a non-offender with such horrifying urges is one of the worst things I can think of, it's total nightmare fodder, and the knowledge that it's almost impossible to get help and try to get better just makes it even worse.My interest is always going to be in how to stop sexual abuse (which will *absolutely* also lower the number of pedophiles) rather than how to morally grandstand in front of others, and everything I've ever heard from actual experts who are doing the work of trying to stop abuse has concluded that pedophiles' fear of asking for help is causing more children to be abused.

If you were, you would specifically say non-offending pedos every single time instead of subjecting people to gross sentences such as pedophiles are treated unfairly. Do you want to actually help these non-offending pedos? Or do you just want to be provocative? To normalize disgusting phrases? So, my view is relatively straightforward. I believe that society has demonised pedophiles to a point that makes life less safe for children. No, society hasnt demonized pedos unfairly. Again, if you mean non offending pedos, then youre being grossly negligent.Two problems, one whats the evidence to support this? Second, youre driven by an arbitrary morality for whatever reason, not by whats best for the children. That is, youre not for children pursuing whats necessary for their survival as their highest moral purpose, including when they are adults.  Treatment in the form of counselling/therapy or anything else that is possible, should be widely availableWhat does this mean exactly?  I believe that the rhetoric of kill all pedophiles does nothing but prevent these people from coming forward to receive the help that they need to stop them from acting on their thoughts. Whats your evidence? Two, the question isnt whether it stops non-offending pedos from coming forward, but whether it saves more children for people to know that pedophilia is completely evil, completely unacceptable. Three, all pedophiles should be killed with fire. Telling people not to stand up for and say whats just is not going to help you persuade people to treat non-offending pedos more justly.","title":"CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly"},{"text":"You should not base any of your decisions out of concern about climate change other than how you vote.

An alcoholic talks about their experiences and therapy, they hate themselves, that they loathe drinkers. WHY are they sharing this? 1. They want people to understand them, that they didnt intend it and they wish they werent this way - i.e., that theyre really just a normal person and not the monster their condition makes them\\n2. They want people to understand they know its wrong, and they hate it just like anyone else - i.e., theyre normal and have normal moral standards\\n3. They want to give tips to other struggling people and help them avoid pitfalls that other people like them might want to avoid - this is the one positive from these sorts of messages, BUT, it still positions that the person is normal, they are one of many struggling with this and its a struggle normal people have. So it doesnt matter if they go in with the intent oh Im going to make everyone okay with pedophiles so I can be a pedophile. By opening pedophilia as a normal struggle you should be able to talk about just like any other struggle, you are making it just as normal as any other struggle.

The book women are from Venus and men are from mars talk about how we as a collective can relate to men. Theres also a lot of literature on how to raise boys. At the center of it, all peoples need to feel heard, seen, understood, and appreciated. Some men are raised to have some shared values and qualities that they perceived to be undermined by women at large  because women are self-sufficient. E.g.:I buy my own things, I pay my own bills\\nThese diamond rings, my automobiles\\nEverything I got, I bought it\\nBoys cant buy my love  KeshaIn this case, what role do men play if they cant be providers? And the list goes on: if they cant be protectors, if they cant be the guide or the decision-maker or the leader or the enforcer?All of that challenges their sense of self and it causes a tremendous amount of cognitive dissonance. If you havent experienced CD before, the brain literally hurts  its like a vinyl record that gets stuck with a thought and two pinballs go back and forth between both sides trying to get unstuck. Ouch.  That, paired with a sense of rejection where the body literally hurts, because we as humans are wired to be rejected to ensure our tribal survival. That sharp pain of when you realize the person that you like doesnt like you back  imagine if thats all you feel every time you see a woman because you automatically assume you will be rejected. Plus, the inability of hold dialect thinking, which is the capacity to hold two distinguished thoughts, due to lack of emotional depth  and not to their fault, just because most men are raised to have low emotional depth. Boys dont cry, dont act that way. Real men dont do that, etc. Add all that up and theres what we end up seeing now: men in pain because they dont know how to add value or be around a woman that has their stuff together. They also dont feel they can approach women. I saw data of people under the age of 30 that have approached a woman and asked her on a date, I dont want to misquote, but it was extremely low. And on the other side, theres a large number of women that (un)consciously understand all of this so they keep their distance, do their thing, focus on themselves and their cats and dogs and they are building their own castles and realizing they dont need a prince after all.

I cannot phantom how other people with brains think Israel can be justified in ANY way to shoot 13 year olds in the head, bomb refugee camps, and torture and sodomize their prisoners- which they took with no trial.People that still believe in israel, please consider this.Im going to pretend that Israel has not lied. That 40 babies DID get beheaded by Hamas. Let me even be generous and say Hamas took 1000 hostages.  say 100 Israeli women were raped by Hamas. (I believe Israel claimed it was a few dozen, but again, I'll be generous)A small handful of hostages have been rescued. Many of them are not allowed to give statements, and those that do seem physically unharmed, and with not much to say aside from \\"There was no food\\" (Israel blocks food from entering the strip) and \\"I was afraid of the bombing\\" (all of those bombs were Israeli) Tragically, some of these hostages have also been killed.... by israel. 3 of them were waving white flags and ended up getting sniped dead. Israel admitted to this, and is so very sorry for the mistakes.\\nOne hostage shouted for help in Hebrew, and was shot by an israeli. Israel is so very sorry.Even with all this ^ being true (there is NO evidence that it is btw. Not video, not photo, not even consistent statements) you cannot ever justify Israel's response. Let me do the opposite of what I did for Israel- Im going to round DOWN.In carpet bombing the strip, Israel has beheaded hundreds of Palestinian babies. Thousands of children are missing limbs, and since Israel also bombed nearly every hospital, they cannot get medical care. Thousands more have been killed in the bombings. Entire family lineages have been completely killed off. Israel has thousands of Palestinian \\"prisoners\\" that are being held with NO trial. Some of these are children. Many of these are there for something as inane as (gasp) throwing rocks at an officer (the ones wearing the uniforms of the people that murdered their parents)These prisoners are tortured and given no medical treatment. Many of the ones that get released are missing limbs, have countless health issues, and when they recount their time in prison- its nothing but war crime after war crime. They are sodomized, humiliated, and beaten. Reminder that many of these people never even had a trial, not that it would justify their treatment.And there is evidence of this. Journalist that have traveled to Israel found the facility where these crimes happen- but they are not allowed to take pictures- so let me be fair to israel and assume none of it is true. There are still countless- literally countless pictures and videos of little Palestinian children being pulled out of rubble, of mothers and fathers begging people for help so that they can leave to seek safety for their families. I can't tell you how many kids I saw, or the state they were in. You can go look that up yourself. Its out there. Go look at the mangled little corpses and then come back here and tell me Israel has a right to defend itself. Go look at the pictures of infants with bullet wounds to the head, look at the video of a 6 year old little girl begging for someone to help her. Then look at the video of when her body was found. Look at the picture of a 10 year old's body shredded and hanging from a wall. Look at the picture of two little boys- one with his eyeballs popped out of his head and the other with his hand over his little brother, both trapped under a building. Look at the video of a father pulling his (headless) baby out from a fire, and holding the body up to a camera, demanding to know what this child did to deserve that. Look at pictures of the mountains of corpses Israel leaves behind. Count each of them, and remember that these are just the ones you can see. Note how so many of them are incredibly small.But okay. Maybe you dont trust those videos and pictures, maybe you think theyre fake. Okay. Sure. Go look at Israel's official instagram and twitter then. The IDF themselves have posted videos and pictures of them posing in front of the houses they destroyed- smiling like there isnt a body just out of framed. Look at the videos of them playing with toys in the rubble of a playground they just destroy. Look at the videos on them prancing around in woman's underwear- which they stole from the homes they bombed. Look up the IDF soldier that found a ring in the rubble, and plan to use to propose to his girlfriend. Look at how proud they all are of the lives they destroyed.Or dont. Its distressing stuff to see, and its not happening to you, so why should you care? But can you still look at that and tell me you dont understand why Palestinian kids throw rocks at soldiers- after seeing what they are put through?Knowing that this has been happening for decades, can you say you're surprised about October 7th?And, if Israel succeeds in destroying Hamas- but claims they have to kill your entire family to do it- would you just sit back and let them?If any of you actually read this whole thing, genuinely tell me HOW can you possibly be taking Israel's side.","title":"CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today"},{"text":"Nah.

If you want any meaningful representation at all, you're going to have to deal with the fact that people you don't like will occasionally be in the tent.Your answer is to back the candidates you want in the primaries, especially local and Congressional primaries.

She won her seat because people like you didn't pay attention to local and Congressional primaries because they live in safe districts and their vote \\"doesn't matter\\".Voting for neither Trump nor Harris is going to change whether or not someone like AOC keeps her seat.

I'll bet you if I look hard enough I can find one Taylor Swift fan who will vote for Donald Trump.Also, as someone who was thrust back into online dating when I thought that was never going to be something I'd have to deal with, I've learned a lot about what is being pushed on men as \\"dating strategy\\". Which essentially boils down to some version of a redpill or \\"alpha\\" mentality, which is basically just treat women like objects and hooking up with them is the end goal. So in that case, they only have to mask their beliefs long enough to hook up, and then they can just dump them and move on. There's also a lot of mental manipulation tactics encouraged to trigger anxious attachment on thw women to make them continue to seek out the guy while he plays on their insecurities. It's all really shitty, and it's why everyone complains about online dating.The plan is one thing, the outcome is another. 4D chess moves sound great and doable in thought experiments, then there's having to pretend you think immigration strengthens the country and resist all urges to say you think immigrants are responsible for everything wrong in the world when all of your twisted impulses tell you to pronounce your feelings to the contrary at every possible opportunity.Hiding your true personality like a real social chameleon is incredibly hard for anyone who isn't a completely amoral sociopath, which few people are. And MAGA cultists have wed this wretched \\"movement\\" to their personalities more than any other such movement in American history.As a guy who isn't like that, it means you have to put so much effort into just showing you aren't going to fuck them over.As a guy who isn't like that, no you don't. You can just be normal.

Biden was clearly too old to run but because of his ego decided that he was the only one who could beat Trump (ignoring the polling showing he was unpopular). He was obviously not feeling great during the campaign, mixing up words and losing track of sentences. Despite this he was arrogant enough to call an early debate (and thank god he did). Then after it was clearly over there was almost a month of the entire democratic party in rebellion, publicly calling for him to step down, even after he released multiple statements saying he had decided he would not stand down. Finally his closest allies, Pulosi and Obama, had to step in to push him before he finally decided to put his country before his ego and withdraw.I think the truth is somewhere in between the two narratives.

Haven't gotten into her newer records. Context: I worked in the music industry (as both a musician and in management) for over 20 years. While I don't love all her music, I can say objectively she hasn't been \\"releasing the same song in different variations\\". She tried to buy her old master recordings back so she had full control over all her music - past and future. Instead she had to use a loophole in copyright law that allows you to re-record your songs (even if they sound incredibly similar to the master recordings controlled by someone else). She now has her own version (which she controls) of all of her old music and her fans can choose to buy/play/license 'Taylor's version' to ensure she is paid for her music instead of Scooter Braun (who bought her old label and all her master recordings without allowing her to make an offer). Pretty brilliant business move on her part to effectively devalue Scooter Braun's purchase and maintain control over her own music. So that's the story of the 'different versions' of her old music.Are you referring to the time when Kanye came on stage when Taylor won her VMA and made a big spectacle about how Beyonce actually had the greatest video? Or when Kanye decided to release a diss track about her, claiming he made her famous (again, she had already sold tens of millions of records by the time she was 19) and implied he was going to have sex with her? Or when Kim released an edited version of a private phone call claiming Taylor had ok'd the track, but years later when the full recording came out, it turns out Kim and Kanye had not only lied about getting her permission, but also purposely tried to deceive her? That's what happened. Who exactly is she \\"still playing victim\\"?Sure, people can dislike someone without being a hater. My point was, it's common that along with people that just simply dislike certain famous musicians or actors, there are also a lot of haters who seem to feel the need to make an effort to express their dislike, and invest time into making sure everyone knows their opinion - even complete strangers on the internet. It's an odd psychological issue that seems to manifest in internet trolls or people with poor self worth.","title":"Taylor Swift Disables Comments After Endorsing Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Who should get the most credit for pushing Biden to pass the torch?

I'm certainly not walking down the street assuming every person around the corner is secretly dreaming of touching kids, not to say some people aren't overly paranoid. But I believe we can agree most people will not ostracise a regular person that shows no signs of paedophilia. 'Non-offending paedophiles' are most likely going out of their way to do everything not to be associated with that. But when someone says or acts a certain way around children or displays signs that are concerning, people have every right to back away. People have every right to try protect their kids because sure, its not all peadophiles that are touching kids, but some are. Can you tell the difference? Are you going to believe someone who just says \\"Oh, I'm a non-offending peadophile.\\" Does this mean you're okay with the idea of them seeing a little child that lives across the road and fantasing about doing things to them, just as long as it's not acted upon? Are you okay with the use of AI images producing child pornography because \\"It's not a real child.\\"It's just drawings, calm down, I'm not hurting anyone.\\" The point is, where is the line between offending and non-offending. When are people allowed to be upset? Do these people need help? Absolutely. But we continuously see in real time that people take \\"a little sympathy\\" and \\"just need some acceptance for the good ones\\" becomes a slippery slope. The topic is interesting, and I do agree they need more help in therapy, but many interviews I've seen have shown that these services don't really help in the long run. Unfortunately, it's very tricky and you're one of few that can have sympathy for a difficult group which is commendable.","title":"CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly"},{"text":"So don't vote for a candidate who holds those views, but there aren't any candidates at the top of the ticket with them","title":"CMV: As a Jewish Democrat living in a solidly blue state, I should protest the Democrats' embrace of the Pro-Palestinian side by voting for Trump."},{"text":"Protip: Don't look at the comments.

That you, with your background, work with these people is absolutely admirable.However, it would be interesting to test this view so some counterpoints:* True Pedophelia can't be treated with therapy at this point in time. Chemical castration is in most ways the only solution for them. This Paraphilia is rare, and most offenders use the sexual abuse as a way to exert power because they have issues/feel weak/are unhappy with their life etc., not far away from substance-abuse. It is not about loving children per se.\\n* I believe, that this part of soon-to-be-offenders won't be catched well by the supply of therapy (if there would be hypothethically enough therapy avaiable which in reality is obviously not the case), because they have to \\"use\\" first, to recognize, that it feels good for them. So for example, inner-family abuse will most likely happen in affect, not as long-planned fantasy. Non-offenders, who \\"up the dosage\\" of abusive material, which leads them to develop such fantasies on the other hand are not acting in affect, true, but for them, this material certainly \\"feels good\\". I think, it would be the same as supplying withdrawal-offers to addicts: Sure, in light moments they will have the thought of getting clean, but then... yeah they are not getting clean because whatever they are taking is a good time, right? Abusing anything will always have you say \\"but i want this\\", because your brain is pretty good in convincing you of it.So in summary: i didn't attack your point \\"pedophiles are treated unfairly\\", but the conclusion you are providing. Treating them more fairly and offering therapy could be not as effective even if they all are allowed to come forward, because the one part of them can't  be properly treated, while the other part of them will always have an incentive not to go to therapy.As an addition: Of course you can't censor the internet, but i believe that echochambers in which they exchange material and fantasies are making non-offenders much more dangerous than their shunning... Another important factor is obviously Porn and its current bias towards violence, interlocking with OF, Tiktok and the \\"Pixarfication\\" of women's/girls faces in social media, which leads the developing sexuality of people in puberty towards these two strains: Underage/childish looking objects of desire + sexual activity as brutal display of power.  \\nThis is just my observation though.","title":"CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly"},{"text":"Hello Mr far leftist.

In the first group (whether they have in the past or potentially would in the future) these pedophiles are actively engaging with children sexually. This involves directly messaging them on social media, talking to them in public, all the way up to full on intercourse.   \\nThe second group would be the pedophiles that look at images online of minors. They fantasize about being with someone younger but would never act on it in any scenario. They treat it as a fetish and may use it as porn but not something they would do \\"in real life\\". This plays into the same conversation as people with scat fetish, CNC fetish, hardcore BDSM fetishes, step bro/step sis etc. It might be hot on video but they themselves would not want to do this in real life. I'm going to consider these the non-offending pedophiles. the first group even if they haven't offended before, have the capability to offend and they 100% should be treated as a danger.  My follow up with the second group is: when AI gets good enough to generate these images- should they be allowed? Do drawings/AI images/videos/sounds/ hell even ai companions that pose as minors but arent minors- should they be allowed?  If they aren't harming any ACTUAL children and can be used as an outlet should that be encouraged. One could argue that flooding the market with AI child porn could save children as it would mean less actual children would have to be filmed/abused.    \\nMY answer to this is - absolutely not.

We shouldn't be dividing ourselves based on fringe politics, or generalizing half of our countrys beliefs because of fringe politics.Agreed.

The problem with, for example, the Hamas protest votes is that Democrats will never become more pro-Palestine than they already are. Another example is Jill Stein protest votes, where they just want Democrats to get better, but rarely have specific demands. So, for your protest vote to have practical benefits, there should be 1) a clear message (Democrats have to know why people arent voting for them) and 2) a clear action they can take to get your vote back without costing them more votes elsewhere.

My grandfather was a pedophile who molested me, my brother, and one of my male cousins. This post really resonates with me. Probably because of what happened to us, I've searched for articles and scientific data on pedophilia, and you'd be surprised how little research has been done, considering how prevalent it is. I agree completely that if society would try to be more compassionate towards this illness, we might actually get somewhere with treating it. And let me be clear, there are some people who are BORN pedophiles, and they are not the same as sexual predators. I mean, a born pedophile CAN be a predator, but not every predator was born a pedophile. If that makes sense. (listen to a podcast on Spotify called 'Hunting Warhead' for more clarification of this statement.)When I think about my grandfather, I always feel really conflicted. What he did to us was devastating but I'll never 100% hate him or think that he had zero moral values. In many ways he tried his best to be a good father, brother, uncle, grandfather, husband. From stories my mother told me, pedophilia and incest kind of \\"ran in the family\\", like this was almost a \\"learned behavior\\" that he grew up witnessing. I'm 95% certain he was also sexually abused as a child. Sometimes when I talk or write about this, I think people get the wrong impression, like I think pedophiles are these completely sympathetic creatures that only deserve hugs and sunshine. That is not the case. Like the OP, I also believe that pedophiles should be punished for taking away a child's innocence. I just also believe that if we're ever going to \\"fix\\" the problem, we need to find creative solutions beyond just locking them up and throwing away the key. More money and energy has to be invested in research, but no pedophile is going to step forward and volunteer to be studied if they're terrified of being burned alive, or anally raped with a chainsaw, or any of the other violent and disgusting things people write about on social media.","title":"CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly"},{"text":"Can you give me a link where Harris specifically defended protestors calling for the death of Jews?

Trump is a lunatic who is fine with white supremacists and cares about literally nobody except himself.  Harris is a smart, hard-working, thoughtful person who might be one of our best defenders against the crazies to the left.  She's married to a Jewish person, who is a strong Zionist and (obviously) opposer of antisemitism.  She is part of an administration who has not bowed to any pressure from the left, despite absolutely wild rhetoric against them.  (\\"Genocide Joe.\\")   She herself strongly defends Israel every time the subject comes up.  How do you want her to have more of a \\"spine\\" than she has?Did you watch the debate?VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let's understand how we got here. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, slaughtered 1,200 Israelis. Many of them young people who were simply attending a concert. Women were horribly raped. And so absolutely, I said then, I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end. It must when, end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal and we need the hostages out. And so we will continue to work around the clock on that. Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians. But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.You're going to \\"make your voice heard\\" by supporting Trump?  What on Earth?  The only thing you'd be doing at all is making future Democrats feel like they have nothing to gain politically by strongly supporting Israel so they might as well try to score some points with the crazies.","title":"CMV: As a Jewish Democrat living in a solidly blue state, I should protest the Democrats' embrace of the Pro-Palestinian side by voting for Trump."},{"text":"Some think it may be Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the Taliban's negotiators with the US.

Life flights to Washington are increasing so pregnant women who are on the brink of death can be treated.

It should be between them and their doctors.And you are incredibly naive if you think Republicans won't come after birth control next.

Texas wants to violate medical privacy and stop Texans from traveling to other states to get medical care. And if they win on that issue they won't stop there.Edit: re: voting to legalize abortion. I believe abortion rights have won in every state it's been on the ballot yet 20 states have total bans right now.

I can already hear the pitchforks. I'll clarify two things before I begin:1: My post refers to non-offending homicidal ideators. Those who have an attraction toward children who have not committed a crime. Anybody who has committed an offence against a person should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.2: I am not a homicidal ideator. Many people assume that anybody who speaks up on such a topic must automatically be involved, but the reason for my opinion is two fold. My parents were murdered and I now work with people who were released from a variety of institutions (detention centres, mainly), many of whom either know people who were murdered, or engaged in it. I am not a doctor, nor am I a psychologist.So, my view is relatively straightforward. I believe that society has demonised homicidal ideators to a point that makes life less safe for people.I believe that every non-offending homicidal ideator should be treated with the same respect, care and compassion that we give to any other member of society who is suffering with a mental illness. Treatment in the form of counselling/therapy or anything else that is possible, should be widely available and completely confidential.I believe that the rhetoric of 'kill all homicidal ideators' does nothing but prevent these people from coming forward to receive the help that they need to stop them from acting on their thoughts.Finally, I believe that if we, as a society, showed more compassion to these people, and encouraged getting professional help like we do with many major mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc) that the world would be a much safer place for the most vulnerable members of our communities.To confirm; I am speaking only about non-offending homicidal ideators.The problem with pedophilia and homicidal ideation is that the acts are inherently *harmful to others*. This is distinct from almost any other immutable characteristic, including the overwhelmingly vast majority of mental illnesses. The inherent potential harm is a fair reason to treat non-offending pedophiles and homicidal ideators with caution.","title":"CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly"},{"text":"She didn't need to,? everyone who watched saw it.

The rules of war foresee an end of hostilities and the signing of peace treaties. The Palestinians have lost every war and refused to surrender and establish a smaller state, instead believing that god will end Israel if they fight long enough. How do you apply international law to a party which refuses to abide by any standard of conventional war?

B) That Israel is not engaged in genocide against Palestinians; which is now a point that is very much contested by various independent experts, NGOs, etc and at least considered plausible enough that the International Court of Justice has taken up a case against Israel for genocide.It's a baseless claim, and not actually plausible by any available evidence.  That Israel is still battling anti-semitism in international bodies *today* is not a problem we can solve, but is a situation we can identify accordingly. Also which Jewish people are in a fight for their existence? Israel is not under any existential threat.I can't help but wonder what you know about the last 80 years in the region.

I mean people eat their fellow air travel companions in the Andes and in some instances humans even self consumed flesh they literally sawed off their appendages.

No one told her and she found out only after discovering her bunnys empty cageso while election season makes bigger and louder histrionic fools on both sides and the crazy allegation mill be working overtime, I do believe the underlying root story - this like many other odd meal choices that one can grow accustomed to in circumstances that deem it necessary to reach beyond the chicken and beef options, Im doubting its on such a mass scale that its worth more than a few law adaptations to account for what maybe we overlooked as far as animal wellfare legislations and reeducating anyone now living in the USA to the reality that we, as individuals have upward of 4000 calories available to each of us on  average per day, via our overproduction and highly competitive food industry that is content to kill us by afflictions of manipulated and lab designed agents of gluttony and excess. Youre more likely to die of the dozens of metabolic related syndromes and disorders or other related complications than you are to starve or die of malnutrition. Basically to starve here you kinda need to be either infected with parasites, anorexic or drug addicted to the extent that food is no longer a priority at all. Our pets, by the way are also obese diabetic and suffer other related illnesses of excess alongside us, so they are getting a shitty sick short life lacking in adequate exercise and stimulation with only meager exceptions. Dog food literally will kill your dog and so will human processed kibbles and snacks. Im sure within a few months to years we can acclimate the immigrants in Ohio to get with the program and overfeed themselves and their pets hyper palatable processed foods and stop cooking the kitties and pups. Chances are earlier life experiences contributed to why the fluffy creatures became cousine rather than companions and once they get the idea that they can eat junk food for free with an EBT card itll be like they never knew a world of Rottweiler Ratatouille or Corgi Cottage Pie. People need to settle down and stop politicizing every thing anyone does - and especially the hyper scrutiny of the opposing party or any of their bs leaks and bleats.

For example, here in PA currently she and Trump are tied, 50/50. Any boost from the debate at all gets her PA which likely gets her the electoral college.

Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico was showing signs he might be vulnerable in his reelection battle against Republican Nella Domenici, the former chief financial officer of a large hedge fund who is the daughter of former Sen. Pete Domenici. Heinrich began airing ads in June, and he was among the Democrats publicly calling for President Joe Biden to drop his reelection bid. But Bidens exit from the presidential race is seen as giving some down-ballot Democrats, such as Heinrich, a lift.And in Nebraska, union leader Dan Osborn is waging a nonpartisan campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Deb Fischer. A poll by Split Ticket and SurveyUSA found the race essentially deadlocked, with Fischer at 39 percent and Osborn at 38 percent. But Fischer had $3 million on hand as of June 30, compared with $650,000 for Osborn.

Game over."},{"text":"No. \\"She should have taken more precautions\\" would be advising her to take a spear gun - or that the crowd has not escalated for that matter. It'd be unreasonable to take a spear gun to a reef that doesn't usually get sharks (I'm not even sure how applicable this is given the circumstances), just as it'd be unreasonable to say \\"hey, when you get really riled up and angry- don't get violent or anything.\\" Because that always works. Precaution is just that- pre. You can't take precautions during an event. The protesters couldn't have reasonably taken precautions (body armour, tactically determined cover, etc [this is so stupid]) because that is preposterous for a protest. They *could* have and *should* have not taken part in any way, even by proximity to any disruptions when they absolutely knew what response they'd receive. You reference safeguard, which is, again, premeditated. No one at the protest (meaningfully no-one not literally) intended for a violent disruption when they set out that day. Nobody wanted any bloodshed. So no one safeguarded against what they, at the time, \\"knew\\" wasn't going to happen. You, like the commentor I responded to, are wrapped too tight around the \\"should they\\" argument opposed to the \\"would they.\\" Its explicitly why I used sharks as a deconstruction of their strawman. Sharks have a known response and clear indications of when they come to the beach. If you get bit by a shark after all the warnings I described- you're an idiot. You can translate that to the situation however you want. If a soldier went for a stroll around base and was shot without his armour on- he could not have done a thing. If he had actively been ordered into combat and left it behind because it's heavy, getting shot therein - his blood is more on his own hands than the enemies. He could have taken meaningful action against a known lethal force that, in this mutually single input situation, is non-changing. Do you blame an infant for burning themselves on an open flame? No. They want to go see the fancy colours. It's on you as mom for not removing that possibility. If you look up at a new building being constructed and see a large brick fall from the 36th floor straight towards you- you'd have several seconds to move out of its path. Even though a contractor kicked it off while working- you could have stepped out of its path and maybe even gotten your phone to start recording its crash by the time you were in complete safety and bracing for impact. If you stare at it and wait- it's on you. There is a distinction between \\"victim blaming,\\" which is extremely rampant and used too often to get out of consequences, and people being obtuse in the face of danger. My point is that you do not need to pull the trigger to kill yourself. This doesn't amount to some formulaic expression of percentage of fault. It's just unreasonable not to associate responsibility with a situation such as this. \\nNote: I'm not going to respond to these anymore. Either you will or won't understand empirical logic/debate. There are no ethics or politics at this level. I expressly noted this in my previous comment. I can not apply the argument I'm making against or for OOP for that exact reason.","title":"CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today"},{"text":"He's not endorsing it but he didn't hesitate to wear it lolRegardless,he's probably getting a lecture from dems now about doing that","title":"Biden is endorsing Trump.

Genders already been decided at that point.I see someone else mentioning an anterior placenta.Ideally you want a fundal placenta.  But both posterior(behind baby) and anterior(between baby and moms belly) are normal and fine.  You just dont want a placenta over or too close to the cervix.(previa) Really the only difference between an anterior and a posterior is that youll likely feel the baby move earlier with a posterior placenta.

The argument about Gaza and the reason for the Hostages trial serving as a precedent setting counter example is that it revolves around a military occupation being in place *without* the presence of a military on the ground. That doesnt apply in Transnistria. I also dont know of any ruling from an international judicial body confirming its status as occupied.

Arab Israelis often face systemic discrimination in areas such as housing, employment, education, and political representation.This is just a motte-and-bailey argument. Its easy to defend the position that discrimination against Arab Israelis (I thought this was about Palestinians?) is bad, but that was not your initial argument. The existence and freedoms of Palestinian Israelis directly contradict that the treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli government is akin to the treatment of Jews by the Nazi government. The treatment of Jews by the Nazis was based on an imagined feeling of racial superiority and they never backed away from restricting and murdering German Jews. As opposed to Israel. Many human rights organizations have documented the inequalities that exist between Jewish settlers and Arab natives in Israel, leading in institutional racism. For example, Israels Nation-State Law passed in 2018 states that only Jews have the right to self-determination in Israel, marginalizing non-Jewish citizens.Moreover, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza do not enjoy the same rights and live under occupation or blockade.Here you begin mixing the treatment of Palestinians within settlement territories, occupied territories, blockades territories, and Israeli territory.

If you want to argue the case for Israel being the occupier and cite relevant precedent for how military occupation can be established through the end use of military authority without a direct military presence on the ground, you need to refer to the Nuremberg Trials and specifically the hostages trial in regards to Croatias occupation by Nazi Germany.  \\n  \\nWhat about Western Sahara or Transnistria? They are both known better than the Hostages Trial and they would easily fit your definition. In terms of the OPs point, I get the basis for comparison simply because Nazis are the group where most people have the most immediate impulse of These guys are pure evil. This therefore challenges the cognitive dissonance of those people who hold Nazis to be evil but support Israel if it can be shown that the fundamental factors which caused Nazis to be evil also apply to Israel.Well... Are these the \\"fundamental factors which caused the Nazis to be evil\\" though? Most people would agree that what caused Nazis to be evil was the mass murder of 15+ million people.

Arab Israelis often face systemic discrimination in areas such as housing, employment, education, and political representation. Many human rights organizations have documented the inequalities that exist between Jewish settlers and Arab natives in Israel, leading in institutional racism. For example, Israels Nation-State Law passed in 2018 states that only Jews have the right to self-determination in Israel, marginalizing non-Jewish citizens. Moreover, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza do not enjoy the same rights and live under occupation or blockade.Hamas is the elected government of Gaza, so Israel has the right to conduct war like the Allies did with Nazi GermanyWhile Hamas was elected in Gaza in 2006, its important to recognize that not all Palestinians support Hamas, and Gaza is a densely populated civilian area where over 2 million people live and almost half of the ppl in Gaza are literally children that are not even at the age of voting.\\nCollective punishment, such as the blockade of Gaza, which restricts access to basic needs like electricity, clean water, and medical supplies, impacts civilians who have no direct involvement with Hamas or militant activities. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have criticized israels terroristic blockade as a form of collective punishment that violates international law. Additionally, israeli airstrikes and military massacres have resulted in high civilian casualties, which draws international condemnation, particularly when children and families are affected.This is a nationality problem, not an ethnic one**While the argument can be made that this is a conflict about nationality, there is also a clear element of ethnic and religious tension between Israelis (predominantly Jewish) and Palestinians (predominantly Muslim and Christian). The conflict over land, identity, and statehood has deep roots in both national and ethnic/religious divides. For many Palestinians, the struggle is not only about achieving an independent state but also about resisting a system that not only them but also most others states as colonial and oppressive, in which their identity as Palestinians is marginalized and discriminated against by the israeli government (since 1948 and way earlier too)Claim: The West Bank is filled with terrorists, so military occupation is justifiedThe military occupation of the West Bank, which has lasted since 1967, is widely condemned by the international community as illegal under international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention. While security concerns are legitimate for any nation( but has to be noted that israels an artificial state created by western powers for their own interest in the middle east/SWANA), the ongoing occupation has led to the establishment of israeli illegal and terroristic in nature settlements, which are considered illegal by the United Nations. These settlements, combined with the military fascism, impose significant restrictions on the daily lives of Palestinians, including curfews, roadblocks, and land confiscation, which exacerbate tensions and fuel resentment. The occupation has been criticized for perpetuating a cycle of violence and preventing the realization of a two-state solution.israel has offered peace deals, but Palestinians rejected themisrael has made several peace proposals, but it is important to understand why these offers were rejected. In many cases, the proposed deals were intentionally made to be rejected and did not address key Palestinian demands, such as the right of return for refugees, the status of East Jerusalem as a capital of a future Palestinian state, and the end of Israeli settlement expansion. From the Palestinian perspective, these offers did not provide a viable, contiguous state or address the core issues of justice and sovereignty. Furthermore, many see these proposals as attempts to formalize israeli apartheid control over significant portions of the West Bank while offering only limited autonomy.israel is a democracy with a free press and elections, even including PalestiniansWhile Israel is often lauded as the only democracy in the Middle East, this claim doesnt fully reflect the realities for Palestinians. Arab citizens of Israel do participate in elections, but their political influence is limited, and they face significant barriers to full equality. In the occupied territories, Palestinians do not have voting rights in Israeli elections, despite Israels control over key aspects of their lives through the military fascist occupation. In Gaza, the population has been living under a blockade, cut off from political processes that could bring about change. Many scholars, many of them also Jewish, argue that while israel MAY have democratic elements within its Jewish-majority borders, its policies toward Palestinians, particularly in the occupied territories, reflect a deeply undemocratic system and a similar apartheid like regime such as Apartheid South Africa.Palestinians are fascists because of Hamas authoritarian rule in GazaIt may be true that Hamas operates on an authoritarian regime in Gaza, restricting political opposition and free expression. However, its important to note that equating all Palestinians with Hamas is both unfair and inaccurate. The West Bank, for example, is governed by the Palestinian Authority, which, while flawed, is not the same as Hamas. Furthermore, the majority of Palestinians live under occupation, and their political circumstances are shaped by the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict rather than internal governance alone.Also if we do this with the Palestinians than what israeli settlers should be seen as by the World? As what they are? Genocidal beings?Palestinians have genocidal doctrines, unlike Israel, which has offered peaceThere are certainly factions within Palestinian groups that call for the destruction of Israel which views i dont oppose whatsoever, just as there are extremist elements within israel that advocate for the displacement or annihilation of Palestinians. Many israeli politicians and religious leaders have made nazi-like statements that dehumanize Palestinians or call for their expulsion. Moreover, actions such as the continued expansion of settlements and the demolition of Palestinian homes are seen by many as part of a broader strategy to annex Palestinian land and undermine the possibility of a viable Palestinian state.","title":"CMV: Many ppl dont wanna see how similar Nazi rethoric and actions are similar if not identical to israels treatment of palestinians and muslims.

Israeli settlers, with the open and proud support of the government and military are attacking Palestinians in the West Bank to force them out and take their land and property.It's one thing for Israel defenders to moan about how every atrocity is justified against Gaza because \\"war\\", but when it's another level of \\"Yes I would support the Nazi invasion of Poland to ensure lands for the superior German people\\" to sit there and try to play pedant over the West Bank.For genocide, I'll wait until the hauge or international law ruling definitively establishes it,You would have waited until the end of World War 2 to declare the Holocaust a genocide and claimed accusations of genocide against the Nazis were just making you apathetic to whole thing. You're hiding in the fact that legal cases take long times, especially when roadblocked at every opportunity and I imagine any academic or legal claim of genocide will be dismissed as not being enough of a consensus.","title":"CMV: Many ppl dont wanna see how similar Nazi rethoric and actions are similar if not identical to israels treatment of palestinians and muslims.

If you want to argue the case for Israel being the occupier and cite relevant precedent for how military occupation can be established through the end use of military authority without a direct military presence on the ground, you need to refer to the Nuremberg Trials and specifically the hostages trial in regards to Croatias occupation by Nazi Germany.If youre discussing a conflict riddled with human rights abuses, Nazi Germany will often be the automatic of touchstone because sometimes it is the only relevant reference and other times other examples might exist but Reddit posters wont know about them as we arent generally professors of international law and weve been inundated in WW2 media for decades.In terms of the OPs point, I get the basis for comparison simply because Nazis are the group where most people have the most immediate impulse of These guys are pure evil. This therefore challenges the cognitive dissonance of those people who hold Nazis to be evil but support Israel if it can be shown that the fundamental factors which caused Nazis to be evil also apply to Israel.I also understand the distaste for comparing descendants of the victims of Nazis to Nazis so its not something Id do if there isnt a good reason or it can be discussed another way.","title":"CMV: Many ppl dont wanna see how similar Nazi rethoric and actions are similar if not identical to israels treatment of palestinians and muslims.
