Hillary was a terrible candidate in 2016, buy you forget that as much as she wasn't good, she was loathed and despised as well. Anyone running against her would have won, including Donald Trump, who she allegedly helped in the primary because she thought she'd beat him most easily. Sanders is not going to win an election in the US for president, the American people aren't ready to elect an acknowledged socialist. Every nursing home in the country would awaken its population to make sure of it.In 2016, the 3rd canadadate running in the Democrat primary, Jim Webb would have beaten Trump, IMHO. He was well-spoken, moderate, military veteran, senator, etc. He had populist policies, like Trump, but more left leaning and without the baggage. Trump wasn't the powerhouse he became yet.\\nNow, your next mistake is deeming Trumps first term as disastrous. You don't have to like the man to give him credit where credit is due. Failing to do so will continue the slide of the democratic party and it's lack of recognition of the common man. Prior to covid 19, the US economy was among the best it's ever been. Unemployment was almost all time lows, wages going up faster than inflation. Trump was getting nations to normalize relations with Israel, working on peace with North Korea... Russia was afraid to invade Ukraine, he turned out to be a profit with NATO nations getting them to kick up funding and try and get off Russian oil and gas. Covid19 was a disaster world wide, and his handling of it is defiantly mischaracterized. Few people who say his response was disastrous offer real plans that would have been better. There were massive deaths world wide, many American death were people that had covid when they died, not died because of it. There was a famous case where a guy was loved as a covid death when he had a motorcycle accident. Also he was opposed at every turn anytime he tried to set policy. Remember when he killed flights from China and Europe and Nancy Pelosi was calling him a racist bigot and encouraging people to goto Chinese new year in huge crowds? Or when he tried to reopen the economy after the initial 2 week shut down and was stopped by pretty much every blue state governor? Or how he gets blamed for covid deaths that governors like Cuomo and others were putting highly infectious covid patients in nursing homes (with some of the most vulnerable people)? Covid deaths were also higher under Biden.... 384k under Trumps 1 year, 462k under Bidens 1st year of covid alone. I'm not about to sit here and say Bidens response to Covid killed people or the like, but i am pointing out that any idea that a different response would have produced different results, when deaths went up after Biden took office demonstrates that the disastrous response you think it was is really propaganda. Then there's the elephant in the room, the 2020 election.... remember Trump got more moves than any sitting president in the history of our nation. The Vast majority which came in on election day at polling locations. Biden beat him, mostly with mail in ballots, there's real questions how many of those mail in ballots would have been people showing up if they had to, many of them were people who casually mailed in a ballot because it was at their house and didn't care enough to show up. There's alsonthe fact that the laws and policies were changed in many places to allow for mail in ballots, many of which weren't legal processes and while people will tell you this was proven wrong in court..... it wasn't. It was ruled the petitioners didn't have standing to complain, not that they were right or wrong. Texas v. Pensylvania should have been heard by SCOTUS to put all that to bed and they punted it..... by the way, PA determined later on that they didn't follow the proper procedure for that after the decision was meaning less. Trump may or may not have beaten Biden in 2020 without covid, well never know, but the 2020 election certainly strengthened Trump amongst his base. There's no way he would have lost to Biden in a rematch. Just based on his energized base. Harris was part of an administration that was seen as unfavorable. Its odd to me that so many party loyalists can't see this, but the only people that \\"liked\\" the Biden admin were democrats. Harris had no shot against him, likeable or not just by being part of the Biden admin. Throw on the fact she wasn't liked by her party in 2020 when she didn't get a single delegate vote. And the lack of primary completely deflates any talk about \\"saving democracy\\". She had no shot even if she was running against Trump, but she ran against him, and an energized version as well.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Proper Title:  Zuckerburg bribes Trump in an effort to be left alone.

Basically it hasn't been adapted to changing demographics and wealth distributions.](https://www.cato.org/white-paper/cato-institute-report-department-government-efficiency-doge#shrink-social-security) In essence, the program operates like a Ponzi scheme: Paying benefits promised to earlier generations depends on new revenues from current and future workers. With an aging population, the worker-to-beneficiary ratio has been decreasing, making Social Securitys finances increasingly unsustainableIt's also incredibly unfair to workers in it's current form.  older generations tend to be wealthier than the younger generations paying for their Social Security benefits. This creates a system in which the federal government effectively redistributes hard-earned dollars from poorer workers to wealthier retirees. Notably, high-earning retirees can receive up to $60,000 in Social Security benefits annually, regardless of their other income and assets.They have some great suggestions about how to fix it, my favorite of which is a flat benefit scheme. Basically fix the program to only target senior poverty instead of being a mix between poverty reduction and a poorly run government pension program.","title":"Why is this sub pro cutting social security?"},{"text":"Pennies implies more than zero pennies.","title":"Some disabled workers are making pennies per hour.

In fact, she doubled down on a political aesthetics that aligned her with the image of the Democrat elite--she shared her stages with a bunch of out-of-touch rich celebrities.How might a Democrat have won in 2024? Very simple: The Democrats would easily have won if they ran a left wing populist whose goal was to fight for the working class and push through transformative changes that would restore power to the working class. I.e. \\"On day one of my campaign, I will begin the work of setting up a FREE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL program. On day one of my campaign, I will fight for a $20/hour minimum wage. etc etc\\" This sort of campaign would easily win 80% of the vote.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Ya because we all know that banks are completely capable of strict self regulation","title":"Trump Advisers Seek to Shrink or Eliminate Bank Regulators"},{"text":"Wow-every independent stupid enough to think what Trump said could be taken seriously.?","title":"Donald Trump Changes Tune on Project 2025'Very Conservative and Very Good'"},{"text":"Celebrity endorsements are about all the Ds had this election.

People not having to take time off of work was likely the largest contributing factor to the record turnout. As well as mail in voting making it easier than ever to vote.I would also like to highlight the voting shift at a macro level.Biden secured [81,283,501](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#:~:text=Biden%20received%20the%20majority%20in,Bush%20in%201992.) votes in 2020, and Kamala secured 74,983,555 currently. 81,283,501 - 74,983,555 = 6,299,946 less votes.Trump in 2020 secured [74,223,975](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#:~:text=Biden%20received%20the%20majority%20in,Bush%20in%201992.) and 77,269,255 currently. 77,269,255 - 74,223,975 = 3,045,280 more votes.They undid it, and the only real reason is laziness and complacency.I feel like this assumes all of the people who voted in 2020 and didn't in 2024 would have voted for Kamala. I think there's much more at play than \\"laziness and complacency\\" among voters who voted in 2020 vs now. I also think Trumps increased share of voters indicates that some people switched from voting Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024.

Inflation was on the way down, gas prices were down. Unemployment was low. That Americans still voted for Trump after that Madison Square Garden Nazi rally, where some of the ugliest, most hateful, and most ridiculous rhetoric was spewed, and despite being warned about Project 2025, and its nightmare vision for America, demonstrates the extent to which propaganda &amp; disinformation have infected the minds of Americans.

Tradition. The mind set of \\"My pappy was a republican and so was his pappy and his pappy before him\\", is ingrained into the mind of the average Republican voter. They vote NOT because the party has their best interests in mind (red states are the poorest and most heavily dependent on social services), but because it's \\"tradition\\". Like being affiliated with a political party is some kind of inherited right. \\\\#2. Hatred. Republicans know how to speak hate. They know how to play on the fears and ignorance of their base. It's not hard. Most Republican communities are rather isolated, small rural towns where mostly everyone is related. (cue the dueling banjos) They don't know much about the outside world and most have never even been to a city or major population center. All they know are people from the same color, same religion, same town and same mindset. They have no exposure to what the world is really like. Couple that with the bullshit Fucks Newz feeds them, they think everything outside of their little \\"parish\\" is full of terrorists, rapists, murderers and that their town is the only safe, sane place in the world. Republicans promise to bring that ignorance to the major cities and turn the whole country into what their little ignorant towns are like, and it makes them feel safer. Then the Republicans turn around, rob their pensions, slash their benefits, drive away their jobs and plunge them further into poverty and the morons buy it as \\"sacrificing for the greater good\\", when in reality they're just being played for fools.\\\\#3. Raging stupidity. The average Republican voter has been scientifically proven to have less receptive, less intuitive and less analytical minds. They're more like animals than anything else, reacting to emotion and sudden stimulus than actually sitting down and thinking about that is going on and figuring out a plan. They just react and that's it. Think primitive neanderthals throwing rocks at the sky to make the thunder stop scaring them. It doesn't do anything, but they keep doing it until the lightning strikes them, but by then it's too late. The same applies to their voting. They think if they keep throwing the rocks (republicans) at the sky (the world) it'll somehow stop the thunder and lightning and make it do what they want, but they keep getting struck by the lightning (shitty republican policy).So, why do people keep voting republican? They're traditionally hate-filled and incredibly stupid.","title":"South Carolina Republicans Set To Reintroduce Bill Allowing Death Penalty For Abortions"},{"text":"Exactly!

Ask anyone who's worked with him over the last 50 years. Ask his father, who spent a lifetime digging this idiot out of one failure after the next. Project 2025 is written by the same people who told Donald what to think in his first administration. He followed their policies and elected their judges. They were the hand inside the puppet. And just like any puppeteer, they got better with practice. The first adminsitration was the rehearsal, THIS is the real deal. It is the perfection of running a society for the exclusive benefit of the top 1%, while simultaneously making a bunch of self-congratulatory idiots think that he's running the show for them.The founding fathers largely based a lot of what we are on Plato's Republic ,and Plato, like our founding fathers (who were well educated elites), regarded most people as idiots. To allow a group of morons to have direct say over every single issue without guidance or education would lead to a non-functional state. So, we have an indirect democracy, a republic (from the latin, res publica, or \\"public actiuon/undertaking). But even with our form of indirect democracy (republicanism), it requires an educated populace in order to elect worthy representatives. That's part of why Benjamin Franklin's response to Elizabeth Willing Powel's question: \\"Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?\\" was \\"A republic, if you can keep it.\\" He knew that democracy was messy business and that it generally deteriorated, usually into authoritarianism, so it was on the people to remain educated to the state of things and to vote accordingly.Well, by electing Trump, we've just headed further down the path that Franklin and many of the other founding fathers feared that we could eventually travel with a democratic government. We've elected a fear mongering demagog who does nothing but appeal to people's fear and hatred rather than to their higher faculties. And they wouldn't blame it so much on the demagog himself as much as on the self-indulgent, unthinking people who elected him. Or as Jeffereson put it, The government you elect is the government you deserve.It's ironic that Trump voters say that they revere the founding fathers and find them to be divinely inspired while knowing basically nothing about them or what they discussed during our formation. They would find Trump voters to be the very kind of people that they thought needed to be kept in check and largely disregarded.","title":"Donald Trump Changes Tune on Project 2025'Very Conservative and Very Good'"},{"text":"The time to do that was during your first term, Donnie.

Even hoover's meeting with Hitler post presidency was more about refugees and the status of jews. And after ww2 continued organizing aid and support to war ravaged Europe. Hoover was a flawed intelligent individual with generally good intentions but bad policies. Trump is more just lucky incompetent with selfish intentions and bad policies.","title":"Trump advisers seek to shrink or eliminate bank regulators, WSJ reports"},{"text":"Common China W","title":"Xi Jinping Rejects Donald Trump's Inauguration Invitation: Report"},{"text":"?

He has gotten more of his agenda passed in 4 years despite being gridlocked by the house and the 2 sellout senators Sinema and Manchin, than any of the other presidents since FDR. Once Trump is in office, people on the left and right will be longing for the days when Biden's public speaking gaffes were the only flaws his political enemies could pin on him. He had more working knowledge and experience of to get bills passed and ran an efficient cabinet with complete professionals. While he could be seen as going soft on Trump crimes, constitutionally he's not really supposed to be policing his political enemies. it's not his job. I blame congress, the senate, and the judicial branch for that. He did what a president was supposed to do. As for losing to trump. I think history is going to look back at how soft and complacent apathetic the American public has become, where so many young people couldn't be bothered to even show up to vote despite Trumps very public felonies, treason, rape, lies, and evidence of being a compromised mole working on behalf of foreign adversaries.  Assuming that there wasn't some election rigging or voter fraud that Trump has successfully gotten away with that will come to light later, The American people are going to take the blame for essentially handing our govt to a wannabe dictator.If you were around for Reagan, he literally had alzheimer's in office, it was an open secret that his cabinet tried to keep hidden as much as possible.

Now it's nearly $500 for single coverage. This was the cost of insuring millions of unhealthy welfare recipients and ER visits for illegals. Nevermind the penalties I had to pay with my tax return for not signing up for ACA when I was between jobs.Before the ACA you could pay $5 per month toward your medical bills, and it wouldn't affect your credit as long as you were paying consistently. Those days are long gone. Now we've got people going bankrupt over medical bills.The ACA did to America what the subprime mortgage loan scam did, only this directly gets people killed instead of homeless.For our country to survive, we need something completely different. We need to ability to shop for better doctors, alternative treatments, and not being required to use insurance for minor things. We need upfront pricing that can be haggled *before* the treatment is agreed to. But most of all we need transparency on the deals made between healthcare providers and insurance companies that affect us directly.

In 1991That's quite a long time before the current federal constitution was established in 2012.Somalilands territorial boundaries are disputed, with several regions opposing Somalilands bid for independence.?Plenty of countries have border disputes. We recognize Belize as a country even if 100% of its territory is claimed by Guatemala.If Somaliland sought independence solely within the territory predominantly inhabited by its own clan, that would be somewhat more understandable.?I want to clarify that I am not necessarily in favor of a recognition of independence right at this moment. Given the conflict in the east of Somaliland and credible accusations of human rights violations, it seems better to try to organize some sort of general peace process through negotiation between Somaliland, the Somalian federal government, Puntland and Jubaland. This might very well result in an independent Somaliland consisting of less land overall, but who knows.  Maybe they could get a better federal system that is less prone to the issues they are currently facing. It might also result in the full disintegration of united Somalia and the establishment of a number of smaller states. Regardless,  I think we can hopefully all agree that the option that results in the least amount of unnecessary death is best overall.Though Trump just got elected, so any hope of the US helping that peace process is probably out the window.","title":"Why Somaliland Shouldnt Be Recognized as the Worlds Newest Country"},{"text":"The sovereignty of a nation depends on a 50.1% majority vote lol","title":"Why Somaliland Shouldnt Be Recognized as the Worlds Newest Country"},{"text":"Its even simpler than that.

If you were approaching it from a nationalist point of view that we should be breaking down the clan structure to build a nation as opposed to incentivizing dissolution along clan ties then Id be more open. Also your point about a breakaway region is framed disingenuously to support your argument. Not only has Somaliland been de facto independent for almost 30 years the breakaway region is being supported by Somalia, the country which the world is claiming has sovereignty over the region.

They wrote about how if Democrats caught on to this plan during the counting of votes, they would only figure it out after the point that it would be too late for them to stop it.  They wrote about how certain state's electors were being cautious by wanting to make their fake elector paperwork contingent on litigation overturning enough votes such that they would become the truly legitimate electors.  They also wrote about how if too many state's fake electors demanded this contingency statement, it would sink their plan.  But the plausible denialability of this plot is that they were only filing the elector paper work just in case Litigation changed state election outcomes.John Eastman, one of the conspirators that eventually got disbarred for his role in this, remained defiant, even after all of this evidence came out, essentially acknowledged that investigators correctly understood the contours of the plot, but that it all was perfectly legal.Even after two of the states' fake elector's paperwork contained the language that they were only valid dependent on litigation overturning the state's votes, all seven states fake electors were delivered to congress, and utilized as if they were legitimate.Kenneth Chesebro, the lawyer that brought this general theory to the attention of the Trump Campaign, has already plead guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to file false documents in the Georgia case.

I really dont think its lack of education. My own belief is that it largely is influenced by genetics. To me it seems there isnt room at the top for everyone to be great leaders so natural selection has made it so only  the best people are at the top of society while less intelligent people who make up the larger classes doing less mentally demanding jobs reproduce more. So you get a lot of average folks who are easily influenced by propaganda etc. I know this could be completely wrong but talking to people day to day and hearing the dumb things that come out of their mouths really makes me think there is some huge divide between intelligent people and unintelligent people. Not everyone can be rich just as everyone cannot be a genius. The unintelligent get to vote and there is more of them so we end up where we are. I do think democracy will always fail in the long run.

So really, the only way that nation states can work in some areas of SSA is in smaller countries based on a certain clan. Clans are essentially precursors to modern, larger ethnicities, and I don't think it's right to dismiss them as a basis for states (not to mention it's slightly racist to see the more granular identities of Africa as less real or whatever). If Somalia's future is to fracture into small clan-based countries, so be it.

Trump"},{"text":"Maybe, if we'd had a realistic candidate, who we the people chose- they could've.Say what you want, but they lied to us. Everyone knew how Joe was looking, and both he and the entire democrat party was in favor of running him. \\"SHARP AS A TACK\\" They said, over and over and over until... oops. He has to be on TV?The NEXT day the stories were all the same. Everyone called a spade a spade. So, either the dems didn't know he was like that, and lied about what shape he was in. Or, they did know, and lied to the American people. Either way, they lied to the American people. (conspiracy theory) It's my firm belief that those events unfolded as they were planned. Kamala being installed as the candidate once it was FAR too late for a primary, was by design. They just didn't plan on it pissing so many of us off.THEN. Those traitorous fucks trotted DICK FUCKING CHENEY out there. Say whatever you want about Trump, but I was actually alive during the Bush years, and lemme tell you- guilt by association. Dick Cheney is one of the two worst warhawks this country has ever produced. He is a fucking traitor to our nation, and should be withering alone in a cold dark cell- not parading around presidential candidates.No one who brings Dick fucking Cheney out of retirement as a campaign tool is a realistic or serious candidate. I was already on the fence of skipping the presidential ballot, but seeing that fucking traitor being propped up by the dems was the last straw for me.A realistic candidate, is one the people choose, who actually wants to make our lives more prosperous, and doesn't have traitors amongst their midst. When that happens, more people in the center are going to return to voting democrat. My fear is, they're going to double down instead of realizing their mistakes.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"I once read an article positing that most arguments really aren't about weighing the cons and benefits of a given policy: each side is instead attempting to reduce morality points of the other. Critically, to steal points one can associate a policy with other low-opinion values.For example, say B is arguing that CEQA doesn't harm development. B might deploy the following point-based argument:- B: Opponents of CEQA are evil corporate developers.  \\n- B: Only fascists would want to destroy CEQA.\\n- B: CEQA protects the environment and helps disadvantaged communities.  \\n- B: CEQA is democratically elected so responsive to voter needs.Here B attempts to reduce the points of counterarguments by associating them with the negative-opinion concept fascism and \\"evil corporate developers\\". Similarly, they attempt to associate themselves with high value opinions \\"protecting disadvantaged communities\\" and \\"enironment\\", \\"democracy.\\" However, none of these are rebuttals to the original statement --- CEQA harms development!I feel like that is what is occuring here, to an extremely blatant degree: Hegseth is attempting to associate \\"gay people\\" with the negative \\"Marxism.\\" But, crtically, even if many gays are Marxist that still doesn't mean that homesexuality is bad! It just means there is an association for whatever reason, between gays and Marxism. Correlation is not causation! [1] These kinds of arguments take advantage of shortcuts in the human brain, I feel. Most of us rely on cached opinions, because making new opinions is hard! These point-arguments try to take advantage of that caching tendency, resulting in garbage statements like those of Hegseth.\\n\\\\[1\\\\]: This is just an example from the text. Even if there was a correlation, that still doesn't mean homosexuality is bad lol. Freedom of speech trumps all!

Part of the reason we're struggling with the working-class vote is because when over half of those voting Dem have college degrees (maybe check my math on that one), a significant part of your base wants policy to be explained and delivered to them in a way that means nothing at best and comes off as elitist verbal effluvia at worst to those not in that bubble.I figured that gap would kind of normalize on its own. Dems are likely going to simplify the messaging a bit in the next few elections, and as of the last time I checked exit polling data, we already did a little better with the mythical white male blue collar vote than we did in 2020. Those voters are getting tired of the party of the culture war, for instance a lot of folks in Appalachia like me heard nary a peep out of our Republican representatives after the hurricane outside of ads raging about trans people.I didn't expect Trump to show up and give handouts to the educated/high earning for the same reason I don't expect most Dems to compromise on things like abortion and LGBT+ rights (though I expect them to show up less in the messaging for other not fully related reasons), half the reason their respective teams like them is because they don't do those things.","title":"Trump Advisers Consider Raising SALT Write-Off Limit to $20,000"},{"text":"Well that is what those billionaire fucks have private islands for","title":"Trump to discuss ending childhood vaccination programs with RFK Jr."},{"text":"That is entirely false.

It would've been awkward if I admitted you changed my view before you were sure of what you were saying. Great job, !delta. The biggest factors for me were the 42% approval rating amongst Republicans in his state, and your point about the Midwest states largely voting as a bloc. I think I'm not quite so sure about your other points however. While the economy seems to have recovered well under his leadership, those graphs look similar for the federal government, and Kamala still lost on that. The idea that Trump couldn't attack Shapiro for things the federal government did is, I think, valid, but not in the way you suggested in that last paragraph. If just any state governor was immune to Trump's criticism, then there would be several replacements for Kamala that could've won. I think Shapiro is substantially better equipped to deal with Trump than most other state governors because Shapiro held strong Democratic and Republican support in a purple state with a split government (Republican legislature). He's genuinely a liberal, not a DINO or even really a moderate, but he's able to gather respect of Republican voters and work with a Republican legislature. Altogether, that makes him wiley.

More and more money needs to get taxed from less and less base which to some degree stalls out consumption among younger generations and leaves them in a more financially precarious position. Since its based on the 35 highest earning years and when you first filed for benefits you can have ex. millionaires getting paid out up to $58476 annually (with cost of living adjustments to come) after they file at 70 and that hardly seems necessary to prevent those particular people from living undignified lives in desperate poverty which is nominally the point of the program. A bit over a fifth of the entire budget of the federal government goes to social security alone so its competing quite successfully against many many other priorities that some people may prefer.\\nIt seems to me like the effective transfer of money from poorer younger generations to generally wealthier older generations is a bad idea. Ex. if you can support a younger person who is sick or uneducated to become healthy or skilled then that can benefit society for the duration of their health/use of those skills during which theyre more productive, which could be a really long. But by giving it instead to older people who have already retired and dont have as long to go you dont really get much of a raise in productivity over a career but instead elevated savings and more consumption of goods and services that they need or want.\\nIdk maybe Im just cynical about it as Ive seen my dads old gajillionaire boss brag about how he was maxing out social security and someone else insisting that they would collect every penny of it available to them all the time so that none of the money would be available for the government to spend on (and I quote) the blacks. That and given that its precariously funded itll probably blow up before Im in a position to get mine but Im sure to pay out increasingly for it in the meantime which is annoying.\\nAs counterpoints it has helped a lot of people elderly or even not so elderly who had to cash out in a pinch avoid disaster when other income streams werent available or enough, and it being available to everyone surely helps make it a more popular and resilient program to getting cut than it it were more narrowly targeted. I may have my own dislikes for it but I dont think its actually going anywhere, at least not for long.","title":"Why is this sub pro cutting social security?"},{"text":"Something smells fishy","title":"Jeff Bezos reportedly following in Mark Zuckerberg's footsteps with a $1 million donation from Amazon to Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"Gotta call it something else so it doesnt seem so bad, like the Fantastic Recession","title":"Economic fallout from Trump mass deportations could eclipse Great Recession: Report"},{"text":"Trump the peacemaker.

Would Biden allow anyone other than Kamala to run?), but I think we've agreed there at this point.Explain to me why he's able to convince voters that he could fix the economy where Biden couldn't, or why he can make America great while Trump couldn't.Alright, I'll give it my best shot:Josh Shapiro specifically has two strong advantages here. One is that he is very popular, both in general and among Trump voters:[https://archive.ph/9Ai9J](https://archive.ph/9Ai9J)[https://archive.ph/20241107112928/https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-governor-josh-shapiro-polls-20240919.html](https://archive.ph/20241107112928/https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-governor-josh-shapiro-polls-20240919.html)If you're operating on the assumption that you need to take votes from Trump to win, I think he's the most likely candidate to be able to do that. On top of that:?Given that winning the election probably required winning the popular vote by?*at least*?3%Josh Shapiro is probably the most likely candidate to break this convention. As mentioned, he is extremely popular in Pennsylvania, which is the most important state to winning. That should give him an advantage in the election math, meaning he probably doesn't need to win the popular vote by quite as much. On top of that, if that logic holds, he likely has favour across all of the midwest swing states, which have voted together presidentially in every election since 1988. If he wins those three states, he wins the presidency.   \\nWhat about the economy? On Josh Shapiro's watch, Pennsylvania is doing quite well economically. [https://usafacts.org/topics/economy/state/pennsylvania/](https://usafacts.org/topics/economy/state/pennsylvania/) . That gives him something to point to in terms of building an economic plan.But honestly, I think it may be as simple as any choice that was not Trump or the previous administration would get a strong advantage in the election. Trump can't attack Shapiro effectively on the border because he has nothing to do with it. Trump's most effective attack line against Kamala is also gone. He can't point out that Shapiro said he wouldn't do anything different from Biden, and he can't say \\"Why didn't you do it already?\\" Honestly, I've largely convinced myself. I don't know what Trump really can attack Shapiro with. I think he would have a really good shot at winning.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Lol I'm shocked","title":"Trump just announced his plan to lower prices and help Americans who voted for cheaper goods."},{"text":"Hawk Tuah coin","title":"Trump Advisers Seek to Shrink or Eliminate Bank Regulators"},{"text":": breaker of narratives.Meh","title":"Scott Jennings Sums Up The Reason For Trumps Political Comeback In Just Three Words"},{"text":"The more he speaks the crazier he sounds.","title":"Elon Musk calls homelessness a lie and propaganda  and Trump is listening"},{"text":"LMFAOO Barron Trump as a LOL player is an interesting thought.","title":"'Ladies' man' Barron Trump is winning over NYU classmates and 'even liberal people like him'"},{"text":"I have no doubt.

The Ds had already given themselves a really deeply ingrained brand it will be impossible to lose this brand without the D platform really seeking to distance itself from hardcore advocacy.So yes, the DNC wasn't hyper focused in the few months during the campaign, but by not distancing themselves, it still felt like they were to a LOT of people.The best thing that the Ds could do would be to distance themselves from mixing kids in with these issues. Start really pushing back (not just being silent) against the story / reading time stuff with kids (you know what I'm talking about) and that kids should be encouraged to make permanent changes. Those are wildly unpopular for a lot more of America than Ds would like to acknowledge. And given the recent scientific findings, it's not scientifically backed that kids should make permanent changes anyway (and the more these findings get disseminated the more broadly and more deeply this view will grow). The UK just banned drugs that aid in this because even the most activist scientific researcher could not torture results of their own study enough to support the idea that it's beneficial and so declined to publish their results.And I'm not trying to be inflammatory, but anyone familiar with graduate research knows that these studies are typically pretty biased (for various reasons - there was recent commentary I saw where someone was complaining that they had to site research from someone who they knew was going to be a reviewer to get a favorable outcome; one paper specifically noted this as a reason for citation!).","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Will never happen as long as most media are in the hands of people supporting this.","title":"Jeff Bezos reportedly following in Mark Zuckerberg's footsteps with a $1 million donation from Amazon to Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"That fucking kid.","title":"Trump Advisers Seek to Shrink or Eliminate Bank Regulators"},{"text":"Is that even a real quote?

A handful of South Carolina Republicans plan to reintroduce a bill that would define abortion as homicide  a crime punishable by death under state law. Rob Harris (R) pre-filed the South Carolina Prenatal Equal Protection Act earlier this month, and it will be introduced in the judiciary committee when the legislative session begins in January. The proposed bill seeks to amend the states criminal code to widen the definition of person to include an unborn child at any stage of development. The bill would define abortion, with few exceptions, as equivalent to killing a person under the criminal code. a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years in prison for homicide.  Under special circumstances  including when a victim is under 11 years old  the minimum sentence can be life in prison or the death penalty. Taken together, this could mean anyone aborting a pregnancy in the state would face life in prison or execution.I don't care if it's \\"unlikely to pass,\\" that doesn't mean it isn't representative of a broader far right, nation wide effort to impose damn near draconian measures and Christian nationalist-inspired legislation.This is the slippery slope that Democrats were talking about after roe was overturned. Whether you agreed with the fifty year precedent or not, it didn't just set the stage for this type of legislation in the future, but it also legitimized these kinds of efforts in the minds of religious zealots, right wing reactionaries and nationalists, who believe that they've somehow been empowered or licensed to push an extreme, authoritarian agenda without consequence.And it certainly doesn't help now that Trump has been elected for a second term, and that conservatives will feel even more emboldened by the fact that Republicans will have a majority in both houses and in the supreme Court.While Trump's administration is expected to be the richest in history, and his MAGA coalition, which is backed by the most nefarious of forces, people and organizations, has been preparing to abuse their authority to consolidate power, interpret and disregard the Constitution as they see fit, and restructure the government into something resembling a one-party system and state.This will all make it easier for Christian Nationalists and extremists to implement their agenda, especially considering that when it comes to Trump, all these people need to do is to offer their undying loyalty in exchange for a chance to exploit his incompetence, narcissism and increasingly unhinged mental state, to enact these types of measures.","title":"South Carolina Republicans Set To Reintroduce Bill Allowing Death Penalty For Abortions"},{"text":"Makes total sense.wait what the fuck","title":"South Carolina Republicans Set To Reintroduce Bill Allowing Death Penalty For Abortions"},{"text":"Is it 2008 again already?","title":"Trump Advisers Seek to Shrink or Eliminate Bank Regulators"},{"text":"We Argentinians ourselves are setting them further down the list to the economics.

It's the bad guy that wanted to station nuclear weapons next to Russia. If the US lost the Cold War, would you tolerate the USSR having nukes in the former US states(had the US lost, it would have broken up like the USSR did), Canada, or Mexico? As for Ukraine roll over, this late in the conflict, Ukraine doesn't have the men to continue for much longer. They are going to lose no matter what. Whether conscripts survive or not is another matter - Ukraine is already short on young people and needs those people for the future. So yes, surrender is the most rational choice for Ukraine right now, if you truly care about Ukraine and aren't exploiting Ukraine the way the US did for the South Vietnamese.It's like saying to the Axis leadership of Germany and Japan in 1944, should they just just roll over to the Allies? It's irrelevant because they had already lost. So has Ukraine in 2024. It would have been rational for the Axis to have given up in 1944. The outcome of the war was not in question. Whether or not their conscripts and men survive is the only question. After this is over, Ukraine is going to need those people to rebuild.","title":"TRUMP wants end to project Ukraine, Zelensky panics"},{"text":"Zuckerberg and Bezos paying to grovel and kiss tRump's soiled diaper.

As long as your suggested candidate is, or has been, a Democrat, or a left-leaning independent, and there is some reason to believe they'd run if they thought they had a shot, feel free to bring them up in the comments.\\" Regardless of how it's defined, I don't think anyone could plausibly argue Josh Shapiro isn't a realistic choice lol. He was almost the VP choice. So let's say your general scenario occurs. There's a snap primary around the DNC, and Shapiro wins. I'm doubtful that Trump's campaign would agree to a mid-October debate with Shapiro, especially if there was already a debate in August with Shapiro. Even on Fox News. Trump is aware he doesn't perform well in debates against competent people and he knows his polls naturally improve after slumps. In fact, I think if Shapiro was his opponent, he wouldn't even agree to the debate in August. He thought Kamala would be easy and that's why he went along with that one. So, I'm not going to grant you this hypothetical mid-October bump. However, I think your point about the polling has validity to it. You're pointing out that the Emerson poll I touted was very far off in terms of the actual vote. True, but it didn't have anyone outperforming Harris either except Biden. Just about everyone except Biden trailed Trump by 6-8 points. The real distinction between the hypothetical Dems was the number of undecideds. 8% were undecided in a race between Kamala and Trump, while 16% were undecided between Trump and Shapiro (likely due to fewer people knowing who he is). This is a factor I didn't consider in my opinion much, but it counts against me clearly. If Harris was down 6 with only 8% undecided, then she'd need to win 75% of undecideds to win the popular vote. Whereas Shapiro was down 8, but with 16% undecided, meaning he'd only need to win over 50% of undecideds to win the popular vote. Given that winning the election probably required winning the popular vote by *at least* 3%, then, if this poll is accurate, Kamala was likely doomed from the start unless she could flip Trump voters, while Shapiro would still have a chance if he won about 70% of undecideds. Based on the results, if we assume this poll was accurate, Kamala won about 70% of those undecideds (or likely won some Trump voters  and a slightly smaller percent of undecideds).  Plus, he gets a bump in his victory chances due to his popularity in PA. Might not even need the 3% popular vote victory to win the EC. So based on numbers alone, there's an argument to be made that Shapiro would have won.And, as you've pointed out, since Shapiro was not part of the federal government, he could point out the flaws with the Biden administration without coming across as a hypocrite. Alright, you might be just about to change my view. Bring it home. Go beyond numbers and generalized ideas of his ability to air grievances about Biden. Explain to me why he's able to convince voters that he could fix the economy where Biden couldn't, or why he can make America great while Trump couldn't.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Thank you, yes I had trouble commenting.

Citing [Texas v White](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1134912565671891096&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr): \\nIn the Constitution the term state most frequently expresses the combined idea just noticed, of people, territory, and government. A state, in the ordinary sense of the Constitution, is a political community of free citizens, occupying a territory of defined boundaries, and organized under a government sanctioned and limited by a written constitution, and established by the consent of the governed. It is the union of such states, under a common constitution, which forms the distinct and greater political unit, which that Constitution designates as the United States, and makes of the people and states which compose it one people and one country.Under the Articles of Confederation each State retained its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right not expressly delegated to the United States. Under the Constitution, though the powers of the States were much restricted, still, all powers not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. And we have already had occasion to remark at this term, that the people of each State compose a State, having its own government, and endowed with all the functions essential to separate and independent existence, and that without the States in union, there could be no such political body as the United States.[*] Not only, therefore, can there be no loss of separate and independent autonomy to the States, through their union under the Constitution, but it may be not unreasonably said that the preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government. The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.\\nConsidered therefore as transactions under the Constitution, the ordinance of secession, adopted by the convention and ratified by a majority of the citizens of Texas, and all the acts of her legislature intended to give effect to that ordinance, were absolutely null. They were utterly without operation in law. The obligations of the State, as a member of the Union, and of every citizen of the State, as a citizen of the United States, remained perfect and unimpaired. It certainly follows that the State did not cease to be a State, nor her citizens to be citizens of the Union. If this were otherwise, the State must have become foreign, and her citizens foreigners. The war must have ceased to be a war for the suppression of rebellion, and must have become a war for conquest and subjugation.Our conclusion therefore is, that Texas continued to be a State, and a State of the Union, notwithstanding the transactions to which we have referred. And this conclusion, in our judgment, is not in conflict with any act or declaration of any department of the National government, but entirely in accordance with the whole series of such acts and declarations since the first outbreak of the rebellion.\\nSo state secession was illegal before Texas decided to secede and it is illegal after Texas Re-admittance to the Union. Texas also did not cease to be a state after they seceded. Which is exactly what would happen is they seceded now. They wouldnt cease to be a state theyd just be a territory of the United States.","title":"Why Somaliland Shouldnt Be Recognized as the Worlds Newest Country"},{"text":"You mean a 34-count convicted felon fraudster was full of shit all along?

Sometimes states have clearly bad reasons for wanting self-determination, like in the US Civil War.Another problem is that the scope of people choosing self governance is never obvious. If 60% of people in a region want to break from the original country, what about the remaining 40%? How would you define that region in the first place?Like, take the Abkhazians in 1992, where they were actually a minority in Abkhazia itself, before driving out and even ethnically cleansing a bunch of Georgians until they became the majority, which seems to be what would be incentivized if we allowed people to secede based on being 51% of the population.If you go down that route philosophically, why can't individual people decide to be sovereign citizens? Why can't I self-govern myself only?It isn't even clear that breaking up countries reduces conflict. It could even make it worse, since two groups in a single nation at least have to deal with tensions politically, but two new countries could actually create their own armies and go to war.And on some level, peoples breaking up into ethnostates just seems weird: if we claim multiculturalism is a good thing, it just seems strange to say that the ideal situation is breaking countries up by culture, which is obviously what would happen in practice.Obviously, I'm not saying that self-governance is bad, but I don't think there's good reason to say it's always good.","title":"Why Somaliland Shouldnt Be Recognized as the Worlds Newest Country"},{"text":"I cant believe Ive lived through 2 Trump presidencies.When I die Im gonna punch God on the nose","title":"Trump says he and Jeff Bezos are slated to have a sit-down next week"},{"text":"Votes for liars, gets lied to.

If you believe that warmongering, oppression, and propaganda are fruitless, then why not let them fall on their own sword?What do you mean fruitless? Warmongering, oppression, and propaganda are incredibly effective. They're also atrocious for people. But yeah, democracy and liberalism isn't some natural thing for countries to stumble into. It takes an immense amount of work to maintain, and newly liberalizing countries are often at risk from strong men authoritarians taking over.

If you're looking for a real adversary, look no further than China.Yes, China is also an adversary, another one that Trump is completely stepping back from actually dealing with. China is gaining a lot of power globally through their Belt and Road initiative. They're building megaports in South America to expand trade between South America and China. They're basically setting themselves up to take over the spot of the US. What Russia is cooking up is not a threat to the US; it's a European problem.Nah, this is bullshit. Europe is a major ally of the US and proponent of democracy and liberalism. A lot of power of the US comes from our relationship with Europe. A destabilized Europe due to war is obviously bad for the US. And that's not even getting into that Russia is striving for a multipolar society, with Russia, China, and the US controlling their respective spheres.

The only poll I can find comparing them [shows Manchin only one point behind Trump.](https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-support-trump-hits-62-gop-primary) Which is a lot better than most of these hypothetical opponents. Now, I think it's fair to point out that Manchin ain't just any white masculine man. Your original comment seemed to indicate that you thought the real issue was that most Dems were demographically poor candidates for the realities of the nation, but your choice of Joe Manchin shoes that you recognize policy is part of the problem people have with the Dems. I think you're on to something, and while I think your first comment showed you didn't really read my post, I think this might be the closest comment to changing my view. Manchin's blue dog political perspective would likely have been very beneficial in the Dems' efforts to appeal to the working class, and the fact that he's a white male would've likely helped as well. But would any of that have turned voters that were supportive of Trump? It's not like Trump struggled in the primaries against other conservatives. Plus, I think it's clear he'd lose quite a bit of support from the left-most parts of the Democratic party.He'd certainly be a major change from Kamala, but I'm not yet convinced he'd have won.

It would not surprise me if you're right, but let's go with the full devil's advocate view.The main problem is Biden is unpopular, so you need someone completely outside of the federal government, which means it's probably going to be a state governor. This is admittedly also a point against realism, but to create a best case scenario, lets say the democratic party gets behind Josh Shapiro. Considering the importance of Pennsylvania this seems like the most obvious choice, but the most important thing is it is someone who can realistically distance themselves from Biden and criticize his administration where necessary.Next, I think you need to look at the dynamics of the race. Harris opened up her best polling lead in late August, up to about a month after the debate, then lost all her steam in October. We need to fix that. Realistically, to get this scenario in the first place where Biden is distant, we probably need some sort of primary process, which would occur around the DNC. Ideally, what we need to fix is the debate timing. If Trump and his team are smart this can't happen, but I would push for a debate in mid October. I don't care if its on Fox news, I take it anyways. I have faith that literally anyone other than Biden will smoke Trump in a debate because he was truly awful in both debates. I have Josh Shapiro talk to anyone and everyone who will listen, and I have him gladly roast Biden where necessary to distance himself from Biden.Last, lets address the polls. You're pointing to a July poll that has Harris losing to Trump 43-49. The election was much, much closer than that. On top of that, Trump has poor favourable rankings, and has had them for years. Problem is, the current administration is also unpopular. Even so, were the election in September, if you believe the polls, Kamala probably wins if the election is a month earlier (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/).

I also wanted to exclude absurd suggestions like, \\"The Dems could've run Mitt Romney.\\" I think the way I defined \\"realistic\\" was acceptable for the purpose of fostering productive discussion. I didn't address the argument about closeness implying another candidate could win because I addressed that argument in other comments. However, I'll just reiterate what I said before and tailor it to what you wrote. No, this election was not much closer than 2020. Due to the way the electoral college works, and the strategy Dems use to win, this election would best be considered a blowout. 2020 came down to about 43k votes across 3 states (AZ, GA and WI). If those votes had gone the other way, Trump would have won in 2020. That's despite Biden winning by about 7M votes. This demonstrates how hard it can be for Dems to move the needle on swing states, even when easily winning the popular vote. In 2016, Hillary easily won the popular vote (winning by about 3M). But still lost the election due to about 70,000 votes in swing states. Kamala needed about 230,000 votes in key swing states to win. She just doesn't get those votes without a massive popular vote swing. I think it's fair to say you'd expect that she'd need to win the popular vote by more than Hilary. And she didn't win the popular vote at all. You have to go back to 1988 to find a Democratic candidate who did worse in the electoral college. So no, it wasn't really close. It's not obvious that another Dem could outperform her to the degree necessary to win.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"..and then protests come against this domestic military useand then the military is used against those antifa woke protestors as well and then Trump has precedent for using the military against citizens and the transformation to a fascist dictatorship is complete because not even lawmakers from his own party will be able to offer any resistance as the military will be completely under Trumps control along with his newly selected loyal generals.

He was railing about \\"hordes of barbaric yellow dwarves\\" in Asia in the 1940s, but by 1963, he was ready to put his political capital behind getting the Civil Rights Act passed.

You're speaking as if there would be a simple manner to target exactly those 230,000 voters or so without losing some voters. But I don't think that's likely. You gotta remember that the popular vote is typically the *easier* vote for Dems to win. It takes more mass appeal to translate to votes in the swing states. I think you'd agree that if Kamala won Wisconsin, you'd expect that to mean her popular vote total would likely increase by substantially more than the votes she won in Wisconsin. So how much more mass appeal would she need to win Wisconsin?Kamala lost by 30k votes in Wisconsin and lost the popular vote by 2.3M. in 2020, Biden was barely able to eke out a win in Wisconsin, winning by just 20,000, despite winning the popular vote by about 7 million. In other words, turning one Wisconsin voter requires the appeal to turn 186 voters throughout the nation.  Winning Wisconsin might require about 5.5M voter swing for Kamala.Now, I know you're thinking that more targeted policies and campaigning could get this win without the mass appeal. But can you name a candidate in your mind that would be substantially better suited to winning these votes, to the point that he/she could've won the election?","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Eliminating the FDIC would allow the massive banks to have an advantage over the many community banks around the country.

Arguably, removing the FDIC would put more pressure on banks to show that they are financially resilient and aren't carrying too much risk, but more likely it is a play by big banks to achieve \\"too big to fail\\" status as consumer banks, which is the goal of corrupt industries that seek regulatory capture.

Now I'm looking for alternatives, but in the meantime I still have to use my Honda.","title":"CMV: It's ethical to pirate some software."},{"text":"I think they meant most garbage fucking person of the year?\\n What a fucking way to signal a type of person to aspire to be Jesus fucking Christ","title":"Trump is named Time's Person of the Year and rings the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell"},{"text":"Its a bit sad that so much of the US population is this undereducated, however I cant put it all on the school system I mean, I grew up in the 90s and went to school into the 2000s; just like everyone else, middle of the road public school, basic classes etc, and I am not a genius, I only have a basic community college secondary education, and yet all of the stuff that absolutely stumps the average person it seems is basic common knowledge in my eyes.

Also we were told that the hospitals were overflowing yet on July 2019 I had an accident resulting in 7 operations in a 3 year period.

Also almost no one died of Influenza which seems ridiculous.

Pfizer (who has also paid out more in criminal fraud than any company in history) doesn't have to release their data for 75 years! The whole thing stinks of fraud on a massive scale.
