This isnt about \\"Western secular liberalism\\" versus \\"tradition or religious morality.\\" This is about universal human rights versus systemic oppression. By framing this as a false dichotomy between cultural relativism and \\"Western ideology,\\" you attempt to shield indefensible practices behind the veneer of moral pluralism. But oppression doesnt become acceptable because it wears the costume of culture or faith. Female genital mutilation isnt justified by tradition. Child marriage isnt sanctified by religion. If cultural norms sanction the subjugation of half a population, those norms deserve obliteration, not reverence.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights explicitly states that all individuals, regardless of geography or tradition, are entitled to equality and freedom. Saudi Arabias ranking of 126th out of 146 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report (2024) speaks volumes: its not tradition; its oppression masquerading as morality.  If your \\"tradition\\" requires stripping autonomy from women and denying them basic rights, then its not moralityits control. Now, where in your argument can you reconcile human dignity with such systematic degradation?  --- **\\"Most people's primary concern is not about what freedoms they have, it's about meeting their family's basic needs and living a meaningful life.\\"**  The classic appeal to survival. Lets not kid ourselves: this argument reeks of condescension. It assumes that Saudi womenmany of whom are university-educatedcan only think as far as food and shelter. Yet, 56% of university graduates in Saudi Arabia are women, despite their labor force participation hovering at a mere 33.2%. Clearly, theyre thinking beyond survival; theyre being held back by institutionalized guardianship laws and patriarchal gatekeeping.  You dont get to decide what constitutes a \\"meaningful life\\" for someone else. Women globally have demanded the right to vote, to work, to drivethings Saudi women have systematically been denied until recently, if at all. Theyre not \\"sacrificing\\" freedom for security; theyre being denied freedom by design.  Would you dare argue that enslaved individuals in pre-abolition America had \\"meaningful lives\\" because their masters provided housing and food? Of course not. So why apply that same logic to the women trapped under patriarchal systems?  --- **\\"What you've done is exactly the same as Western colonialists throughout the centuries, disregarding what native societies themselves think in favor of your own thinking which has no basis in actual lived experience in the society you're criticizing.\\"**  False equivalence, meet strawman argument. Condemning oppression is not colonialism. Western colonialists imposed systems of exploitation for economic and political gain; criticizing Saudi Arabia's oppression of women is rooted in advocating universally acknowledged human rights.  Your argument conveniently ignores the voices of Saudi women who *are* speaking outSaudi activists like Loujain al-Hathloul, imprisoned and tortured for advocating basic freedoms like the right to drive. Or those who fled the system entirelythousands of women attempt to escape Saudi Arabia every year, risking their lives to gain autonomy. These are not the actions of people content with their cultural status quo.  Your appeal to \\"lived experience\\" is nothing but an intellectual dodge. The facts stand: Saudi law and practice systematically suppress womens freedoms. If you need to live in a burning house to recognize the flames, youre not practicing empathy; youre practicing willful ignorance.  --- **\\"If Saudi Arabia and Muslims in general wanted a feminist revolution, we would have seen one by now in at least some countries.\\"**  This is a grotesque oversimplification. Revolutions dont occur in a vacuum; they occur within systems of oppression that inherently seek to quash dissent. Saudi Arabia jails activists, monitors social media with surveillance apps like Absher, and enforces male guardianship laws designed to prevent women from traveling, working, or even seeking medical care without male permission.  Lets put this into perspective: every year more than 1,000 women try to flee Saudi Arabia. Text alerts sent by the Saudi authorities enable many guardians to catch them before they actually escape. The fact that so many risk their lives to escape doesnt signal satisfaction with their society; it signals desperation. The absence of large-scale revolutions isnt proof of contentment; its proof of repression.  History is littered with examples of suppressed revolutionsslavery in the U.S. persisted for centuries before abolition. Does that mean enslaved individuals were content? Of course not. So why apply such flawed logic here?  --- **\\"Western literature and access to feminist thought has existed in the Islamic world for decades now. The fact that no large-scale organized movement has formed...says spades about how women in that society feel about their culture.\\"**  Your argument implies that Saudi women have access to the tools for change but lack the will to use them. Wrong again. Access to feminist literature doesnt translate into freedom of action. Saudi women cant simply stage movements when doing so often results in imprisonment, torture, or exile.  The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights has repeatedly condemned Saudi Arabia for targeting womens rights activists, stifling dissent, and maintaining a culture of fear. Are you genuinely suggesting that a society with such systemic suppression of free speech can serve as a reliable metric for gauging womens satisfaction?  ---What system of morality can justify treating half the population as perpetual dependents? If the absence of rebellion equates to satisfaction, would you argue that North Koreans, under their totalitarian regime, are genuinely content?  Why does a society that prides itself on tradition jail women for fighting for their rights if it is so confident that those rights are unnecessary?","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"Oh dont worry; Stephen Miller says they will turbocharge denaturalizatiom, but only to get rid of communists and anarchists.

The point of the pick is to be \\"the one Republicans in the Senate can oppose\\" instead of that role falling to RFK. Republicans can't politically get away with opposing too many of Trump's Cabinet picks because they'll have to answer to a legion of pissed off MAGA voters who will be more than willing to primary them out of office in 2026.The other point of the pick is to burn down the DOJ so it has limited capacity to do much of anything after Trump leaves office. Many of his Cabinet picks are for this purpose. Gaetz's appointment is intended to get many of the people at the DOJ to quit before he's sworn in and then to fire a bunch more of them. This is to reduce their administrative capacity so they can't prosecute Trump when he leaves office. His primary plan seems to be \\"burn down the administrative state\\". That's why he appointed Elon and Vivek to the DOGE. Their job is to help him burn down the bureaucracy and neuter the various federal agencies.","title":"Gaetz pick raises fears that Trump will seek retribution on political foes"},{"text":"If he declares a national emergency, it suspends laws.

Not only did it attack the perception of Trump's image as a strongman, it also attacked the legitimacy of the movement itself. If they're \\"weirdo's\\", they're not \\"the people\\" or \\"real Americans\\" who are fed up with the foreign and outside elements conspiring against them. This narrative that they are \\"the people\\" is fundamental to how they justify their actions, and making it manifestly untenable will cripple them. The USA's big problem is that the other party is also wedded to corporate interests to such an extend that it is easy to depict them as interchangeable (which they aren't, IMHO).IMHO, if you want to beat a reactionary and authoritarian movement that operates as a fake populist one, then you need to attack its contradictions. Undermine the reactionary part by emphasizing the division between the oligarchs pulling the strings and the precarious socioeconomic situation of those supporting them. Attack the authoritarian narrative by pointing out how weird and stupid these leaders are, and how they seek to force their behavior on everyone else. Unmask the fake populism by giving people the real thing, e.g. social democracy with meaningful popular control over the economy and social spending to remove the threat of a few companies and people monopolizing the economy and politics. A parallel course is to fight for more local governance and more local democracy, which both counters the centralization of power that authoritarians need to set up, and makes it difficult for them to play the populist card.You won't win over the hard core, but you will reach the lukewarm supporters who are only in it because they feel trapped, because they just care about their part of the economy, or who don't know or care much about politics and vote on emotions and vibes.","title":"Donald Trump Jr. says pushback against Cabinet picks proves theyre the disrupters voters wanted"},{"text":"When Russia hacked and released the (entirely bland) DNC emails in 2016, the GOP emails were also hacked but never released.

The State of Colorado is directly involved in one international treaty, two U.S. Supreme Court decrees, one interstate agreement, and nine interstate compacts.  Imagine a setting, early 1900s and you have a family farm in Nebraska along the Platte River, which your family has used to irrigate your corn for 100 years or more.  Now imagine suddenly the flow starts drying up, not because it isnt raining but because some new factory, mine or farm upstream is taking it all.  Not only does this kill your farm, but all of your neighbors farms and all the fishing commerce and everyone else downstream.  Whats stopping all of them from marching upstream and unleashing a can of whoop ass?We tend to create rules and laws where necessary to protect individual interests.  It isnt just money makingColorado has several lobbying interests over upstream water rights , and downstream states have their own.  In CO one that is money making but overlooked is the value of recreation to a heavily tourism based economy.  So there are recreational in stream flows that must be preserved and hold priority over most, if not all, rights which is other wise a first in time first in kind system.  But, EPA is involved and has nixed storage projects, and The Nature Conservancy has led large efforts to preserve minimal water requirements to preserve local ecologies as well.  Its a continuous fight they fight.Heres more info: https://waterknowledge.colostate.edu/water-management-administration/agreements-compacts-treaties/My family has some very very senior water rights in the Arkansas basin and weve been working with this for a long time.","title":"Trumps likely FCC chair wrote Project 2025 chapter on how hed run the agency - Brendan Carr wants to preserve data caps, punish NBC, and give money to SpaceX."},{"text":"Ok, I get it.

In the Colorado case a lawsuit was brought by Republicans who didnt want their primary vote to be wasted on someone ineligible to serve.  The court had a finding of fact that examined all the J6 evidence and concluded Trump had in fact engaged in insurrection and provided aid and comfort to the insurrectionists, the two criteria for disqualification under section 3 of the 14th amendment.  The finding is worth a read.  It basically boils down to the fact that All evidence and claims for the steal originated from Trump.  If he had not invented that motive the crowd would not have assembled and J6 would not have happened. Based on this legal fact the civil court agreed that Trump was disqualified and ruled for the plaintiffs.  The ruling was appealed, and appealed again at the Colorado Supreme Court.  They agreed with the original ruling too and his name was struck from the Republican primary ballot.  Maines Secretary of State cited the ruling to strike his name from the Maine Republican primary too. The legal fact that he had engaged in insurrection and was disqualified from office was never contested in any of these appeals.  First, the alleged behavior was not in dispute.  He had invented the Big Lie.  Second, appellate courts are not set up to re-litigate the facts of the case, they only focus on the applicability of the law.The case was appealed at the Supreme Court.  They didnt question the finding of fact either.  They invented a loophole out of thin air.  The decided that individual states could not decide eligibility to hold office for the entire country, and struck Trumps disqualification in Colorado.  This, in my mind, was completely unnecessary.  Their thinking was that we cant have a president that is disqualified in one state but not another.   My thinking is that the Presidency has a high bar for serving in office.  If a candidate cant get 2/3 of both the House and Senate to lift a claim of disqualification from any source then maybe that candidate is unfit for office. I believe this was the original intent when the amendment was written. The last sentence in Section 3 of the 14th amendment explicitly gives the US Congress - and only the US Congress - the ability to remove disqualifications from office.  In my humble opinion the Supreme Court stepped way out of bounds to remove the Colorado disqualification.  The Supreme Court went further.  The conservatives on the court invented law when they decided, perversely, that only the US Congress could declare that a candidate was disqualified.  In Trumps case they did when they voted on his second impeachment, but this isnt really relevant to their invention.  According to this ruling, Trump could be tried and convicted in a court of law for the crime of Insurrection and he would still be eligible to serve.  He could send goon squads out to disrupt the vote counting in every swing state and still be eligible to serve.  He could be convicted for all of this and be sitting in prison and still be able to serve.  Its perverse.  Section 3 of the 14th amendment is written to be self effecting.  If a person has objectively engaged in insurrection they are disqualified until Congress lifts the disqualification.  No conviction is required.  No vote in Congress is required. No parting of clouds and gods voice is required.  The person is simply not eligible to serve.  The same thing is true for the other disqualifications from office. It doesnt take a vote in Congress to disqualify someone for being under 35, or not being a natural born citizen.  So WTF conservatives on the Supreme Court?","title":"Elon Musk Says He and Trump Gave Mandate to Delete Regulations.

Aided by his highly respected Washington ambassador Karen Pierce, Starmer was among the first world leaders to secure a phone call with Trump after his victory, sending his \\"hearty congratulations.\\" He was also one of the few foreign leaders to secure a call with Trump shortly after his first assassination attempt. Hes got to try and influence him somehow, said a second, exasperated government minister of Starmers future dealing with Trump. Making the argument that colleagues in parliament had to be grown ups,\\" and accept the importance of a continued dialogue between the White House and No. 10, the second minister said: Ive had meetings with all sorts of people Id rather not have but its part of governing. Starmer has also signalled his desire to go further in building ties with Europe after the damage to relations of Brexit, paying a recent, high-profile visit to Macron. That gives you a good steer on where its going, the minister said of the trip to Paris. Wins for the UK economy may come at the cost of concessions to Brussels, but could also serve as a bulwark against turbulence from Trump if he the U.S. president-elect goes through with his America first threats to impose heavy import tariffs.  But both ministers signalled that Labour had no appetite in engaging in a trade war with the U.S. Then it just spirals and escalates, the second government minister said. The PM has also been shifting his own language around his domestic agenda somewhat, saying in the days after Trumps victory that the economy and border control are the two key priorities. The sharpening of tone on these two hot topics when Starmer spoke to reporters on the way to the COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan this month could be seen as a reflection on No. 10's view of the Democrats failure to make a strong case to voters. It may also be seen as an aligning of language with Trump. So far Starmer has focused on his own agenda when asked about Trumps positions, highlighting Britains strong support for Ukraine and track record on the climate crisis. Rather than snub the summit in Baku as many international allies did, Starmer sought to show leadership on the environment by announcing an even more ambitious aim for reducing carbon emissions by 2035  in stark contrast to the impending Trump approach. But there will be moves designed to please the president-elect too. With one eye on Trump railing at NATO allies for falling behind on spending, Starmer is expected to set out a timeline for increasing UK defense spending to 2.5 percent of GDP in the spring.  Appealing to The Donalds ego via his high regard for Britains royal family is another tool at Starmers disposal.  A former UK government official who worked on the last Trump visits said: We couldnt get him interested in anything except the [late] Queen [Elizabeth II]. There was no point showing him such and such a big gun because hed have a bigger one. Few are under any illusion Britain's attempts to leaven Trump's global impact will be a smooth ride  not least given his new alliance with X boss Elon Musk, who has been openly hostile to Starmers government, and Labours vastly different policy platform to the Republicans. Britain under Starmer is also seeking to forge new ties with Trumps great foe, China. Starmer will have the first bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping for a British prime minister in more than six years when they meet in Rio on Monday. But on defense and security, if its a choice between the US and China  its not a choice, the Cabinet minister said, pointing to how intertwined the two states are on these fronts. They acknowledged there will be fireworks, there will be drama during the Trump presidency but said the government should be mindful theres a difference between rhetoric and reality. Even rhetoric can be pretty impactful, however. Paul Harrison was then-Prime Minister Theresa Mays press secretary when Trump gave an incendiary interview to the Sun arguing her Brexit plans would probably kill a US-UK trade deal just as she was preparing to host him in Britain. Despite this, Harrison believes Trump can be won round, with his climb down of sorts when president and PM met shortly afterwards an example. The act of persuasion with him is difficult, and it has to be done very carefully, Harris said, and Starmer has a few, though not many, cards to play. For one, Trump respects political strength. Starmer won a huge Commons majority in July and isnt required to hold another general election until August 2029  a year after the next presidential vote. It's helpful to be able to give a perspective on how events will play for Trump politically, so being able to say, actually, Mr. President, our perspective is that your political goals will be better delivered by this alternate course of action, Harrison said.  Labour seems to be taking this advice, with some urging Starmer to sell a narrative to Trump that it would look weak to allow Putin to triumph too overtly in Ukraine. Everything now is about how do we sell it to Donald Trump, one senior MP said. We have to convince him that he cant be the man to allow a surrender  that he could get the Nobel Peace Prize. No ones suggesting Starmer is likely to be garlanded with such an honor  but there are plenty of moderates the world over who would be vastly grateful if he tempered Trump even a little.","title":"As Trump looms large, can Keir Starmer save the world?"},{"text":" As progressives around the world are washed away by a rising tide of populism, one man stands as the center lefts great hope. Step forward Keir Starmer. A pragmatist who owes his victory at July's UK general election as much to a collapse in the traditional right as to his own powers of persuasion, the British prime minister may seem an unlikely resistance leader. But the Labour Party chief arrives in Rio for the latest gathering of the G20 group of leading economies as the most powerful politician of his ilk. He is attending a summit that will likely be characterized by coded discussions on how to shield economies, Ukraine and climate action from another round of Donald Trump in the White House. The meeting in Brazil is almost certainly outgoing US President Joe Bidens last dance on the world stage. German Chancellor Olaf Scholzs government has collapsed. The far right is on the rise in Emmanuel Macrons France. In Canada, Justin Trudeaus Liberals look to be on the way out, and polls predict a similar fate for Anthony Albaneses Labor Party in Australia. Progressives are now pinning their hopes on Starmer restraining Trumps darkest and most chaotic instincts where they touch on international affairs  even if hell be treading the most unstable of tightropes while trying not to blow up Britains relations with the White House. Liberal democracy is in enormous peril, said Matt Bennett, executive vice president for the Third Way think tank. He argued that many democrats are now lame ducks, as Trump joins Russias Vladimir Putin, Chinas Xi Jinping and Indias Narendra Modi in a sliding scale of right-wing autocrats controlling major nations, armies and economies. That leaves Keir Starmer almost alone as the leader of a powerful nation who is committed to democracy. This is a huge responsibility, Bennett said. The UK can serve as a bulwark against the march of right-wing populism. He should push back on Trump where necessary and show the world how its done. Its vital  but its going to be a lonely fight. Starmer will be well aware that the forces claiming his more natural global allies are breathing down his neck too. His rise to power in July was fueled by the publics mass rejection of the Conservatives after 14 years of incumbency and the insurgency of Nigel Farages Reform UK Party, which split the right-wing vote. World leaders will be at pains not to utter Trump's name in a negative light, but it's clear he will loom large over Rio. They'll be at the G20 on Tuesday when the grinding war in Ukraine enters its 1,000th day. Downing Street said Starmer would use the summit to call on allies to \\"step up their support\\" or \\"face unfathomable consequences if Putin wins.\\" The PM will also place economic cooperation and the climate crisis at the heart of his discussions. Asked by Politico on the plane to Rio, Starmer insisted Trump's election is not the death knell for the environment, describing tackling climate change as both an obligation which is on all of us to play our part and a great economic opportunity. \\n Starmer will also be seeking a bilateral meeting with Biden to encourage him to give Ukraine a $20 billion loan before Trumps inauguration on Jan. 20, the Telegraph reported. And the PM is expected to push for authorization for Kyiv to fire long-range Storm Shadow missiles deep into Russian territory. But any action the outgoing president takes in his lame duck phase won't Trump proof the world for long. One UK Cabinet minister, who like others in this piece was granted anonymity to discuss international affairs candidly, insisted Britain is well-placed to have the president-elect's ear. He loves Britain, his mom is from [the Scottish island of] Lewis and hes got his golf courses, the senior minister said. When it comes to Britain's European neighbors France and Germany, the Starmer ally said of Trump, he doesnt have those connections to them. Yet even in the most cordial of times theres only so much Britain alone can do to shape the global superpower  let alone when it has such a mercurial protectionist at the helm. Starmer will likely look to form hodgepodge alliances with leaders of all stripes around the world on matters of common interest.  I don't think it does fall to Keir Starmer to be the only one standing up, said Claire Ainsley, who runs the DC-based Progressive Policy Institute think tank. Ainsley, a former Starmer adviser, argued Britain has allies on the center right as well as the left who also want to ease the climate crisis and defend Ukraine so it will be much more about the pragmatic, realpolitik of what is in each nations strategic national interest and therefore, where can you find alliances and allyship. And you might find that in surprising places,\\" she added. Argentinas President Javier Milei may be a chainsaw-wielding libertarian, but he is a steadfast supporter of Ukraine. Brazils Luiz Incio Lula da Silva would probably be viewed by the UK as too close to Russia, but has made tackling climate change a priority. Italys Giorgia Meloni may be way out on the right, but Starmer sees her as an ally in tackling illegal migration.  The past and future president is deeply unpopular across the UK  YouGov polling the day after the Nov. 5 election suggested 57 percent of Brits were unhappy with the result, compared to 20 percent who were content. And Labour supporters were among the most likely to oppose Trump. Brits took to the streets in their droves when Trump visited the UK during his last presidency. Then in opposition, many Labour MPs were happy to tweet their revulsion  including current Foreign Secretary David Lammy, whos now in a sticky situation with the Republicans over his remarks. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, the outgoing chair of the U.S. foreign relations committee, hailed Labour's win as a \\"good shift\\" towards a government that looks after working people, bucking the trend of populist right insurgency. However, speaking to Politico on a visit to London, he warned that Democrats had been scuppered by a failure \\"to connect with the voters that traditionally support our party\\" on living standards and immigration.

You saw this with North Korea, for example. One of the things that Trump is actually very good at is understanding that other leaders have to perform for their own domestic populations as well. He understands there is a certain amount of theatricality about  politics and geopolitics, but importantly he gets that this can't be a;ll one-sided. You can't expect all the other actors on the stage to be happy to accept a shitty script which makes them look bad. He does understand better than the current lot how to deal, because he recognises that nobody likes a zero-sum game. except the solitary winner. The neocons have always been zero-sum, which is why anyone who's had dealings with them is unlikely ever to trust them again. That strategy only works if you can win and hold on to your winnings.

Char is driving and listening to the radio. Its dystopian. Im trying to spread it around. \\nHowie wondered how many ads there would be. They had displaced more and more entertainment. Advertisers were emboldened ever since they realized they could put ads before movie previews, which essentially meant putting ads on ads. The idea was Maggie Barnetts, a widely acknowledged television and media marketing genius. She increased revenues and cut the budget by replacing anchors who read the news with actors, like Bubba, who reacted to it. It was a trick she learned from the popularity of online reaction videos. Her most popular program was a weekly televised execution show. It was being promoted now. 'Tune in tomorrow night for the season finale!' The advertising voice told Howie. 'The condemned offender will be a surprise!' Televised executions had rescued the death penalty after it was on the chopping block (so to speak) due to budget cuts[[9](https://zimri.ink/#fn9)]. Maggies show saved capital punishment and warmed America's heart by giving a (small) portion of the shows ad revenue to the families of the victims of the condemned offenders. Howie used to watch her execution show to experience a thrill of self-righteous indignation but stopped after one offender protested that he was innocent right up until the end[[10](https://zimri.ink/#fn10)]. His last words were: don't sign anything without a lawyer\\". \\n..

I find it hard to believe the average voter wasn't aware of the accusations against Trump. Second, it is absolutely the argument David French making. The only reason he uses the word grievance is because it's a common term that is used to refer to the republican base positions. His core position is that politicians should say whatever needed to their base to get nominated for their primaries and then only govern in such a way as to hold on to power for as long as possible. Even if that governing is at odds with their original positions. Politicians who don't do that are making big mistakes in his book. He thinks Trump is losing only because Trump looks like he's going to keep his campaign promises, and then republicans will lose the white house after he does.  Hell end his political career as an unpopular politician who ushered in a Democratic majority yet again.The implication of David French's opinion is that every president besides George Washington is a failure.

So for example if you have a creek that crosses your land you can't dam up the creek to prevent it from flowing onto your neighbor's land.

Before the internet, KSA could pretty easily maintain an epistemological bubble. But now the floodgates have opened and there's no going back. The sassiest, most assertive student I ever taught was a Mauritanian girl who wore a hijab. She sounded like she was straight out of the Valley in Los Angeles. With some exceptions, people like her will never go back to the old ways... arranged marriage, housewife, and all that. I've taught Saudi kids (in Austria) and they are as Westernized anyone.

Taking them seriously, but not literally.On the other hand with participation as high as it is it's going to be hard to deal with special interest groups like activists demanding specific policy, too. Those special interests dominate the campaigns of both parties and their bases and they will punish attempts to focus on results by trying to suppress turnout among the base.

Especially during Congressional elections when they're arguably more important. In the 2022 midterms **74% of voters 18-30 did not cast a ballot**. Our logic is completely backwards. People talk about politicians *earning* their vote -- except how are they supposed to pass new legislation if don't get elected? Rather than seeing voting as a civic duty, people want everything \\"fixed\\" *before* they will consider voting. Basically someone else is supposed to spend their entire career making your life easier, never compromise whatsoever -- regardless of personal or public consequences, and in return maybe you'll get off the couch and cast a ballot once a decade. Reddit forgets that Bernie's entire 2020 campaign hinged on getting young people out to vote. On social media they overwhelmingly supported him -- do you know what the voter turnout was? It was 14%. If 86% of your demographic doesn't vote -- you're fucked.

Given that Trump has been reelected and is already hinting at retribution against media and dissenting voices, its naive to think that this decision was purely about her social media outburst. Scientific American is owned by Springer Nature, which is controlled by Holtzbrinck Publishing Group (a wealthy German family-run enterprise) and BC Partners (a private equity firm).While Scientific American has been increasingly vocal about social justice and progressive issues, that approach carries real risks now. With Trump's authoritarian tendencies and a government poised for revenge, media organizations tied to high-net-worth individuals are understandably recalibrating. Its about protecting their assets and influence, especially when ownership is tied to families and investors who prioritize their financial interests over journalistic integrity.Were seeing a trend where organizations are quietly stepping back from more vocal positions. Its not just ideologicalits survival. Theyre preparing for the inevitable pressure, audits, or punitive actions that could come from an administration hell-bent on silencing criticism. Helmuth's departure, under these circumstances, feels like part of a broader strategy to preemptively avoid becoming a target.","title":"Scientific American editor steps down after calling Trump supporters fascists and bigoted"},{"text":"Yes, because in Trumps first term he pulled us out of the Tran Pacific Partnership, which is exactly what China wanted.","title":"Sheinbaums Mexico Is Ground Zero for Trumps Threatened Trade War"},{"text":"FDT?","title":"Biden increasing tensions right before Trump is elected"},{"text":"There's no WTF about this.

Then, as now, they tended to prioritize their free market beliefs over fixing the socioeconomic problems that fed the far right, opposing structural reform even as the political climate got more and more polarized and extremist. This made most coalitions (intra-party or between parties) of social democrats and liberals ineffectual because they could only get done what both factions agreed on (the social liberal bit) but descended into infighting whenever socioeconomic reform got tabled.

PIAAC also assessed people in English, which for some respondents was their second language. In terms of those with the absolute lowest level, the rate is closer to 4% if you exclude those who had a language barrier or disability that left them unable to respond to the test. In terms of comparing the illiteracy rate to 1960: according to the US Census Bureau, approximately 32 states had illiteracy rates below the national average of 2.4%. The lowest was Iowa at 0.7% and the highest Louisiana at 6.3%. Similar to today, there is a lot of variation on a state basis.

Yeah, if Trump ran in the 90s or even 2000s, his scandals are front page news that sit on store shelves for weeks. They are the point of discussion for an extended period of time. Now it basically gets the 15 min of fame treatment before it's blasted through all the algorithms and dumped for the next hot content to catch your attention. Nothing has any staying power anymore. Trump also just plays to this very well. He keeps the cycle moving by making the next crass statement, making some controversial endorsement, or whatever else. I don't know if it's really intentional or just how he is, but it works. Meanwhile Dems generally will go into damage control mode, addressing whatever, and letting the focus stay there for a while. Obviously the latter is the responsible thing to do that we should want in a world leader, but people like Trump know that at the base of it elections and campaigning are basically a game and at the end it just matters who had the most points. The Dems need to find a good balance between the \\"responsible, mature party\\" and learning to play to some degree on the same level as their opponent.People are jumping all over the news media, and yeah, they suck and have for a long time, and are largely responsible for him gaining momentum in 2016, but that was 8 years ago and there's been a massive shift in how people get their news. They will get some amount of a bump from his chaotic administration and all that but they are also likely in for a rude awakening that it's not just Biden being boring that lost them ratings and those ratings aren't coming back. \\nAlso, this is a lesser impact, but the internet has also just jaded people to some level.

Trump lost just as recently as 2020, for likely very many reasons that could be attributed to his poor behavior and lack of any (visible) leadership qualities, and that didn't change his strategy in 2024. You'd have to argue that Biden of all people was some kind of change candidate and he was most definitely not, he also barely campaigned and still beat Trump.The fact you don't agree with all of the entire leftwing playbook politically doesn't necessarily make you a republican either, it just makes you an independent, and you would not be unique in that category as [half the country also identifies as such.](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/17/poll-americans-independent-republican-democrat) I'd also need to know your opinion on federal regulations, sociocultural issues, and many more before I could determine what political lean I'd even assess you to be.If removing fluoride from water (which all experts say is a terrible idea) and who celebrities decide to endorse (literally the richest man endorsed Trump in this election tho) is the only thing that decides your political affiliation, I'd argue you aren't waging a strong enough intellectual discourse with yourself on many of the important issues that matter to most Americans, to be able to make effective observations on the broad shifting of \\"political alignments\\".","title":"CMV: We are in the midst of US political alignments shifting."},{"text":"!remindme 20 years","title":"Putin strikes again!!"},{"text":"You've not listed any Democratic or Republican viewpoints that either side are switching to.

If and when this happens the nanolipids can and will end up in blood circulation and thus enter various cells all around the body causing various serious problems. Spike protein: Even the very specific protein, the spike protein, that is supposed to be expressed is not without its problems. Especially so when this takes place outside the intended muscle tissue.Junk DNA:Another huge problem is the junk DNA that is contained in these products, which is a result of another problem being the manufacturing process. The one used for mass production to be more specific, cannot produce a clean and safe product.QA and process problems: There is also massive variance in the overall contents of these products, the various impurities and the amount of the nanolipids themself. This in combination with other factors like shelflife and the injection itself can result in orders of magnitude of different amount of received nanolipids. Which in turn explains the reason why some victims get almost instant serious side effects and many can escape unharmed.Many other problems too.After more than two shots, it is commonly known that any vaccine will quickly start to generate negative results. Especially so because in the case of these products the body continues to produce the spike protein for a very very long time. This often results in the immune system to stop responding to this protein.The product, even when it works as intended produces only one type of antibodies which are not nearly as effective as natural immunity.The nature of the type of viruses that this product is supposed to provide protection for unfortunately dictates the fact that any vaccine is highly unlikely to ever work against them. These viruses simply mutate far too quickly and the vaccines end up doing more harm and useless load to the immune system than anything useful.","title":"Newsweek: Matt Gaetz has claimed congressional committees are declining to investigate injuries caused by the coronavirus vaccines because \\"they are bought and paid for by Big Pharma,\\" without providing any supporting evidence."},{"text":"Ey-oh! ?? to sausage on that.

This highlights the value of intelligence, competence, and education in leaders.8. **Anti-Intellectualism and its Effects on Society**: The film serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of anti-intellectualism, showing how a society that celebrates ignorance will ultimately suffer from poor governance, environmental degradation, and cultural decay.","title":"Donald Trump Jr. says pushback against Cabinet picks proves theyre the disrupters voters wanted"},{"text":"In reality of course, winding up politicians in your own party with ridiculous nominations is just stupid and ineffective.

It encourages students to think critically about the role of government, individual freedom, and the nature of truth.2. **Literary Significance**: The novel is considered a classic of English literature and is one of the most influential dystopian novels of the 20th century. It has had a significant impact on modern culture, contributing phrases like \\"Big Brother,\\" \\"doublethink,\\" and \\"thoughtcrime\\" to the popular lexicon.3. **Relevance to Modern Issues**: Despite being published in 1949, the themes of \\"1984\\" remain relevant in the modern world. Issues such as government surveillance, censorship, and propaganda are still pertinent, perhaps even more so with the advent of the internet and social media.4. **Critical Thinking Skills**: Reading and analyzing the novel can help students develop critical thinking skills. It encourages them to question the information they receive, to understand the power of language and narratives, and to recognize the importance of individual thought and resistance.5. **Understanding of Historical Context**: The novel provides insights into the historical context of the mid-20th century, including the rise of totalitarian regimes, the Cold War, and the fears that were prevalent during that time. This understanding can help students appreciate the origins of contemporary societal concerns about power and control.6. **Examination of Human Nature**: \\"1984\\" delves into aspects of human nature, such as the desire for power, the capacity for cruelty, and the resilience of the human spirit. These are universal themes that resonate with students on a personal level.7. **Preparation for Advanced Studies**: As a significant work of literature, studying \\"1984\\" in high school prepares students for more advanced literary analysis at the college level and helps them to engage with complex texts in a supportive environment.8. **Engagement with Dystopian Genre**: Dystopian fiction is a popular genre among young adults. Engaging with \\"1984\\" can spark a broader interest in literature and help students draw connections between different works within the genre.","title":"Donald Trump Jr. says pushback against Cabinet picks proves theyre the disrupters voters wanted"},{"text":"The inferior got their way.

While it's under no circumstances a progressive country and it absolutely has a totalitarian regime, no other society in the world has seen social liberalisation as fast as them. Don't get me wrong, again, they're living in, at best early 1900s levels, but when you consider the fact that 10 years ago they were in the 1850s, it's pretty impressive. I don't think it's possible to modernize a society like Saudi from the top down by passing immediate liberal reforms - society is far more conservative and you likely risk losing your power. But whether it's a result of MBS(not a fan, he's a murderous bastard) just wanting to liberalise, or societal pressure from being a close US ally, Saudi in the last 10 years HAS seen an overall societal liberalisation, that anyone would agree has been supported by the government. Progress in other countries has never been this rapid even when there are strong supporters in leadership(India, for example, has had no fault divorce since 1955 and remains one of the country with the least divorce rates, and no, most Indian marriages are not happy ones) and in some cases where external forces have been involved in attempting, it's been reversed by reactionaries(Iran). I don't think this has much to do with Saudi specifically- they lucked with a leader who's open to it at the right time. But that means your main point is wrong - imo Saudi is a good example to leave countries alone to eventually liberalise.

We can look at Saudi Arabia and study their systemic oppression of women without this idea that any one culture is superior to another. The \\"justification\\" of Saudi Arabian culture is not to make excuses for oppression but to analyze the state of their society without Western superiority bias. I would argue that women are second class citizens in the West too. In the West, women are sexualized severely and sexual harassment, abuse, assault, and rape are severely common in our society. Not just hypothetical street rapists, but rape as a tool of systemic oppression from men to women. We are not the golden standard of treating women well. In a sociological sense, our view of gender progression is Western in the first place. Is the over-sexualization of women \\"freedom\\"? What events led up to Saudi Arabia's oppression of women in this manner, and what led to ours? Based on our lived experience, over-sexualization is normalized, and thus we deem such a consequence of \\"agency\\" instead of a tool of oppression. Often our own morality is subjective to our lived experiences. You don't understand Saudi Arabia because it isn't your culture. Yes, they suck to women. Yet women are \\"\\"\\"happy\\"\\"\\" not because they aren't oppressed, but because their lived experiences are powerfully personal. They do not exist outside of their lived experience, as you do not. It is easy to point and say \\"look how bad they treat women!\\" but it is important to look at such sociologically in our examinations, and understand that it isn't as simple as just raiding their societies and forcing them to \\"free\\" women.

Proponents argue that a healthy domestic steel and aluminum industry is critical to national defense and that the tariffs were necessary to protect these industries from foreign competition that could potentially undercut them on price.2. **Economic Protectionism:** Supporters of the tariffs believe that they help to shield American manufacturers and workers from unfair trade practices, such as dumping (selling goods below cost) and government subsidies that give foreign competitors an advantage.3. **Trade Deficit Reduction:** Trump's administration aimed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, and tariffs were seen as a tool to encourage domestic production and reduce reliance on imported goods.4. **Leverage in Trade Negotiations:** The Trump administration used the threat of tariffs as leverage to negotiate better trade deals with other countries, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).**Arguments Against the Tariffs:**1. **Increased Costs:** Critics argue that tariffs raise costs for U.S. manufacturers that rely on imported steel and aluminum, making their products less competitive both domestically and internationally.2. **Retaliatory Tariffs:** Many countries responded to the U.S. tariffs by imposing their own tariffs on American goods, which has hurt U.S. exporters, particularly in the agricultural sector.3. **Economic Disruption:** The tariffs have caused disruptions in global supply chains, which can lead to inefficiencies and higher prices for consumers.4. **Impact on Allies:** The imposition of tariffs on allies, particularly members of the European Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners, and other G7 nations, has strained diplomatic relationships and raised concerns about the cohesion of alliances that are important for U.S. national security.The Biden administration's decision to modify the tariffs through negotiated agreements with certain allies reflects a recognition of both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the original policy. By replacing tariffs with tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for the EU and reaching similar deals with the UK and Japan, the administration aims to balance the protection of American industries with the need to maintain strong international relationships and ensure a stable supply of critical materials.The continuation of the basic framework of the tariffs, albeit with modifications, suggests that the current administration sees some value in the policy but is also sensitive to the criticisms and the need for flexibility in trade policy. It is also an acknowledgment that trade policy can be a complex tool for achieving economic, diplomatic, and national security objectives.","title":"Trump seeks pledge that his Treasury secretary will enact tough tariffs"},{"text":"At least the rich made out well.","title":"Opinion: Donald Trump's 2024 election the death knell for experiment.

There hasn't been an election with a significant difference in votes since Regan beat Mondale by almost 17 million votes.  The difference in votes between the winner and runner-up as a percentage of the total electorate has only been greater than 5% on five occasions going back to 1960.What I am saying is a wide swath of the population is leaning more and more towards authoritarianism because of propaganda and a total breakdown of media and journalistic standards in the US. If that problem was fixed elections would still be close but fights would be between more reasonable candidates. Sensationalism, propaganda, and misinformation is taking attention away from real complex issues and radicalizing people such that they are become comfortable justifying ever more extreme candidates.It just so happens that people who are more susceptible to misinformation also tend to lean conservative so we see one side pushing further out than the other and eventually it can no longer be balanced.Trump won it by a small margin because of big donors and influencers like Musk feeding the beastThat's not a Musk problem that's a Citizens United problem. Again, the issue isn't individuals. There will always be people eager to buy a president. The problem is the *system* which allows for that and the US system seems almost designed for it.The amount Musk funneled into the last election was a small amount compared to the volumes people like the Koch Brothers or fossil fuel lobbyists have spent on Republican candidates in the past couple of decades. Timothy Mellon put $150 million into Trump but you probably don't even know who that is because the news focuses on Elon Musk.","title":"Opinion: Donald Trump's 2024 election the death knell for experiment.

The resignation came after a prolonged period of public criticism and tension between Sessions and President Trump, primarily stemming from Sessions' decision to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Here are the key reasons leading to Sessions' resignation:+    Recusal from the Russia Investigation: Shortly after being confirmed as Attorney General in February 2017, Sessions recused himself from any investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign, including the Russia investigation, due to his role in the Trump campaign and meetings with the Russian ambassador. This recusal decision was based on the advice of Department of Justice ethics officials and existing DOJ regulations.+    President Trump's Dissatisfaction: President Trump was reportedly angry with Sessions' recusal because he believed it was unnecessary and led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Trump felt that Sessions' recusal left him vulnerable and exposed to the investigation, which he frequently referred to as a \\"witch hunt.\\"+    Public Criticism: Throughout Sessions' tenure, Trump publicly criticized him on numerous occasions, often airing his grievances on Twitter. The president expressed his disappointment and frustration with Sessions' handling of various issues, including the Russia investigation, the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, and immigration enforcement.+    Political Pressure: The relentless criticism from the president created significant political pressure on Sessions. Despite this, Sessions generally remained committed to his principles and the independence of the Department of Justice.+    2018 Midterm Elections: The timing of Sessions' resignation came just one day after the 2018 midterm elections, in which the Democratic Party gained control of the House of Representatives. Some speculated that Trump waited until after the elections to avoid potential political fallout that could have affected Republican electoral prospects.+    Interim Appointment: With Sessions' departure, President Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General, a move that was controversial due to Whitaker's publicly expressed skepticism of the Mueller investigation. Whitaker's appointment allowed Trump to bypass the normal line of succession, which would have made Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein the acting attorney general, given Sessions' recusal.Sessions' tenure as Attorney General was marked by his efforts to implement the administration's tough-on-crime policies, advance immigration enforcement, and support law enforcement. However, his relationship with President Trump was irrevocably damaged by the recusal decision, leading to his eventual resignation.","title":"Speaker Mike Johnson leaves the door open to recess appointments"},{"text":"I mean, we dont NEED a huge military budget anymore, can we please do something better with that money?","title":"\\nTrumps partisan army would end American military might.

Another Muslim ban will be attempted, which is another human right removed. Voting rights act could be gutted.

In 1936, membership of these groups became compulsory.The Hitler Youth was for boys aged between ten and eighteen.  By 1932, it had just over 100,000 members. By 1934, this number would rise to over three and a half million.The Hitler Youth took part in a range of activities, focusing on sports and physical ability. Examples of their activities include boxing and camping trips, **instruction in National Socialist ideology, such as antisemitism** and commitment to Hitler, and military training, such as shooting.The League of German Girls was split into two divisions. The Jungm?del (Young Girls League) was for girls aged fourteen and under, and the Gluabe und Sch?nheit (Faith and Beauty) was for young women aged seventeen to twenty-one.The Young Girls League focused on similar activities to the Hitler Youth, with activities such as camping, sports, and instruction in National Socialist ideology. In contrast to the Hitler Youth, girls were also instructed in chores such as making beds, in line with the Nazis views on womens place in society.The Faith and Beauty organisation followed a similar agenda, but also emphasised the Nazi ideal image of a woman.All youth organisations under the Nazi Party were anti-intellectual. Whilst they did not replace school, they reduced the influence and importance of education to children.According to Nazi ideology, a womans place was in the home. In their approach to German women, the Nazis emphasised three traditional guiding principles: Kche, Kinder and Kirche (kitchen, children and church).Of these, Kinder was of particular importance and women in Nazi Germany were encouraged to marry and have as many children as possible to further the Nazis  eugenic  goals of building a strong German  Aryan   race. To promote this, a law was passed in June 1933 allowing newly married couples to claim interest free loans of 1000 Reichsmarks . Each time the couple then had a child, 25% of the loan was written off.  **Childbirth and pregnancy were further encouraged by bans on abortions (which were made punishable by death),  sterilisations  (for Aryan women), and contraception .**- courtesy of theholocaustexplained.org","title":"Trumps 2023 vow on education sounds a lot like reparations"},{"text":"Reek*","title":"Elon Musk may already be overstaying his welcome in Trump's orbit  He has been so aggressive in pushing his views about the president-elect's second term that hes stepping on the toes of the transition team and may be overstaying his welcome at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"Failing to remove the SALT deduction cap to pass the IRA in it's final form burned a lot of goodwill from upper income Democrats.\\nMay have genuinely costed Harris the election.","title":"The End of Denial - How Trumps rising popularity in New York (and everywhere else) exposed the Democratic Partys break with reality"},{"text":"What I really want the FCC to do is end my isp's bullshit and ever more untenable data cap.","title":"Trump just chose Brendan Carr for FCC chief - he won't uphold Net Neutrality"},{"text":"Sadly, they also love watching each other beat their brains in","title":"Trump flanked by top allies, cabinet picks at UFC 309: 'USA, USA'"},{"text":"Well he did apologize and it didn't rise to the level of sexual assault or rape.

They didn't even meet the low bar defined by the strictest interpretation of the law. Their bias is undeniable.Until democrats start to acknowledge that established institutions are working against them, democrats will continue to lose. The Democratic Party establishment are fierce institutionalists, deathly afraid of proposing anything that would upset the status quo., afraid to even analyze election results for their validity, lest they upset the American people.With modern election laws, there are, undeniably, ways to cheat an election. The democratic party establishment is afraid to even investigate, to even look, to even question the very first initial unverified outcome.

Being willing to at least *question* Israel-first Neoconservative foreign policy (see for example Tulsi Gabbard) and,2. Understanding the basic reality of the \\"deep state,\\" i.e. that the bureaucracy, military-industrial-congressional-complex and civil service sectors are self-interested groups that keep standing in the way of necessary market-based reforms and will do everything necessary to perpetuate their own existence and grow their own budgets. This is *elementary* Public Choice Theory straight out of Niskanen (one of the founders of the Cato Institute if I remember correctly). Even if Trump isn't a libertarian himself, he has the same basic enemies libertarians do, wants to take a chainsaw to them, and (unlike most libertarians) has energy and popular support behind him.Look, the \\"cosmotarian/paleolibertarian\\" or Cato/Mises Institute divide gets wanked over a lot, but its REALLY a strategic division over this question: do we try to win by persuading the establishment intelligentsia that we are correct, or do we try to win by making our case to the common man?Since the establishment intelligentsia are basically a self-interested group, and mostly dependent on government for their jobs/employment (directly or indirectly), they have a strong financial incentive to *be hostile towards libertarianism*. This is one of the biggest reasons why, despite us being *demonstrably correct* on the economics, we don't make progress into the Ivory Towers. Its way past time we took the case to the common man. Javier Milei did it and succeeded. Unfortunately it requires making some compromises in the name of building a coalition capable of capturing the decisive vote in a democratic election.

Circumcision really has no long term negative impacts on people who have it done, it's just unecessary. Female genital mutilation has a lot of terrible outcomes.From the WHO , the forms it takes are horrificType 1:?*This is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glans).*Type 2:?*This is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).*Type 3:?*Also known as?infibulation, this is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glans.*Type 4:?*This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g., pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.*The negative long term outcomes are significant and numerous, again from the WHO*FGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways. It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and it interferes with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies. Although all forms of FGM are associated with increased risk of health?complications, the risk is greater with more severe forms of FGM.**Immediate complications of FGM can include:** *severe pain*\\n* *excessive bleeding (haemorrhage)*\\n* *genital tissue swelling*\\n* *fever*\\n* *infections e.g., tetanus*\\n* *urinary problems*\\n* *wound healing problems*\\n* *injury to surrounding genital tissue*\\n* *shock*\\n* *death.**Long-term complications can include:** *urinary problems (painful urination, urinary tract infections);*\\n* *vaginal problems (discharge, itching, bacterial vaginosis and other infections);*\\n* *menstrual problems (painful menstruations, difficulty in passing menstrual blood, etc.);*\\n* *scar tissue and keloid;*\\n* *sexual problems (pain during intercourse, decreased satisfaction, etc.);*\\n* *increased risk of childbirth complications (difficult delivery, excessive bleeding, caesarean section, need to resuscitate the baby, etc.) and newborn deaths;*\\n* *need for later surgeries: for example, the sealing or narrowing of the vaginal opening (type 3) may lead to the practice of cutting open the sealed vagina later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth (deinfibulation). Sometimes genital tissue is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing both immediate and long-term risks; and*\\n* *psychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.).*","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"You mean once the technology is perfected.

You must be young. I grew up in the '80s and '90s and I learned all about slavery, world wars, the civil war, civil rights, and factual history. \\"Back then,\\" there was no diversity, equity, inclusion bs that made kids feel bad for being a white male or whatever. I didn't do shit to anyone of color and no one of color did anything to me. We weren't even alive then. I grew up in the deep South and was absolutely the minority in my community and school. I had many black friends and still have those same friendships today. No big deal to be different races. Today's DEI is absolutely overboard compared to factual history and is part of a political punishment for skin color. It's insane and thankfully is being stopped. It's so disrespectful and, frankly a form of mental abuse. The instant someone tells you you should feel bad about something that happened in the past simply because of your skin color, is the moment you should realize it is not history, rather it is part of an indoctrination of making you ashamed of who you were born as. That's horrible. Don't spread misinformation; civil war history, slavery, civil rights, WW-I, II, etc. will still be taught.  Facts cannot be changed or manipulated as history stands on its own. Unless, of course, you have information that nobody else does. Not MSNBC hysteria, actual facts that civil rights, slavery, all of it will cease to be taught. And before you think you're clever, no I don't have proof of my statements, either. I'm willing to bookmark this post and return 3 to 4 years from now to make sure you understand how incorrect you truly are. Stop being a part of the problem and join those who prefer facts over rewriting history. It's okay to be black. It's okay to be white. It's okay to be Asian. It's okay to be who you are.

I've never seen this kind of reaction from the media or from people on the left or from people in general over any other person.

This was a key reason that we finally got a protein based vaccine approved for everyone.These injured folks are very common in the LC communities and I have spoke to many of them. And vaccine injury is not a new concept, when my kids got vaccinated we got a pamphlet on what to do if they got injured and how to access a government program to pay folks who it happens to.The problem is this kills mRNA as a platform and there is big money behind making mRNA vaccines for all vaccines because it turns our vaccines into a subscription service.So, instead of a vaccine being good for life, they are moving to them only being good for years or even months.They won't investigate it and currently because of a bill passed in 1992 by the first Bush, 69% of the FDA biologicals (that's vaccines) budget comes directly from the pharma companies trying to get approvals.It's not even a conspiracy theory, it's actually how they rigged up the system in the early 90sSo, while Gaetz is a child predator, he is not wrong about this issue and there is THE BIGGEST money behind it.Also, I like turtles.","title":"Newsweek: Matt Gaetz has claimed congressional committees are declining to investigate injuries caused by the coronavirus vaccines because \\"they are bought and paid for by Big Pharma,\\" without providing any supporting evidence."},{"text":"It's also too complicated of a topic to not harm the party.

Which yes, can technically be done under the laws of this country, but isn't a democratic action. Another example is the supreme court. Now, I may not be as bothered  by who sits on it when they rule in ways that protect my human rights, but the appointment of lifelong judges who get to make national policy decisions is inherently autocratic. So, as we saw under Trump, he will absolutely appoint the most extreme conservatives possible. Gay marriage? See ya. Mass deportations? They will happen. How quickly people forget that we had internment camps in this country. There are many people still alive who were children in those camps.
