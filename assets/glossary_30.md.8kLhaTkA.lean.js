You should be free to have and express any opinion you want to. Others might have a reaction to that opinion, which is their right too. The right to free expression is not the right to not feel shame or embarrassment, or the right to not have anyone disagree or call you out. The right to free expression is it the right to a platform. If your view isnt wanted in a space, or violates agreed terms, or otherwise can impact a business for platforming you, you dont have a right to force your view anyway. The right to free expression is not the right to harm others. That is why freedom of speech is limited. Threats, terrorizing, abuse, and slander all extend beyond ones right to free expression. And lastly, and a bit more ambiguous, the right to free expression should not be the right to lie, on a scale where those lies can impact and harm others. I dont think lying, on its own, should have a legal penalty. But couching lies as free expression is an abuse, and should not be tolerated. We should not elevate lies to equal status as the truth, just because of free expression.

Despite feverish searching with Scripture in one hand and cutting-edge technology in the other, evidence backing the Bible remains elusive. But there are some surprising anomalies](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2017-11-01/ty-article-magazine/is-the-bible-a-true-story-latest-archaeological-finds-yield-surprises/0000017f-eb2f-ddba-a37f-eb6fc2260000)\\n**Beauty and biblical evidence both lie in the eye of the beholder, it seems. No evidence of the events described in the Book of Genesis has ever been found. No city walls have been found at Jericho**from the appropriate era, that could have been toppled by Joshua or otherwise. The stone palace uncovered at the foot of Temple Mount in Jerusalem could attest that King David had been there; or it might belong to another era entirely, depending who you ask.Archaeologists always hope that advances in technology will shed fresh light on at least part of this ancient mystery: Did the Bible really happen? So far, what discoveries there are, tend to indicate that at the least, the timelines are off.A paucity of evidenceEighteen years ago, on October 29, 1999, Haaretz published an article by Tel Aviv Universitys Zeev Herzog, whose message was spelled out in the very headline: The Bible: No evidence on the ground.Of what? No evidence that the children of Israel sojourned in Egypt, passed through a miraculously parted Red Sea, wandered the Sinai Desert for 40 years or indeed any years, and no evidence that they conquered the land of Israel and divided it up among 12 tribes of Israel. The renowned archaeologist also shared his suspicion that David and Solomons United Kingdom, described in the Bible as a regional power, was at most a minor tribal domain.Jehovah, the God of Israel, had a wife and the early Israelite religion adopted monotheism only towards the end of the period of the kingdom, not at Mount Sinai, Herzog also wrote.The unbridgeable gap Herzog described between the Biblical tales and the archaeological findings was nothing new, to researchers. Israeli archaeologists have long thought as much, based on biblical criticism theories originating in Germany during the early 19th century. The general public, however, was shocked.Today, 18 years on, armed with cutting-edge dating and molecular technologies, archaeologists increasingly agree with Herzog that generally, the Bible does not reflect historical truths. But the jurys out on several key issues, and at least some stories have been bolstered by actual discoveries, for instance, in the copper mines of Timna, the mysterious powerful fort of Qeiyafa, and in Jerusalem itself.Meanwhile, everybody wants to know whether the Bible is literally true, from the layman to the clergy, to the political echelon, pertaining as it does to questions of identity and our right to the land.Among archaeologists, the camps have split according to academic institution: In Jerusalem the biblical (maximalist) camp dominates, for instance arguing that the impressive palace found in the City of David practically had to have belonged to David. In Tel Aviv, the critical (minimalist) camp prevails, arguing that there is no evidence to buttress the bible, and that the palace in Jerusalem evidently doesnt date to the Davidic era.The founding fathers of Israeli archaeology explicitly set out with the Bible in one hand and a pick in the other, seeking findings from the biblical eras, as part of the Zionist project. But as excavations progressed in the 1970s and 1980s, rather than substantiation, what began to pile up was contradictions.In Jericho no wall was found from the era that Joshua was supposed to have lived, around the mid-13th century B.C.E., that he could have caused to tumble down. No evidence has been found that a large new group of people entered into Canaan during the post-Exodus settlement period.There is, in fact, no evidence to substantiate Exodus.In Jerusalem, no concrete remains have been found from the purported glorious United Kingdom, and nowhere is there ex-biblical evidence of the kings David or Solomon either, with the possible exception of the Beitdavid inscription (more on that below). Nor do major archaeological tells conform to biblical descriptions, until after the period of the purported United Kingdom.From the Egyptian frying pan into the fireThe last 18 years of digging have changed basically nothing about the very earliest Biblical periods, for all the advances in archaeological technique.Open gallery view\\nTell Hatzor, aerial view\\nCredit: Yuva Gesser\\nArchaeology has not been able to find the Patriarch Abraham, or signs of his heirs. There is no evidence that the Children of Israel ever went to Egypt, or fled it in the Exodus.Israeli archaeology was late to adopt carbon-14 dating techniques, and until recently dated sites relying largely on pottery. Today not only is C-14 being used to date organic materials: advanced techniques enable inorganic materials and structures to be dated as well. And the new discoveries occasionally rock the boat, in both camps.If anything, archaeologists find inconsistencies between the biblical accounts and the facts. For example, the Book of Genesis mentions camels, but the earliest domestic camel bones found in Israel date to around 930 B.C.E., about a millennia after their appearance according to the Bible.(Read the article for more)","title":"Texas GOP chair denies church-state separation as lawmakers, pastors prep for spiritual battle"},{"text":"It's fucking gross how slow americans are over the GOP. lol @ being the party of national security **ever**.

Most jobs it doesnt matter. Theyve been pushing more remote/telehealth stuff in healthcare across the board for policy and insurance reasons. Even my job a bit and we manage ventilators and thats a disaster.I sincerely doubt they have, if for no other reason than this being the government and it is an incoming administration and majority party that has tepid-to-nil support for WFH in both voting base and in elected officials, taking over from an administration and party that very much supports WFH.As an anecdote, my brother works in IT and his office has been WFH since he was hired. Productivity was absolutely up across the board and there really wasnt a good argument to reverse it. Not even business wise because, well if productivity is up and everything is going well there, and costs are down on in person office use, whats the reason?They reversed it and lost more than half their team, with mostly the newest most entry level people staying. I dont understand this crusade against WFH if the tech and data is there. I see no benefit to pushing this hardcore anti-WFH stance unless a given domain of work is truly better done in person or the work cannot be done remotely such as my job in healthcare.Even then, I know of areas that I can work in my field where they absolutely have been trying hybrid and WFH stuff/remote/telehealth, often due to insurance companies and reimbursement structures pushing tell health models. I think thats a disaster for my field and that still hasnt stopped it from being tried even with the most critical thing we do which is managing ventilators and critical airways (managing the vent remotely as backup or primary with secondary being dispatch somebody in person is how thats been tried, and managing such a thing should always start with assessment from patient to machine and back unless its obvious)The messaging isnt consistent. Sometimes its that companies and the gov need people back in person to get workers back on track. Sometimes its like healthcare where its pushed because often the best way to profit or the best way to survive reimbursement structure changes, even if it is objectively insane.

I don't know how difficult the resources are to extract - probably fairly tough in many spots given the huge ice sheet...It is a pointless distraction mostly.  Canada is so obviously trolling I can't believe anyone gives it any thought.  I did happen to learn recently that the US Articles of Confederation allowed Canada to join if it wanted to.

It's a major strategic point.  I don't think he will invade it.  But if the US bought it, I can see it being admitted as a territory with self governance and no ability to vote in federal elections, free trade with the US and its allies, and in exchange, the US military will ramp up its presence for its strategy while also adding to protecting Greenland.  It really is a win for the US and Greenland; with Denmark getting some money as well.  Depending on how much (and Denmark could really price gouge given how bad the US wants it) and if Denmark is smart, they could use it to become a dominant European power, possibly even bigger than Germany.  The possibilities are endless.  They could easily become an innovation hub in tech or healthcare with that chunk of change.Panama is another strategic point.

This seems to have started organically by her deciding to \\"whistle blow\\" on the Dem campaign spending on TV, then facing backlash and criticism from Democrats, and then also being wooed by Trump, specifically Eric Trump. They're probably dangling a lot of carrots in front of her face, like a job in the administration, that would be hard for anyone to resist. In addition, whatever reason she was with the Democrats in the first place does not appear to be because she was a strong left-wing ideologue. So, Li's switch seems more career-oriented than ideology-oriented. And I suspect she may be angling for a hosting job on Fox News as well. And Trump probably cares more about siphoning off donors from the Democrats than he does about whatever her ideology is.All that being said, there is another well-known Democrat fundraiser defector from last year, Evan Barker. From her writings and posts, I understand a lot more why SHE left the Democrat party than why Li did. Barker has said she was a populist, watched her whole family switch from Democrats to Trump over the years, and had many moments at the DNC in particular where she felt the Democrats were being snobs and elitists.

As a historian, I have studied this timeline before. Its not hyperbole when I state that we are showing a lot of signs of an approaching another civil war. Trump is threatening to use the military to deny states their own state rights. They are threatening to literally target blue cities and deny them aid in the event of natural disasters (see their comments on the California wildfires). They are threatening to remove voting from the states and centralize it at the federal level, thus stripping statehoods of their autonomy and the election process of its checks and balances (which have already been severely hindered). California has the 4th largest economy in the world and we pay $1.25 in taxes for every $1.00 in federal aid we receive. Red states are the highest recipients of federal aid, yet they are also still the poorest in the nation. So, yes, we need to split up at this point.

That republican establishment is now completely gone.  Yes Democrats lost the election, but tens of millions of people still voted for them.  These people deserve political representation, and they did not vote for Dems to be a trump lite party.

Dogs need a lot of protein in their diet, which means that they require meat and other high-quality food, which could be more efficiently used to feed humans directly or to grow livestock that is better adapted to converting produce into meat.While a single or occasional case of eating dog meat may not carry much weight morally, the large-scale adoption of eating dogs would have a significant impact on the environment, and would therefore be immoral.","title":"cmv: Eating dogs or cats is not bad."},{"text":"Those Republicans sure showed those 1 or 2 trans athletes per state.

It was a promise that the government would never try to force censure of religious ideals..This idea has been pushed to its limits by evangelical propaganda.  The wall is bidirectional.  It was always intended to be bidirectional.  That's why there are two separate and independent clauses in the first amendment.  There are ample quotes from the author of the bill of rights which clearly outline his mistrust, nay disdain of organized religion's attempts to control government.  Detached Memoranda is a scathing rebuke of theocratic influence.  He had no doubts at all about what the Establishment Clause meant.  He was even appalled by early attempts to make churches tax free entities.  He refers to churches there as \\"Ecclesiastical Corporations\\" which I take to be a non-subtle dig at their profit motive.  How can a statement like this one be misinterpreted by any fair minded person?  Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States **the danger of encroachment by Ecclesiastical Bodies, may be illustrated by precedents already furnished in their short history.**It is astounding to me that anyone could conclude that learned enlightenment men who were influenced by John Locke would willingly invite the church to direct the government.   Already in the short existence of the colonies they had seen the impact of theocratic governance, and knew well the sorts of abuses it led to.  There is not a chance in hell that they wanted to allow government of and by the people to be based on doctrine rather than rule of law.  Jefferson even compiled own version of Bible, which removed every bit of superstition and dogma, retaining only the positive philosophy. He was left with about 25 pages with very wide margins.   Yes certainly, they allowed things like prayers before congressional sessions and state events.  That's not remotely the same thing as crafting laws to codify Leviticus.  There's a wide gulf between allowing people the wiggle room to express their faith vs passing laws which limit other people's ability to express themselves in order to satisfy other people's faith.

And there was a lot of ridicule because of your heritage. Women are still viewed in many quarters as lesser human beings in certain circumstances. Today, because of Affirmative Action, the definition has changed to highlight the differences rather than looking for merit. Weve dug a hole for ourselves that may take a century to get out of.

She also didnt know the difference between key surveillance powers, according to the report.Senator Reveals Why Gabbard Confirmation Hearing Is Delayed\\nBOGGED DOWN\\nZachary Folk\\nThe gaffes came in meetings with Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), according to two Republican Senate aides and an unnamed Trump transition official.Rounds also read the statutory language for the role of director of national intelligence and asked how she could possibly meet that threshold. When he asked how she would handle specific elements of the job, she said she would have to just wait and see when she gets there.Trumps team declined to let the Journal interview Gabbard and said in a statement that she appreciated the chance to address [senators] questions and share her vision for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The Daily Beast has reached out for comment.Gabbard is an Army Reserve lieutenant colonel and was deployed to Iraq but has little intelligence experience. She has repeated Kremlin talking points, including blaming NATO for Russias invasion of Ukraine, and secretly met with Syrias former President Bashar al-Assad in 2017the same year she also questioned a U.S. intelligence report claiming that Assad had used chemical weapons against the Syrian people.So far, none of that has been disqualifying, though.Right-Wing Medias Hilarious Self-Own Over Tulsi Gabbard\\nFRIENDLY FIRE\\nJanna Brancolini\\nOn Sunday, Lankford told NBCs Meet the Press he would vote to Gabbard confirm her after she pulled a 180 on an electronic surveillance program that targets national-security suspects living abroad. Previously, she had opposed the program, which is laid out in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, but now shes in favor, she announced.Rounds, meanwhile, sent her away with homework after their first meeting. She spoke to the experts hed suggested and showed improvement in a follow-up meeting on Monday, he told the Journal in a statement, adding that he would do what he could to support her during the confirmation process.Ultimately, no Republican senators have said they would oppose her nomination, though Sen. John Curtis of Utah and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine claim theyre still making up their minds.And if any do ultimately vote against her, Trump megadonor, adviser and First Buddy Elon Musk has indicated his support for primary challenges against Republican senators who dont fall in line on Trumps Cabinet nominees.","title":"Trumps Pick to Lead National Intelligence Couldnt Say What the Job Actually Is"},{"text":"Of course not, that is a big reason why she was picked, unfortunately.","title":"AG nominee Pam Bondi won't say that Trump lost 2020 election"},{"text":"Oh yeah this mfer who showed up at that shitshow of a press conference in New Orleans to shove people out of the way and posture in front of the cameras.","title":"Discussion Thread: U.S. Attorney General Nominee Pam Bondi Testifies at Confirmation Hearing"},{"text":"Im sorry what?","title":"The inauguration is on MLK Day."},{"text":"Sam Bankman Fried had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.","title":"Discussion Thread: U.S. Attorney General Nominee Pam Bondi Testifies at Confirmation Hearing"},{"text":"We could live beside the ocean Leave the fire behindSwim out past the breakersAnd watch the world die","title":"The GOP Is No Longer the Party of National Security | Americas allies and enemies watched as Trumps pick for defense secretary failed to quell concerns about his character and qualifications"},{"text":"So much for any foreign allies sharing intelligence with America.
