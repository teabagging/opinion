We have all the funding we need out of Russia.\\nDonald Trump JR, 2014Here is just of the things that connects him.  \\nTrumps main financial backer for the Trump Tower Toronto was a Russian-Canadian billionaire who got the money by selling a massive steel mill in Ukraine for nearly a billion dollars. $100 million of that money was paid to a Kremlin-backed fixer, likely as a bribe to VERY high Russian officials. The Chairman of the Bank who financed the deal? Vladimir Putin.Trump bought his home in Palm Beach, Florida for $41 million. A few years later, with no real increase in the value  he sold it for $95 million  the most expensive home in America at the time! Why? A major Russian oligarch bought it  we dont know yet why he effectively gave Trump $54 million. But its classic money laundering practice.Trumps real estate deals were often fuelled by Russian money, typically passed through shady shell companies. 77% of Trump Soho apartments were bought with cash by such mysterious companies. At least 13 people with links to Russian oligarchs or mobsters lived in Trump properties, including one of Russias top mobsters. One even ran a high-stakes illegal gambling ring in the apartment right below Trumps!\\nRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets\\nDonald Trump JR, 2008Trumps financial broker and Senior Advisor was a Russian convicted felon named Felix Sater, widely known as a mafia figure who once stabbed someone in the face with a broken margarita glass, requiring over 100 stitches. Sater helped set up shell companies, and arranged funding for Trumps projects, including plans for Trump Tower Moscow. Hes also part of Putins inner circle. Heres one email he wrote to Trumps lawyer Michael Cohen in November, 2015:?Michael I arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putins private chair at his desk and office in the Kremlin. I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected. We both know no one else knows how to pull this off without stupidity or greed getting in the way.

I think she is genuinely one of the ones they do want to get her spot. Not necessarily to spy for Russia or anything like that, despite her close ties to them. Just to try to force our national intelligence apparatus and military liaisons to Ukraine to stop sharing information with them. I think thats the biggest factor right now. This pick is obviously meant to help Trump give Putin what he wants in Ukraine. That combined with his plans to fire generals that get in his way or dont like him already. Ukraine has relied on an abundance of Intel and other kinds of non combat support from our national defense. Its a large part of why Ukraine has fought so well this war. They can get info distributed to their soldiers that is bolstered by access to U.S. and other nations existing intelligence gathering sources. Thats the support he will try to withdraw next. Its not just that hes not going to send them more aid, hes going to take away one of their biggest advantages: the attention and support of our military complex. Putin knows the US is a much more formidable military power than his country is, and that the world sees it. Hes concerned with trying to withdraw from this conflict with minimal additional embarrassment for himself, to preserve his own power. People underestimate how threatening this war has been to Putins power, both domestically and abroad for him. The U.S. intelligence apparatus and professional military expertise has proven how superior our military is to Russias means. So much so that we were able to arm Ukraine and get them fighting on par with a world class military even with relatively minimal aid in terms of equipment and weapons. And even without many of the weapons our actual military has access to, our robust intelligence capabilities have been a decisive factor in factor in the war. We have been giving Ukraine tons of help with the intel we gather for them, as we have the largest and most advanced infrastructure for that in the world. Putin needs to disrupt that to actually make decisive progress in this war. His military will never be able to get enough of an advantage on Ukraine with the U.S. helping them organize and coordinate their defenses and strikes from behind the scenes. We can literally spy on everything Russia is doing and feed that information straight down to their soldiers in the field in a moments notice, but it is being shared at will by our military and Ukraines other allies. The U.S. constitutes a significant bulk of that.","title":"Senate Republicans deliver a message to Trump: Gaetzs confirmation is in jeopardy"},{"text":"Delayed until 2029 when they can put him in jail without having to deal with the Supreme Court declaring it's interfering with the executive branch.","title":"Trump Sentencing In Hush Money Case Indefinitely Adjourned"},{"text":"Great news.

I've written variations on this post a couple times in different contexts, but it helps to lay this out from a procedural perspective:1.  What is 100% is that ICE directors under Trump will be told to take an aggressive posture as to immigrants and detentions, and you will see an uptick in enforcement efforts.  The standard procedure when any undocumented immigrant is encountered by ICE is that the first option is voluntary deportation.   The individual signs paperwork waiving any right to an immigration hearing and gets a bus ticket or plane ticket back to their home country.    Trump and Miller have been quite clear that they hope to create a climate of fear such that many individuals voluntarily self-deport.  It is also likely they will make some efforts to pursue more aggressive legal proceedings. For example, any immigrant convicted of a crime of \\"moral turpitude\\" can be deported on an expedited basis. 2.  The administration has spoken in terms of pursuing immigrations raids to search for individuals who have already been ordered to leave the country.   There is little to no court remedy for these individuals, they have already had due process.   (Typically this would be a court date for an immigration hearing where they failed to appear).     Of course, a given is that the \\"plain sight\\" doctrine means any other undocumented immigrants are likely to be detained.      However, as the Axios article notes,   there are a lot of practical challenges here rather than legal challenges.     Turf wars between government departments, resistance from local cities and manpower issues are likely to hamper efforts here.  3.  An additional practical challenge noted by the Axios article is that if they detain a significant number of migrants, and those migrants choose NOT to voluntarily waive their rights and be deported, they have to be detained.   That presents an administrative challenge they have to work through.  4. Trump can declare a national emergency and access funding and manpower from other federal departments (including the military) in a support role.    Unless more happens, the military cannot directly participate in law enforcement. But, for example, they could use emergency status to call up national guard and other resources and personnel to come in and assist in building camps to house immigrants pending deportation proceedings.   5. Further out, Trump could theoretically invoke the insurrection act, which allows the military to be used in a law enforcement role directly.  There are legal procedures to be followed here that render that subject to attack and court orders that could prohibit it.  The insurrection act was last used in 1992 during the Rodney King riots, and was used during the vietnam war era as well.   The axisos article again predicts administrative pushback from states and organizational issues inside the government that will be roadblocks here. 6. Finally, and the furthest extent, Trump, Bannon and Miller have spoken of invoking the 1807 Alien Enemies act, which permits summary detention and deportation of \\"alien enemies\\" if the US is the subject of an invasion or is in a state of war.  It was last used in 1941 to justify the detention of Japanese American citizens.

I don't understand the merit in putting people in old-age homes where they continue to live in boredom, cut off from their loved ones.Quite likely, the old people *do* understand the merit of continuing to be alive, despite limited mobility and poor health: they want to be alive, and they don't want to be dead. Similarly, their families want Grandma to be around to see little Susan graduate highschool, even if that means pumping money into Grandma's dialysis treatments that could be more efficiently spent sending Susan to a better college.That's part of what makes human beings human beings; we don't actually practice or believe in utilitarian morals. If Grandma wants to be alive (and overwhelmingly, she does), we are usually more than willing to take care of her so she can keep being alive as long as possible.Skills and credentials can be taught, and otherwise expire in one generation. Genes provide a benefit for future generations, who could still learn the skills and credentials needed.That's not at all true; I can take two identical twins (with, presumably, the same inherent genetic coding for intelligence), and if I send one to better schools and college I will reliably get far better outcomes from that kid than the other twin -- similarly, I can have the most genetically-gifted-child ever, if I wait until they're 10 to teach them to read they will be overwhelmingly likely to have poorer life outcomes than a kid with below-average genetics. You are **vastly** overestimating nature and underestimating nurture.But I digress... let's loop back to the moral and incentive issue in your position:We ought to recycle, even though it's more expensive and time consuming that throwing stuff in the trash. We out to reduce pollution, even though it makes stuff more expensive right now.In these examples, you are relying on the idea that *we* as a human race are doing it for *our* children's futures. However, here are some things that are uncomfortably true for your position:* Some groups of people have far fewer incidences of harmful genes and genetic illnesses than do others.\\n* For example, Jews are significantly more likely to carry genes coding for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, Riley-Day syndrome, fanconi anemia, Goucher disease, Joubert syndrome, attention deficit disorder, clinical depression, and autism.\\n* Meanwhile, ethnic Japanese are surprisingly unlikely to carry genetic illnesses, putting them on the opposite end of the spectrum.Regardless of whether eugenics was \\"done wrong\\" in the past, it is impossible to support the idea that we should eliminate \\"bad\\" traits or produce more \\"good\\" traits through selective breeding, without coming to the conclusion that, a generation from now, there should be no more Jews. Yes, we could all go adopt Japanese children, but you are asking that there be no more Jewish children in the hope that the world will be a better place without us in it.I'm not trying to paint your argument negatively, I'm just telling you that is the thing you are saying -- and it isn't a good solution to the problem statement you came up with in the first place ... if your goal is to reduce the risk of bloom syndrome or cystic fibrosis, etc ... you don't need everyone who might carry these genes to avoid having children. If you have the ability to pinpoint the genes that are causing health issues, you're well on your way to being able to *turn them off.* For that matter, since neonatal testing is quite easy, if you have an embryo that actually *has* those health issues (even if genetic engineering is for some reason out of reach), you can simply decide not to carry it to term.","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"She saw what happened to Cawthorn.

For example, a general contractor who makes $150,000 a year without a college education is more working class than the sociology post-doc student working at Target to cover the bills while they wait for a tenured position to open up. But its also a cultural phenomenon. The Working Class of America is deeper than education or income or even rural/urban.Its Pliny the Elder vs. Miller Lite. Its vacationing in Branson vs. traveling to Europe. Its Ford trucks vs. bike lanes. Its wild-caught salmon vs. smothered pork chops. Its Hokas vs. New Balance. Its Kid Rock vs Taylor Swift. Its Coca-Cola vs Olipops.There are so many other examples that can be used as a proxy, that capture some of the growing cultural rift.I dont know how to exactly quantify it, or even fully explain it.

Then with the Obama campaign in 2008, younger evangelicals began to gravitate toward Obama because they saw what the GOP was doing and Obama had great Evangelical surrogates going out and explaining how his campaign was actually working to reduce the number of abortions and showing how the GOP was doing nothing to that effect. Its a big reason why Obama won (and I say this as a former Evangelical myself who attended such events). So if you pay attention to what happened after 08, the GOP began seeding the ground with a whole range of culture war targets because they knew that they had to fish or cut bait on abortion, which meant they needed a new issue to galvanize their voters.

The decentralized model that the open source community has been experimenting with for years. That way every person would be responsible for the content they post on their own instance. It would be easy for echo chambers to coalesce but they wouldn't have the publicity and reach that they currently do. I suspect platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok are the most culpable for Trump getting elected and disinformation because of the lack of division between echo chambers. People who aren't radicalized see more radical content. That doesn't happen nearly as much on Reddit because people pick the subs that they want to get content from and they never see content from subs they're not interested in. My impression is that with the Reddit model, less people fall into the rabbit hole but the ones that do get more radicalized compared to platforms with less barriers between communities.

Trump has been consistently promising a considerably bigger larger operation using the military and/or national guard to deport millions and even tens of millions of people. But looking just at your stated policy, I'm also not even sure what you are proposing is much different from what we already do. Unauthorized immigrants are already breaking the law and risk being deported. There are some legal paths to become citizens, but certain crimes are going to impact their eligibility. So if I'm understanding your view, I think the main distinction between your view and the status quo pretty much just amounts to the level of Federal resources we should commit to proactively deport these people right now.The other problem is that even if Trump did get the resources to deport all these people that doesn't necessarily mean the other countries will take them. I think this is a big unanswered question in this whole situation and is a good reason to be concerned that his plans are likely to result in \\"unintended\\" situations like concentration camps or international conflicts.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"He declassified it just by thinking about it","title":"Donald Trump is Getting Sensitive, Classified Information Again"},{"text":"It has been  this is just turning it up to 11.","title":"Could Trump and his billionaire buddies turn America into an oligarchy?"},{"text":"Yes, sign Maine upSide note do yall realize how frustrating it is trying to google anything near me and half the time it thinks youre talking about the state and half the time it thinks youre talking about yourself?","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene calls for a national divorce from Americans not on board with Trumps agenda"},{"text":"what sucess?

They include higher education specialists at the Heritage Foundation who contributed to the audacious Project 2025 governing plan, and lawyers who specialize in attacking diversity and inclusion bureaucracies. They are leaders of the very few institutions of higher education that fit the Trumpian view of what a college should offer.As Donald Trump prepares to take office in January, a new conservative higher education cognoscenti, espousing views long considered fringe by the liberal-leaning academic world, are ascendant. They see this moment as one of extraordinary opportunity: Higher education is rarely more than a blip in presidential politics, but Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, made elite schools  their cost, their culture, their politics  a red meat issue in their campaign.

They aim to use federal funding, accreditation boards, taxation, congressional investigations, and, potentially, changes to the Higher Education Act to achieve their goals.These conservative thinkers share a view of higher education as hostile to the kind of society they think they ought to have, said Brendan Cantwell, professor of education at Michigan State University.For the sector, he said, it brings a great deal of uncertainty.Perhaps the most influential and provocative spokesperson for Trump Worlds views on higher education is Christopher Rufo.A right-wing activist and writer, Rufo rose to prominence in the summer of 2020 after an appearance on Tucker Carlsons show on Fox News. He set off a national firestorm by popularizing a critique of critical race theory, a term he wrested from its legal studies roots to include a wide range of teachings about race and racism, calling it an existential threat to the United States.Not long after, the Trump administration tapped him to help draft?[an executive order](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-race-sex-stereotyping/)?to limit how government agencies and contractors talk about race and racism in employee trainings.Hes been all over this space and gradually become more and more influential in these MAGA circles, said Steven Brint, professor of sociology and public policy at the University of California Riverside.In the years since, Rufo, 40, has increasingly focused his attention on higher education. A senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute, Rufo graduated from Georgetown University and Harvard Universitys Extension School before becoming an activist journalist. He was unavailable for an interview.Last year, he played a prominent role in what?[he told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/03/christopher-rufo-claudine-gay-harvard-resignation-00133618)?was an orchestrated campaign to oust Harvards first Black president, Claudine Gay. At the time Gay was already under fire for her testimony at a congressional hearing about campus antisemitism when Rufo helped circulate accusations that she had plagiarized in her academic works.He has also targeted new immigrants in his advocacy work in recent months, fueling false narratives about Haitian migrants.Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institutes Center for Educational Freedom, called Rufo one of the main influencers who gives \\\\[Trump\\\\] ideas about higher ed policy.Several higher education watchers believe Rufo could be tapped by the Trump administration in an official role, while others expect him to continue influencing higher education policy from his current platform.","title":"No DEI.

One core issue the Dems have had for awhile is that they tend to speak mostly to the middle class: people who are generally comfortable but want to get ahead a little more. Think millennials who are okay-ish: they have their city apartments, they can afford their maybe-too-frequent DoorDash nights, they can buy the stuff they want, go out, etc. But they aren't quite at the point where they feel ready to start a family or buy a house. They may have a lot of student loan debt, still. A lot of Harris's policies targeted that demographic (child tax credit, first-time homebuyer credit, etc.).These policies don't really resonate with the working class. What good is homebuyer assistance if you can barely afford day-to-day expenses? Not much. Child tax credit would be good, but there are tons of working-class couples for whom the idea of having a child is simply out of the question.(They're also worthless to older generations. What good is a child tax credit if you're never gonna have kids again? \\"Well, for their kids' kids\\" is the logical response, but if there's one thing we know about the average American voter, it's that they don't really vote to better society as a whole; they vote to better their own life first and foremost.)What the working class (and the middle class, who are still working-class, as they rely on a paycheck for survival) actually want is for shit to cost less money, for them to have more money, or both. Rent is bonkers right now. Groceries are bonkers right now. Home prices are beyond bonkers right now. And yet the Dems keep talking about how *great* the economy is -- \\"The stock market's at all-time highs!\\" \\"Unemployment is historically low!\\" \\"Inflation is way down!\\" \\"We're the envy of the world!\\" -- but our metrics for national economic performance have become completely untethered from the lived reality of most citizens. So that rhetoric is extremely alienating, because, well, \\"who gives a shit how well the economy is doing if I can't fucking afford anything?\\" is a very good and valid question for which the Dems have no answer.So they listen to the Republicans' answer: \\"Well, the economy *isn't* doing well: it's trash.\\" Obviously Republicans haven't done a single thing in recent memory to improve the lives of lower-income Americans, but you have to remember that the average voter -- Democrat or Republican -- is woefully underinformed, and it's even worse these days with everyone living in a constant shitstorm of misinformation. So they hear \\"this guy validated the way I feel,\\" and that's enough for them. No further research required.The only way we'll ever get shit to cost less money -- because, as I'm sure you've noticed, nothing ever goes *down* in price organically -- is by heavily regulating capitalism. Both parties have been doing the exact opposite since Ronald Reagan more or less began his long process of destroying the United States. 40 years of \\"trickle-down economics\\" has led to a wealth gap whose magnitude is extremely difficult to articulate to the average person, who thinks that someone with three billion dollars is just a little richer than someone with three million dollars (to help clarify, I like to ask people what they'd do if they won a billion dollar Powerball, and after they list off all the stuff they'd buy or people whose debts they'd pay off, I ask, \\"Okay, so what will you do with the billion dollars you have leftover?\\").If we want to go back to the era Boomers enjoyed, where a simple, manual labor job could buy a house and support a family, we just need to go back to what we were doing back then, namely, taxing the shit out of corporations and rich people, and putting all that money back into the US economy in the form of stronger social programs and economic assistance for low-income people.So why don't the Dems push harder for that? The tl;dr is \\"money in politics.\\" Dems are beholden to all the same massive corporate donors Republicans are, because running campaigns costs an inordinate amount of money. So if you're running on a platform of \\"tax the shit out of rich people,\\" you won't be getting that money. It only almost worked for Bernie because he's somewhat of a political anomaly, where most of his donations were tiny amounts coming from huge numbers of individual donors. But the fact that it almost worked for him should be a *strong* indicator that *people like his ideas*. But the DNC doesn't: they're already stupidly talking about how to shift even further to the right to peel off more Republican voters.","title":"Donald Trump Has NOT Won a Majority of the Votes Cast for President"},{"text":"Oh man, that's the dystopia I want to see, worldwide debates and protests over which toilet the genderless asexual NHI spore-beings should use to evacuate their waste pouches.","title":"Congress erupts over GOP bill targeting new transgender member McBride"},{"text":"i mean thats literally what all those people are. if not externally, internally. remember the old family guy bit where peter dropped a penny off the empire state building and it fell on a cop who immediately cracked in half?

All the words are real things, so it sounds smart, but its all mashed together wrong or interpreted wrong. The issue with XO2 isnt the levels relative to the highest its ever been while there was life, because that life evolved in those levels, it was adapted to it. Same for temperature. The issue is the rate of change of CO2 and the rate of change of temperature that that causes. Historic variations in temperature are on the scale of gundreds of thousands of years to tens of millions of years. Life can adapt at those rate, but even then not all of it. Even with the relatively slow natural warming and cooling, there were mass extinctions. Human life and definitely human civilisation didnt exist during the warmest periods. Human farming and civilisation exist during an incredibly stable era in terms of the global climate. The rate of temperature change we are causing is unprecedented. Think of the amount of extra energy that is a planets atmosphere compared to that of a planet that is one or two degrees cooler. All that extra energy is powering the extreme weather events we have been seeing increasingly frequently over the last decade or so. And as devastating as they are, they are still a minor effect compared to global effects on crops, or displacement due to sea level rises. Or the effect a higher temperature will have on bacteria or fungi, part of the reason we can fight them off so well is that we are generally too warm for them (especially fungi), if they adapt to a world that is a few degrees warmer then that advantage is eroded. Your friend talking about needing higher co2 levels to keep the earth warm in a few million years I dont think you understand the time scale of the current warming. It isnt even hundreds of years, it is decades. Why listen to a friend or The Chinese (who are investing **heavily** in renewables by the way) when there are multiple resources from multiple different governments or independent scientific institutions all telling you the actual story about climate change, the one that is real, the one that has been around for over 100 years, and has been mainstream theory for at least 40 years.

Why? The answer lies in the very nature of modern federal criminal laws, which have exploded in number but also become impossibly broad and vague. In Three Felonies a Day, Harvey A. Silverglate reveals how federal criminal laws have become dangerously disconnected from the English common law tradition and how prosecutors can pin arguable federal crimes on any one of us, for even the most seemingly innocuous behavior. The volume of federal crimes in recent decades has increased well beyond the statute books and into the morass of the Code of Federal Regulations, handing federal prosecutors an additional trove of vague and exceedingly complex and technical prohibitions to stick on their hapless targets. The dangers spelled out in Three Felonies a Day do not apply solely to white collar criminals, state and local politicians, and professionals. No social class or profession is safe from this troubling form of social control by the executive branch, and nothing less than the integrity of our constitutional democracy hangs in the balance.However, I wouldn't read it uncritically: Silvergate's choice of examples to introduce his book does not address the quoted thesis at all (that average professionals unknowingly commit felonies), and thus one can assume the whole book fails to support his thesis.(https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/22536)Conversely: The big point is that rule of law CANNOT entail the impossibility of intelligent, decent, informed citizens who cannot stay on the right side of substantive laws. It then means prosecutors can convict anyone these choose to go after. Gives prosecutors the equivalent of bill of attainder power. Once in their focus, other felonies follow (e.g. misleading statements). Many of the people who might contribute the most to society subconsciously choose to avoid being bold and entrepreneurial, lest they attract too much attention and face possible prosecution/persecution.(https://www.econlib.org/three-felonies-a-day/)","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I mean...","title":"Walmart may have to raise some prices if Trump tariffs take effect, CFO says"},{"text":"This is a great answer!

Please allow me to provide their insight into how this constitutional right has been misinterpreted. I remember Laura Ingraham making headlines discussing it 10 years ago. Now it has come to the President actively seeking to remove a section of the Constitution by himself and a Supreme Court which he has installed 3 justices in. Their legal contention is that and subject to the jurisdiction thereof in the first section of the 14th amendment originally meant something other than the ordinary day-to-day regulations and laws applied to citizens within and outside and residents within the US. Something the article didnt mention, is that they will cite Senators such as Jacob Howard, an author of the 14th amendment, for saying during debate: [The amendment] will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons. They might also cite Senator Lyman Trumbull: The provision is, that all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens [which means] not owing allegiance to anybody else. Conservatives will argue that people who owe allegiance to another country (ie their parents home country), they should not be granted birthright citizenship for being born in the United States. They do not realize that allegiance and being subject to the jurisdiction of another country does not mean that they are exclusively loyal to that country and not to the US. The fact that citizens are globally taxed and some have to sign up for selective service is proof that they are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Their entire legal argument relies on the often contradictory legal doctrine of originalism, attempting to search and find any evidence for the intent of lawmakers that remotely supports the claim they are advancing. I wont detail the controversy surrounding this doctrine and how it has been abused to selectively apply historical facts in a biased manner. It would take too long to recount in one post, but you only need to look at the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe to see how conservatives have taken advantage of this doctrine to selectively apply history and create a country that resembles an image from when America was great. I dont need to explain the xenophobic and racist sentiment of what it implies  Republicans have explicitly said it with their rhetoric. They would like to revoke 125+ years of legal precedent that reaffirmed birthright citizenship in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. They would like to ignore the reasoning for which and subject to the jurisdiction thereof was included in the 14th amendment. As the article mentioned, it was to exclude children of ambassadors who were not subject to US law as well, and those of an enemy occupier on US soil. They would like to conveniently forget that the text of the 14th amendment is regarding All persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States. The subjects in question are the children themselves, NOT THE PARENTS. They cannot comprehend the distinction that the children are citizens jus soli. The childrens citizenship is not and should not be tied to their parents immigration status, because it is not their parents that need to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The conditional requirement is that those born in the US who are not children of ambassadors, diplomats, and enemy occupiers are given birthright citizenship because they would automatically be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States (not their parents). This effectively means that their parents legal status is irrelevant to the citizenship of the children. To respond to the question of why Senators like Howard and Trumbell stated how they interpreted the 14th amendment, it is important to highlight that the Supreme Court rightly recognized in United States v. Wong Kim Ark that the intention of Congress, which framed, and of the states which adopted, this amendment of the Constitution, must be sought in the words of the amendment, and the debates in Congress are not admissible as evidence to control the meaning of those words. Moreover, Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 before the 14th amendment was ever adopted  which stated that all persons born or naturalized in the United States were citizens of the United States with the exception of American born persons subject to any foreign power and for Indians not taxed. It is clear that Congress had the ability to create an exception to citizenship similar to the original interpretation that conservatives argue for when discussing the citizenships clause of the 14th amendment. And yet, they chose not to include such an exception, they chose not to codify words that they had passed 2 years beforehand. It is telling that conservatives want to ignore the clear text of the Constitution to advance an agenda that would make America more conservative looking. Words cannot express how frustrated I am with the countrys direction and that people actively elected a person with no respect for the rule of law or the constitution. To say Im disappointed in the results of the election would be an understatement especially given the immunity ruling given to Trump by SCOTUS. This comment will probably get lost but I had to put it out there.","title":"The law is clear on birthright citizenship.

My point is that a general society-wide acceptance of eugenics as a good thing opens up floodgates of misuse. As a perhaps imperfect metaphor, there is a very strong social/international stigma against using nuclear weapons, and I think that stigma has helped prevent nuclear weapons being used for good or ill since 1945. Studying nuclear power alone isn't enough, you need to have a social will for it to be okay. Likewise, studying genetics isn't enough to lead to government mandated eugenics programs, You first need a social acceptance of them. Even if you can argue that there are some positives to greater social acceptance of eugenics (as you understand it), I am extremely skeptical that those positives would outweigh any negatives of overstepped government power in the realm of eugenics.","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"Thats what Im saying.

And that person you're talking about is living in ignorance. It's like everyone that says they have great healthcare from their job, but what happens if their job decides there's plenty of unemployed people out there that they could get rid of the health care, lose employees, and quickly replace them? Or she gets laid off? Even with the birth control thing. Let's say she decides to get her tubes tied and never bear children and now thinks there's no worry in the world. What if the GOP decides to make that illegal? What if she gets raped? What if she just has some really horrific periods and her doctor could prescribe her the birth control pill to calm it down, but now she can't have it? This is the biggest problem with our society. In general. Everybody seems to focus only about the area around them and not about the entire society in general. I mean, imagine if me as a childless person suddenly decreed that all of us with no children should not have to pay tax money to go into schools? That we basically decide that the education system should be 100% the financial responsibility of parents? Imagine if folks like me sitting in Chicago decided to rethink everything and fight and push to get rid of all federal taxes until all of those red states they are 100% on their own? Maybe this woman lives there and suddenly finds that everything is a hot mess because there's no Blue State money coming? And imagine if they got rid of ACA, and she shows up with her insurance card, and the insurance company decides to drop her instantly, claiming it's a pre-existing condition? Or they decide they're not going to cover anything and she's wondering what happened? This is the thing that people like her don't get. The idea of government is supposed to be to serve all the people, not some of them. The GOP turned it into some and people on the right seem to think that the Democratic party is all about just serving minorities and poor people.

I wouldn't be surprised. Also if she's getting all of her news off of social media posts and not actually taking the time to really learn about what's going on. If you ask me, she just sits there hating on the US government because probably whatever she watches tells her to do that, and she 's basically decided this is the issue she can use to really hate on things. I mean, this is like all the people that voted for Trump because they claim that things were better economically during his 4 years, but they failed to really try to learn how economics works and understand that a lot of Trump's success at that time was due to everything the Obama administration did to get us out of the Great recession, and that the misery of the last 4 years is mostly due to all the things the Trump administration and the GOP did. This is why I got to the point that I just stopped caring. Then I'm at the point that I want people to start suffering so they can really understand how they keep shooting themselves in the foot.

If youre a biological man, you shouldnt be in womens restrooms.She added that the lawmaker does not belong in womens spaces, womens bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, period, full stop.Ms Mace had intended to force a vote on the resolution this week but is instead in talks with House GOP leadership about how to move forward, a source familiar with the matter told Axios.House Speaker Mike Johnson has promised Ms Mace that he will prohibit biological?men from entering female-only spaces in the Capitol next year by adding a provision to the House Rules, PunchBowl reported.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/19/nancy-maces-trans-congresswoman-sarah-mcbride/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/19/nancy-maces-trans-congresswoman-sarah-mcbride/)","title":"Republicans move to ban first trans congresswoman from using female bathrooms"},{"text":"Telling how Trump never specified whether the Haitian immigrants he was demonizing were illegal or legalIts almost like its not just the illegal immigrants he wants to go after","title":"Trumps Deportation Threat Puts Haitians in Springfield on Edge"},{"text":"When did I specify who would be making the decision about desirable or undesirable?

Even if no ones forced into it, people will still feel pressured by society, cultural norms, or implicit biases. Look at how prenatal testing already pushes some parents to feel like they should avoid having a child with certain traits. Thats not freedom; its subtle coercion.And comparing it to inbreeding or picking a healthy partner doesnt work. Avoiding inbreeding isnt about improving the gene poolits about reducing immediate genetic risks. Choosing a partner because youre attracted to them or want healthy kids isnt the same as a structured system telling people who should and shouldnt have kids. One is personal choice, the other is control.The escape ark example might seem logical, but its not the same as normal life. Survival situations like that arent comparable to a world where resources and ethics are way more complicated. Eugenics doesnt exist in a vacuumit always creates hierarchies of worth, whether its enforced directly or through societal pressure.Its not just that people did eugenics wrong in the pastits that the entire idea assumes some lives are more valuable than others.

You can construe anyone you like as having \\"committed a crime\\" especially if you hold their presence within your border to be a crime. IMO this new notion that \\"what he meant was...\\" the worst of the worst only, it sort of exists to make a lot of things...spongy in the mind and relieve tension over the obvious impracticality of trump's campaign rhetoric and promises.it has a couple main rhetorical functions:1. is to continue begging the question that there's a significant plurality of people in the opposite camp, that there's someone on team \\"don't deport violent criminals\\" - there are a few, a very few, anti-deportation absolutists in the far left but they have NO political voice. the democrats, the biden admin, the obama admin, etc - very deportative and always have been.\\n2. is to claim work in progress, a trump tradition. Saying \\"we're just going to deport people with violent criminal convictions and active deportation orders\\" is really just saying \\"we're going to keep doing exactly what biden did the whole time he was in office, but we're going to take the credit we denied him for it.\\"\\n3. is to move the overton window on deportation and \\"what trump meant\\" even further. understand that the right has, in my lifetime and beyond, never once, for a single day, relented on immigration rhetoric, no matter what the actual state of the policy or conditions at the border were. When they're in charge, they're doing all they can but need the opposition to stop holding them back. when the opposition is in charge, they will absolutely SHRIEK the libel that the border is \\"open\\" - to the point they literally interview people at the border who say \\"I heard on fox news it is open\\" and are doing the shocked pikachu when they get here and it isn't.It's pure passive aggression and darvo.

The fact that the original eugenicists were also racists means that they are bad, not that the idea is bad. Lets selectively breed for health and diversity instead of racism, and use eugenics for good. But if I go somewhere and say, \\"I think we should discourage people from reproducing if they are unhealthy, unfit, or more likely to have deficiencies\\" then everyone accuses me of espousing eugenics. So if eugenics is based in racism, I'm not arguing for eugenics and I'm only arguing for selectively breeding healthier people. If eugenics is the practice of selectively breeding for healthier people, then I would say that early eugenicists did it wrong. Asthma is a good example. Most people would be fine having children with asthma because inhalers are pretty common in the modern world. But on a space station, or in a third-world country, that might not be the case. The health impact of a genetic predisposition is based on a lot of factors that require extreme expertise to weight the pros and cons of, and my argument is only for the underlying principle. Yes, dogs are a good example of how selective breeding can be used to hurt or harm. It might have helped to give dogs deformities in exchange for making them more suited to a task, but it's also helped to breed those traits out of them since most dogs don't need to do those tasks anymore. And the benefits of genetic variation also come with the risk of more genes capable of causing unwanted mutations. I'm not a geneticist, but it seems like a small loss in variation for a large loss in unwanted mutations is a good trade off. If reducing variation means we're less likely to have genetic problems, then that's a good thing. If reducing variation means we're more likely to have genetic problems, then that's a bad thing.  I'm not an expert, so I couldn't expound on it more than that. but you're asking for a tremendous sacrifice from a lot of people who will in no way benefit from \\"the human race\\" improving.Fair point. And, yeah... I think a lot of people ought to make sacrifices for the good of future generations. We ought to recycle, even though it's more expensive and time consuming that throwing stuff in the trash. We out to reduce pollution, even though it makes stuff more expensive right now. And I think we ought to have less kids, if those kids are likely to pass on harmful traits. If they want a kid so bad, they can adopt one. There's no reason that selecting terraformers based on their genetics is inevitable, or even desirable -- you don't actually know what \\"good genes for Mars\\" are.  \\nIt makes a hell of a lot more sense to pick terraformers based on their skills and credentials, since those are things you can directly observe and use.  \\nUnless you are going to selectively breed your Martians for features you want, it isn't eugenics. If \\"picking people whose genes make them suited for a task to do that task,\\" is eugenics, then every time you pick a sports team, you're practicing eugenics.In the hypothetical where we're even considering terraforming mars, then presumable the science nerds would have some idea of which traits are more ideal for mars.   \\nSkills and credentials can be taught, and otherwise expire in one generation. Genes provide a benefit for future generations, who could still learn the skills and credentials needed. Presumably, the idea candidates would be taught the necessary skills, rather than people with the necessary skills going through genetic screening. But again, this is all just hypothetical.   \\nI think eugenics has definitely played a role in sports and athleticism. Black people were (immorally) selectively bred to be physical laborers, and as a result have a higher than average disposition toward athleticism. Let me confirm: it seems like your opinion has shifted from, \\"There's nothing wrong with eugenics,\\" to a different one: \\"In the context of a voluntary mission to terraform Mars where everyone agrees to the construct in advance, there'd be nothing wrong with considering the genetic diversity and health of the people selected to go on that mission.\\"Terraforming mars is an example for the merits of eugenics, just as dog breeding and nazis are examples of its misuse.  My opinion has remained, \\"Eugenics (the study of attempting to improve a population's genetics) is a good thing, but a lot of people have gone about enacting it in a wrong way (ie. by culling people they deem unworthy).\\"No one in this society is allowed to exceed 65 years old, because you'll take up increasing resources for decreasing yield.If resources were scarce, as they would be on mars, then yeah. Even when they're not scarce, I think that people whose quality of life has begun to suffer as a result of old age should be allowed and encouraged to get their affairs in order and pass on with dignity. I don't understand the merit in putting people in old-age homes where they continue to live in boredom, cut off from their loved ones.","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"Just like Kavanaughs sham background check?","title":"GOP senators deride idea of replacing FBI background checks for Trump nominees"},{"text":"No, he's not.

I have unlimited Botanical C02 at my job from a government source and I can \\"barrow\\" as much as I want and I use it to go grow in my greenhouse and in my tent to grow my weed. Under 2,000 ppm my tomatoes grow like trees and become very disease resistant and I can feed them twice as many nutrients and they gobble the CO2 up like starving babies. The weed boosts even more dramatically.My friend is a geologist and he says that the earth has been dying since the dinosaurs went extinct and that we lost a bunch of our atmosphere and oxygen levels and CO2 levels used to be a lot higher.... He said that all scientists pretty much universally agree that the earth is moving towards a permanent ice age, that CO2 ppm was 280 pre industrial times and that it's the lowest the earth has ever been since there was life and that if it fell below 200 ppm most the plant life would die and we would all probably die. He said we are in the Halocene epoch of the Quaternary period and that we are having a little warming period that will last another 40,000 years and that all the ice is projected to melt and it's going to be warm and tropical everywhere for awhile until the Halocene ends and then we will go back into another ice age for a long time. He says that the idea that the CO2 levels going from 280 ppm to 480 ppm is having some kind of meaningful effect on the climate is preposterous and that 480 is still really really low and that we've average 2,000-3,000 most the time that there's been life in earth and that the CO2 isn't really an issue but that low oxygen levels are a problem.... Like if the CO2 goes up and oxygen stays low, that's a problem, and we need to figure out a way to increase the oxygen. He says that we are probably going to need to purposefully release C02 into the atmosphere too far in the future to prevent the next ice age or to make it more mild but we don't have the technology for that yet, to do it safely and the right way..I didn't believe him and we argued and he said it was all common knowledge and to start looking some of this stuff up and reading about it and then he showed me that the Chinese are pro C02 and have a bunch of pro CO2 propaganda and that there's some disagreement about some details but that there's a pretty robust scientific consensus that we will need much high C02 levels and oxygen levels in the future to keep Earth habitable and warm over the next couple million years.... And that the biggest threat to human life is probably Earth losing it's atmosphere like Mars did and global cooling and that it would take so much energy to heat the earth, that it's not really possible but it would be pretty easy to figure out a way to vent heart l heat into space.And that this isn't some weird niche theory and that pretty much everybody agrees about this stuff.I'm not really sure how I feel about climate change after learning about all of this stuff.....

We see our bodies undergo puberty and change into something that only reinforces the way the rest of society treats us.  We remember the myriad ways throughout our lives that gender is taught and reinforced, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.Misgendering hurts not just because someone is seeing and treating us as the wrong gender right now, but because it links into a larger pattern of struggle and abuse in our lives.And even if somehow it were possible to fully replicate that experience for a cis person, the message you send to the trans community is that you agree with the right-wing bigots who tell us that we're not *truly* the gender we say we are, and that having our gender recognized is a privilege that can be revoked the moment we step out of line.

It applies to people who do not enter with proper inspection at a port of entry, such as those who enter between ports of entry, avoid examination or inspection, or who make false statements while entering or attempting to enter. A first offense is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, up to six months in prison, or both.  Illegal Re-Entry/8 U.S.C.  1326 makes it a crime to *unlawfully reenter*, attempt to unlawfully reenter, or to be found in the United States after having been deported, ordered removed, or denied admission. This crime is punishable as a felony with a maximum sentence of two years in prison. Higher penalties apply if the person was previously removed after having been convicted of certain crimes: up to 10 years for a single felony conviction (other than an aggravated felony conviction) or three misdemeanor convictions involving drugs or crimes against a person, and up to 20 years for an aggravated felony conviction.Thus, if one's entry or reentry was lawful, neither of these two statues are applicable.","title":"ACLU files lawsuit to gain information about Trump mass deportation plans"},{"text":"Oh, so it was delayed again?

This strategy, meticulously documented, has often gone unrecognized in its full scope. Trump has unwittingly served as a conduit for Putin's objectives, advancing along a path strategically crafted by the Russian leader.The U.S. intelligence community has consistently reported on Russia's interference in American elections, notably in 2016 and 2020, aiming to sow discord and erode trust in democratic processes. These efforts have included cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and the exploitation of social media to influence public opinion. Despite these findings, the comprehensive impact of Putin's actions on U.S. institutions remains underappreciated.Trump's public admiration for Putin and his reluctance to confront Russian aggression have raised concerns about his susceptibility to manipulation. His actions, whether intentional or not, have often aligned with Russian interests, leading to questions about his role in facilitating Putin's agenda.Recognizing and addressing the extent of this influence is crucial for safeguarding the integrity of American institutions and preserving the nation's democratic values.Sources:[Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Intelligence_Committee_report_on_Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election)[Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections)[Trump and Putin's Avowed Personal Rapport Masks Deeper Tensions](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/trump-putin-russia-changes-second-term-e2c481af)[Trump and Putin have talked as many as 7 times since 2021, new book claims](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/trump-putin-have-talked-as-many-as-7-times-since-2021-new-book-claims/3568199/)[Trump told Putin not to escalate war in Ukraine days after the election](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine-war-election-b2644734.html)","title":"Putin Sees America Hurtling to Disaster, With Trump at the Wheel"},{"text":"No no no, were eating the cats and dogs, remember?

Employers are taking advantage of that opportunity to work with the Haitian community, and now this is going to turn it completely on its head.Local officials, business owners, migrants and advocates are on edge as they try to figure out whats in store after Trump takes office Jan. 20.Springfield drew international attention and bomb threats that closed down city schools and offices during the presidential campaign after Trump and running mate?JD Vance?falsely said that Haitian migrants there were eating pets. The politicians were amplifying claims made on social media amid a backlash against the new arrivals in the wake of a?traffic accident?involving an unlicensed Haitian driver that killed a young boy.Social services and the local health care system in a county of about 135,000 people have struggled to cope with the influx of an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Haitian migrants during the past three years, drawn by the low cost of living and plentiful job opportunities.Republican Ohio Governor?Mike DeWine?has said most of the newcomers are there legally under the federal Temporary Protected Status program after fleeing violence and poverty in their home country.

The question is who is the owner? It is factually true that a private owner is not necessary...the owner can be the public or a collective ownership (such as by the workers) and indeed there are plenty of examples of this happening all around the world. This is generally what socialists/leftists advocate for.  \\nAs I understand it, critics of private property, notably those who are economically left, propose that there are two fundamental issues with the concept of private propertyThere are other criticisms of property, particularly land/resources but also factories etc. 3). The observation that land and natural resources (like fresh water, minerals, and oil) is acquired and protected collectively...this territory is acquired and controlled by the state, and it's use and protection is only possible thanks to collective resources like armed forces, police, sewage, public health, etc. So why is land privatized? It's not clear to me why private owners are entitled to buy and own property and natural resources perpetually.4.) Following up on this, private land ownership in some ways contradicts the concept of a merit-based society. When valuable scarce resources like land and minerals can be consolidated and inherited, it inevitably leads to a society where few individuals can amass ownership of many resources. Land and resources are distributed by a first come first serve situation which is inherently unequal and anti-competitive. People's lives are temporary, but corporations and family dynasties can last generations which create additional barriers to free competition... it is much harder for a new person or business to compete with an established corporation that already owns so much property. Private land ownership is a pretty arbitrary concept. I believe there are better ways to distribute and use land, such as 99 year leases or Georgism. Yes people should still own the work of their labor and be incentivized to produce...but I don't think perpetual private ownership over scarce resources is a good or necessary way to do that.","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"I hope so!","title":"\\"Unknown and unauthorized third party\\" has gained access to Matt Gaetz depositions, source says"},{"text":"They might want to start reading the Constitution.

In the supreme Court case that legalized eugenics, for instance, Buck v Bell, they used some pretty shoddy logic for the idea that the malady of the woman they wanted to sterilize was actually genetic, then argued that \\"the principle that justifies forced vaccination (i.e. The good of the people as a whole) is sufficient to justify the cutting of the Fallopian tubes (i.e. eugenics)\\"This is literally an example where one person's Rights and interests as an individual (having children) is said to be less important than society's well-being overall. You may disagree that this is the kind of eugenics that you want, but I don't think it's possible to avoid governments wanting to use the principles /ideals of eugenics to force/enforce their own ideas of what an ideal populace should be. I think it's entirely beside the point of this conversation. If I say we need to do something that promotes a good quality of life, we can agree or disagree on that whether or not we have a complete definition for what things would or wouldn't contribute to quality of life.I think whether it's just vague individualist choices about trying to have the best spouse and kids, or whether it's government action, encouraging specific pairings or encouraging abortion of some babies, I think it's best to have a specific idea of what is right and wrong that you can judge decisions against, instead of a vague idea that still needs to be argued out. Viability seems pretty concrete to me. You're clearly able to measure if a baby has made it to term or not, and whether they have any diseases/issues that will negatively impact their reproductive viability is relatively easy to figure out. But quality of life just seems like you're opening yourself up to many other things. People with far left political beliefs tend to be less happy on average, and political belief is at least slightly genetic, so should you abort babies with a genetic predisposition to the left? That seems like it's got a lot of issues. Additionally, in some areas skin darkness is associated with bullying, so wouldn't it make your kids' lives better if you aborted any kids that had skin that was too dark?I think quality of life is way too mushy a metric for me to be willing to say it can even have good outcomes (let alone the other moral issues with eugenics)","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"Now now, it also took 60million people willing to tear everything down least some poor person receives support from society.","title":"Trumps Nov. 26 Hush Money Sentencing Called Off, Court Says"},{"text":"They can sure as hell try, and whether or not they're successful depends on how much effort the rest of us put into resisting them.","title":"Could Trump and his billionaire buddies turn America into an oligarchy?"},{"text":"Anyone who fell for this shit thinking he represented regular people is a fucking idiot.

The point is that providing people with information about their genetics is *not* eugenics; you are not \\"selectively breeding\\" and neither are they. You haven't found them a \\"perfect genetic match\\", you've just given them a view of their risk factor for passing on specific genetically-determined illnesses. I can understand your perspective, but defining \\"eugenics\\" as \\"providing people insight into their genetics\\" is a bit too big of a goalpost-shift; [that isn't what the word means.](https://www.britannica.com/science/eugenics-genetics)I don't see the problem with selective breeding for the effort of increasing healthBecause if someone has fallen in love (and wants to have children) with someone who has a genetic predisposition to asthma, you're quite unlikely to get them to voluntarily agree that they'll forgo having children with their wife because there's a chance their children will have asthma. They like their wife and are glad she exists, despite the fact that she occasionally uses an inhaler -- while it might be lovely for the human race to breed out asthma, it is not lovely *for the actual humans that make up the race.*Most people know that mutts are healthier than purebreds, so selectively breeding dogs of different breeds is healthier than selectively breeding dogs of the same breed.Hopefully you recognize that mutts also do not have the traits that the breeds *were bred for.* The pug has breathing problems in exchange for a recessed nose that lets it bite a bear and not let go to breath; a whippet has hip problems because of its long legs, which allow it to run very very fast... etc. These are things we selectively bred *for*. They're the type of \\"best traits\\" that eugenics, in principle, is supposed to provide.By \\"breeding out\\" something like asthma, you will, by necessity, be *reducing* genetic variation.\\"The human race\\" and \\"the humans that make up the human race\\" are effectively synonymous, and thus of equal meritNonsense. \\"The human race\\" is an abstract concept; you are suggesting that many people should not have children with the people they love (or in fact, have children with people they have no interest in raising a family with), so that the average human of the future will be healthier, stronger, smarter, and so on. Neat -- but you're asking for a tremendous sacrifice from a lot of people *who will in no way benefit* from \\"the human race\\" improving.If we're going to terraform Mars and populate it with &lt;1% of earth's population, then most people aren't going to be represented in the new societyAnd if you are selecting people 1% of people to go terraform Mars, then you'll certainly need selection criteria for doing so. However:* There's no reason that selecting terraformers based on their genetics is inevitable, or even desirable -- you don't actually *know* what \\"good genes for Mars\\" *are*.\\n* It makes a hell of a lot more sense to pick terraformers based on their skills and credentials, since those are things you can directly observe and *use*.\\n* Unless you are going to selectively breed your Martians for features you want, it isn't eugenics. If \\"picking people whose genes make them suited for a task to do that task,\\" is eugenics, then every time you pick a sports team, you're practicing eugenics.When I'm talking about selecting for healthy genes, I mean those with less chance to require valuable resources to construct artificial assistance. A repopulation ark wouldn't have an abundance of resources to use in making sure all members of its society can participate equally.Let me confirm: it seems like your opinion has shifted from, \\"There's nothing wrong with eugenics,\\" to a different one: \\"In the context of a voluntary mission to terraform Mars where everyone agrees to the construct in advance, there'd be nothing wrong with considering the genetic diversity and health of the people selected to go on that mission.\\"Is that fair?so selecting for people that are less likely to need assistance like that is preferable.?That's certainly a reasonable utilitarian argument, but I should note that people are much more likely to need wheelchairs due to old age than due to their genetics; sure, we can make sure that nobody with a gene coding for muscular dystrophy is allowed to breed (or maybe just ... terminate pregnancies that actually express those genes) ... but extending your argument, it'd be perfectly reasonable to say, \\"No one in this society is allowed to exceed 65 years old, because you'll take up increasing resources for decreasing yield.\\"","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"Im assuming youre unaware that domestic oil production rose to a record high under Biden?","title":"Trump's election triggered a large sell-off that pushed oil prices down by more than $2 per barrel during trading as the U.S. dollar rallied, at its highest level since September 2022."},{"text":"You assumed I implied that because youre a fucking moron","title":"He Is Coming for Us: Springfields Haitians Are Terrified After Trumps Win"},{"text":"Wonder how it will play out if democratic states says fuck you to federal troops and bring out their state troops.","title":"He Is Coming for Us: Springfields Haitians Are Terrified After Trumps Win"},{"text":"I'd rather Joe Biden didn't make commuting Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's sentence part of his encore.","title":"What Donald Trumps election could mean for the federal death penalty"},{"text":"Trans people have always existed and always will.

If you have a gene that may lead to early Alzheimer's, but prevents depression, how should you handle that?Hard to know. People would need to weigh the pros and cons, the chances of each result, etc. Yes, quality of life is a vague term, but it expresses an underlying idea that I'm pretty sure we all understand. We can go bit by bit on all the possible things that might give a life better or worse quality, but I think it's entirely beside the point of this conversation. If I say we need to do something that promotes a good quality of life, we can agree or disagree on that whether or not we have a complete definition for what things would or wouldn't contribute to quality of life.","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"That doesn't sound at all legal though.","title":"Biden should order background checks of Trumps Cabinet picks"},{"text":"no, what's disgusting and racist is assuming all immigrants are illegal.
