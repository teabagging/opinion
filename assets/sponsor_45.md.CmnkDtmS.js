Which is part of why it's so hard. I'll give some concrete examples:?\\n?* Take environmental review of building projects. Started because, well, we built a lot of shit without much care to how it impacted the environment. Traditionally not favored by conservatives.?\\n?But now, you have people- who consider themselves staunchly liberals or staunchly on the left- who feel that in some ways enviromental review is holding us back from building clean energy projects or implementing congestion taxes (there was, in fact, an environmental review done of New York City's plan to implement a congestion tax) and see it's stringenst requirements as a hindrance *too* the enviroment.\\n?Of course, others would say, \\"Your crazy to think that weakening environmental protections would help the enviroment\\" And then there would be a rejoinder and so on. Point is, among the people who are pushing for change are people who want a version of it that they would believe specifically helps the enviroment as a whole. And they are opposed by those who also view themselves as protectors of the enviroment.\\n?*Take nuclear power- getting it hard to build in the US was a major environmental victory in the 1970s. Now, to some, it looks like a defeat, because nuclear power has a lower carbon footprint.?\\n?Once again, we got two groups who both see themselves as enviromental champions, and while I know which one I favor, I'm sure I could find some people who are quite commited to the enviroment who disagree.?\\n?The point is, there are in fact times when those for change are not clearly in the right. And, more generally, there are such a thing as times when two good people will disagree on the right path forward. And that's why they're will always be politics, and probably why politics will always be maddening.\\nEdit: NYC was trying to get a congestion tax to lower traffic (and thus, presumably, emissions) not a more general tax on the generation of carbon itself","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":" \\"Why haven't they stolen the election already?\\" A somber question depicts a Trump tired of politicking","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Is she trying to piss off every voter demographic one by one, the Blacks, Veterans, Border Payroll, Law Enforcement Agencies, now Christians","title":"Cant mention God to democrats now"},{"text":"Going from a Bernie supporter in 2016 to a Trump supporter in 2024?

Suddenly trump doesnt bring in what he used to and they flip the script and pivot away. Someone sees the writing on the wall for once and see that he aint it anymore.

Also, In most companies directors arent even considered company leadership, that term usually means c suite or VP.But yeah these costs are going to be highly variable. For example, at my company, we had 15 in-office employees with a payroll of about $2M, and our office cost $60k a year. If we went wfh under your model, we could have hired another employee or two depending on role for the same budget. It could be worth it if you hire good people, but in my experience, about 10-25% of people who are transitioned to wfh from in office basically just stop doing useful work at all, so then you have to fire them and hire someone else, and hiring is very expensive in terms of money, but also momentum for small-medium sized companies.","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"Looking at that map perhaps the red states should vote for Kamala or stay on a shitty minimum wage.

So when the 2000 census happened they used it to push through gerrymandering while they controlled the state legislatures. The three key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania all fell under that. Republicans used the gerrymandering to maintain control of state legislatures.That meant they could prevent pretty much any legislation from passing they did not want.Pennsylvania and Wisconsin both are at $7.25. The federal minimum because of legislation blocked by Republicans. Michigan has gotten to slightly over $10, although I think that was thanks to citizen petitions for ballot amendments, which in some of the other states have been blocked by conservative majority Supreme Courts (which has now begun to change).BTW. Pennsylvania Democrats gained back control of the state house, and Republicans maintained a slight majority in the state senate. The Republicans refused to vote on something like 15 different bills to raise the minimum wage that has been put before them over the last 2 years.Michigan has regained a Democratic control of their state legislature after maps were redrawn to be more balanced.

Probably you're right, and progressives should vote for Harris in swing states. But being right doesn't change a thing. Many millions of words are written on this topic every election season, and not one of them changes the basic simple rule of politics: if you piss off a group of people, fewer of them will vote for you; if you make them happy, more will vote for you. The Democratic Party has made a strategic calculation in the past three presidential elections that moderating and drawing in reluctant right-wing voters will get them better results than catering to their base. I think, based on results in 2016 and 2020 and polling since Harris has taken a sharp turn to the center, it's probably a pretty stupid calculation. That remains to be seen.But at the end of the day, they know what they're doing and they know it'll affect turnout on the left. They know they're torpedoing the Muslim vote in Michigan and they think whatever they'll get in return will make up for it. All the rhetoric about strategic lesser evil voting and whatnot will not change any of that. But, it will give them someone to blame if they lose.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"When 48 is considered young....","title":"Elissa Slotkin for U.S. Senate (Michigan)"},{"text":"My absentee ballot still hasn't come :(","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Coming in with a late post, but we finished writing 200 postcards to a swing House district today, will mail them out Saturday.

In unregulated capitalism, and indeed as you say, anarcho-capitalism, Walmart and the other too big to fail would never have gotten to the point of corporatism: Corporatism is a political system of interest representation and policymaking whereby corporate groups, such as agricultural, labour, military, business, scientific, or guild associations, come together on and negotiate contracts or policy (collective bargaining) on the basis of their common interests.This is NOT unregulated capitalism. And the solution is not to use the same government that is already SETUP to give undue advantages to special interests and lobbies and corporations to attempt to put handcuffs on the hands that feed the policymakers. That will never work without something akin to a revolution.On the socialism front I always oppose robbing Peter to pay Paul but its especially egregious to rob Peter to pay Paul when youre already robbing Peter to pay WALMART (and the military industrial complex). Walmart doesnt just come in and undercut prices and put mom and pop out of business because they are larger  they CAN do that because even the local politicians give them zoning breaks and property tax and liability breaks (that they dont give to mom and pop) so that they can be the ones that brought the 1000 Walmart jobs to town.

Employee salaries may be 50%+ of the total operating budget whereas an office may only be 5-10%. If you think you can increase productivity by 20% by bringing people into the office, its an easy decision to make.The other aspect of this is that increased productivity has compounding effects on revenue by way of increased speed. Every team in every company has deadlines theyre trying to hit, and the faster they hit those, the more the company can grow. In a vacuum, you may not spend any more money by having wfh and reducing salaries by 10%, but even if the budget is the same, youre sacrificing potential growth, which is what all companies want.","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"Its never occurred so no process exists for such a turn of events.

The selected projects announced today through the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program will deploy new, innovative transmission and distribution infrastructure and technology upgrades to enable over 7.5 gigawatts (GW) of grid capacity, speed up interconnection for new clean energy projects, support nearly 6,000 good-paying jobs, and catalyze over $4.2 billion in total public and private investment to bring reliable, affordable, clean energy to Americans. These projects, which span 42 states and the District of Columbia, include the six projects across the Southeast that President Biden announced during his trip to Florida last week. Those six selected projects included utilities that were impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The selected projects announced today will upgrade more than 950 miles of transmission by constructing more than 300 miles of new transmission lines and reconductoring or adding grid-enhancing technologies to more than 650 miles of transmission lines to increase the capacity of existing lines.  \\n...  \\nFunded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the GRIP program is investing $10.5 billion in communities across the country to enhance grid flexibility and improve the resilience of the power system against growing threats of extreme weather and climate change. The first round of GRIP funding, announced in October 2023, included $3.5 billion for 58 projects in 44 states. In August 2024, DOE announced an additional $2.2 billion for eight additional selections. With todays selections, GDO has now announced a cumulative $7.6 billion in Federal funding for 104 projects through the GRIP program. In total, GRIP projects are expected to enable 55 GW of grid capacity, equivalent to powering more than 40 million homes each year. The GRIP projects announced in October 2023 and August 2024 will upgrade an additional 1,650 miles of transmission. This funding supports the Biden-Harris Administrations Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments in climate, clean energy, and other areas flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution*Improving Reliability and Resilience in the Face of Extreme Weather*In this round of funding, DOE received applications requesting more than seven times the amount of funding available, an oversubscription rate of nearly 800%, demonstrating the tremendous need for these types of investments across the country. Improving grid resilience in the face of extreme weather events was a key need nationwide.*Adding More Energy to the Grid Faster While Generating Economic Development and Union Jobs*The projects announced today will increase grid capacity, allow more renewable energy to reach customers across the country, and increase the speed of the interconnection process. Over $150 million will be invested in communities through workforce development, scholarships and apprentice programs, and community organization grants through these projects and more than 80% of the projects will work with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).*Investing in Innovative Technologies and Achieving Grid Liftoff*DOEs Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Innovative Grid Deployment report identified multiple advanced grid solutions that are commercially available today to quickly and cost effectively enhance grid capacity, including advanced transmission and grid-enhancing technologies used in many of these projects.Example list of recipients and scope of projects is in the press release with link to complete list at the end. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:The devastating and deadly Hurricanes, Helene and Milton, have put on stark display how extreme weather events continue to stress the nations aging electric systems C but across the country, the Biden-Harris Administration is using every tool in the toolbox to make sure Americas power grid is hardened in the face of this challenge, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. The Administrations Investing in America agenda has provided the largest grid investment in U.S. history helping us add more energy to the grid faster, improve reliability and resilience, and invest in innovative technologies so customers across the country can have access to more renewable energy and pay less for their electricity.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Additional $2 Billion to Protect the Grid Against Growing Threats of Extreme Weather, Expand Transmission"},{"text":"I can't believe we now have real, undoctored video of Obama saying \\"Mom's spaghetti\\", this has become a blessed timeline","title":"Obama jokes his \\"palms are sweaty\\" after Eminem introduction at Detroit rally"},{"text":"He is RIGHT !

Theree nothing wrong with having Palestine as your singular key issue. Its incredibly importent to me.With that said, there are a lot of issues that end up having real consequences, often leading to unjustified, avoidable death and misery.When you have a whole array of issues, its important to tale a nuanced perspective so that pressure can be applied towards saving the most amount of lives and reducing the most amount of misery. When one sacrifices all other issues for the sake of their primary issue , it's not just immoral, irresponsible and negligent, its an inherently extremist perspective.Now, as for Harris, I don't like her. I'm my opinion, she's both a class traitor and a traitor to people of color. On the other hand, Trump is explicitly racist sexist, homophobic, transphobic and ableist to name a few. Hes intentionally negligent and evil. He tasks action or inaction specifically because it will either harm others or because there is no personal gain for himself. Hes perfectl content to let thousands die because it's not particularly helpful for him to take positve action.Heres an example. In Palestine, at least 40k people have been killed by the IDF and settlers. During covid, various research groups came to same conclusion, which is that over 1 million people died in the US and as much as 40% of deaths, or 188k people, died needlessly. This happened because not only did Trump fuel lies and misinformation, he also actively blocked of otherwise sabotaged efforts to get aid where it needed to be.His covid response was not a poor response, it wss non responses while actively seeking tp create harm in typically blue cities hoping that his political enemies would be blamed for the failure. I don't care how inexperienced a person is or how uneducated or whatever else, if Trump had beem replaced on covid issues by a person, any person whose singular qualification was that they wanted to reduce harm. It could have been a 10 year old child. All that person had to do was take the pandemic plan provided by the Obama administration and tell white house staff to get parts of the plan to the correect people and not only would that had saved the 188k needless deaths. It would have also significantly reduced the total number of covid related deaths from over a million to muchWhat I'm saying is this, Palestine is and should remain a primary issue. However, one must takes nuanced perspective that's going to lower the most amount of harm and death. Covid was just one issie. What about the thousands of kids that will never be returned to their family because the Trump administration didn't keep proper records to kmow what kids go with which families. Thousands of families had one or more children stolen from them, never to return home.If Trump is president again, he will align the US witb Russia and pressured the Ukrainians into surrender. He will load Isreal up with more weapons than they can use and will openly applaud the genocide against Palestinians because hes racist against people of color, including against people of color that vote for him. He hates Muslims and i promise he will laugh at what happens to Palestinians. He will call them all terrorists.And that's not even including the dozens of other issues that could save lives or reduce harm, simply by not having a sadistic racist at the helm.Kamala is the lesser of two evils, but this is not a lesser of two evils argument. She is analytically and objectively the best choice for reducing harm and death.One must weigh all views but even if one does not, even if one sacrifices all other issues and the harm, misery and death that come with them. Even only considering just Palestine, she's the only real choice. Her or Trump will be Potus and he will be a nightmare.Lastly, There is no \\"better person\\" when one of them is funding a genocide, whether it's putin or kamalaYour're placing too much responsibility at her feet here. This is not an opinion, it's a fact but I can't explain it now, apologies. I explain how this wrong later today.

I guess with the attack on North Africa by Italy in June of 1940, one could argue that a World War had been created.  With the UK being one of the only real Allies left.The US was marginally involved with European theater (mostly just a supplier of goods and weapons) up until Dec 7th, 1941.  With the attack at Pearl Harbor came the joint declaration of war on Japan and Germany and Italy making it a global World War conflict.  The Tripartite pact cemented Germany, Italy and Japan together in late September 1940 making their alliance global, but the US only responded by creating an oil embargo.  At least thats my point of view.

This isnt just Hollywood or politicians, although theres plenty of that. Its religion, its close knit families. They allow secrets to be out in the open because it all feels normal.

Any model you hold of the world needs to align with the good, the bad and the ugly of humanity for it to be an even remotely accurate model of whats happening. Which is why I know for a fact that there isnt one group at the top, there are broadly two competing groups. Groups splinter and reforge. Thats as true as the sky is blue and it is a deeply engrained part of human society. They dont want the same things. Theyre mortal enemies in all planes of existence. We couldnt begin to fathom the true breadth of the dispute. I get that it feels like it all makes sense when one group sits at the top directing everything, but, go outside. Observe people. Be kind to them. Observe them be kind to each other. Observe when they get frustrated. Experience their lives as a bystander. Join a group and learn about the conflicts within it. Join a more exclusive group and learn how skeletons are hidden in plain sight and no one thinks twice because theyre all part of the in group.Best outcome of this is that you learn how to actually change the world: kindness and love. Help others become a nexus of good. Second best is you develop your empathy and learn all the good, bad and ugly things humans are capable of.

It's stealing a bit from the libertarians maybe, but it's not really moving to the right.  It's still the same belief.On abortion, no, Harris isn't as far right as can be. On immigration, this is less true, and it's certainly true that she's essentially adopted 2000s-era neoconservatism for her hawkish stances on Iran.I have more to say on immigration below.  I mean sure, maybe they would the first time it happened. Which is why you have to vote in every single election, because after that first and second time, it's less falling in line and more becoming a core part of the party. Why on Earth would the \\"taking the left vote for granted\\" ever stop happening? Election after election, liberals bitch and moan about the left more or less singlehandedly deciding the election whenever Democrats try to veer right and lose. It sounds like this voting group *is* a powerful constituency that can decide the fate of the party. It sounds like this group already has power, which makes it baffling at best and inexcusable at worst that Democrats don't court this demographic by offering policy concessions.  There's also the matter of voting for downballot races, especially progressive candidates.  If those start winning more consistently, then the message gets even louder and you start to have some actual say. I will agree with you on this. Progressives should vote for progressive candidates even if the Democratic Party doesn't recognize their value. (Progressives should also vote for shitty centrist candidates too.)  Really? It doesn't have to be adopting right wing values to say that there was a bill that a whole bunch of people agreed to would ease some of the issues we have with the border, and it's undeniable that there are actual issues. You, Harris, Republicans, and I all agree that \\"there are issues\\" at the border. We do not agree on what those issues are. Republicans, and seemingly Democrsts as well, think that the solutions involve increased funding, discretion, and power for Border Patrol. I think the solution is the exact opposite and involves empowering altogether different institutions. I understand well that Democrats were playing a game of (shitty, stupid) Chicken with Republicans: if the Republicans flinch, then Democrats get to call Republicans hypocrites, which *no one on Earth cares about*. There is no one in the country that wanted a \\"tough\\" border bill who is going to be persuaded by Republicans \\"being hypocrites\\". If Republicans don't flinch, then the Democrats give Republicans a policy win. There's no way to interpret this array of facts that avoids the conclusion that Democrats are comfortable gambling with migrants' well-being by risking that Republicans will get a border bill that they want.  She has said many times that she wants an easier process to come into the country and become a citizen.This is good. It would be much better uncoupled from the myopic fixation on \\"eNfOrCiNg tHe bOrDeR.\\"  She is also using it as a contrast to her opponent -  she is willing to work with both sides and be a President to everyone in finding solutions to problems, while Donold wants to run on those problems.The problem with this approach is that \\"working with both sides\\" isn't good. It's not good to do bipartisanship with evil and to give more money to militarized tacticool thugs to brutalize impoverished brown people seeking a better life. The \\"solutions to the problems\\" that bipartisanship yields aren't, in my view, solutions. Even if I agreed that this was be an effective way to win elections, which I don't (see \\"Who is this for?\\"), it's hardly a refutation of Democrats' rightward drift: bipartisanship with a radicalizing Reoublican Party constitutes rightward drift.  They also talk about being gun owners, and that they believe in reasonable gun control.  That's not moving to the right either, it's just trying to do a bit of deprogramming to the Fox News crowd that no, they aren't coming to take everyone's guns.  Same thing with the border - she's not favoring open borders, she wants reasonable laws that allowYou got cut off.","title":"Some progressives and Arab Americans say they won't vote for Kamala Harris over Palestine.

My wife and I keep a tally based on the lists provided by the campaign; we've knocked on around 500 doors so far since September. We've had some door slams and a few rude folks, but a lot of the Trump supporters we've met have been polite. We had one guy last week who was outright apologetic about it; he interrupted us when we started to speak and said, \\"I'm so sorry, but I have to tell you, I'm voting for Trump.\\" I tried to push him on some of the down ballot folks (Sherrod Brown!), but he said no thanks he had already made up his mind. It was almost like he regretted wasting our time by coming out to talk with us.We've had a number of folks like that. Granted, it helps that we're normal folks who engage politely, and I tend to make self-deprecating jokes to break the ice. I've had folks with Trump flags on their house actually stand there and listen while I pitch them on voting yes for Issue 1 (anti-gerrymandering effort). We don't linger super long with anyone, we've got a list to finish, but even when someone tells us they're voting Trump, I follow up by saying something non-political... \\"hey, I like this bench you have on your front porch. Where'd you get it?\\" Or \\"Hey, what kind of dog is that? He seems well-trained.\\" One older woman said she was planning to vote for Trump, then went on a 20 minute monologue about her husband who just passed away this month. We stood and listened to her story; expressed sympathy for her. I don't think I convinced her to change her vote, but when she mentioned she was a cancer survivor, I told her I was worried for her because Trump and Vance want to repeal the ACA and allow insurers to charge more or deny coverage for preexisting conditions.I can't argue everyone into voting for Democrats, but maybe they'll think twice about us \\"liberal Dems\\" if they have a friendly interaction with a well-informed neighbor.There are plenty of deplorables out there and folks who are deep, deep in the cult, even within my own family.

The weak points in the democratic system are on the judicial and administrative side, not the voting side.

The people who think we need voter ID today don't hold that view on the basis of evidencethere is no evidence of substantial voter fraud. They hold that view because they are the victims of propaganda. So if voter ID laws were implemented, the same propagandists would simply invent a new lie (e.g. \\"fake IDs are being given to illegal immigrants\\") and the same gullible people would fall for it again.(3) Even if it did temporarily increase trust, the costs of that temporary trust would far outweigh the benefits, because voter ID laws give people in power a way to disenfranchise voters.

I've consistently held that voting is necessary (but not sufficient). You can check my comments history, if you like. The \\"fantasy land\\" I'm describing is nothing if the sort. It's exactly reality: the Harris-Walz campaign and the Democrats more generally have made an informed choice to not do the very thing that a number of progressives, anti-war activists, and pro-Palestinian activists have said is the price for their vote, so Harris and Walz own the consequences of that decision. If that decision turns out to cost them the election, they will be culpable for it, and minorities the country and world over will pay the price for what is at best their incompetence and at worst their anti-Palestinian bigotry. What *is* a fantasy is the world in which scolding those activists with very clear and actionable demands to vote for the person selling gasoline to the government burning their loved ones alive is going to win their vote. Even if the scolding was correct and sound - and I do think that pro-Palestinian sympathizers should vote for Harris - the scolding doesn't work. It doesn't give the desired results.

The non-Republican should always attempt to be as right-wing as possible to poach voters from the Republican Party, knowing that they still best-represent every constituency but those which are most far right.She's not being \\"as right wing as possible\\", she has instead done things like re-frame abortion rights as a fight for freedom.  It's stealing a bit from the libertarians maybe, but it's not really moving to the right.  It's still the same belief.Second, I disagree with the causal relationship you describe. If progressives and the left start reliably showing out for Democrats, why wouldn't Democratic politicians say \\"good, they're finally falling in line,\\"I mean sure, maybe they would the first time it happened.  Which is why you have to vote in every single election, because after that first and second time, it's less falling in line and more becoming a core part of the party.  There's also the matter of voting for downballot races, especially progressive candidates.  If those start winning more consistently, then the message gets even louder and you start to have some actual say.I'm not sure how to interpret Harris boasting of how tough their border proposal was except that she's adopting right-wing, or right-leaning, values on immigration. Really? It doesn't have to be adopting right wing values to say that there was a bill that a whole bunch of people agreed to would ease some of the issues we have with the border, and it's undeniable that there are actual issues.  She has said many times that she wants an easier process to come into the country and become a citizen.She is also using it as a contrast to her opponent -  she is willing to work with both sides and be a President to everyone in finding solutions to problems, while Donold wants to run on those problems.  They also talk about being gun owners, and that they believe in reasonable gun control.  That's not moving to the right either, it's just trying to do a bit of deprogramming to the Fox News crowd that no, they aren't coming to take everyone's guns.

The House apportionment limit (435) means that states with small populations have outsize representation. The Senate naturally provides small population states disproportionate representation as well by design.Add in the \\"first past the post\\" nature of the Electoral College and you end up with a situation where only a very specific set of voters in a very small set of states actually matter for elections for Presidency. These are \\"swing voters\\" in \\"swing states\\". That's why if you're plugged into the news everyone is talking about Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Swing voters are typically low information voters and are usually referred to as moderate because they aren't attached to either party. If they are somehow well informed and still haven't decided then they typically dislike both parties to a nearly equal degree.

I read through the replies here and I dont think they changed my mind. 1. Harris and Bidens track record is viewed badly by the majority of America, and if people feel bad about their lives under the current government, they are not going to go out there spend time and vote. Its hard to sell people on Trump will ruin the country when the majority feel worse under the current administration. Are they supposed to go out and vote for more of a bad time? Theres no motivation there. Meanwhile, republicans are voting to replace their perception of a bad time with a great time and that is a motivating factor. 2. There is very little trust for Harris. People are voting for her because shes the Democrat candidate. If you give her a serious tough thought, and there was any other Republican, she would likely be losing even worse. One of the key reasons she has lost the trust of the American public is because she hid Joe Bidens mental state. Even Mike Pence went against Donald trump for the good of America when he thought his president was out of line. Instead Kamala put her politics ahead of the country and people who are not innately desiring to see a Democrat in office wont vote for her. 3. This has been a very bad time in terms of world wars and inflation. Most people who are not Democrat feel that a stronger leader is needed. Under trump people threatened that wars in the world would get worse but they actually did not. Instead he got rid of ISIS during his term. After Bidens disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal the world peace has been extremely disrupted . A lack of strong American leadership and clear weakness in Afghanistan has been credited with emboldening our enemies and is the way a lot of people perceive whats going on today. 4. In a time of record inflation, illegal immigration has increased dramatically. For people who are not doing well economically the message that while they are feeling poorer people who are not supposed to be here are coming in at higher numbers is not pleasant. All of this put together makes it hard for a normal person to spend their day voting for Harris when she and her administration are causing these problems. Its not about campaigning. Its about the past 3.5 years.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is highly likely to win the upcoming General Election in a couple weeks"},{"text":"I convinced my buddy who rarely votes to get involved with his local democrats and start door knocking/writing postcards.I convinced several apathetic voters that down ballot elections are worth going out and voting forThe goal isnt to convince hardcore MAGAs to see reason; that would take years.

I think they have no political ideology. And reactionary politics is not only common in India but in other post-colonial democracies too, like Brazil and SA. They are a challenge not merely to the liberal norms and institutions of democracy, but also to concerted efforts to control and even repress civil society and to sustain the power and influence of dominant class-led coalitions.What we need in India now is a balance between political and civil society, which is critical for the sustenance of democratic institutions and practices. Because the Democratic crisis is a symptom of the failure to incorporate the subproletariant  the masses who remain outside the realm of capitalist accumulation  into the economic and social mainstream. When the subproletariat begins to make some economic and political gains through collective mobilisation, that traditionally dominant elites form a reactionary social coalition.And lastly, democratic backsliding reaches a crisis point when the reactionary social coalition, having consolidated its grip on state power, starts to subvert democratic institutions and practices in order to preserve or restore their social and economic privileges.Thus, so long as large segments of the population remain socially and economically excludeda challenge that the decades of Congress rule failed to address  the stability of the democratic order would remain at risk. The tensions that arise from this exclusion would be played out in a balance between civil society and political parties.","title":"Is India an elephant in the room for academia when it comes to discussing post-colonialism?"},{"text":"She's not a nerd or a bookworm.

Dropping support for Israel would also come with political costs that other folks seem to be ignoring, the pro Israel bloc of the Democratic party would also revolt. I don't like the situation but that is exactly what we're dealing with, a no win situation. Likely the calculation is that the pro Israel vote is more valuable to the Dems right now. I can't stand Bibi and the right wingers in Israel, they really need to stop with the settlements and bullshit, they need to stop in Gaza. They have Biden by the balls and they know it. Netanyahu's strategy is just going to create more enemies in the long run of both the US and Israel.I agree with the strategy of courting never trump Republicans, they've been sticking it to Trump pretty hard. They're not gonna direct policy, so I really don't think it will hurt to have them along. I live in a very red area and there is a softening among some folks who do see Trump as a liability, and not liking his stance on Ukraine. The theory is that someone like Cheney gives them a permission structure to vote blue. Haley voters could come along simply because they crave sanity and Trump essentially shunned them.

I will not fight for them if they cannot be bother to fight for us.5. Its unfortunate that Cheney is an ally at this point, but thats because shes aware of the threat to America (and the world) that Trump poses. It transcends ideology- except Democracy, that ideology (which empowers you, and me, and Arab Americans that choose not to act) is the one thing that can help the situation. Its unfortunate that the far left has made it impossible to get them, acting as though the president has the power to single-handedly write and pass legislation AND also run foreign countries, and ALSO as though Hamas doesnt have fucking hostages. Hamas could end it at anytime, literally, by accepting the thing that only Democrats have called for (a ceasefire) but they dont. Why not? Because their calculation is that subjecting their people to further horrors wins public sentiment. To act as though the Americans can snap their fingers and fix all that is absurd and obviously untrue.In short, when this election is lost to Trump, Arab-Americans will have won nothing, but also cost millions more. The blood of every woman that dies waiting for an abortion will be on their hands. The blood of the people that die in internment camps awaiting mass deportation will be on their hands, right alongside the Trump supporters, and anyone else that chose to sit out an election with an open fascist whose most recent political act was a LITERAL ATTEMPTED COUP.

Onstage to introduce former President Barack Obama, Eminem told the crowd that he was at the event for a couple of important reasons. As most of you know, the city of Detroit and the home state of Michigan mean a lot to me, he said. And going into this election, the spotlight is on us more than ever, and I think its important to use your voice. So Im encouraging everybody to get out and vote please. He added, I also think people shouldnt be afraid to express their opinions, and I dont think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution, of what people will do if you make your opinion known. I think Vice President Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld. When he took the stage, Obama said, I have done a lot of rallies, so I dont usually get nervous. But I was feeling some kind of way following Eminem. He then proceeded to rap Eminems Lose Yourself. I thought Eminem was going to perform and I was going to jump out, Obama said. The Harris campaign has been tapping celebrities for campaign appearances, with Bruce Springsteen scheduled to perform at an Atlanta rally Thursday and at a Philadelphia event Monday. Earlier in the day, actor Bradley Whitford appeared at an event with Obama and Harris running mate Tim Walz. Earlier this month, Julia Roberts campaigned for Harris in Georgia.","title":"Eminem Tells Campaign Rally Kamala Harris Will Protect Freedom Of Speech: People Shouldnt Be Afraid To Express Their Opinions"},{"text":"First comment I wanted to make and finally found you saying it.

The best thing we can do, imho, is to organize on a grassroots level. We have a long, rich history of organization. Unfortunately, we have gottwn so far away from that.Looking back, every time we have won significant change, or at least the catalyst for change, that affects the lives of most people, those victories always came as a result of organizing and pressuring the State from without.Workers rights, civil rights, child labor laws, women's right to choose and to vote, second wave feminism, and the list goes on and on. I could list at least 2 dozen. When we fight for widespread social change, we have a tendency of winning meaningful steps forward. On the other hand, electing officials, and hoping they will bring significant, widespread social change on our behalf, well, it hasn't won us so much.As you mentioned, weve made no meaningful steps at mitigating climate change. Those kinds of movements take years to build. If Trump is elected or steals the election, we will be years away from seriously challenging him and his authoritarian leaning sycophantic evil supporters.Frankly, we need to be organized like that year around. It used to be several movements were organizing separately at the same time and could support each other in solidarity. Now, we have nothing real happening. Furthermore, if we get in trouble with a Trump v2, he could do irreparable damage before we are ready to resist and the need will be there, because we know that he will go after left leaning cities, women, minorities, migrants, trans individuals, others from the lgbt and more besides. He wilm hit the ground running. His favorite tool will be by executive order and we cannot trust that our representatives will ever be in a position to challenge him effectively. If not us, then who, you know?Thanks for the conversation. I really must go sleep. If you reply, know that I won't be able to get back to it until tomorrow.

But I honestly dont blame Trump for the economy being trash at the end of his administration. That was caused by a once in a generation phenomenon pandemic that affected the global economy. He didnt do himself any favors, but I think the shitshow of the COVID economy combined with his volatile personality lost him the election to Joe Biden. And so if we acknowledge thats the case, then we can also agree that the economy is better *now* then it was in 2020 and 2021, while the country is trying to claw itself back from that economic recession. Trump claims things would have been better if hed won in 2020. Thats an easy claim to make because hes been out of office. I believe the economy is in a lot of ways better than it was before during Trump. In a lot of ways its worse. In a lot of ways, things havent changed. The economy is better on paper - the stock market is surging, peoples retirement and investment accounts are doing very well, home owners are sitting in appreciating assets, all that stuff. Gas is cheap. $2.69/gal here where Im at. The economy is worse - groceries are super expensive. Building materials are super expensive. Cars are stupid expensive. Everything seems really expensive. I can say for myself, while the cost of living blew up, my personal income also has done well. I earn a lot more than I did in 2019. However, for a lot of lower middle class and working class people, the wages thing hasnt kept pace. I think thats where MAGA gets a lot of support from - people whove been left behind by an evolving economy, where people who have college degrees and career mobility have cashed in on the huge salary handouts big firms were making when the base interest rate was sitting at 0% and cash was basically free to borrow. Anyway, Im rambling. Bottom line I dont think Trump could do anything different to affect peoples economic situation, hes full of hot air, and people are deranged if they think the economy today is bad but under Trump is was so great.","title":"How do yall respond when people say that the economy was better under Trump"},{"text":"*Putin's puppet pretending she was a Democrat","title":"Tulsi Gabbard, former Democratic candidate for president, joins Republican party at Trump rally"},{"text":"Work in a state psych hospital... they set up a voting booth for the patients...","title":"Im pretty sure my parents just committed voter fraud for Trump!"},{"text":"The Kremlin party at the trump rally, ftfy.","title":"Tulsi Gabbard, former Democratic candidate for president, joins Republican party at Trump rally"},{"text":"Shes all thumbs when shes off her knees.","title":"Kamala fumbles answering questions about Bidens decline on NBC"},{"text":"The left lies with the ease your toenails grow.","title":"Kamalas body language points to her fabricating her answer about Joe Bidens decline.

You are right about the consistent standards with regard to branding and product, McDonalds also chooses the real estate, vendors and systems. McDonalds has some of the tightest franchising rules in the business. Youd be surprised, though, by areas in which the Corporation has little to no say. What it doesnt do is forbid political activity of the franchisee companies as long as that activity isnt construed as being on behalf of the McDonalds brand. Franchisees also have free rein to set their business hours within guidelines, host private events, etc. Its likely that within the franchisee governance no rules were challenged  the franchisee loaned out their restaurant to a legitimate (barf) political candidate. As much as we see that as an endorsement, it isnt technically. Based on that, McDonalds likely had no grounds to limit this activity within its policies however much hes a brand risk in reality. If whoever tasked with making this call said no, it would be an overreach of their governance, and potentially, a violation of their political neutrality policies by intervening against a particular candidate. That poor corporate cog would get canned. I dislike Trump as much as anyone here, but I also believe we need to be reasonable in our exercise of that opposition or were as bad as they are.

I'm angry at the situation, not at you. I shouldn't have be typing in anger. I apologize if you felt it was directed at you. For whatever it worth, I'm just angry with the situation.Anyways, the US suffers from a system that is highly outdated and corruptible by redesign. Its hard to imagine anything of note getting seriously fixed until we address the fact that our system of governance was designed almost 300 years ago.When they looked forward to plan for the future, our time, they had no way of knowing that we would make such leaps and bounds in every aspect of society.Take any period in human history and compare it to 300 years prior and, barring any revolutions or being wiped out, it will be something they recognize as similar.The US, is uniquely different in a way that the founders could not have imagined, and yet, we have not sufficiently updated the system to operate better for the time it is in.Representatives on both sides have been guilty in manipulation of the system for self serving purposes. In last few decades, it has been primarily them on the right.Its left us in a situation where 1: it's incredibly and increasingly weak from attack from within, which makes trump, and worse, future successors a prospect that is scary as hell. Can you imagine, we actually lucked out with Trump. We lucked out that he's a narrow minded grifter that can hardly read and had zero understanding of how the political system worked, which is why he was violating laws, regulations, norms, traditions left and right. He had no real ambition of authoritarian power going into his first term, hopefully his only. Imagine the next guy is young, handsome, charming, charismatic and is as evil as their ambition for authoritarian control? We lucked out that it was Trump and not that guy. However, we are in no position to stop the next one, not at the moment at least.Second, it left us in the only place it was possible to go. A highly polarized electorate, with one side aligned with fsr right extremists, billionaires and evangelical extremists. There are ways tl fix that but it requires a working system. We have a corrupt scotus. A house tjat gets nothing done when under Republican control, that fights like hell to sabotage any effort by the left. To make matters worse, there are plenty on the left that are negligent and just your average self serving politician. They just don't seem bad because of the cover provided by extremism.Im just gonna stop. Sorry again for m6 first comment.

That's not what it typically was prior to COVID, that's not what it would mean nowadays. That's called a straw man. That's not what anyone who would argue in favor of a return to the office is saying is necessary about the office. It's definitely not what I said. Having the presence of police in your town or city, gets many people to obey traffic laws (not all) who wouldn't if there was no fear of getting a ticket, or worse. That does not mean police cruisers are literally following every car around at all times. Obviously. You don't like working in an office, so you  view yourself as mature, and therefore the opposite is true of those who prefer working in the office. That doesn't make it babysitting or immature, a sing of incapability, for those who prefer or benefit from working in the office. Just like those who prefer working from home are not any less mature.Here is the CMVCMV: there is NO reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of workEvery time you give personal anecdotes of how things work well for you and in your office, that essentially means nothing. I'm not saying that working from home can't be great. I don't believe that. It absolutely can be. But that is essentially irrelevant. The question isn't whether there typically isn't reason to RTO, it's whether there is No reason.We aren't dealing in a future idealistic world, where the work schedule is changed. We are in a real world where there are certain age groups that are essentially incapable of using technology. There are people who are working their first job, and do need guidance (not babysitting, or someone breathing down their neck). There are employers who can't afford to just fire everyone who isn't an optimal employee. Does working from home work for you and your boss? It sure seems like it. Does working from home work for many if not most businesses that don't need to have people in the office? Sure. But your office, or the majority of offices, says very little about whether all offices that could theoretically work from home should.","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"Unfortunately, by not having clear brand guidelines that state no political advertising or events under our brand, and [explicitly approving the Trump campaigns stunt](https://abc3340.com/amp/news/nation-world/donald-trump-mcdonalds-mickey-ds-fast-foodies-food-event-2024-presidential-candidate-campaign-drive-thru-nominee-visit-approved-approval-suburban-fry-station-burger-giant-seeking-comment-elected-office-golden-arches), they got played into taking a side.

I agree with your point that widespread cases of food poisoning, hospitalization and now a death is very different than the isolated cases that more regularly occur. I dont think this is a conspiracy, other than it is alarming how common that chain restaurants unwashed vegetables are the cause of  food poisoning rather than undercooked meat which is what seems to get peoples attention. The idea that its sabotage purposely targeting the McDonalds brand and stock price due to Trump visiting a franchise location just doesnt add up with the timeline that we know so far. The Trump photoshoot occurred after the initial cases, and hospitalization(according to coverage I could find the first cases started popping up in September). I guess if you were really conspiracy minded perhaps the most likely conspiracy is some slick McDonalds executive had a hunch of the cause when those initial cases popped up and used a franchisee and Trumps campaigns photoshoot to pump a bunch of news coverage and media attention around the brand to impact algorithms and create a media push so that coverage of the food poisoning would be delayed or overshadowed by the coverage of Trumps presidential campaign. I dont think like this but perhaps someone whose bonuses are tied to the stock price, in a moment of greed and desperation thought using the media attention and the political circus that is the presidential election could be useful way to shield themselves and turn a public health and food safety issue into something political. I have yet to see any evidence that McDonalds executives or corporate leadership setup that photoshoot or were working behind the scenes to cover up the initial food poisoning cases so at the moment I am withhold any opinion of a conspiracy like  I see this post and thread focusing on, could just be a coincidence","title":"Like clockwork, upset the deep state by seemingly aiding Trump, and they will unleash the government attack dogs on you.

Since then, another 200-plus medical professionals have signed on, following a slate of unhinged episodes and nonsensicaleven profanecomments from Trump over the past week. As I reported yesterday, highlights included swaying on stage for a half-hour to?Ave Maria, Hallelujah, and YMCA;?calling himself the father of IVF;?falsely claiming?nobody died?on January 6?other than Ashli Babbitt?and that there were no guns among the insurrectionists; and making lewd comments about both his opponent and the late golfer Arnold Palmers genitalia.\\nIts no wonder, then, that as of Monday afternoon, 448 health professionals have voiced?concerns about his fitness for office. With no recent disclosure of health information from Donald Trump, we are left to extrapolate from public appearances, their letter states. And on that front, Trump is falling concerningly short of any standard of fitness for office and displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity.As the letter points out, Trump is 78 years oldthough its unclear if he realizes that, given that he?said?hes not that close to 80 during a town hall Sunday. His age, the writers argue, makes it all the more necessary he come clean about his state of health. (Biden, after all, is 81.)

The most recent insight we have is a three-paragraph letter he?posted?to Truth Social in which his personal physician claimed he had lost weight and was in excellent health.While many older adults are highly functional, age can also come with cognitive changes that affect our ability to function well in complex settings, the letter says. We are seeing that from Trump, as he uses his rallies and appearances to ramble, meander, and crudely lash out at his many perceived grievances. He also is notably refusing to give the public the ability to properly vet or scrutinize his capacities. Earlier this month, Trump?dropped out?of a scheduled?60 Minutes?interview.

If what the israli government, the IDF and settlers are doing on Gaza is, in fact genocide, then its important to say it. Playing politics on issues is precisely why things end up il not progressing.If the liberals hadn't been so afraid in passed decades to appear to be anything less than in full support or Israel, I doubt we would be in the situation we are. If in the 90's, 2000's or whatever, liberal said, \\"we support Israel, but its also prudent to make sure we have agreements for what weapons we sell them are used for\\" or, \\"its necessary that we takw steps now to ensure that the Israelis, whom we support, will never use the weapons we sell, or otherwise provide them with, are used for unjust purposes\\" Talk about short sighted. If the left had pushed for those kinds of agreements, with real consequences, then we wouldn't be in this situation because we could be like, \\"look, we've given Israel our full support but they are violating the terms of our support and we are going to take these actions to force them to back down\\" All of this was predictable. All of it. Maybe not the timing, but it was clear that Isreal was going to jump on any occasion \\"go to war\\" with Palestine. (we can't call this a war, its shooting fish in barrel) its also clear that they want to make land grabs in Lebanon. The left had a responsibility to keep Israel in check. The best way to do that is by threatening to withdraw support but they were afraid how it would have looked at home. The left would have likely lost some seats over it, but they would have recovered lomg before the the terrorist attack happened on October 7th and would have had guardrails in place. Oh, and they would have primed the American people for the understanding that the support ot Israel is conditional. Instead, all this time, US support has been unconditional, to the point that Harris can't even call it genocide, which is precisely what is happening and it's pretty obvious that Harris believes this too but she's in a awkward position created by decades of a weak left. Why has her attacks on Trump been successful? Because people are sick and tired of bougie ass democrats taking the high road every time, which means they end up getting taken advantage of by a party that has no qualms with lies, manipulation, corruption etc. I'm not saying they should engage with that but damn, stop giving a rats ass what republicans are gonna say, because they will say anything no matter what the dems do","title":"Kamala Harris does not agree with protester who shouted genocide, her campaign says"},{"text":"He knows what a shit show the economy will be in should trump be elected","title":"Jamie Dimon Privately Supports Kamala Harris.

First and foremost, the uncommitted movement isn't entirely Muslim Americans. I'd characterize them as the uncommitted to be clear about who we are talking about. The entire Muslim community in America isn't uncommitted either.I would say more accurately, if she wins or loses Michigan rather than the entire election. Michigan is the swing state that matters the most on this issue and the source of the uncommitted movement.To your point of... If Kamala wins Michigan in spite of not meeting the uncommitted movement any concessions, that means she doesn't need their vote - Again, I'd reread my post. She is already making this point and it seems that she is calling their bluff. None of the uncommitted want to vote for Trump. (Sure, maybe there are some accelerationists in there.) If anything, this supports into why it isn't damaging their own interests. That is, if she is going to win (Michigan or the whole thing without Michigan), there is no cost to remaining uncommitted. The problem is that, there is no power in being uncommitted. It goes both ways. Both parties need to be willing to walk away. Kamala has far more power here than the uncommitted movement. And everyone wants them to give up what power they do have? That seems counterproductive to their own interest.The question you asked and posed is, is it against their own interest. Even if Kamala wins without their help, it doesn't hurt their own interest to not support her. Their interest is to get a ceasefire. They are putting pressure on her using the levers they have available. That's how you advocate. If they commit to her, they lose their power, and lose all the attention they have.Last point, this is extremely important. When Andrew Yang lost, us Yang Gang guys realized we really 'won' when a UBI-like stimulus happened during the Pandemic. I honestly don't think that stimulus would have gone over as well if it weren't for Yang Gang priming our society for UBI. I truly believe it mattered. This is the same thing. When you advocate and force people to address you, using the power that you have while you have it, you can move the needle. I have no doubt that Harris thinks about the uncommitted movement when she looks at the electoral map and sees Michigan staring back at her. People are paying attention to Gaza, and hearts and minds are shifting on the issue. The fact that it is potentially going to cost her the election is massive. And the uncommitted movement is fighting the good fight over there and they shouldn't fold to the pressures that are being put on them. They are absolutely acting in their best interest here.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"\\\\\\"Think of a crazy person ranting nonstop about absolute nonsense, making connections between random thoughts, jumping from topic to topic.\\"\\\\To vote for who she would have voted for anywaysIt tracks.

I don't see how treating employees as adults instead of children and expecting them to do the job to their employers standards without being required to breath down their neck is a 'meaningless idea of how to be an adult'. I think employers treating their employees like petulant children who don't want to go to school is an extremely poor analogy. If your child doesn't want to go to school you can't fire them. If your adult employee doesn't perform their job to an employers satisfaction why are they employing that employee? Act like an adult and employ someone who can. If employers can't handle employees working from home and still behaving as adults, who are meeting (and exceeding) their job requirements, are they really mature enough to be an employer? In the same way some people work more efficiently in the office with or without a boss present, doesn't mean they need a babysitter.No, it doesn't, but the point I was addressing with that was the idea that 'some people need the pressure of having their boss showing up every half hour to their desk', or 'some people need supervision or they'll slack off/won't do their job'. That is very much saying that those people NEED a babysitter. Some people work better in the office even without a boss on sight. Sure, I get that. That's fine. But the argument was made that some people work better in the office because their boss was there and could make sure they work, to which I still ask: if an employee is unable to do their job UNLESS the boss is there making sure they do it, why is that employee still employed?Nobody is getting their diapers changed, nobody is making sure that they are in bed on time.No, but if the employer wants the employee on sight to 'make sure they're doing their job' then that employer is treating their employee like a child when they should treat them like an adult, and find an employee they don't *have* to do this with.Guidance, supervision, and instruction, can be parts of babysitting, but it's also part of teaching, or being a coach, or being a boss whether you're in an office or not.Yes, I absolutely agree. And don't understand that what works for you and your place of business, doesn't mean it works for everyone else and every other place of business, so let me give you some personal examples as well.I never claimed it did. Please quote once where I said, 'This works for every job everywhere all the time.' I'll wait.Different subject matter is different, and therefore what is the beneficial way to go about it can be different. Not only that, but different people are different.Yup. Never once said otherwise.I never said you shouldn't feel that way, and I never said your boss shouldn't feel that way.I also never said that you or your boss should feel the way I do either.What I again said is different people and offices are different.And I never disagreed with that. You gave some differences and supported those differences with reasons I disagreed with and gave you examples of how your argument for those differences were not strong arguments for requiring RTO. Maybe you grew up in the area you now live in, or you went to college there, so you already had a social network, and that's wonderful.Did grow up in the state, but not the area. Didn't go to college. My social network has evolved and changed my entire life. Yes, some people go to work looking to socialize and make friends. Never said they don't, or couldn't. What I said was, employers making the argument of 'come in, we want you to make friends here' is often exploited so that they can overwork their employees or keep them in a job that treats them badly in other aspects for longer under threat of 'losing their friends'. Ever hear 'we're a big family!' or 'we work hard and we play hard' in relation to workplace cultures? BIG red flags that employees are going to get shafted in one way or another but 'it's okay, because we buy you pizza once in a while'.  But there are also people who are moving to a new location for any number of reasons, or people with a small social circle whose friends are moving away for various reasons. There are offices in the middle of Montana. Many people after school is over, the most socialization they get is work.Sure. What I'm saying is that work *is not* necessary for socialization despite many employers painting it that way. Work *is not* necessary to keep and maintain friends that you may have met through work. And people are notoriously overworked and underpaid, sure, and have to spend 80 hours a week working and that's all their socialization. That needs to be changed so that people CAN actually have social lives outside of work. Having the option to work from home actually HELPS that, not hinders it. Your boss letting you work from home, as a means of keeping you happy and allowing you more freedom in your personal life is no more exploitative than the boss creating a social atmosphere to keep people happy.Not at face value, no. But there is far more room for exploitation from a boss who demands you come into the office anyway *even when you can do your job perfectly well and to their standards at home*. Tell me. If your boss has no complaints about the quality of your performance at work when you're working from home, what motivation does he have to *require* you to work from the office? How is he served by forcing employees to do this? Genuine question, and I'm very interested in your answer. He could've had you work in the office and offered you more moneyHow prevalent do you think bosses are that will give you more money if you simply come into the office (to do the exact same job you're doing well) , versus bosses who want you to come into the office (to do the exact same job you're doing well) who have no intention of giving you more money? I will tell you right now, my pay didn't change when I went home to work, and those departments that *did* have to return to the office (like call center folks) certainly didn't get a pay bump for their 'sacrifice'. Pretty sure bosses wanting their employees to come into the office for reasons that actually have nothing to do with that employees performance or genuine social well being, and won't actually result in a pay bump for the employee outnumber the number of employers saying 'hey, come back and will give you more pay' by a DRASTIC amount.Not everyone thinks and acts the way you doStill, never once said that they did. I gave examples of why some of your arguments didn't hold water.It's a matter of perspective and opinioWhat works for you and I, and our bosses, isn't what works for every employee and employer. That's all I'm saying.And I never claimed it did. What I'M saying is certain reason(s) being given on why employers might want employees to work in an office don't hold water. Reasons like 'well, some employees don't work well unless their employer is popping up at their desk every half hour' don't hold water, because why does that employer keep an employee who cannot be relied upon to do the job they were hired to do without their hand being held?' Reasons like 'employers want their employees in the office because its easier to walk over to a desk' don't hold water because no, it isn't. The same delays and time wasted that can happen communicating with people in a workplace when working from home are the same delays and time wasted that can happen with people in a workplace when everyone's on site. The reason that 'some people perform better under pressure so should be in the office with a boss popping up to provide that pressure' doesn't hold water because there are plenty of far more useful and constructive pressures to utilize other than distracting, worrying, and adding additional stress on your employee by hovering over their shoulder and making them feel patronized. And, once again, if the boss doesn't think the person can perform their job to their standards (pressure or no), why is that person employed in that position?That's all I'M saying.","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"No doubt protesting genocidal Iran and its genocidal proxies in Gaza and Lebanon.","title":"Detroit Muslim leader ejected from Kamala Harris rally, deepening rift between Democrats and Arab Americans"},{"text":"Her speech was great.

DOE plans to use this fundingmade possible in part by President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Lawto spur the safe and responsible deployment of advanced reactor technologies across the country and encourage follow-on reactor projects to support our nation's ambitious climate goals and meeting the growing demand for clean, reliable, and affordable power. Todays announcement aims to assist the private sector in establishing a credible and sustainable pathway to deploying a fleet of Gen III+ SMRs across the country that advances environmental protection and community benefits, creates new, good-paying, high-quality jobs, and reinforces Americas leadership in the nuclear industry.  \\n...  \\nDOE estimates the U.S. will need approximately 700-900 GW of additional clean, firm power generation capacity to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Nuclear power is a proven option that could be deployed to meet this growing demand. In 2023, nuclear energy provided nearly half of Americas carbon-free electricity. Utilities are looking to extend the lifespan of current nuclear reactors, planning to uprate reactor capacity, reversing plans to close reactors, and even restarting formerly closed reactors. At the same time, they are earnestly exploring building new reactors to meet the fast-growing demand for carbon-free energy. Designed with a variety of capabilities, sizes, and deployment scenarios in mind, SMRs can be used for power generation, process heat, desalination, and more. In particular, SMRs offer the potential for greater modularity, more factory-style construction, and the ability to be matched with loads and scaled to meet demand. Additionally, Gen III+ SMRs may be able to revitalize and leverage the expertise, workforce, and supply chains supporting the existing fleet of large light-water reactor designs, thus providing a near-term path for new nuclear deployments and operation. Created by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 and utilizing funds from President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, DOE anticipates offering funding in two tiers: * Tier 1: First Mover Team Support, managed by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), will provide up to $800M for milestone-based awards to support up to two first mover teams of utility, reactor vendor, constructor, and end-users/off-takers committed to deploying a first plant while facilitating a multi-reactor, Gen III+ SMR orderbook and the opportunity to work with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to incorporate safeguards and security by design into the projects. \\n* Tier 2: Fast Follower Deployment Support, managed by the Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), will provide up to $100M to spur additional Gen III+ SMR deployments by addressing key gaps that have hindered the domestic nuclear industry in areas such as design, licensing, supplier development, and site preparation.  \\n...  \\nThese investments advance the Presidents Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution....Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:Revitalizing Americas nuclear sector is key to adding more carbon free energy to the grid and meeting the needs of our growing economyfrom AI and data centers to manufacturing and healthcare, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. Thanks to the President and Vice Presidents Investing in America agenda, the nations nuclear industry is poised to lead the world in innovative advanced reactor technologies, which will create high-paying jobs while providing the flexible and reliable clean energy we need to support a thriving clean energy future.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $900 Million to Build and Deploy Next-generation Nuclear Technologies"},{"text":"I donated several times and Im writing letters now too.

Trump is a threat to that. When he calls people who disagree with him the enemy within, he puts out whole system at risk. He makes seeking out these conversations a dangerous thing to do.

Even in the 90s with abortion as a #1 priority issue, there just wasn't room for financial concerns when *battling over vulnerable childrens' souls*.

Finding an excuse to stay home every time the Democrat doesn't pass their purity test will then cause Democrats to move to the right, since that's where the voters are.A couple of things with this position. One, this isn't actually responsive to the reasoning fomented by the two-party system that left-of-center folks have to vote for the Democratic candidate, no matter how right-leaning they may be. The non-Republican should *always* attempt to be as right-wing as possible to poach voters from the Republican Party, knowing that they still best-represent every constituency but those which are most far right. Second, I disagree with the causal relationship you describe. If progressives and the left start reliably showing out for Democrats, why wouldn't Democratic politicians say \\"good, they're finally falling in line,\\" and continue pursuing center-right voters as they have done and are incentivized to do by the two-party system? If anything, the opposite of what you're suggesting seems to be true: the Party tried veering center/right in 2016 (more prominently than in previous elections), and when that electoral strategy failed to give desirable results because center-right voters don't reliably vote for Democrats, they seem to have doubled down on pursuing that very cohort that is unreliable. The only possibility that hasn't been meaningfully attempted yet is offering large concessions to the left to attempt to draw them to the polls, and I think we both know that this won't happen in the foreseeable future. \\n Except that they haven't fully adopted that racist lie, what they have fully adopted is that we have a problem with our immigration system, which we have had for decades, and we need solutions that most people can agree on, which is what happened with the border bill.I'm not sure how to interpret Harris boasting of how tough their border proposal was except that she's adopting right-wing, or right-leaning, values on immigration. Politico in August had a good exame of this \\"law &amp; order\\" rhetoric coming from Harris, which was its peak when Trump killed the border bill hut has backed off somewhat since then. The emphasis has been that the problem is people is how many *illegals* are streaming across the border, violating the law, rather than the humanitarian crisis that ought to be the focus. I would much rather Harris, or whoever is the opposition candidate, emphasize a pro-migrant position rather than accepting the premise that we have to \\"secure the border\\".","title":"Some progressives and Arab Americans say they won't vote for Kamala Harris over Palestine.

You still have extreme individuals on the Democrat side, but they have not subsumed the entire Democratic Party.

The Democrats are imperfect, to say the least, in handling all instances of trendy antisemitism but it's a phenomenon mainly online on campuses and far left spaces that would never call themselves \\"Democrats\\" or \\"liberal\\" anyway. And I'm not some antisemitism hand-waver or minimizer, per my comment history I'm extremely rattled by the explosion of antisemitism and terrorist support (that's harmful to Palestinians btw) post-Oct. 7th.On the other hand, The Republican Party did get subsumed by MAGA, the far right and the evangelicals who bolstered their hard right Christian agenda. Trump has in many ways wrecked the party and I genuinely don't know where they go from here post-Trump.Right now the election Kamala is running has The Vibes and talking points being more center than her positions 2019-2020. She's shown sympathy to the plight of innocent Palestinians (imo as she should, right thing to do) and hasn't catered to pro-Hamas extremists. The Democratic Party right now has not been subsumed by extremist far-left cranks, and I am hopeful they see where the Republican Party went and not to go down that road.

When the principal plan is to \\"poach\\" center-right voters from Republicans while everyone to the left of the center-right has no other viable option, you end up with (say) a candidate that agreed with the most odious right-wing freaks on 75(+) percent of issues; and on the basis of that 25 percent remaining, not only does everyone left of center-right get browbeaten into enthusiastic support for that candidate, it's hailed as a victory for the left and for progressives because it could have been worse. Which is why the strategy for Progressives should be that they need to be seen as a consistent voting bloc.  Finding an excuse to stay home every time the Democrat doesn't pass their purity test will then cause Democrats to move to the right, since that's where the voters are.We can see less extreme versions of this happening even now, with Harris and other Democrats fully adopting the racist lie that there's a \\"border security crisis\\" of migrants streaming across the border, the solution to which is to juice up Border Patrol, rather than a humanitarian crisis of how horribly migrants are treated and how few are accepted.Except that they haven't fully adopted that racist lie, what they have fully adopted is that we have a problem with our immigration system, which we have had for decades, and we need solutions that most people can agree on, which is what happened with the border bill.","title":"Some progressives and Arab Americans say they won't vote for Kamala Harris over Palestine.

Mr. Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft, has not publicly endorsed Ms. Harris, and his donation would represent a significant change in the strategy that has previously kept him away from gifts like this.In private calls this year to friends and others, Mr. Gates has expressed concern about what a second Donald Trump presidency would look like, according to a person briefed on Mr. Gatess thinking, although he has stressed that he could work with either candidate. Mr. Gates does not have a deep relationship with Ms. Harris, but he has celebrated the Biden-Harris administrations work on climate change. Mr. Gatess philanthropic organization, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, is significantly concerned about potential cuts to family planning and global health programs if Mr. Trump is elected, according to two people close to the foundation.[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/elections/bill-gates-future-forward-kamala-harris.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/elections/bill-gates-future-forward-kamala-harris.html)","title":"Bill Gates Gets Off Political Sidelines With $50 Million Donation to Future Forward Group to Support Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Hey everyone!

Then he banned the media from entering and no one from his party ever mentioned it again. At least when Trump was President, the Dems were putting pressure on him to deal with it. It didn't work, but they actually tried. I guarantee that if Trump wins again, the border camps will suddenly become a big talking point. Just like everything else. Democrats live only to campaign for power, it's how they make their profits. Fixing problems would actually make things worse for them because then they have less bargaining chips. Harris is campaigning with the same promises Biden made and failed and four years ago, and in four years time they'll be doing the same. The Republicans at least actually do what their voters want them to do. They've been very successful. I don't support their policies, but I wish I did because then I'd be supporting a party that got some work done.

Instead of doing what you need to do, and going to the place you need to go, you want to stay home, where you're more comfortable. So, stop acting like a child, and wanting to stay home from school. You don't get to play sick everyday. There's no snow on the ground keeping you from going.\\nIt's called being an adult, you go into work and you act your age and stop being immature and childish. If you can't handle being in the workplace maybe you aren't mature enough to be working.Do you see how your argument is based upon your meaningless idea of what it means to be an adult. Your home can also be your office. It isn't necessarily just the place away from the office you stay at when you don't want to go to work. In the same way some people work more efficiently in the office with or without a boss present, doesn't mean they need a babysitter.A Boss, or a college professor, or the coach of the pro sports team is not a babysitter, just because they do some of the things a babysitter does on a very vague level. There is a big difference between a babysitter and what a boss's presence would be in an office. Nobody is getting their diapers changed, nobody is making sure that they are in bed on time.Guidance, supervision, and instruction, can be parts of babysitting, but it's also part of teaching, or being a coach, or being a boss whether you're in an office or not.  Like cooking meals can be part of babysitting, but the chef at the restaurant is not babysitting you.You seem to give only personal examples often, and don't understand that what works for you and your place of business, doesn't mean it works for everyone else and every other place of business, so let me give you some personal examples as well.In college I took some online course. For literature and history,  the subjects where I didn't really need to learn how to read or write, all I had to do is perform functions I already knew by a certain deadline, I took those courses online, it was easy. My science courses, I couldn't take online, because there was a lab component and group work. Math courses I preferred to take in person, because I felt as though the instruction of a teacher in real time was going to be more beneficial than just reading a textbook and a web page. Different subject matter is different, and therefore what is the beneficial way to go about it can be different. Not only that, but different people are different.You wouldn't want to meet friends or a significant other in the office. That's fine. If your boss has those same opinions that's fine too. I never said you shouldn't feel that way, and I never said your boss shouldn't feel that way. What I again said is different people and offices are different.Maybe you grew up in the area you now live in, or you went to college there, so you already had a social network, and that's wonderful. Or maybe you live in a decent sized city. Some other people are just like you too. But there are also people who are moving to a new location for any number of reasons, or people with a small social circle whose friends are moving away for various reasons. There are offices in the middle of Montana. Many people after school is over, the most socialization they get is work. It is what many people spend more than half their waking hours, 5 out of 7 days a week doing.That wasn't you, but that doesn't mean it's no one. Your boss letting you work from home, as a means of keeping you happy and allowing you more freedom in your personal life is no more exploitative than the boss creating a social atmosphere to keep people happy. He could've had you work in the office and offered you more money, but instead he exploits you, and you allow it, by taking the pay you are getting and working from home. In reality It is just a difference of opinion. In either situation some employees view it as a benefit, some employees view it as a negative, but creating an atmosphere that employees enjoy which gives them a social or personal benefit, is only exploitative to you, because you want to view it that way.Not everyone thinks and acts the way you do, Not every office is the same. Some offices have four people, some offices are a full campus of 4,000 people. What makes sense for one, doesn't necessarily make sense for all. Communication is going to be different based on the size of the company, amongst many other factors.Like I said before, in some offices everybody has a designated task, and specific completion dates, like for instance in yours, and I said in that situation work from home makes sense. But that isn't every office.At one of my past jobs a decade ago, I was the only person under 60. Other than the bookkeeping everything was done by hand. Even the book keeper once handed me a handwritten note with a web address written on it for a dropbox page with 30 random alphanumeric symbols at the end to send the tax forms. (Of course she leaves her email open, I just found the email, and clicked the link.) In an office where the most computer literate person was still basically illiterate, they could not function from home.I work from home. I Iove it. I have a boss I talk to essentially once a month for 5 minutes or so on the phone, and maybe send a short email every week or two. I'm left alone to do my work. I can work whatever hours I want, I can take on as much or as little work as I want, as long as I get it done, and I always do. My friends, I didn't meet through work. My girlfriend, I didn't meet through work. I'm doing pretty well for myself financially. My employment situation works for me, and it works for my boss. I have friends who work from home and love it too. I have friends who don't need to go into the office more than a couple times a month, but do for various reasons. I have one friend whose company is on the other side of the country, and they rented him an office so that he can go into work everyday, because he has four kids at home. I also have friends who have to go into the office and hate it.From the perspective of the employee or the employer, there is no right answer. It's a matter of perspective and opinion.What works for you and I, and our bosses, isn't what works for every employee and employer. That's all I'm saying.","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"Whoops, somehow I didnt add the photo.

What I am saying is that the means of threatening them from the left comes during the primary process and during coalition building during their actual terms in office. Biden's economic policies are arguably the most progressive since FDR. That didn't happen because his campaign worried about losing Michigan votes to Jill Stein.
