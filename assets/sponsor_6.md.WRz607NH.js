This is the final death of the Obama coalition. In 2008 he brought together college-educated White voters and racial minority voters, who are both located primarily in the major cities and their suburbs. Since then the Democrats have really consolidated the college-educated demographic, but Black and especially Hispanic voters no longer behave as homogenous voter blocks. Non-college-educated minority voters are now behaving like non-college-educated White voters. Those people have always been socially conservative, except for their opposition to racism. America has become less racist in the last 16 years (despite perhaps becoming more xenophobic), so opposition to racism no longer overrides other concerns for those non-college-educated racial minority voters.There's no way the Democrats are going to abandon socially progressive policy, and shouldn't. They need to bring in another coalition partner. Ideally somebody in rural areas. I think focussing on massive economic investment in infrastructure in rural areas is the way to go. I don't think people are actually afraid of socialist policies, they're just afraid of their taxes benefiting someone else instead of themselves. Urban populations are already locked down with social policy so we need an economic policy tailored to rural voters.Edit: I know this is r/neoliberal but my desire to retain my basic human rights overrides my critiques of socialist economic policy.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"Brownshirts when?","title":"Kamala Harris wins Colorado"},{"text":"Wait, isn't he going to prison?

I spent 20 minutes writing out my thought. Think I should share it here.  \\n  \\nReasons I think why majority of moderates like me supported Trump (I could be wrong, but I will be completely honest here from my perspective):1. **Inflation and unnecessary wars**. I supported Biden 4 years ago, but I am very disappointed with his administration on handling inflation and wars. High inflation was expected due to Covid and I understood Biden's job as president after Trump would be super challenging. I was fully supportive on Biden till he allowed Ukraine war to start at the very peak of inflation during early 2022. Yes, we couldn't control Putin who initiated the war, but it is obvious that US policy change under Biden administration was the main reason the war started. We were literally forcing Putin to start the war. Biden administration also lost control of middle-east war now. Israel do not listen to Biden. They will definitely not listen to Kamala. They may not even listen to Trump, but at least we now have a stronger leader who will hold Israel in check. With Trump's re-election, I expect him to cut down on magnitude of both wars and save us some federal expenses to focus on fixing the economy.\\n2. **Kamala and Democratic Party did not focus enough on addressing the biggest concern (economy) throughout Kamala's campaign.**?The campaign focused more on democracy of the country and that Trump's re-election means US will not be a democratic country anymore. This is incorrect because existing checks and balances and separation of power of US political system will prohibit MAGA from changing the country as they wish. Major constitutional changes won't pass the Congress due to the two-third of majority support, thus the claim that Trump re-election means no democracy is incorrect and politically ill-wised. Dethroning existing political system means civil war. MAGA people are timid and they have more to lose in civil war. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign focused sufficiently on addressing the economic issues like cutting down national debt.To sum up, I firmly believe that Trump will be a better president in fixing the economy, which is the foundation of US stability, and that democracy will still persist under him. I do object his claim that 2020 election was stolen (Biden did beat him fair and square), his participation in Jan 6, and some bullshts during his last term. But I do think he will be doing better in his second term with more experience this time. I weighted all aspects, and concluded that Trump will be better this time, and thus supported him.To be clear, if Bernie, AOC, or Michelle Obama is the Democrats candidate this time, I will vote for them. I do think their campaign will focus more on fixing economic issues.Let's unite everyone!","title":"Trump official won. It's time to unite fellow Americans!

They will try to blame this on not only sexism; but also racism, and the \\"Left.\\" This is where I'm going to disagree with you. The left is no more responsible for this than sexism. This defeat can be laid directly at the feet of Kamala Harris herself and the Democratic party, which is not a left wing party but a center-right one. She and they ran a campaign that berated her allies for disagreeing with her, while also insulting her enemies. It couldn't have been calculated better to lose the election. If this sounds familiar that's because it's the same tactic used by Hillary Clinton in 2016. I think you give a pretty good analysis of the problems within the Democratic Party right now. But that is not a good description of the American left. The left were the people calling for an actual primary both when Joe Biden was running and when Harris replaced him. The Left were supporting and voting for candidates that more closely aligned with our values or refraining altogether. They were told that they would cause Trump to win for this, and they'll continue to be berated for this for at least the next 4 years. The Left isn't perfect. Some have, unfortunately, taken up that moral superiority and attacked rather than argued. But most on the left are open to dissent and willing to engage with those we disagree with. Unfortunately that is not a good strategy for the current state of American politics. Sexism didn't lose Kamala Harris this election, neither did the left. Harris lost not only the election, but the popular vote to a Republican for the first time in 20 years. As things stand as I'm writing this you could take every vote from every candidate who isn't Trump or Harris, give them to Harris, and she would still be losing by more than 3 million votes. This happened because Harris ran one of the worst campaigns in American political history. TLDR:\\n1: Neither sexism nor the \\"Left\\" is to blame for the result of the election. Harris and the Democrats are at fault for their own failure tonight. \\n2. Your description better fits the Democratic Party than the actual American Left wing. Disclaimer: While neither sexism nor racism caused this loss, they both played a part. Considering that all 3 Democratic candidates that have faced Trump used basically the same strategy, and the only one to beat him was a white man. It's also true that both racism and sexism play a large part in Trump's rhetoric and many of his supporters like that.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"She couldn't because she is still on that fake phone call.","title":"US presidential election 2024: Kamala Harris cancels election night party as path to victory narrows - BBC News"},{"text":"There's no scenario, even in reaction to what just happened, that ends with the Democrats nominating someone pro life","title":"Andy Beshear 2028"},{"text":"first they took harambe from us, and then peanut... we will not stand for this","title":"Democrats blame Peanut the Squirrel for election landslide"},{"text":" That they just voted themselves into more of it, and their attitudes clearly dictate why their lonely.If you hate everyone , no one will want to play with you duh","title":"What are your thoughts on the growing loneliness epidemic?"},{"text":"If we fix housing people will stop freaking out about immigration.","title":"Doomer-ing out hard"},{"text":"Proud of you Michigan!","title":"US House Is Democrats Best Hope in Brutal Election for Party"},{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, I was extremely sad to hear about Peanut - RIP little dude","title":"Democrats blame Peanut the Squirrel for election landslide"},{"text":"Nuts out for Peanut","title":"Democrats blame Peanut the Squirrel for election landslide"},{"text":"RIP Peanut, your sacrifice will be remembered","title":"Democrats blame Peanut the Squirrel for election landslide"},{"text":"Yall remember when the party you wanted in today rugged this dude?

Many Latinos are religious and socially conservative. Best option for abortion legalization are through state referendums at this point, unfortunately but realistically.(3) Speaking of Latinos, a lot of them that I talked to really did not like Venezuelans who crossed the border and took a similar stance as Trump in basically stereotyping them as criminals (a lot of them comes over to their countries too). I really think Democrats as a whole should be really hawkish on the border and immigration enforcement while encouraging legal immigration to highly skilled workers (Republicans old platform).(4) People were growing numb to all of Trumps rhetorics to a point where theyve been basically ignore them, but Harris Campaign spent a lotta time talking about it (I mean they were low hanging fruits, but still).

Yanno, like all the videos of poll workers suspiciously covering every possible area where someone outside might take a peek at what's happening inside right as poll workers get the boot so the poll workers could close up shop for the night. or watch the countless videos of poll workers, mailmen or other govt officials throwing out ballots, ripping up or shredding ballots, even lighting ballots on fire while they record themselves giggling as they monologue on how awful X canidate is. just the simple fact that a state like California legally prevents a voter from even voluntarily showing ID to vote SCREAMS massive fraud - as Joe Rogan said about 100 times during his podcasts last week... what other reason is there to not require identification? other than making cheating possible. the entire election \\"your vote counts!\\" gimmick is complete theater to begin with imo. the real rulers of our reality would NEVER leave it up to chance, even if the US President is merely a puppet they control. this cycle made it super obvious that the canidates are selected for us and they always just happen to align on all the REAL major issues (support Israel, support Ukraine, don't talk about elite/govt child trafficking, don't legitimately investigate obvious criminals who've been in govt positions for 5 or 6 decades straight, or alternate between govt official and employee of the industries they were just in charge of regulating) - just like when Trump last won, instead of \\"drain the swamp\\" he immediately filled his Cabinet with mushbrain psychopaths from the Obama, Clinton and Bush administrations (HE LITERALLY HIRED JOHN BOLTON FOR GOODNESS SAKE!) or how Trump shamelessly pushed the mRNA gene therapy under a \\"vaccine\\" costume and TO THIS DAY has yet to admit the vaccine is 100% bullshit and deadly, even lying to us that he was completely manipulated and had NO idea (yeahhhh, right.)Anyone with a brain who's lived through multiple administrations can plainly see... despite all the campaigning bullshit the candidates spin endlessly.... nothing critical EVER changes. Clinton, Bush and Obama all just coincidentally waged the same wars against the same \\"axis of evil\\" - Iraq, Syria, Libya, Aghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Yemen, etc. Even mr. \\"no new wars!\\" Trump didn't utilize the power he had to immediately cease our drug smuggling or whatever the point of Afghanistan was. No one ever audits the Government's spending or dares even utter anything about the Federal Reserve or our debt-slavery economy. Trump threatened NATO and the UN so they'd cover their fair share..... and didn't utter a single peep about the creepy way we endlessly do Israel's bidding like a do-boy or. No President from either party ever bothers to look into why so many \\"public servants\\" on limited salaries somehow manage to increase their net worth 10-50x while \\"serving\\" in Congress or other high lvl positions. Shit, not a single peep about Epstein or all the psychotic, LITERAL EVIL, anti-humanity activities carried out in secret by our intelligence agencies, including regularly breaking the law to target Americans in America.this election was more one-sided, but if elections were 100% legit...why don't we EVER see a *true* landslide? How has California never voted 60/40 in favor of a Demonrat? Why doesn't Florida or Texas, red to the core, ever vote Republican 5 or 10 to 1? Just like polling for the last year.... they always seem to coincidentally wind up with merely 1-5 points difference... seriously? ALWAYS? EVERY. SINGLE. POLL? As the internet has taught us, many times people voting for a thing will hive-mind support the ironic or meme option in overwhelming numbers.... yet it never happens in US elections? Why haven't we had a dominating write-in victory by Ass-y McShitTits or something else 4chan-y? If any of this actually mattered, the elites ruling over us would NEVER even give us an opportunity to potentially throw them a curve ball. Out of the literal tens of millions of Americans that could end up running for President throughout America's history.... how does ONE family tree just magically happen to produce almost every single elected President...? Even more strange, the vast majority of (western) world leaders all just magically branch off the same family tree? So many of them literally groomed for their position of power since childhood.... I'm sure there's nothing to say that should be a statistical impossibility..Trump is sooooo \\"outside the system\\" and a \\"rogue populist\\" who does what the people want...! Like... pardon Julian Assange...? Or idk, even something so painfully obvious and simple like say.... firing Fauci when he was blatantly lying and propaghandizing ad-nausem during his daily covid pressers, while pushing a literal mRNA gene therapy that ALTERS YOUR DNA and was NEVER tested on human beings and in ALL animal testing, the shots had catastrophic results?Or idk.... you're only the PRESIDENT... I'm sure there's literally nothing Trump could have done to prevent tyrannical state leaders from using the full extent of their power to punish evil terroristic Americans for daring to *gasp* walk their dog outside, totally alone? THANKS FOR KILLING GRANDMA YOU SELFISH PRICK! Meanwhile those same tyrants were caught repeatedly literally laughing and making fun of us for obeying the same foolish rules they never followed. We knew exactly what covid was from the word GO - Alex Jones, love or hate him, literally gave the game plan before the first peep about \\"corona virus\\" appeared in America... and the pandemic followed that script to the letter.... at any point, if nothing else, Trump could have gotten in front of a live mic and explained the same things Alex Jones did, taken directly from the papers and speeches of the very same demons carrying out the pandemic. If you have to pick trash or garbage, I guess Trump is the best of the most terrible options.... but you're only foolin yourself if you think things will truly change or improve, he may take us down a different route... but you can bet your ass we'll end up in the exact same place Kamala or Biden or any other puppet will take us. Trump isn't going to tear apart the CIA or FBI down to the framework, he isn't going to thoroughly investigate our many corrupt politicans, he isn't going to 100% end Ukraine and Israel \\"aide\\" ASAP and he isn't going anywhere near our debt based banking system, the FED or the many shadowy wealthy dynasties that have controlled society from the shadows for literal centuries at this point.But hey!

A. They need to actually reconnect with the voting public. This is evident in a lot of places. Trump used propaganda yes, but it was really how spread out it was. His face was everywhere, he had rallies all the time. The people he wanted in office faces were everywhere. Media about him was literally everywhere. The Democratic Party, as much as it sickens me to say, should take a page out of that book. Send out things by mail to get your voters engaged. Hold events so that your people think their voices are heard. B. They need to get rid of the bad image that the Republicans have given them. Yes, a lot of people can say they changed how they were voting after Trump's last attempt, but it clearly didn't change enough people's minds. That combined with the smear campaign, our party leader being constantly seen as an aging relic and lackluster performances from our elected officials, has lead to a sort of bad image. They need to do more things to better their image and get people to think of them as a genuine second party again, instead of this bs \\"them vs. us\\" mindset that's been going on since 2012C. We need a strong party leader, and actual candidates. Kamala Harris did well in many respects, but the fact that her campaign was shorter then most ever are definitely did not help in this regard. We should not have put Biden up as a candidate this time around, or honestly the previous time. A little controversial, but double that for Hillary Clinton as well.D. Weak leadership. Our leaders need to grow a spine and fight back against all of this stuff that's been thrown at them. The Republican Party is strong because it is united, and it has leadership that is willing to fight with numbers to get what they want. The Democratic party has had a lot of infighting as of late, and does not put out a steady message. See Tim Walz saying the Electoral College needed to be disbanded, and then the campaign having him retract that statement ASAP.To continue on with point D, I think we need to take these next four years and strengthen and unite our party. Once we do that, we find someone who is a capable leader, and ready him or her to run for president. Make him or her the public face of the party so that the public recognizes them. do work to actually improve the middle class, and blue collar workers lives.

Not that they should be entitled and given what they want, etc, but that they've seemingly been caught between a (valid, but then overly generalized) indictment of toxic masculinity on the left, and an acceptance of said actual toxic masculinity on the right.Women's rights are absolutely crucial, and as the father of a daughter, I mourn what I'm seeing. At the same time, I think there is a degree to which the conversations have become exclusionary to young men, and that might even be valid in the abstract, but which has left them no place. The right wing manosphere welcomes them, and gains another convert.I don't think the answer is to give up on women's rights or to give these men more privileges, but I think there is a very real void of positive masculinity and a place for these young men on the left that let's them be both accepted and positive parts of groups. Unfortunately, the toxic version of these things are also easier, it's so much easier to be entitled and then to simply be angry when you don't get what you want, so I don't know what the answer really looks like here, but I think this is a key aspect of the right wing propaganda machine you're describing.To be sure, there are others (it's not all just young people nor men who get sucked in after all) but this seems like such a strong funnel.I have a son as well as a daughter, and I ponder and worry about this because I want to protect them both from these phenomena.","title":"Democrats feel 2016 all over again in Harris-Trump battle"},{"text":"If he does that for real, then Republican voters will shoot him themselves.

Secondly, we bring manufacturing back to America, where are we going to get the workers to work in these factories? People cant even stay af Amazon, theres an insane turn over rate, let alone make a T-Shirt. America is at 5% unemployment rate. America is not good at producing clothing and other cheaply made items. Look at Tesla as a great example, most of it is made and assembled by robots, not humans. Also 3 CEOs have already said theyre just going to pass the tariff cost onto the consumer and their competitors will do the same. Do you know how much an American made polo cost? $75. You can get that polo for less than $30 at some stores. Now polos all cost $65-70. So guess what happens? Hardly anyone buys polos because they cant afford it, then guess what the company does? They dont order anymore and manufacturing produces very few products because the demand is low. Manufacturing lays everyone off and so does the retail company. Congratulations youve brought back American manufacturing where nobody can afford the products and since nobody can afford it, nobody is buying it, and because nobody is buying it, they stop making it, since no product is being made people arent getting paid, people arent being paid, they arent spending money, no money is spent no economic circulation is happening, were in a recession. her economic plan would end America.You realize over 20 Nobel prize winning economists signed off on Harris plan. These people do analysis on the economy for a living and have won Nobel prizes for it. You think youre smarter than them?

It's not just that Kamala Harris is a woman.  Yes, there are eerie similarities to 2016, with both of his opponents being women and getting over 300 electoral votes both times.  But to say that the reasons for Trump winning both times being that the Democrats ran women is missing the fact that the electorate blamed Democrats (not the women that ran for the presidency) for the direction the country was going in.  Before we blame this on Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris, ask yourself what other Democrat would have won in 2016 and 2024, all other things being equal.  This is not much different from 2008, when voters blamed George W. Bush, and no Republican (even if John McCain picked a better running mate than Sarah Palin) would've won.  Quite frankly, the incumbent party is what was blamed all four times (2008, 2016, 2020, and 2024).Also, it wasn't just Kamala Harris that lost (or will soon officially lose). The Republicans mopped the floor in the Senate races.  This was a repudiation of Democrats overall.  The Democrats still do have a chance of narrowly winning control of the House (that's still up in the air), and that will be crucial.  But it still won't stop Trump and the Republicans from advancing their agenda via executive order and in the Senate (confirming judges and Supreme Court justices), it will only stop most legislation from being passed (at least without significant compromises from Republicans).The Democrats lost, quite frankly, because voters thought that the country is moving in the wrong direction.  It doesn't matter what the current inflation and economic numbers are, it's what voters perceived them to be.Hillary Clinton was criticized after the 2016 election for not campaigning enough in the most critical battleground states, and for making missteps during her campaign.  Kamala Harris was different on both counts, she made appearance after appearance in battleground states in the days leading up to Election Day, and made no major blunders in her campaign.  The results weren't any different.I proudly voted for Kamala Harris and am liberal in my politics.  I am despondent right now.  But I have to be fair and call it like it is.Finally, let's also not mince words: Trump may end up winning the popular vote, something I never thought was possible.  If he does, that means that literally, a majority of the voters preferred him.  That speaks volumes.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"Federally decriminalise marijuana","title":"Any ideas of what Bidens final moves will be? He has zero to lose now.

Most ICs are decent people and don't treat others wrongly. It's the hiring managers who should have to deal with this. So making everyone fill out some fake \\"how they helped the company's DEI goals\\" every performance review is absurd. Not to mention many companies are giving bonuses to managers for hiring women over men. The way to fix any perceived imbalance is to get more women in STEM classes, not give leniency in skills or amount of work performed for one set of the population.Plus look at trying to get a job as a fresh grad these days. Apply to 200 places and nothing, while companies give out as many jobs as possible to H1Bs that they can deport if they don't do as told. And then companies lie about looking for local candidates first. And in tech companies Asians now dominate and are the majority, not the minority. Asian managers hiring *only* Asians. that's not diversity and an insult to the local population. Our immigration laws need reform as they only benefit corporations, not citizens. Canada is just as fed up with the drastic influx they can't really deal with in a fair manner for everyone. And Canada is the H1B loophole to import more than the quotas allow in the US. Then, Asian companies are setup to lie and cheat on resumes to foster this industry of ever increasing imported labor.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"We know bro Ooooo youre so woke Let people talk about the election because it has real life consequences.

Let me laugh harder.shes worked as an attorney general and U.S. SenatorAnd performed unreasonably terribly in both. Which disqualifies her.Her policy document was over 80 pages meanwhile Donald Trump was 14 pages long.That means nothing.Donald Trump [...] thinks tariffs will actually fix AmericaIt's a start. Outsourcing our production was a devastating blow to our economy and self-sufficiency. Like it or not, but there is no such thing as fair competition with literal slavery such as China.[tariffs] will put most Americans into an economic hardship and America as a whole into a recession if he imposes tariffsSome prices will rise, yes. But bringing productivity back here is a massive boon that will outweigh that cost in time.We are already in a recession.Theyve looked at Donald Trumps inherited net worth and ultimately determined he wouldve been richer if he just put his money into an index fund instead of trying to go into business, so hes a horrible businessmanCan't jump straight to that conclusion, unfortunately. Business regulations are utterly absurd and obscenely expensive.Also, how many jobs would he have created if he simply invested it? The guy single-handedly shifted industries. Would you prefer that for president or a stock hoarder?[Trump] wants to give police qualified immunity so they can shoot at you if they feel even slightly scared.They already have qualified immunity and no he doesn't want what you claim.Yet people still voted for him.Turns out most people aren't terminally online redditors. Surprise!Donald Trump has been in politics for 4 years and Kamala has been doing it for almost 15 years.If you consider failure experience.If Kamala Harris was a man, she most definitely wouldve gotten more votes.She wouldn't be there if she were a man. Biden very publicly announced that his VP would be a woman long before choosing one. She's literally a diversity hire.Id say a fair amount of men dont want a women leading their country.Women rarely lead anything successfully.Theyd rather vote for a convicted felon than a woman with a real economic plan.Better a convicted felon than an unconvicted felon.Also, did you even *read* her economic plan? It would unironically end America.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"Correct. The more shitty people's lives are, the more they want governmental change and the more they cling to extremes. This election both came together. Plus, the democratic campaign felt like it was mainly \\"on the internet\\" while the republican campaign seemed to be \\"out there, in reality.\\"It's ironic that life basically got more shitty every year since the 1980s and that the president obviously has no power to change that.In the 80s my father was a welder and my mother was a housewife. With three children, we had a big ass house, two cars and two big vacations a year. Today, me and my wife both are college educated and we have a much smaller house with a mortgage, one car that's still not paid in full, no kids and one small vacation per year. This trend will never change, no matter who is president. Yet, people will countinue to vote for change and extremes. Short of a bloody revolution, there is nothing else to do, so I don't even blame them. Four more years of democrats wouldn't have made life better, just like the next four years of Trump won't.

The party is also weak in comparison to Maga's ruthlessness. Now this doesn't mean copy Maga, heck no. But we are the \\"nice\\" party now.

And this election, trump made big gains with the minority vote but lost a share of the white vote.Fact is, the messaging of \\"the police are dangerous and corrupt, and they won't help you\\" that's associated with the DNC now(regardless of it's prominence as a talking point) is diametrically opposed with the forward talking point of magazine capacity limits and rifle bans that don't restrict the police from owning such firearms.A voter who believes that the police aren't there to help will not be warm to the idea that the police should have more power to restrict how said voter can protect themselves. And among minority communities, the belief that the police aren't going to help them is stronger than any other group.It sounds harsh, but spending massive amounts of political capital on banning AR-15s because they kill about 400 people a year on average is extremely unproductive. Especially in the context outlined above.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"I am not too concerned about the flouride or vaccines beyond the trends we're already seeing of reduction in childhood vaccination (which to be clear is very bad, but I don't expect like a ban on smallpox vaccines or something that stupid)I'm also not that concerned about the \\"end of public education\\", because as shit as it is the federal government is usually a small fraction of education funding (8-12%). States that want to resist will probably be able to do so, states that don't are already going the way Trump will want them to go anyway. I expect **rampant inflation** from policies like tariffs, deportations, threats to the federal reserve, etc. I legit fear if the worst idiots end up in charge the end goal is to intently trash the economy so hard they can peg the dollar to crypto. If the Fed is allowed to operate normally, which is the best case scenario, there will be a massive recession because they to have to hike interest rates. Gaza is **fucked**, I hope the Uncommitted Movement is happy because they're getting their genocide. I wouldn't be surprised if it starts before Trump even takes office. Ukraine might cling on depending on what Republicans in Congress do, but they are in deep trouble. I doubt there will be a rise in a Chinese world order though, I think their economy will collapse as the US economy falters. I fear they will make neighbors a scapegoat and start a hot war. The ACA is getting cut down. They've promised that for too long, if Republicans fail to gut it it's too much failure to deliver on their promises.I wonder about student loan borrowers. The SAVE plan is dead, but I have to wonder if the lawsuits pushing to end all loan repayment plans will prevail. If people suddenly have to pay more on loans, that will be political poison for Trump and Republicans so they may back off.I think the people who will be hurt the most will be blue collar workers in red states, farmers, seniors on social security, and gig/transient workers everywhere. However, I do expect political retribution against states like California and substantial financial burden on the states that give up federal funds to resist Trump policies, so it's not like people in blue states will be hunky dory.As for \\"the end of democracy\\" and dismantling the federal government, I have to hope that Trump won't care once he's pardoned himself of any past or future crime.","title":"2025 Predictions"},{"text":"It's over","title":"Alsobrooks Wins Maryland Senate Race; Democrats Hold Seat"},{"text":"Actually even with all that, she could have won seeing how close the race in PA was.

Moderate on social issues like DEI, pronouns, etc. Dont abandon trans people or immigrants but take more moderate stances.

Remember, this is the GOP thst argued against real-time fact checking in debates. So what ends up happening is that the Republicans isolate and indoctrinate a large portion of the population, democratic political leaders are too afraid to do anything that brings consequences because they fear the backlash from the right media machine (which only emboldens and makes the right media stronger), and then the democratic base gets frustrated and contributes to the division by taking out their frustrations on both Republican politicians and voters. The number of times people have mentioned Republican voters as morons or uneducated tonight is off the charts.  That was not the response to take. As for fixing it, there's no fixing it. The Republican long game has completely come to fruition with the sweep that happened tonight and it's the tipping point of no return. Remember when Trump had officers fire rubber bullets on BLM protesters so he could have some faux religious photo op? Get ready for that with every protest as soon as he's in office and fully expect real bullets to replace the rubber ones before his first year in office is over. The best option is to get yourself to a blue state in the short term and look at getting out long term before the full transition to the autocracy is complete.","title":"I think its over: Democrats despair as Trump runs up the score in battlegrounds - Some members of Harris campaign began bracing for defeat."},{"text":"Im honestly sick of both parties.

To directly answer your CMV though, that simply isnt in character for US democrats. They are far more likely to blame the morality of their opposition than anything else.As for me personally, I believe that most likely Trumps victory is based on a combination of inflation and people tuning out information about the candidates (which in fairness is probably great for their mental health).

I believe that Trump is a fascist and, in light of this, that the Democratic party had a duty to run an intelligent campaign. They did not, because the Democratic party cares more about positioning itself as moderate than it does actually beating Fascists. Similarly, the party has demonstrated that they find supporting Israel more important than winning the Arab-American vote. There is a tendency on Reddit to blame voters for staying home.

In 2020 they ran Kamala and hyped her up as much as they could through their connections in the media. Americans darling. Everyone hated her She dropped out without winning a thing. But have no fear. The Democrat establishment still loved her and thats all that matters. So they made her VP. And they kept her hidden for most of those 4 years because they had a plan. They knew Joe couldnt do another 4 but they also knew they had to protect their beloved Harris.  So even though Joe couldnt barely stand without help, they made it seem as if he was going to run again. So they cancelled the primaries. They cancelled the Dem debates. Then they scheduled an early debate with Donnie? What! That hadnt happened since Eisenhower. Oh right. They wanted to show the American people that Joe was a mess. And that was the plan all along. Because they couldnt trust the American people to vote for THEIR candidate. So they made her the ONLY candidate! So very democratic for the party saving democracy But they couldnt have her in the primaries going up against populist candidates that would expose her the same way Tulsi demolished her in 2020. This was Mamala and she needed to be protected. How else would they be able to move her further right than any other Democrat in history? Pro fracking. Yup!\\nGenocide?

The Dems in charge picked an unlikable candidate, they didnt allow her to and she refused to address any of the issues the voters were facing. And she lost. She lost and the Dems lost because America doesnt take kindly to having candidates appointed and forgetting the things that are importantFree speech Affordable healthcare Affordable living expenses (that isnt tied to a fucking genocide)No endless warsMy body my choice. That applies to everything. Attacking the climate crisis (spoiler alert: embracing fracking voids this contract)Its so fucking obvious and yet they act so dumb But then again, the Dem establishment is set to make a SHIT TON of money being the opposition party for another 4 years.

I don't want people in camps.If we come to find out that Latino people were a key part of Trump's victory there will naturally be a desire to tell them they fucked around and are going to find out.But if our response to people being mass deported is to shrug then the fascists win. To the extent it turns out to be true that Latino people voted against their own interests we should forgive them and show concern for their well-being.  If the worst case comes to pass and Latino communities are getting ripped apart and people are being crowded into camps and sent to countries they haven't been in or over a decade they will already be punished. We need to recommit to our principles and use this as an opportunity to demonstrate the importance of those principles.

But unless Biden had dropped out in 2023, can't see how there would have been much of a primary. The last time the Democrats had an actual competitive primary was 2008.Whatever the reasons, this loss was monumental and historic. * Harris is going to lose the popular vote, and by a lot. Hillary won it in 2016. People may just have felt like they didn't know Harris.* The last time the Democrat lost the popular vote was 20 years ago, when Bush ran on 9/11 and two wars that people (at the time) were supporting. A wartime president is never unseated, and Bush won 50.7%. Trump is on pace to have the biggest popular vote percentage win for the Republicans since Ronald Reagan in 1984. (Still won't touch Reagan's 58.8%.)* Trump seems to have gained big with Black men, Hispanic men, white women, three groups that came out for Biden four years ago. Trump is getting 30% of the vote *in the Bronx.* That hasn't happened for an (R) since Reagan as well, 40 years ago.* Trump voters say their #1 issue was the economy. 70% said their #1 issue was either that or immigration. With abortion being at 7%.* Harris voters said that their #1 issue was the \\"state of democracy\\" at 58%. What is that? Abortion was second, at 22%, but American elections are *always* about the economy. Only 12% of Harris voters said that the economy was their #1 issue. This seems to have been a huge problem. It's one thing to motivate your base by pointing out that your opponent doesn't seem to like or defend (or understand) democracy. But to not make the case to the rest of the country that he'll be shit for the economy, and you'll cut their taxes?* Swing state voters had a 60% disapproval rating for Biden. Harris couldn't overcome that. * When Democrats don't have an incumbent, they have only won twice, both times (1992, 2008) on the economy. Kerry didn't run on it in 2004, and Hillary didn't run on it in 2016. * There's never been someone running on a four-year-old record, this was the first time. Trump benefited from people remembering how much cheaper milk was four years ago. Which most Americans don't seem to realize is not personally something the president decides.Now we have an 80-year old senile agent of chaos, who can't run again, but who could also die, with the poison pill Vance to keep anyone from invoking the 25th.

I agree, Democrats liked to talk about the strength of the macro economy (GPD, DOW, etc.) but the reality is that the micro economy (buying power, general prices) generally sucked for many of Americans. People vote on their wallets and not that the GPD is up because they don't *feel* that.2. I agree and I definitely underestimated the impact of the young male vote. But looking back, it's not that young men went overwhelmingly to Trump, it's that I know Harris didn't do a single thing to appeal to that group.3. This is a really interesting perspective on minorities and makes sense. Black presidential candidates don't automatically get the black vote. A woman candidate doesn't automatically get the woman vote. And I do think Harris' campaign ran very reactively on immigration. Instead of platforming strong immigration policies, they eventual fell back on bashing Trump's mass deportation plan. Which, say what you will about mass deportation, his supporters will see that as at least a plan where Harris had no plan except to reintroduce a the border bill. Which, on that, I'll say 99% of American voters don't know how bills work so when you say you're just going to introduce a bill on immigration, that doesn't feel like it does anything at all.4. I saw a lot of people bashing Harris for essentially \\"doing nothing in the 4 years she was in office\\". Which I think is unfair because it's not like people are out there parading what Pence did during Trump's presidency. But it was a rhetoric the GOP went with and I think it actually dug in pretty deep and worked against Harris' favor. She was seen as the appointed candidate with no primary tied to a current president that people are iffy on and people are wildly unimpressed with her track record.And maybe I should've seen this coming. Sure, she surged in approval and enthusiasm, but before being appointed to the presidential nominee, her approval rating was disastrously low. Many people did not like her and perhaps it was naive from the very start to assume that was somehow magically going to change once \\"America was introduced to her.\\"","title":"Early Reaction: Why did Kamala lose?"},{"text":"That's right.

Harris doesn't have any extreme opinions - she is overall extremely unremarkable. So, why was it that everyone views her like this? Her sex is a reasonable possibility, as female figures tend to be disproportionately viewed as \\"extreme\\" for the same actions male figures do. See any media discussion around even remotely grey female characters. Additionally, one could argue that running to be the first female (and first black female) president could be considered a revolutionary (read: extreme) action all on it's own. Finally, there could be voters who refuse to vote based on \\"identity\\" and so they vote Trump as an over-correction. Obviously, being a woman also has advantages, as many voters (especially female voters) will feel inclined to vote for her because of it. I'd even say that overall being a woman helped Harris more than it harmed her. But I'd also argue that it's at least distinctly possible that her sex influenced people's opinion of her in a negative enough way to loose the election.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"How come all of the Biden voters didnt vote for Kamala this time??","title":"Kamala Harris a sore loser?
