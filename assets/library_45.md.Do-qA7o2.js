And apart from a short stint between WW2 and the 1980s - where people realized that might not be a good way to run a society because look what happened to Germany - it's always been this way.Add in record income inequality doggedly perused by GOP policies for decades, and people are not just open to misinformation but crave it like plants crave Brawndo.To say \\"oh it's because of Elon Musk\\" is dangerous because it ignores the major underlying structural issues which are the primary drivers, but it also erroneously suggests that the problem would be solved by attacking or removing Musk.

Temperance, although often overlooked today, was an enormously popular and influential reform movement during this time. Connections between women organizing for temperance and for suffrage can be found throughout various Manuscript Division collections.Temperance followers advocated abstinence from alcohol, but also learned much about organizing for a cause through their advocacy efforts. For example, women gained important experience in public speaking, including future suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony, who gave her first public speech at a Daughters of Temperance meeting in 1849. Moral suasion was the main tactic used during the antebellum years as temperance organizers attempted to persuade potential adherents to abstain from alcohol based on individual virtue and self-discipline, including by signing temperance pledges. By the 1850s temperance became more of a political issue as the movement turned toward legislative measures, much like the womens rights and womens suffrage movements. But in the case of temperance, legislation focused on combatting the sale and distribution of alcohol.","title":"Fox News host confronts Mike Johnson with GOP demand for Matt Gaetz report"},{"text":"Yeeaahh, *thats* the problem with trumps cabinet picks ??","title":"Trump's Cabinet is on Track to Be the Least Diverse This Century"},{"text":" Pretty sure the only tenet of the modern conservatives is \\"own the libs\\".

The new approvals cover Ivanka-branded fashion gear including sunglasses, handbags, shoes and jewelry, as well as beauty services and voting machines.The approvals came three months after Ivanka Trump announced she was dissolving her namesake brand to focus on government work.China also granted provisional approval for two Trump trademarks to DTTM Operations LLC, headquartered at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York. They cover branded restaurant, bar and hotel services, as well as clothing and shoes.The marks will be finalized if there is no objection during a 90-day comment period.All the trademarks were applied for in 2016.These trademarks were sought to broadly protect Ms. Trumps name, and to prevent others from stealing her name and using it to sell their products, Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ivanka Trumps ethics attorney, said in an email. This is a common trademark practice, which is why the trademark applications were granted.Both the president and his daughter have substantial intellectual property holdings in China. Critics worry that China, where the courts and bureaucracy are designed to reflect the will of the ruling Communist Party, could exploit those valuable rights for political leverage.There has also been concern that the Trump familys global intellectual property portfolio lays the groundwork for the president and his daughter, who serves as a White House adviser, to profit from their global brands as soon as they leave office.Ivanka receives preliminary approval for these new Chinese trademarks while her father continues to wage a trade war with China. Since she has retained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether President Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his familys businesses, wrote Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group that first published the news about Ivanka Trump brands new Chinese trademarks.Lawyers for Donald Trump in Beijing declined to comment.Companies register trademarks for a variety of reasons. They can be a sign of corporate ambition, but many companies also file defensively, particularly in China, where trademark squatting is rampant. Trademarks are classified by category and may include items that a brand does not intend to market. Some trademark lawyers also advise clients to register trademarks for merchandise made in China, even if its not sold there.China has said it handles all trademark applications equally under the law.","title":"6 years ago, Ivanka Trump sold voting machine \\"patents\\" to China, looks extremely suspicious now."},{"text":"So do income taxes.

Tariffs are distortionary on the economy and in the beginning/middle of the supply chain. Income tax is an end source tax, taxing individual gains once the (hopefully as open as possible) economy has been able to generate as much wealth as possible.Honestly, if like 1% of economists said the personal income tax was sort of okay, theyd still favor it over tariffs. Free trade is the way to a freer society. Tariffs are antithetical to that economic truth and libertarian supported ideal. I realize personal income tax isnt beloved by libertarians, but since that isnt going anywhere the focus should be making sure the tax system fucks with the economy as little as possible. Im not sure what the ideal ranking system of taxes is but tariffs are hot garbage and are near the bottom.","title":"Republicans are pussies"},{"text":"It was founded on eugenics and genocide.

TELL ME WHAT LEFT!!*Google and Wikipedia exist! How are people *still* making serious arguments about the US democrats or Canadian Liberals are anything near Left?

No word is said more but understood less by both speakers or audience.

Using Massachusetts as an example is a good one because yes, they do criminalize sodomy. Not just the gay kind, but all of it. Consensual oral sex between a husband and wife? That would be illegal. But why? Well, because a puritan in 1641 enacted the first set of laws in New England and among them was outlawing \\"any unnatural and lascivious act with another person\\" in addition to \\"abominable and detestable crime against nature\\". Notably, this is well over 100 years before the United States existed. So why does the law *still* exist? Well, it doesn't. I mean, technically it does; it's on the books after all. So if Lawrence falls Sodomy is illegal in Mass right? No, not at all, because Ward's anti-sodomy law was overruled in 1974 by *Commonwealth v. Balthazar*. Massachusetts has slowly repealed outdated laws on fornication, abortion, and adultery but they haven't been successful doing so for anal and oral sex. But it's not pressing because the laws are already off the books. If I had to guess, Michigan probably has a similar deal going on.

It's worth noting however, that the United States has provided Israel with over $200 billion in military funding alone since it's inception. That speaks pretty highly to how all presidents, including Trump, have approached the military industrial complex in the region. If you think that is changing in this new Trump administration, you're lying to yourself. You may not consider that funding foreign tyranny, but there are millions of oppressed Palestinians that would disagree with you.If Tariffs aren't used correctly, the ultimate result will be a negative impact on the middle-class and below. If we increase tariffs, but continue to use that money to fund foreign wars instead of investing more heavily in domestic interests, we likely will see increases to consumer prices. Admittedly, this is more speculative, and it will take years to truly reveal the impact, but the point I was trying to make, is that Trump has no more of a plan to end inflation than Harris did. I wasn't even trying to be partisan, everything I've read said that plans from both the major parties to reduce inflation were likely to fail.Here's a source to reassure you about my truthfulness:[https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts)On a more personal note, you seem to personify the kind of \\"libertarian\\" I was referring to. I see the cabinet appointments Trump's making, and the loose promises that are floating around making it seem like we might be headed in a more libertarian direction, and it gets me intrigued. Unfortunately, I am quickly brought back to the reality of the situation we are in. We elected a billionaire, who is bringing his billionaire cronies into positions of great influence. To add to that, the billionaire in charge is a convicted felonious liar. I will not believe anything until I see these systems actually making a positive impact. The problem is, it will probably take decades to straighten itself out, and we get to risk electing someone who will roll it all back every 4 years. Call me cynical, but I have not been given reason to have faith in this political system as it stands.","title":"Republicans are pussies"},{"text":"County jails are not for convicted felons.

Carr previously served as the agency's general counsel and as an aide to FCC commissioner Ajit Pai. Carr supports changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and opposes net neutrality protections. He has been a supporter of Elon Musk's efforts to win subsidies for broadband internet service and criticized NBC for letting Vice President Kamala Harris appear on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" just before the election. Carr [has accused] Adam Schiff of overseeing a secret and partisan surveillance machine. Carr publicly accused social media platforms of being biased against the Trump reelection campaign. During an on-air interview with Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox News, Carr stated that \\"Since the 2016 election, the far left has hopped from hoax to hoax to hoax to explain how it lost to President Trump at the ballot box.\\" In 2021, Carr criticized the Biden administration's proposal for $100 billion in new broadband deployment as part of the original American Jobs Plan proposal.Carr has been pretty vocal about the Biden administretions efforts to make broadband Internet a more accessible service for Americans, calling it \\"administrative regulatory overreach.\\"When Elon Musk was criticized for denying Ukraine extended Starlink satellite coverage because he believed that Russia would launch an attack against the U.S. in response, Carr came to Musk's defense, claiming that there was an \\"effort to weaponize the government against Musk,\\" and that it was \\"part of a clear and repeating pattern of regulatory harassment that accelerated the moment Elon Musk stood up for free speech.\\"","title":"Trump just chose Brendan Carr for FCC chief - he won't uphold Net Neutrality"},{"text":"Its okay girl were not on dating apps.

Well, you're about to find out why Trump chose him... In 2023, Carr authored the chapter on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 book, Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise. Carr previously served as the agency's general counsel and as an aide to FCC commissioner Ajit Pai. Carr supports changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and opposes net neutrality protections. He has been a supporter of Elon Musk's efforts to win subsidies for broadband internet service and criticized NBC for letting Vice President Kamala Harris appear on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" just before the election. Carr [has accused] Adam Schiff of overseeing a secret and partisan surveillance machine. Carr publicly accused social media platforms of being biased against the Trump reelection campaign. During an on-air interview with Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox News, Carr stated that \\"Since the 2016 election, the far left has hopped from hoax to hoax to hoax to explain how it lost to President Trump at the ballot box.\\" In 2021, Carr criticized the Biden administration's proposal for $100 billion in new broadband deployment as part of the original American Jobs Plan proposal.Carr has been pretty vocal about the Biden administretions efforts to make broadband Internet a more accessible service for Americans, calling it \\"administrative regulatory overreach.\\"He expressed apprehension to support \\"caps\\" on \\"phone &amp; Video Call Rates for Incarcerated Persons &amp; Their Families\\" I was concerned that this item could lead to negative unintended consequences, particularly for public safety. As the item itself acknowledges, at least some IPCS providers will likely lose money for every call made under the new rules. It is in nobodys interest for these providers to exit the market, or for smaller facilities to go unserved because the economics no longer make sense...When Elon Musk was criticized for denying Ukraine extended Starlink satellite coverage because he believed that Russia would launch an attack against the U.S. in response, Carr came to Musk's defense, claiming that there was an \\"effort to weaponize the government against Musk,\\" and that it was \\"part of a clear and repeating pattern of regulatory harassment that accelerated the moment Elon Musk stood up for free speech.\\"","title":"Trump taps Brendan Carr for chairman of the Federal Communications Commission"},{"text":"If the shoe fits...","title":"\\"Makes us look like Nazis\\": Trump allies asked to stop talking about mass deportation \\"camps\\" | \\nThe president-elect's advisers worry about how the word \\"camp\\" plays as they plot mass deportation schemes"},{"text":"The rules dont apply to them.

In Chapter 28, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr writes that the FCC chairman is empowered with significant authority that is not shared with other FCC members. Under a new chairman, he writes, [t]he FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals: [r]eining in Big Tech; [p]romoting national security; [u]nleashing economic prosperity; and [e]nsuring FCC accountability\\nand good governance. The FCC, writes Carr, has an important role to play in addressing the threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market. Nowhere is that clearer than when it comes to Big Tech and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square. Carr writes that the FCC should require more transparency from Big Tech, which today offers a black box. And it should issue an order that interprets Section 230 which provides protection from legal liability to online computer services that? moderate content in good faithin a way that eliminates the expansive, non-textual immunities that courts have read into the statute. In addition to taking unilateral action, Carr says, the FCC should work with Congress on legislative changes to ensure that Internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections.","title":"Project 2025?

Both Trump and Biden pumped tons of cash into the economy to keep it stable. That caused high inflation. It was caused by both sides knowing it would spike inflation, but that was seen as a better alternative than to allow the economy to just utterly crash. To blame Biden for the pandemic inflation spike is insane. The Biden administration wiped out the pandemic spike. Are you seriously saying that Trumps or any other administration would have brought it under control any faster?Violent crime. Which year are you using for Trumps last non-Covid year?  Because if you want to compare apples to apples and want to look at 2021,2022, you should look at 2017,2018. But I am going to guess you are using 2019. Your source doesnt match up with your claims. You say there was a jump of 1.1 million violent crimes in 2021 and 2022, but your source shows 800,000 and 600,000. Or in values not skewed by population increases, 21.0/100,000 to 23.5/100,000 and 22.5/100,000. How does a shift from 21.0 to 23.5 or 22.5 equal a 30% increase?If you actually look at the whole chart that goes back to the 1990s where the violent crime rates were up at 80/100,000 (yes, about four times where they are now), you will see that 2018 (which you ignore) has rates right around 2021-2022. Strange that you would ignore that year under Trump. But, the current rates are hysterically called out of control when they are really lower than any time before 2009. Magnitudes lower than 2000. So how do we fearmonger it?  Compare historical lows to a slightly lower historical low. Because that is an honest way to look at it. How does Bidens insane peak compare to other peaks of the last 30 years on that report?Global military conflict?  Please support that and show how it is related to the United States Presidential administrations. Illegal immigration?  Please show me some good data. One of the biggest problems is in how the border patrol changed how they defined encounters in 2020 to include not just apprehensions, but people deemed inadmissible at legal border crossings and turned away as well as expulsions due to Covid 19 health risks. Those changes massively change the numbers. And sadly, those are the most often used numbers to talk about illegal immigration.   Add to that, the fact that most illegal immigrants are crossing the border for work, and if you look at historical crossings, they tend to ebb and flow with how the US economy is doing relative to the countries people are coming from. As we seem to refuse to crack down on companies hiring illegal immigrants, we are doing nothing to cut down on the demand for illegal labor. So the supply will surge as our economy does better. If we took how we currently deal with immigration and applied it to the drug war, we would make the manufacture and sale of illegal drugs to be legal, but to keep keep just the consumption of those drugs as illegal.  Totalitarianism and the trampling of rights?  Ok, now you must be joking.","title":"Trump defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth denies sexual assault allegation, acknowledges payment to accuser"},{"text":"Nothing good is going to happen next 4 years, every single day, every single month your life will get worse.","title":"Trump just chose Brendan Carr for FCC chief - he won't uphold Net Neutrality"},{"text":"Ease rules?

A socialist would also make a greater push toward universal healthcare, which she hasn't made any big pushes to do as president.Trump's biggest two claims to libertarian fame are a) the tax cuts he did the first time around as president and b) DOGE, which we have no promise will actually do anything it claims it will do, because it has no real power. Everything else Trump promises to do is worlds more authoritarian than Kamala could dream of. A Trump presidency is tariffs and bump stock bans and ICE being the biggest pain-in-the-ass 3 letter agency in the nation.

People are reactionary, and if the nation is a mess in 2028, we'll see Democrats voted in. In fact, I think that's actually pretty likely: Many of the actions that people voted for--tariffs, removing immigrants en masse, getting rid of entire agencies, reworking social security--will be incredibly unpopular, and will very likely cause a dramatic increase in inflation. Should inflation occur, or SS be affected, or people lose family and friends to draconian immigration efforts, many of the Trump faithful will blame it on Biden, but many will see Trump in office and blame him. Trump has an impenetrable knot of supporters, but the GOP does not. From that point of view, and Democratic president in 2028 might even seem likely. Plus--we don't really know how much of the the GOP's success lately is due to people loving their policies vs. people loving Trump. He is--and I say this as someone who deeply loathes him--a once-a-generation talent. What Obama was in 2008, Trump has been since 2016. He has kept the GOP alive and broadened it--but it may be wishful thinking to assume the GOP will retain its popularity after he's gone, because there just isn't anyone that generates the same excitement among conservatives. They like DeSantis, but he's a wet blanket; Vivek is Indian and while that may not matter to majority of conservatives, there are plenty who would care about that, and care about it a lot; Vance is not a terrible politician, but has been \\"meh-ing upward\\" at a faster rate than any other candidate I've ever seen; Trump's sons are wackjobs and don't have his \\"charm.\\" Think of all the Republicans on the scene now, and ask yourself if you can see pickup trucks flying that person's flag--for me, it's hard to imagine a parade with \\"VIVEK\\" or \\"RON\\" flags blowing in the breeze. I think the Democrats have TREMENDOUS challenges ahead them, with their media problem being the biggest. The legacy media is weaker than it's been in a century, and they can't control the narrative in the new media landscape, or counter the misinformation that the GOP can spew at unbelievable rates. But to say that all this means the GOP will be power for the next three presidential cycles--I have a pretty bleak outlook on the future, and even I don't see it that way. Pre-edit, where I'll disagree with myself slightly: if the GOP uses the next four and figures out a way to demolish the vote and run an election that is \\"free and fair\\" in name only--and I absolutely wouldn't put it past them, seeing as they had a practice round in 2020--then yeah, maybe, I can absolutely see that playing out, where we get more Republicans elected.","title":"CMV: Republicans will continue to win both the Presidency and Senate continually till 2036."},{"text":"I feel awful for Joe.

Ukraine is getting military aid from all over the western world, and the technology way better than Russia's This is a huge boost.\\n5.

Also remember that   Ukraine was restrained from targeting Russian inland with those missilesThe comment below talks about Russia not using their full capacity but that's not true either.
