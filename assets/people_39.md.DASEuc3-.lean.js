Maybe there could be a primary and Harris, a woman of color, could have a shot of winning.

It will be rockier.Well, no shit. Anyone who has been paying attention understands that, this time around, Trump will be filling his cabinet, and consequently, most staffed levels of government, with loyalists and sycophants who are either unflinchingly committed to every single one of Trump's whims, or are there to use him for whatever self serving end.Trump's last administration already tried to implement one of Project 2025's major policy proposals, schedule F. This, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities granted to the president, will give the Trump administration the power to dismantle government agencies, fire countless staff, eliminate the independence of these agencies, while putting them under the direct control of the executive, then filling whatever roles are left with pre vetted and trained Trump cronies, corporate stooges, and far right fanatics.This will lead to what some have already called, a \\"crisis of incompetence\\" at every level of government.What this agenda does, is it basically hamstrings the separation of powers and affords Trump and his admin the power to install loyalists into positions of authority that were previously reserved for non-partisan, knowledgeable, professionals and experts in their field.These were positions that were formerly staffed, not appointed. But Trump will be given the power to change that.What's more, Trump will have the power, or at least believes he'll have the power to create new agencies tasked with carrying out an outlandish, and likely anti-democratic agenda. Think \\"DOGE\\" secretary Elon Musk.This is on top of the obvious moves Trump will make to appoint people who have shown their undying commitment to him, into secretary and leadership positionsThere will be few to no guardrails, little checks and balances, and power will undoubtedly be abused.Trump has also made it clear, that when all is said and done, he will exploit his position as king to use the power of some of these agencies to seek retribution against his political opponents, his naysayers in the media, former staff who have spoken out against him, so called \\"fake news\\" journalists, anyone who has attempted to hold him accountable in the past, as well as anyone who he believes was involved in stealing the 2020 election from him.This is not some 'blueanon\\" conspiracy, it's not some exaggeration, if you have been paying attention at all, you'd know that Trump and his allies have been pushing for these things throughout his campaign. It's not a matter of whether this is an exaggeration, it's a matter of when Trump follows through, or in the less likely scenario, *if* he has the unchecked authority to carry out his threats. Again, the Trump campaign has brazenly communicated these goals, it's not a question of if this is real, it's a question of if they'll be able to pull it off","title":"I Quit the First Trump Administration in Protest.

There isnt a clear cut way. Whether its done through a build up in ICE or a mobilization of the national guard, the question will always be of manpower. The vast majority of illegal inmigrante should be deported back to their country of origin. I think exceptions could be made for some who have been here for a particularly long time. Anyone of particularly dubious origin (terrorist linked) thats crossed in the last few years or beyond should definitely be at the top of the list of those returned home. 2. Im not an economist, so it would be foolish of me to play the percentage game. I think its important to foster positive trade relationships with long term allies, but to apply tariffs harshly to countries that are double dealing against our global interest.3. Im all for a robust medical system, but the overhead and bloat thats prevalent throughout our federal government needs trimming. Cutting sections of the FDA doesnt inherently mean a lowering in standards. In fact, I think most Trump voters expect a freeing up of resources to explore experimental medicines i.e CRISPR.4. Not sure, not every candidate is going to match my desires entirely. I hope that our system is so that medical debt isnt a possibility. Im not heartless, this just isnt an issue I consider to be on the top of any Republicans mind right now.5. Id like him as an advisor, and I highly doubt hed accept an official federal role even if offered. However, if youre convinced he will make his way into a full time federal position, buy puts on TSLA.6. Just withdraw from NATO and rely on forming individual treaties and alliances with countries that deal with us fairly. This doesnt mean I completely support isolationism, but Russia isnt the global threat we thought it could be. Granted, China is untested, but the games they play seem to be wholly different. 7. Nobody will like my answer for this, but honestly, the best outcome is for both sides to lose. I dont support Hamas, and I dont support a genocide of the Palestinian people. If we have to pick a lane then well pick it, but this isnt an issue I voted by. 8. Well, it depends on your definition of totally. We need to keep lanes open for shipping naturally, and I dont have a problem with legal immigrants from any nation making their way here. However, the incompetence of the current administration in handling the border means that serious, temporary measures should be considered.Now, I do think its important to note, that most of these issues arent really what I decided my vote by.

This includes a significant rebound from the pandemic, with employment levels now about 6.3 million higher than pre-pandemic levels2.\\n- **Trump Administration**: During Trump's tenure, the economy experienced job growth until the pandemic hit in 2020. Excluding the pandemic year, the job growth rate was slower compared to Biden's first three years1. Trump left office with about 3 million fewer jobs than when he started, largely due to the pandemic?. Unemployment Rate\\n- **Biden-Harris Administration**: The unemployment rate has decreased from **6.4%** at the start of Biden's term to **4.1%** as of September 20243. This marks a significant recovery from the pandemic-induced spike.\\n- **Trump Administration**: Before the pandemic, the unemployment rate had fallen to a low of **3.5%** in late 2019?. However, the pandemic caused a sharp increase in unemployment, which was still high when Trump left office.Overall, while both administrations faced unique challenges, the Biden-Harris administration has seen a faster recovery in job growth and a steady decrease in unemployment rates post-pandemic.

The media weve known forever is dying. Alternative news and media are rapidly rising. Democrats have virtually zero presence online as there are no Joe Rogans on the center nor left. COVID lockdowns were too much. Pandering and expecting minorities to always turn out finally cracked. Alienating men, especially young, in order to not appear participating in patriarchy or zero-sum identity politics has failed for a decade. Focusing on women and minorities with weak policies failed.Apparently mothers of young boys are scared for their sons. They know their sons wont do well, wont find a partner, and most likely wont have a family. Women tend to date economically horizontal or upwards, rarely downward. Women still expect men to provide despite the wage differential beginning to flip as women dominate more professional jobs. This election was a rebuke on the Democratic Party against family-oriented policies at the hands of republicans. You may think that everyone believes that we dont need families in America but that is the core of the countrys entire foundation. Womens rise is great, but if we leave men destitute to suicide, drugs, and angry, we will lose every election. Women love their sons and want them to find a family and provide for them with a great job and education.Do you remember when some social progressives were saying that standardized tests and SAT/ACT were racist to do because black students specifically did not do well? It wasnt even considered that schools educated black students as well, it was assumed the test was designed specifically to alienate and discriminate against black children. I find this only hurts black students from doing better in the future. These are the kinds of progressive views that need to die. A multiple choice standardized test is not fucking racist. Otherwise Asians and Hispanics would also be doing poorly. Better socialist-ish socially conservative candidates WITH charisma and eloquence are the people the Democratic Party needs. Instead they will push candidates that cannot speak off script in any way that makes people feel connected to them.

It seems shocking, but sometimes people will choose someone who is diverse _because_ they provide a valuable perspective and voice first, and happen to be diverse.Representing all walks of American life (sans criminals) is what both parties should strive to do from the start, as a default.

We are never going to recover from this election because people were so chicken shit to vote for a lesser of two candidates, even though Harris was far higher in character and morality than Trump. There's no point in talking about it so long as the Democratic Party has no fucking clue what the pulse of the union is.My God... Harris is a mixed race woman who lost in every minority demographic, women, and young men. Young men on college campuses are saying they decided to vote for Trump because they saw him on the Joe Rogan Experience or Theo Von. Literally. Harris was too chicken shit to go on a fucking podcast and talk about her vision for America and her personal life because of her poor judgment. Democrats for over 10 years now have been cutting men out of the party with anti-male rhetoric. Patriarchy speech to a 21 year old man is not going to win him over.Apparently mothers of young boys this election voted for Trump because they worry about their son growing up without finding a partner. They worry about their economic future. It is a fact that women tend to date men who earn higher salaries. We can't have a functioning society if women continue to outearn men but do not date below their economic station in larger numbers. Men do not earn $100k fucking dollars a year being an office worker. We are lucky if we earn $60k. Women make up 60% of college students because we have universally failed educating boys the way their brains develop. Teachers are overwhelmingly women teaching to girls. Girls develop their brains faster by over a year. But then we fail to accommodate for boys not learning the same way girls do.

The world now knows who Vance is, and if things go well these next 4 years, I think he has a great chance in 2028.There's also a golden opportunity now permanently repair some of the damage the Dems did and put safeguards in place to keep them from breaking it again. Mass deportations must happen, and we also must have federally-mandated voter ID requirements. Just by virtue of requiring ID to vote, it will cut down on illegal immigration because the Dems will no longer have as much of an incentive to allow wide open borders.There also needs to be stringent requirements placed on who is eligible to utilize mail-in ballots. It should *only* be an option for those who can prove they are physically handicapped (i.e. you have handicapped vehicle registration), those over 65, and those who are deployed as active duty, civilians, or contractors supporting the military.Hell, while at it, pass a 15 week national abortion law. Anything goes until 15 weeks, and after that you must have a medically justifiable reason (such as safety of the mother or grave anomalies in the fetus) to terminate. This is as fair of a compromise as you can get and I think it will placate the majority of people. Doing this will serve two purposes: 1) It will take away a major talking point the Dems use every single election cycle. 2) It prevents Dems from later passing a law allowing something much more insidious, such as third trimester abortions.","title":"The assassination attempt was the moment Trump won 2024"},{"text":"I don't expect Trump to pass huge tariffs.

Their mission is to overcome the largely Satanically-controlled world via corporate prayer, political action, and very possibly become a supernatural army along with angels to sweep away all things demonic, and emerge as the ruling body in the U.S and the world.\\nIn recent years, this variable movement has become overtly political, epitomized by the Seven Mountain Mandate. This is the idea that Christiansof the right sortare supposed to take dominion over society by conquering the seven mountains of influence, or culture: government, religion, the family, education, arts and entertainment, business and the media\\nhttps://www.christiancentury.org/article/features/quiet-rise-christian-dominionism?\\nThe central tenet of Rushdoonys teaching is that God has tasked Christians with taking dominion over society, beginning in Genesis 1:28, in which God commands humans to take dominion over the earth.? What would the perfectly reconstructed society look like? Rushdoony taught that it would provide manspecifically the male genderwith the greatest possible freedom, due to the absence of a government that currently limits that freedom. A federal government would no longer be responsible for laws that govern public safety, social programs (including public schools and welfare), or just about anything else.\\nInstead, society would be reconstructed so that the male-headed family and local church fulfill the roles that currently belong to the government, which would have the authority only to protect private property and punish capital offenses. Families and churches, as the cornerstones of the reconstructed society, would implement Mosaic law, with Christ as king over what would have become a Christian nation. Without government welfare, churches would carry the responsibility of aid to the poor, and without public schools, families would be responsible for their own childrens education. The economy would operate without any government regulation, meaning present laws requiring the integrity of consumer goods, protecting workers rights, and disallowing exploitative financial practices would no longer be in effect. Because in a reconstructed America Christians would have brought Gods kingdom to earth through the implementation of Mosaic law, these protections would not be necessary.","title":"After Win, Trump Fans Admit Project 2025 Is the Agenda"},{"text":"I really thought about Johnson.

Which is interesting as it its clear that democrats support equity, equality, more freedoms, and a stronger social safety net for all, no matter race, gender, or sexual orientation. Which is leading me to believe one of 2 things - this group has truly gone down the rabbit hole of right wing masculinity where straight white men are better than all other groups and deserve their rights more than others, and hearing that others might be afforded the same rights as them feels like an attack as they wont have control over people (women) any more. Or the messaging has been off for democrats (which I dont know how I feel about since this group has been at the top for our entire history and has not faced their rights being attacked). But to to focus on this group when other groups are actually experiencing their rights being stripped and attacked seems strange when they have not been attacked for generations and the Democratic platform has clearly been advocating for all groups to receive benefits economically, whether that be tax credits, health care benefits, access to jobs, etc. Think theres a very interesting discussion to be had here but again, Im not sure how far to read into this and whether its something worth investigating as Reddit is obviously not the place to read into these things especially on a subreddit like that and is not a great representation of any population.

They priced it as being built by all legal and union staff.And, the union bosses know the game. So do the builders.  The inspectors.  The zoning bureaucrats.  Pretty much everybody but the buyer.There is something called the \\"I-9\\" form, which has been in place for years.  An employer must verify the employee is eligible to work.  The \\"day labor\\" crew has no paperwork.Yet, in a poor neighborhood close enough to the build is filled with unskilled citizenry.  And their failing schools don't have a shop or metals class to learn a skillset in high school anymore.  And the unions aren't stepping up to put some vocational training in their midst.There will be an influx in deportation, and, that's not a bad thing.  It's up to us to look at the bigger picture to offer opportunity to the citizen, and to improve the legal immigration process to bring the hardworking undocumented immigrant back in quickly, vetted, legally and into a system that can accommodate their skillset, as an unfulfilled need awaits by proportion.The immigration questionnaire can include items about skill set, education and field of employment of choice.

It's one of those things you don't hear about anymore, but you know those family graves with multiple young kids and infants dead in quick succession? A lot of those were diphtheria.\\nOr as it used to be called, the strangling angel. Because the thick white-grey membrane that grows in the throat of a child with diphtheria flutters like wings when they try to breathe. It closes a small throat over very quickly. They can't breathe past it. Their breath gets trapped as much as they can't draw one at all. They get these round, puffy necks that close the throat even more until they're breathing through a gurgling straw. Then they're dead. It doesn't take long.Even if they survive, we're talking infants and small children suffering days deprived of healthy oxygen levels, suffocating to near death over and over and over. With all the knock on?effects you might expect.It's also very, very contagious and very lethal. Before the modern era of vaccinating every person?against it, a family could easily lose five out of seven kids in a year to waves of diphtheria. Even with all the benefits of modern medicine - even with! - the fatality rate is still 5% to 10%. The main treatment is antibiotics.How many people will be able to afford access to those antibiotics without the ACA? How many people will?be able to get those specific antibiotics even if they can afford them??\\nHow many people who voted Trump realise that they voted to realise a future where they sit up with their dying, suffocating babies for days on end, using their little fingers to puncture those strangling wings every ten to twenty minutes, hoping?their bluefaced, bullnecked child has the strength to?draw just one more breath? How many people even have five kids to lose??\\nI wish I was dramatising. I wish. But there are so, so many records. And so, so many gravestones.","title":"Trump Voters Got What They Wanted  Those who expect that Donald Trump will hurt others, and not them, are likely to be unpleasantly surprised."},{"text":"Stay condescending, that is part of the leftist problem.","title":"'The View' Spew: The Ladies Just Can't Deal With Trump's Blowout Win, Blame 'Uneducated White Women'"},{"text":"He did what he could with the time he was given.

Their mission is to overcome the largely Satanically-controlled world via corporate prayer, political action, and very possibly become a supernatural army along with angels to sweep away all things demonic, and emerge as the ruling body in the U.S and the world.\\nIn recent years, this variable movement has become overtly political, epitomized by the Seven Mountain Mandate. This is the idea that Christiansof the right sortare supposed to take dominion over society by conquering the seven mountains of influence, or culture: government, religion, the family, education, arts and entertainment, business and the media\\nhttps://www.christiancentury.org/article/features/quiet-rise-christian-dominionism?\\nThe central tenet of Rushdoonys teaching is that God has tasked Christians with taking dominion over society, beginning in Genesis 1:28, in which God commands humans to take dominion over the earth.? What would the perfectly reconstructed society look like? Rushdoony taught that it would provide manspecifically the male genderwith the greatest possible freedom, due to the absence of a government that currently limits that freedom. A federal government would no longer be responsible for laws that govern public safety, social programs (including public schools and welfare), or just about anything else.\\nInstead, society would be reconstructed so that the male-headed family and local church fulfill the roles that currently belong to the government, which would have the authority only to protect private property and punish capital offenses. Families and churches, as the cornerstones of the reconstructed society, would implement Mosaic law, with Christ as king over what would have become a Christian nation. Without government welfare, churches would carry the responsibility of aid to the poor, and without public schools, families would be responsible for their own childrens education. The economy would operate without any government regulation, meaning present laws requiring the integrity of consumer goods, protecting workers rights, and disallowing exploitative financial practices would no longer be in effect. Because in a reconstructed America Christians would have brought Gods kingdom to earth through the implementation of Mosaic law, these protections would not be necessary.","title":"Far-Right Donald Trump Supporters Celebrate His Victory with Violent Memes and Calls for Executions"},{"text":"If by all of a sudden you mean more then three years now in Ukraine then ok","title":"How likely do you all think it is that trump will invade Iran during his presidency, do you think nato would involve them selves, or would trump probably have us out of nato before hand"},{"text":"Its scary that this is what our young people think.

Seeing as how we agree that our govt is an incestuous parasitic tool for the ruling class's personal piggy bank, how would you suggest you achieve those goals given the structure we're working with?Personally, I've never seen so many people put together who are willing to identify the many systemic problems in our bureaucracy with a real plan in place to remedy it. The fact that Casey and Calley Means are joining the cabinet with RFK to dismantle the FDA/big pharma revolving door to de-poison our food and water, I've never been so optimistic for the future of the health in this country. This is a big move in the right direction.This community would like to see tax incentives that give small and local businesses an advantage over bigger corporations.AgreedWorker owned businesses, worker co-operatives I think the underlying issue here isn't with the govt, it's with the workers themselves. It's a rare thing for enough workers to be invested in the success of the company without having first risked everything to create it. That usually falls onto one person who has the drive to create something for themself.I'd love to see it happen though. Unfortunately those things tend to fail because the risk involved in creating a business requires a central figure who will forego their own profit to make sure the workers and vendors/suppliers/utilities get paid first (or atleast that's what a good boss is supposed to do). That sort of risk can rarely be decentralized.and organized union negotiating power are the types of measures that can democratize our work placesI've held union and non union jobs. IME the major unions have the same corruption problems as big govt at the expense of the worker. Once a union gets too big it tends to follow the type of trajectory that ends in bosses stealing the pension funds, and then getting replaced by someone *else* in on the scam while never being made to replace the money. The boss that leaves winds up moving to another union that does the same thing. It's definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.I'd love to know how this can be remedied so that the workers don't keep getting screwed.Unfortunately we are stuck with oligarchs buying politicians, amassing wealth through corporate ownership and exploiting our ponzi-like stock market.Indeed. I truly hope we see a major change in that power structure. All I know is there wasn't a hope in hell with the current uniparty in power. If absolutely nothing changes in the next four years, it was atleast worth a shot. If we get just a 1% change it's moving in the right direction at the very least. I expect something much bigger though. If it wasn't, the bureaucracy/human traffickers wouldn't try so hard to kill and lawfare the bad orangeman.I also forgot that civil liberties is a major issue that our factions could also agree on.Absolutely. Ever heard of Julie Kelly? She's been the only real advocate for the jan 6 political prisoners. Families have been destroyed, prisoners have been tortured and had their civil liberties violated worse than anyone at gitmo. She's going to play a big role in this administration. With a proper DOJ and AG I expect to see many of these corrupt federal judges and DOJ bureaucrats investigated and prosecuted for weaponizing the justice system against people who did nothing wrong beyond being welcomed in by police.Idk how much you know about the setup/false flag on that day, but it was planned in Gen Milley's office. He, the secretary of the army, and 3 other generals planned the op with the help of the 3 letter agencies, the Pentagon, and a bunch of private contractors. Capitol police had 800 officers off that day on administrative leave, leaving only 200 officers and no NG (at the secretary of the army's orders) after Yoganonda Pittman signed 6 permits for protest, which on any other day would be an *all hands on deck* situation  - just like the *other* 300 protests per year in DC.Lots and lots of people planned what happened that day, and a bunch of unassuming dipshits fell for it. I knew weeks earlier it was going to be a setup when I started seeing advertisements to \\"make it an *armed* demonstration\\" online. They wanted blood, and they had the fake \\"pipe bombs\\" as a backup just in case the agent provocateurs couldn't pull it off. I'm betting we'll see a shit ton of sudden retirements over the next two months leading up to the inauguration.For the record, the US military/state dept specializes in color revolutions. They've been doing it around the world for more than 70 years (a very similar timeline  to when the CIA started controlling the US govt). I find it bizarre that so many people will call them out when they happen to communist regimes in Central and South America, but somehow are blind to the hallmarks here at home.Thanks again for the constructive comments. And just so we're clear, I have no issue with communist idealists. It's part of human nature to want the best for everyone. It's the marxists I have issue with. All they know is how to destroy. They refuse to create anything, and instead focus on divide and conquer while making themselves massively rich. The lessons I got in \\"progressive stack\\" was enough to make me understand it's nothing more than societal sabotage.","title":"I'm a right wing populist trump supporter, and I want to meet you guys where you're at to find a way to move forward together for a better future"},{"text":"This is why I feel like its truly over.

Most Americans support the overwhelming majority of the Democratic partys platform, from LGBT rights to abortion to expanding Medicare/Medicare and Social Security to making the rich pay their fair share. Americans, and even MAGAs, support the Democratic partys platform. The problem isnt policy, its identity. Americans arent ready for minorities to actually take part in the American experiment. Kamala had concrete plans to make housing affordable. She had concrete plans to make starting a family affordable. Biden has successfully landed us a recession-free COVID recovery. Every GOP POTUS since over the past 50 years has left their office with the U.S. in a recession. Every ounce of economic data proves that the GOP is shit for the economy and the average American, yet Americans believe the inverse. Why? Because the Democratic Party also supports social policiespolicies that are based on ensuring social equality. This means that Democrats talk about trans rights, gay rights, police brutality. Most Americans arent affected by that, but still have to hear the discussions because Democrat politicians still talk about it, because it still exists. Trans people exist. Black people are incarcerated at higher rates than white people, and that still matters. But when most Americans arent trans, or black, or *insert specific minority*, they dont care, they see it as irrelevant, and therefore see the Democrats as out-of-touch, and therefore see the GOP as being focused on the economy.","title":"Old Habits Die Hard"},{"text":"One of my very close friends is a southeast Asian legal immigrant, got her citizenship after 19 years, and is a diehard conservative after living in a socialist country.

No universal healthcare, poor consumer protections, poor labor rights, little child/maternity care, poor safety nets etc. etc. However on social issues, the party (mostly rightfully) tries to be a world leader and a trend setter. For gay marriage, drug legalization, trans rights, reparations, defund the police etc. As well intentiond as a lot of this is, it frankly is left of the rest of the world and attempting to trailblaze when we arent acknowledging our place as being behind the curve.  Its difficult to introduce brand new ideas to a conservative society. Modern political messaging is fought by amplifying the more extreme, unusual, uncomfortable positions of your opponent.  The messaging of offering free Transition surgery to prisoners when the majority of the country cannot easly afford basic health services, however noble and right, frankly is out of touch with our current situation.  If I have to establish 3 sets of logical conclusions that aren't conmmonly held and reference 6 scientific or medical journals to explain why its the right thing to do to an uninformed person, it isn't going to land. \\nIts like fighting for the civil rights movement before the slaves are even free. Its completely a valid and righteous cause.  Its the goal end state, but you expend too much political capital asking for too much too soon and as a result you get nothing.We dont drop these issues, they are important and matter but its time Dems realize that American federal legislation isn't the place to be world leaders.  Fight the fight elsewhere, globally, in education, in entertainment media, at the state level, fight bottom up rather than top down, soften the electorate on these issues before you make it a central part of your platform.  The first time Amercan citizens hear about these social issues shouldn't be from their senator or presidential candidate telling taxpayers they are using their money for XXX.  Instead, lead the citizens to realize that this is the correct thing to do on their own.  (I'd say Legalization of Marijuana has worked pretty well this way recently) Dont play the race, gender identity, orientation, sexism card proactively.  Sure maybe your opponent's position is racist/sexist/homophobic etc. but its likely a lot of the electorate doesn't understand the issue enough to understand why. (explaining why school choice is racist isn't something a lot of people would immediately understand), Push the issues that are just spam dunk obvious that there frankly isn't a rational response to: healthcare, workers rights, consumer protections, infrastructure investments, etc.Am I asking for a shift right?  In some senses yes I guess, bi\\nt Id argue its more akin to the \\"snowball\\" method of getting out of debt.  Focus on the most important, achievable issues first, (without outright compromising or changing your beliefs), and then use that momentum to start pitching the newer/more radical ones. Your beliefs, values and end-state doesn't change, but your approach to get there does.This is more or less what Obama did with gay marriage, and look what happened.","title":"Capitulating on Trans Issues Would Be a Mistake"},{"text":"This fucker has no business in the American government.","title":"Elon Musk wins big by betting on Trump"},{"text":"people who view latino as a \\"race\\" are remarkably stupid.","title":"My attempt at explaining the huge shift towards the right in the Mexican-American border communities as a guy from El Paso"},{"text":"Thoughts and prayers-again.","title":"What former Vice President Mike Pence said about Donald Trump's 2024 presidential win"},{"text":"Most of the shit he says isnt gonna happen tbh.

When everyone suddenly decided Biden was too old for the job, I can not wrap my head around the idea that holding a primary before certain states made them lock their candidates was feasible. I think what most likely happened was that party democrats in power heard almost everyone say they didn't want Biden after that debate performance and went with the only alternative they could possibly get to it time. And, to their credit, they actually went with someone who was on the primary ballot instead of pulling a candidate out of thin air, which would have been arguably more undemocratic than at least sticking with someone voter's voted for in the only viable primary.Put that together with the fact that Kamala ran a decent campaign free of too many major embarrassments, I honestly believe that the only reason it turned out this way is because the pocketbook of the average American is hurting. Bottom line is that people voted in 2020 for a return of pre-covid prices, and while inflation slowed to a more acceptable pace, wages didn't keep up enough for the average American to not feel the burn. If everyone is wondering where the votes disappeared to, I honestly think it's people just dissatisfied with the state of their bank accounts and little else; the simplest explanation is that Americans are hurting and they don't feel heard. (And the majority don't look further to figure out why they are hurting, or what is being done, other than what the people in power tell them). If you want to hold onto power, you have to make the people giving you that power happy that they gave it to you; without that, there was just a ton of indifference this time around.","title":"Trump Voters Got What They Wanted  Those who expect that Donald Trump will hurt others, and not them, are likely to be unpleasantly surprised."},{"text":"You know they wont believe its him behind it, theyll blame it on the democrats or anyone else","title":"After Win, Trump Fans Admit Project 2025 Is the Agenda"},{"text":"The conspiracy is distracting you with conspiracies while the corpos like Peter Thiel fund creating meat puppets in the open.","title":"Reddit is now proven to be a propaganda machine."},{"text":"..we need to pass common sense laws for children's sports?
