That is why you see so much on mainstream right wing news calling him a lefty, and left so bc news emphasizing he followed IDW types and places like reddit pushing anti-wealthy narratives over anything closer to reality. this isnt about the rich vs the poor, the top 1% transcend our class system anyway. Their power is beyond money. Its about the medical industrial complex that all Americans have alllwed to grow out of our control through willful ignorance of reality in favor of pretending they are entrenched in a good vs evil fight with huge swaths of their fellow citizens. I dont think that murder should be celebrated, and its unfortunate humanity as a whole creates societies that can make situations like these morally ambiguous. However, Sometimes we must accept things as complex without excessive moralizing. Nothing is ever truly about good vs evil in the end.Brian Thompson may have been a decent man, or he may not have been. Same with Luigi. Brian Thompson was not the target, the machine he represented was. The medical industrial complex is a machine that as Americans we have allowed to grow to be something that actively works against our own interests to an extreme degree.It has grown so large and corrupt that dismantling that  system and turning it into something that works well and fairly for the majority of Americans is something outside the scope of either sides ideas. The polarization between left and right actually helps perpetuate the centralization of healthcare into something increasing profitable for a few at the expense of the many.Yes, Luigi Mangione is a terrorist. No, murder is not something to celebrate. Yes, Brian Thompson may have been a decent man. No, he was not the target.The machine was the target, and if you put yourself in the position of operator, you risk being injured, maimed, killed, or in some way victimized, when a willing and able individual, blinded and emboldened by rage and courage, sets out to attack that machine.Live by the sword, die by the sword.Attacking that machine is something to celebrate. Thompson is a casualty of that. His death is not what should be celebrated, only the symbolism in it. Consider him a sacrifice at the altar of the public at larges suffering. When his trial is over, Luigi will be the same: a sacrifice.Seldom are those whose works benefit others without dispute the victims of political violence and assassination.

It arose in opposition to the French Revolution attempting to lessen the power of the monarchy. All other conservative \\"values\\" are public relations to sell those who do not have immense wealth and power on the idea that they should support a system that solely benefits those that do. Notably, conservatives were once far more open and honest about this. You can read the writings of people like Burke or de Maistre and see quite explicitly laid out that there are a class of people chosen by God or Nature that are just better than everybody else and deserve to rule. The wirtings of America's founders also contain many of these notions (which is why Burke supported the American revolution but not the French). Throughout history, conservatives have opposed every move towards a more democratic system. Only as they've lost these battles - first with allowing any voting at all, then with allowing non-landowning males to vote, then with allowing black men to vote, then women, and so on -  have they been forced to create ideas like \\"meritocracy\\", \\"personal responsibility\\", \\"taxation as theft\\", \\"the spirit of competition\\", various culture war issues, etc. as a way to allow a system of de facto aristocracy to continue under other guises. Fundamentally, conservatives do not oppose dynastic or generational wealth, or any fetters at all on the ruling classes and elites.

They don't create more incentives to work - they do the opposite.Rich parents facing heavy inheritance taxes often retire earlier and spend their wealth on luxury consumption instead of keeping it productive in businesses and investments. Their kids also work less during their parents' lifetime because they need to help manage complex tax avoidance strategies.I run a family business. If I knew 40% of it would go to the government when I die, I'd sell it, lay off workers, and blow the money on fancy cars and vacations. How is that better for the economy than passing it to my kids who could keep growing it and employing people?And forget the \\"nepo\\" argument - most inherited wealth is gone by the second generation anyway. 70% of rich families lose their wealth by the time grandkids grow up. The ones who keep it usually do so by being productive themselves.The current system where people can pass on their life's work creates multi-generational businesses and long-term thinking. An inheritance tax just encourages short-term consumption and tax schemes. That's way more damaging to economic productivity than a few trust fund kids.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"She kind of did.

Both want to keep their stores as family businesses, not selling out to private equity or conglomerates. Then suddenly Bob dies in a car accident.

Then Carol dies, Bob's grocery is inherited by her brother David, who also needs to liquidate assets to pay the inheritance tax. Then David dies, and Bob's grocery goes to his sister Eleanor, who liquidates yet more assets.

The flaws with the welfare systems are that there are disincentives to working, rather than labor doesn't give superior compensation.  I won't pretend to be an expert, but my understanding is that if you receive $1,000 per month in support and earn $0 income, your support would change by more than what you earned if you did earn income.  This creates the perverse scenario where working is detrimental to living unless one can get wages at least above their total support prior, which isn't the easiest.  This system is broken.  It should make people more or less the same level from $0 income to whatever level of support they were getting. Another variant of the anti-welfare argument is that it's a safety net.  If a crowd of people were crossing the street and someone tripped and fell, it's pretty likely someone would stop to help lift them up.  However, someone laying in the street and expecting to be dragged along by all the passersby isn't doing much at all aside from being a burden.  In my anecdotal experience, this argument is a much larger proportion of the anti-welfare argument.; that it enables people to be dragged along.  Someone with inheritance isn't discouraged from working, they just don't need to.  They aren't being propped up by anyone else, they're just in their own world.

Countries are under no obligation to accept deportees that are not citizens of their country, so almost certainly will refuse to accept them and physically block them from entering, i.e. won't let them get off the plane or won't let them get pushed through the gate. So, Trump and his goons will have to build large deportation camps to concentrate these deportees into small confined areas of the country, like down in Texas at the border. Then the problem becomes the cost of feeding and caring for all these human beings, a cost that will skyrocket since not only are the numbers of people in these concentration camps increasing by the day, but many of the people being shoved into the camps were the very people involved in harvesting and processing the food that gets eaten in America. Crippling food production in the country will drive food prices way up, and we can't import more food to offset those losses because that food is already destined for tables elsewhere in the world. We can outbid other buyers for food, but that means paying a whole lot more for those imports to offset what was lost domestically. It's an upward spiral with no real ability to cap.There are options to deal with this. Probably the first one Trump will order is reducing calories per prison camp occupant. Cut their calories down to 1,000 or even just 500 per day and you cut food costs by over half. This is a temporary measure, though, because at those low levels you get muscle and fat wasting and after a few months you'll just have millions of walking skeletons in the concentration camps. There absolutely will be accelerated deaths during this process because many people's bodies just can't handle this kind of wasting. Trump's concentration camp managers won't have room to bury all the bodies so they'll ship them out to local crematoriums for cremation, but as the volume of bodies skyrockets, after all we're talking millions of people starving, they'll have to bring in mobile crematoriums (like the Russians have done), but eventually for cost efficiency they'll go ahead and build cremation ovens on site. Mass cremation also has the benefit of ash being easier to dispose of than intact bodies. The ash residue from millions of people can be spread on local fields and in ash pits.And history repeats itself as it always does, and each time it does we pretend to be shocked anew at this thing we had no idea could turn out this way, even though we've seen it turn out this way before.","title":"Trump's \\"McCarthy era\\" throwback: A promise to deport protesters"},{"text":"Shhhhh... people are trying to be edgy.","title":"Trump getting humiliated left and right and he's not even in office yet"},{"text":"Of course not but are you then saying they all follow the rules?

Currently India slaps about a 45% import tariff on pork, which is mostly supplied by the U.S.Tariffs could also be reduced on high-end medical devices such as pace makers and luxury motor-cycles, including Harley Davidson, said a second official with direct knowledge of trade issues, citing the 25% to 60% tariffs on these products.With bilateral trade between India and the U.S. exceeding $118 billion in the 2023/24 fiscal year ending in March, and India enjoying a $32 billion trade surplus, the country is readying for trade talks with the U.S., aiming to clinch a broader trade and investment deal once president-elect Donald Trump takes office.To address Trump's concerns over the trade imbalance, officials have also proposed buying more LNG and defence equipment from the U.S., the second official said.\\nIndia's energy imports from the U.S., including crude oil, refined fuel and coal, were estimated at $12 billion in fiscal 2024, and aircraft and parts at $2 billion. Such imports could rise by $5 billion to $10 billion annually, a third government source, said.The government and industry sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions remain confidential.A commerce ministry spokesman declined to comment.Commerce ministry officials have previously said they would wait for the Trump administration to take office before any offer of trade talks, while working out plans for possible negotiations.Indian officials are also sensing an opportunity in Trump's plans to impose up to 60% tariffs on Chinese imports, by pitching India as an alternative manufacturing base.The government has held consultations on the issue within ministries, as well as with local think-tanks and industrial groups, said a government source who attended some of the meetings.TRUMP GOOD FOR INDIA\\"That is an opportunity,\\" said Arvind Virmani, a government adviser and member of the state-run policy think-tank NITI Aayog.\\"It is in the interest of the U.S. and India that more of critical manufacturing or the sensitive manufacturing be done in India rather than China,\\" he said, adding a \\"preferential trade cum investment deal,\\" which is more ambitious than an earlier proposed mini-trade deal, would benefit both countries.Ajay Sahai, director general at the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said high tariffs on goods from China would accelerate the process of global companies moving to India.\\"We have to do our homework... Overall the coming of Donald Trump is definitely good for India,\\" he said.During Trump's first term, a proposed mini-trade deal aimed at addressing trade imbalances and strengthening trade ties through limited agreements faltered over disagreements on tariffs, market access and intellectual property.India is now seeking a broader deal, offering significant concessions including production-linked incentives for shipping and support for logistics companies.\\"Under Trump's 'Make in America programme', India could extend concessions for U.S. companies for manufacturing low-end products in India for their supply chains,\\" said Ram Singh, a trade analyst at the state-run Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.In the semiconductor sector, for instance, he said, India could become a hub for the production of low-end chips as part of the global supply chain while U.S. companies focused on high-end products.\\nNoting that India has attracted investments, such as Apple Inc's iPhone production, the sources said the government plans to offer further incentives in sectors like aircraft maintenance, semiconductors, electronics and renewables.India also plans to allow 100% foreign direct investment in the insurance sector, up from the current 74% in a move that could help leading US insurers like AIG .The plan would require parliament approval.\\nSummary\\nTrade officials say internal discussions aimed at preparing for Trump administrationIndia seeks broader trade, investment deal with TrumpPlans to offer tax cuts on farm and other key importsSees opportunity to draw U.S. firms away from China!ping IND","title":"India gears up for a potential trade deal as Trump targets China, say government sources"},{"text":"Oh geez, who would have guessed (besides everyone who didnt vote for a convicted felon)","title":"The Republican Party Is Out of Control | An ungovernable party is about to run the government."},{"text":"Thanks all for the laugh.

Thank you dear leader. We are now the golden toilet.","title":"The Republican Party Is Out of Control | An ungovernable party is about to run the government."},{"text":"We are paying the price for a few things here. First, after years of appeasing Trumps behavior, abdicating their responsibility for legislative power to limit Trumps executive power, and abdicating their impeachment power to hold Trump accountable for his actions, the Republican Party proved once again that a large percentage of GOP, including the House Speaker, will throw out a bipartisan funding bill at the drop of a hat, at the demands of Trump and a Billionaire. Democrats and a few fiscal hawk Republicans said No to Trumps demand for abolishing the debt ceiling so he could rack up substantially more federal debt. It is a good sign that some Republicans are willing to tell Trump, No.Second, we have always had the influence of money swaying our politics. But with Trump partnering with Billionaire Musk, moneys influence is now on hyperdrive.  Of course, we have Citizens United to thank for unlimited money flowing into our politics to sway anything from policy on climate change to healthcare to funding priorities. Back in 2010, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Citizens United, Justice Stevens dissent was spot on and foretold what was to come and the corrupting influence of corporate speech and money in our elections.  In a functioning democracy the public must have faith that its representatives owe their positions to the people, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.We are now experiencing the consequence of our failure to reign in corporations from pouring $Millions into our politics. As Justice Stevens wrote in his dissent, Corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires  they are not themselves members of We the People by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.The Republican Party is not there to govern. They are there to provide more tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy.  Their bravado about being fiscally responsible does not match their actions. They know Trumps next round of corporate tax cuts will accelerate our federal debt. They know the tax cuts wont pay for themselves. And, after five decades of failed trickle down theory, they know the rich will not trickle down their generosity. This is the Republican Party. And it is functioning as designed.","title":"The Republican Party Is Out of Control | An ungovernable party is about to run the government."},{"text":"170 did.

Journalists never made a ton of money, but now they generally start at just above minimum wage and there have been many reports of older reporters who make more money being fired or forced into early retirement because the publications can make more profit with the less experienced and lower paid younger reporters. This not only means the average reporter less experience, but they are also missing out of years of mentorship and guidance from older, more experienced reporters. A big reason is that there is very little money in news anymore. It used to be the expectation that if you wanted to read the news, you bought a newspaper of your choice for a small fee. With the rise of internet news, people generally expect free news, so newspaper sales and subscriptions have gone down significantly and internet ad revenue hasn't been nearly enough to make up for the difference.

It used to be Democrats who wanted to keep cheap foreign labor out of America to ensure American wages remained high and a living wage, and it was Democrats who wanted tariffs on steel and other products to protect American manufacturing, the argument being that it wasn't fair for American manufacturers to compete without tariffs against cheap overseas labor.

If it isn't, then it's only the illusion of democracy that they tolerate because they have already bought it. In fact, the ultra wealthy are a symptom of a socioeconomic problem just as poverty is. They represent a malfunctioning political and economic system, a concentration of power that is a direct threat to the people. When they appear, cut them down to size or they will destroy society.The reason they are now openly supporting oligarchy and dictatorship is not that they didn't support those things before. They are simply aware that the popular rage caused by the system they control has to be turned towards something that isn't them if their power is to survive. They were always OK with fascism and would always have chosen it over even the mildest compromise with social democracy.That's the reason why no democratic society should allow people to own so much, why the rich are and have always been the enemy of the people. Not because they are inherently evil people, but because their position puts their interests at odds with the interests of the rest of society; they are no longer part of it in any meaningful way, so they start acting in an anti-social way while also being above the law.

How is it that I can't even begin to understand right wing ideology? Logically, if there's no way to understand and empathise with one another, how do we begin to even bond?But it's not that right-wing agenda is incomprehensible, it's that it benefits only a small percentage of the population. So why then is there a significant amount of people who are below middle-class and right wing? Well imo, the truth is harsh to hear, but it is because some people are unable to recognize the source of their own issues. It's easy to understand success when looking at a rich person, it's easy to accept they must be capable of more than most, and so it's easy to hand over control in hopes that they will change the world for the better. When the same person sees money pour into their account in return for their hard work, they see that as a small-scale success. It is positive reinforcement that they're also on a path to success. The problem occurs when wages are low, and a liar like Trump goes into power, promising economical prosperity. The people do not recognize that the tyrant they vote for is the same guy who will steal from the wallets of the working-class to ensure it.I felt as if the answer to this paradox was education, and long-term outcomes will yield a population that can see past the lies.

Yes, economic activity can be spurred by tax cuts, but those increases have to be incredibly high and sustained to make up for tax cuts.From data I've seen this never actually works: economic activity basically never outweighs the loss of revenue. Reagan and trump definitely increased economic activity, but the deficit ballooned under them as well, trump even before COVID.But I'd welcome any actual data that indicates otherwise.And, for my soap box: We also have to be really strategic about this.

This rhetoric enabled their tool (Trump) to rile up and broaden his loyalist base and get out the vote among lower- and middle-class Americans (of various backgrounds, not just white folk) who perceive themselves as aggrieved and victimized by the current economy (which perception of victimization and economic ruin are at base carefully managed constructions reinforced by Fox News and by social media manipulation). The blame the immigrants leitmotif was a way to divert the target electorate's attention from the matter-of-fact benefits that Biden's policies and legislative accomplishments have brought and will bring to those same demographics in the short and long run. Foremost among these was the successful cooling down of rampant post-COVID inflation that resulted inevitably from an overheated economy driven by pent-up consumer demand, global supply chain issues, and increases in government spending during COVID and its aftermath, needed to to stave off both the widespread economic turmoil of broad unemployment as well as a massive economic recession. It remains to be seen if Trump's puppeteers (corporate and non-corporate, domestic and foreign) will direct him actually to follow through on any of those promises. I'd be surprised if they do, considering the rampant economic disruption it would bring by depleting the supply of low-wage labor upon which corporate America relies so heavilynot to mention the problematic optics of family separation/human rights infringementas well as (greater concern for Trumps handlers) the inflationary pressure that would result from funding the actual costs of mass deportation through massive new government spending (printing money to expand DHS personnel and build the new or additional infrastructure of mass deportation-including but not limited to building multiple huge new incarceration facilities, transport of targeted undocumented migrants, and legal costs and timing delays of defending against predictable and multiple Constitutional challenges in courts, etc.). The whole project is too costly and too inflationary as a governmentally funded enterprise, too disruptive to the labor markets on which Trump's handlers depend, and too problematic from a legal standpointmeaning that the whole thing would rightly become stuck in courts for the entire Trump 2.0 term or at least until the midterm elections, which predictably will swing leftward in view of the impending failures to govern that typically result from Republican control of the Congressnot to mention the recession that will result from Trump's fiscal, trade, and tax policies, combined. Mass deportation along with tariffs could very well result in both the rekindling of rampant sudden inflation (note the Fed's loss of enthusiasm for 2025 rate cuts this week) as well as the spurring of economic recession through disruption of labor markets and the cooling off of consumer demand in view of rising prices and novel supply chain problems (tariffs again). I dont see and have never seen mass deportation as anything except the latest version of the Southern Strategy (to lure white voters to vote against their own economic interests) and more chillingly a borrowed page from the Nazi party's scapegoating of Jews as an electoral rallying point. And in view of that, there's every possibility that Im wrong about all of this and the MAGAs are willing to follow through on mass deportation despite the social, economic, and political costs Ive outlined here. But my hunch is that the anti-immigrant ideologues and True Believers (the Stephen Millers, et al.) arent really in charge here, and theyre just as much part of the window dressing and puppet show as Trump himselfas opposed to the corporate entities and interests that are and always have been truly in charge of Republican governance and policy-making. Unfortunately I do predict some smaller-scale operations that will impact smaller numbers of undocumented immigrants, launched merely for symbolic propaganda optics and talking points, but it won't (I hope) amount to muchjust like the diversionary Wall-building shadow play of the first Trump term.  Either this or else maybe they really are genuine Fascists, in which case we are deeply and truly fucked.  One last point:  These assholes may be clever, but theyre not really that smart, and theyre reasonably likely to nose dive their own aspirations through their lack of competence and inability to govern. Maybe Im whistling in the graveyard, but here's how I keep my chin up in these last dark days of 2024. Trump and his masters will certainly do a lot of additional damage, on multiple fronts, but I dont think they're likely to follow through on this one. Mass deportation may prove to be only a mass diversion, Trump once again swindling his own base. Anybody wanna buy a sixty dollar Bible?

It wont be because the country cant handle a black woman president. Its because people *think* the country isn't ready for a black woman president. And the reasons people believe it, are such a red herring. - Hillary Clinton was shit candidate. Whether she was a man or woman is irrelevant- Kamala Harris got pushed into the position under poor circumstances. She didn't win a primary, in fact she performed quite poorly during the 2020 primary. And on top of that, she had very limited time to run a good campaign for 2024. To say that they are evidence that we cant have women presidents is misleading and unfortunate. Because there are women like Stacey Abrams and AOC who could conceivably make great presidents, if they are given all the same opportunities to run.I think, for the reasons you think we cant have a woman president, we'll probably have to wait for a Republican woman to win the presidency before people feel comfortable with Democrats ever running a woman again.

One person with 34.5 billion dollars is pretty likely to do some wacky, cool things with it. They can spend 34.5M 999 times and still have eating money.

And that's a common problem with the progressive left, they don't know what they stand for.  So much so that when presented with their own ideals, they rage against the very thing they claim to be fighting for.Remember where we started:Progressive left supports big government, they are very much against the whole 'anarchy' and 'kill the rich'. They constantly call for more taxes, **more government oversight, more regulation, more authoritarianism**.And this is exactly what you're also (angrily I might add) arguing against.. and for... and well both.  All while trying to double down on some convoluted reinterpretation of the French Revolution, which had nothing to do with the argument in the first place.Old school liberals hold liberty, freedom, and justice in high regard.  So for them it's not as much about 'big' vs 'small' government, as opposed to 'just' vs 'unjust'; 'freedom' vs 'oppression'.  It just so happens that smaller government almost always aligns with their views.The progressive left doesn't give two shits about freed, justice, or liberty.  Hence they are quite happy to advocate for a larger authoritarian government if it's one that claims to support their form of authoritarianism.   Like most supremacy ideologies, they think the world will be a better place if they are on top.The modern left is neither liberal nor ethical, and people are starting to catch on to the grift.","title":"CMV: The Left puts too much care on ethics and none on aesthetics, that's why we'll Always lose."},{"text":"Trump: Hold my McDolands","title":"Senate confirms Biden's 235th judge, beating Trump's record"},{"text":"Kristi Noem shot the sheepdog.","title":"Republicans Nativity scene, No unwed mothers, middle eastern people, refugees, or Wise Men."},{"text":"I DONT think it needs to be blackmail, he can just redirect his troll farm to issue propaganda against trump, this is enough to destroy trumps image. also pull funding from trump, or any of trumps Maga GOP members.

In fact, it was one of the closest elections in the last 50 years. So whatever changes the Democrats decide to make, they really dont have to be fundamental changes.Maybe not all Republicans are racist, but all racists are Republican, as well as all homophobes, xenophobes, bigots, and misogynists. And now Im going to say something that is NOT MY POSITION. As close as this election was predicted to be (as well as turned out to be), if you want to attract votes from the other side, then picking a black woman as your candidate might not have been the best move you could make, because it damn well matters to some if not most Republicans. Should her race and/or sex have been an issue for anyone? No. Were they? Undoubtably.In hindsight, its easy to see mistakes the Democrats made.  First, they hid Bidens real condition from the public. To this day, I have no idea what his condition really is or how fast hes declining, if in fact he is (Personally, Id pick a somewhat compromised Biden over Trump any day, plus we really dont know how bad Trumps decline is, either). There was no way to hide it for the entire duration of the campaign; a flub like the debate was almost guaranteed. Then, they hesitated far too long to make a candidate change. Every day they waited was a wasted day that the new candidate could have been campaigning. I do think they did an admirable job uniting behind Harris, but I admit the lack of controversy over picking her kind of led me to have a false sense of security.So picking a candidate that was not going to attract many Republicans (and might well have been a problem for some Independents, too) made her job to get elected harder, as did every one of the mistakes that the Democrats made. And still she lost by a tiny margin. That reinforces my point: the Democrats dont need to make fundamental policy changes, they just need to be smarter about campaigning. And Im not suggesting that their policies are perfect by any means, or that they do a good job promoting or communicating them. Right, wrong, or indifferent, rich people can contribute far too much to campaigns, and campaigns are expensive. People dont like the Democrats hobnobbing with the rich, but money in politics is a problem. Nevertheless, Democrats have to play in the real world in which many rich people dont want to pay taxes, revolting as that attitude is. We cant expect a 100% progressive platform to carry the day in 2028, although it ought to look pretty attractive after the wreck that Trump and company are going to leave in their wake. But picking one glaring issue, like health insurance, and beating on that issue with a simple description (Medicare for all is a genius formulation because it incapsulates a whole concept in just three words) might be the way to go. Just pick one, think it thru, figure out a simple way to communicate it, and stick to it.","title":"To those who did not vote for Harris &amp; Democrats: It's not that Dems didn't earn your Vote.

I could remember wrong, but I believe Bidens Chip Act has a small tariff to go along with the investment. Because foreign micro chips are both cheaper and better quality, there's no reason to buy domestic chips. But by investing in research and production, a small tariff on top of that helps make US chips seem like a reasonable option domestically compared to foreign chips. Hopefully, the US market can eventually catch up to be at least comparable to Taiwanese chips after a decade. The plan is long-term. Then compare that to what Trump wants, which is wide, sweeping tariffs that don't make any distinctions between products and with no investments to US production in order to make up for the price increase.

Im not trying to demonize, just trying to be accurate. Studying economics Ive met many libertarians and conservatives, as well as conservative history and political theory professors, they simply do not believe inequality qua inequality is a problem, certainly not one to be solved with redistribution. This has been expressed from Rothbard to Hayek to Friedman to Regan to Trump. Maybe this is more of an elite conservative/libertarian position but when inequality is brought up I have frequently been told, The problem is poverty, not inequality. Its a fairly common view among conservatives that the way to improve peoples lives is to encourage business growth and therefore inequality.The new right does exist and they have a different worldview that inequality and cultural liberalism are products of globalization that should be rolled back.

I would argue that 'earning votes' is the biggest job of the party., because the party that convinces more people to vote for them gets to enact their policies. Blaming the people doesn't change the outcome of the next election, changing party poicy/strategy can.3. As for preaching to the choir, it seems like all we do are get our point out in like-minded echo chambers and get the most up votes. Opposing views are downvoted, which is barrier to any further discussion. At a party level, Republicans have a strong base in every city, county and state. The democrats have focused on cities and suburbs. There are states they have practically given up on. Jon Tester in Montana and Lance Kunce in Missouri were excellent candidates who never got any support. This leads to more disinformation and the circle continues. I dont think the problem was the democratic messaging, but who actually saw the message.","title":"To those who did not vote for Harris &amp; Democrats: It's not that Dems didn't earn your Vote.

Blame Biden, for not dropping out sooner, to give her a better campaign to work with. Blame Harris, for courting neocons like the cheyney family, instead of the working class. Blame the DNC for sticking to the status quo, rather than embracing something different. Trump already obliterated the neocons, and he pretty much just did to the neolibs too. And, they are still sticking with their ideology. Pelosi sabotaging AOC? for some geriatric? I voted for Harris, despite being an actual leftist. I wasn't happy about it. I was pissed about it.

And then in 2021, the 10th circuit court of appeals ruled contrary to the statement in Burdick. In that case, Trump had pardoned a soldier, Clint Lorance, who had ordered his troops to shoot and kill three unarmed Afghans. The court of appeals ruled that his pardon was *not* an admission of guilt. (Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdick_v._United_States))This makes sense to me. Suppose Lorance were innocent and wrongly convicted; it'd be unfair for him to have to admit guilt in order to get a pardon.

It very much is, and its a very hard concern but one we deal with and think about very very often. I swear I discuss this with my father like every week. We really do care about monetary inequality.The problem is similar to what you say, how do we fight the filthy rich drowning in money while not discouraging people to make good products or services? I mean genuinely. Lets take Bezos as an example. We tax him to high heaven. Ok cool hes gonna combat that by firing all of him employees and using drones or robots to do his work for him. We make that illegal cool hell find some other loophole where he can get labor cheap elsewhere or do whatevers necessary to keep the lowest loss in income.Big issues are A. These people arent dumb theyll try to find loopholes to stuff. B. Anyone now working in an industry with a good product now gets taxed to hell and cant use cool technology like drones so were punishing innocent good business. And C. Now well have a crisis of unemployment because we decided to interfere, when we couldve just let him be rich and at least people would have jobs. The best solution me and my father have discussed is that their income is based on a certain percentage or equation of a percentage (we can figure out the exact number, ie: 1000% or 100% x every ten thousand employees) of the lowest income of their company. This means they can get more money if they pay better, theyll want more employees if we do it based on number of employees and it wont hurt anyone else. 2. Its absolutely both in our eyes. I dont know what you think conservatives are like but frankly in my eyes it sounds like youre just absorbing what the media or maybe other people will tell you were like rather than us being actual humans like anyone else. Were getting paid less too, our cost of living is going up too, our inflation is going up too, our gas bills are going up too, our grocery bills are going up too. Were not suddenly immune to these issues or our grocerys get more expensive and we go huh lays is charging me more, ok well less money for anything else okey dokey Genuinely do you think our money issues the same that you have magically disappear because we value different things. Yes we absolutely believe the establishment is pushing wrong views. But to think we have no issues with our money being taken more and more is beyond me. Thats not just ok. Not to you. Not to us. Not to anyone. I want to say this to EVERYONE if you hate conservatives, hate conservative views, hate politics or dont understand conservatism. Go talk to a conservative. Dont talk politics specifically. Just spend time with one. Hang out, go to an arcade do mini golf go to a mall. Do something with someone you know is conservative. Were not aliens, were not some out their species whos entirely different in every way. Were actually quite similar and believe a lot more of the same things then you think. The fact is were all human.It doesnt mean you have to agree, but I used to love doing this all the time. Nearly all of my friends were liberals. Did I fully believe that they were making the world worse in their worldview and beliefs? Ab-so-lutely every day. But who cares? Let people believe what they want to believe. Deep down you hate that theyre a maga loving gun owner? Awesome cool believe that nobodys telling you otherwise. But go be with them, ignore all that for a second and just be human. Go spend time with the great amazing people who are on both sides.To every conservative not every liberal is a blue haired screaming they/them who will tear you apart for the wrong pronouns or kill you for using a gas car or having a gun.And to every liberal not every conservative is racist, wants to take away your bodily autonomy, and will murder any lgbt person. Were humans people! Humans. All of us. So grow up and stop thinking the worst of the other side. Theres things to love about all of us, and things we can disagree on and discuss. But we need a common love and a common bond with one another for real work to be done on both sides. And thats something no matter your political view that you can contribute to.I know Im biased so if you want to ignore this feel free. But I believe the reason liberals lost in a landslide this election was because you dehumanized every trump supporter as a racist maga gun toating homophobe. If you think trump supporter and associate it with bad person in any way, thats a stereotype you need to break. Hate the guy? Fair. Dont hate the people. When you do that people just see you as an asshole and the ones on the edge will leave and go to the non asshole side. (Trust me theres a TON of conservative asshats too) but so many of yall dont even treat us as human anymore. So change that and maybe youll see a chance for more progress to be made on your views and more people respecting and agreeing with you. Again Im not saying agree with us, but just have some common decency and be human with us. As we all should back to you as well. I know this got off topic (sorry) but I just saw this as an opportunity to educate and share my experiences because (no offense) this just seemed so out of touch with reality and hopefully help bring us together because we always need more of that. I hope at least one person at least treats the opposing side a little bit better with me saying this. Doesnt matter which side either.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"How is Jesus God's son if an angel impergnerated(raped a minor?)
