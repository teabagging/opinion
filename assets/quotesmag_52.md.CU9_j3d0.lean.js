Hes gay and for some reason believed that his brother hated him so much that hed vote conservative to take away his rights.  No idea where he got that and this dude is not a young guy!   Youd think he had more sense.  But he watched CNN all day and come Covid, he decided that since he wasnt going to get vaccinated, he was putting him at risk.  Then his brother talked to his dad. Who also watched CNN all day, went ahead and agreed that they didnt want to talk to him anymore.  Cause dad hated Trump and he also figured that to prove to his other son that he accepted him, he foresook his religion and did what his son wanted or needed.  Well his brother and his dad spoke to my bf when he called to say Happy 4th of July to them.  The brother told him off out of the blue and said he didnt feel he could talk around him, and that my bf voted for people who want to take his rights away.  (Idk which rights hes talking about actually.). Well, said that after he goes on his trip he didnt want to see him anymore.  The. The crazy thing is that his dad said yeah!   I feel like I cant watch what I want when youre in my house.   Maybe you shouldnt come around anymore.  (His dad was 88 yrs old and my bf spent half the week there taking care of his dad, unless his brother was on one of his 3 months long trips, the. He was there to take care of him everyday the previous two yearshis brother took his vaccines to be sure he could travel. So literally his dad disowned him.

But to them it was they considered that they didnt feel they could talk politics with him and came up with all kind of CNN accusations to what he must believe.   Idk.  It was so wild.  I was actually sitting them to deliver a Happy 4th message and instead my jaw is dropping because of what I was hearing.  These guys were a tight, Italian family and they were disowning him?   Not because they even talked politics. Thy knew hed been a republican his whole life, and they came to believe that republicans wanted to destroy the lives of everyone else.   Im sorry to ramble a bit here.  Its so crazy to have known them to be so tight and then just turn on him while saying he was after them!    So nuts!

Most specifically, most of us didn't care about the Beghanzi 'witch hunt' and didn't care for what the GOP was doing.  However ... the second the story broke during the Benghazi hearings about Hillary's private servers, most specifically clintonemail (dot) com, we all hit the Internet watchdog servers that track e-mail relays, including hers, over many years.Not only did we confirm her servers, what they were running, what certificates and encryption they were using (none for most of their time up -- we considered her contractors to be incompetent from that info from the get-go), we had confirm they were hacked by remote systems in China and Russia more than once, and we had the dates they were rebuilt.  We had all this information.  We also caught her contractor Combetta using a poorly masking handle on our boards, but we realized what software they used.  This is why Clinton's lawyers were smart to get the DoJ to prevent the FBI from seizing her computers, as well as using 'third party information,' namely ours in public service non-profits that many companies use to work together.That was the real tragedy.  I had FBI agents that couldn't legally use our information.  Of course they knew it was hacked, from our recordings.  They even had archives of it they could look at, as they use our information too.  But ... they couldn't follow those leads, and where they went, when it came to Clinton's servers.  So the damage would never be known, what we call 'spillage.'  Combetta had also bleachbit their drives, so the few computers and IoT devices they could seize, would never be found on them.That's why the FBI had to publicly say they, as part of the agreement with the DoJ that Clinton's lawyers had made, that they never found evidence of compromise.  That was true, the FBI itself never did, under the limitations of the investigation.  Unfortunately, the well documented and public reality is to the contrary, and ... the FBI has that too, everyone does.  And that's why ... it's tragic.  It's out there.  And it's not just right-wing sites.  In fact, Fox News makes me cringe, because they just futz up the truth, like they did with Dominion.  Because, just like with Dominion ...The whole story is way, way bigger than people realize.  Now with that said ...There was still one thing left over that we all couldn't understand.  If Hillary's e-mail servers were hacked, and knowingly hacked, and many other security entities use our blackhole lists, like we do -- part of the reason our companies fund these non-profits -- so we know which servers to NEVER talk to, and Clinton's were on them most of their existence ... how the heck did State's servers get those e-mails from her server?I worked with the DoD (again, I do space-based communication and related systems), so I knew they ran TrendMicro at State.  TrendMicro subscribed to at least 2 of the blackhole groups we did.  Her servers were on both.  So how the heck did she function?  And that ... was what came out in 2018!  FOIA release, as well as State publicly admitting ... they had been hacked.  The reason?Secretary Clinton ordered State to disable their TrendMicro security temporarily, and then ... later ... whitelist her servers.  So she sent all sorts of crap into State.  She also ordered the DoD to do the same, disable McAffe and ClamAV and others.  They told her FU, they weren't State.  She threw fits, but no one got fired at the DoD over it.  In fact, behind her back, everyone said 'Good Job,' including Colin Powell when he became aware at DoD (well before it was public).  That's part of the reason Powell was so pissed when Clinton tried to say it was the same thing as Powell using his AOL account at home to talk to a few people.  He didn't send anything with markings via e-mail!  He was long-time Army!  He's used to working in disconnected systems, and why nothing goes out over anything public!Now a few in State got fired for refusing to do things.  Ironically, that was a good thing.  Because ...I had 2 colleagues at State that wouldn't talk to me.  And trust me, I was up their rectums about, *\\"WTF?! You guys had to have known!  You're running TrendMicro!\\"*  As I indirectly found out later, both of them were charged, along with 15 others, and eventually over 30 total.  They were charged with all sorts of things for ... yep ... doing what the Secretary of State told them to do, which was a total violation of National Security (among other) policies.  That's why the people who got fired for not doing what Clinton told them to do, saved themselves from criminal prosecution by State after-the-fact, had they just done it as part of their job.Fortunately for my colleagues, the lawsuit went nowhere.  The union got involved, and it was largely *'let's not bring more attention to this.'*  But it happened.  And if you don't understand Blackhole lists and tracking of mail relays and other servers on the Internet by several non-profits that corporations fund, then I suggest you find an GNU/Linux and other Internet Cyber experts who will explain to you how that works.  They will tell you how clintonemail (dot) com was tracked from Day 1, and how we had all the information on her servers, what security they were using (or not), and when they were compromised too, with a change in utilization, vectors, etc...Again, this is all public information you can find, as it is freely shared.  We all work together to 'watchdog' much of the Internet, so systems that are knowingly open and compromised, or at least not using good ciphers, handshakes, signatures, etc.. are not communicated with.  And we track all that history too.  And the rest has all been FOIA releases.  I recommend people turn off the news, and talk to experts in this field.","title":"CMV: in the US many progressive ideas and challenge to the status quo, foreign policy, or wealth inequality, is and will continue to be stifled and silenced by Americas main stream news and the obscene ubiquity of corporate interests behind it."},{"text":"These immigrants come in from conservative countries and vote against liberal values and vote for strong men creating conditions of failure that existed in their own country.

When that one voting place in georgia closed for the night and trump was winning, they had security footage of suitcases being brought in the middle of the night and hidden under curtained tables. Like another reply said, fake water pipes busting, cardboard pizza boxes on windows. Mark Zuckerburg from what I understood not only funded but I think he had teams of  people working key polling locations and they could probably change the machine with codes. Just recently Colorado is in hot water because the codes were hidden on their website for anyone to see. Voting machine passwords for equipment in 34 of Colorados 64 counties were listed on a hidden tab on a spreadsheet posted on the Secretary of States website in June. So its more than possible, but iit was so much, and it was weird to see that NOBODY is in charge and NOBODY wanted to do anything about it.

If you recall, in most (all?) states voting laws are drafted and passed by state legislators and then signed into law by the governor. During Covid, because it was an emergency, many governors, Secretaries of State, and election officials just bypassed the legislation and made their own rules. One example from 2020 was how ballots were counted that were not postmarked by Election Day (illegal). Other new rules instituted included the practice of simply blasting out mail in ballots to addresses without a particular request. The typical way is that traditional absentee ballots are only mailed out with a specific request (i.e. I have a broken leg and cant drive). This led to a cyclone of mail in ballots going out to old addresses, duplicate ballots, people who werent even registered, etc.Many states also cleaned up their voter rolls. [Not] Shockingly, when Texas, Florida and Virginia did it, republicans crushed it in Texas and Florida  and almost won Virginia (amazing given Northern VAs composition). Why?

Fox News didn't have to lie, and say the election was hacked.  They could have just had a few Cyber experts on their shows, and left it at the truth.  That is ...The CISA audit destroyed Dominion's products.  They basically got blacklisted by the feds.  Fox News had nothing to do with that.There is a concept known as non-repudiation, and that means the ability to repudiate any claims of the system.  This is beyond the simple fact that Dominion was using a very old version with Android with many exploits that could be hacked in seconds.  The base issues were a combination of ...* No way to confirm signatures on the base software, that they hadn't been changed\\n* No way to confirm other changes to the system, or any modificationsThat is basic, system 101.  If you don't have that in a solution, it's not allowed in a secured environment period.  Especially that first one.  Automakers cannot even do that either.  Toyota got into big trouble over that.  But beyond that?  It got even worse, far worse!* Absolutely no key or other credential management, they could be accessed by anyone\\n* This included even if they were disconnected from the network, by non-technical peopleThe actual voting software was ... well ... a hackjob atop of that.  But even that alone isn't enough.  But the lack of any non-repudiation around the changes and key access, that was the death blow.Most specifically, CISA demonstrated that a *non-technical* poll worker could access the master keys and lock everyone else out of the system, controlling the units, and then have them do what they wanted ... including changing votes.  Combined with the lack of tracking modifications to the system, this was total lack of non-repdudation.Dominion started to offer some mitigations, like a literal 'paper trail,' but it wasn't enough.It was a very, very sad read for me.  I mean, even I just 'ignored' the Fox News reporting, because I figured it was Fox News just being Fox News.  I figured they wouldn't have been able to sell it if it didn't have basic non-repudiation of at least the system software, and some other mitigations.Understand I had colleagues reach out to me from DISA and DCSA.  You can look them up and what they do.  These are colleagues in DC who are registered Democrats (I'm registered No Party, there are many 'work' advantages to that, along with never doing any substances in my life, even uncontrolled ones).Nope, these government entities basically ignored everything, and governments that put them in didn't follow any authorities.  It's asinine to spent hundreds of hours securing space and other key communication networks, to ensure complete non-repudiation, like most networks, even private (by used by other entities), and then some political decision puts something like these on a similar network in another capacity.For example, there are very well documented cases of everything from nuclear power plants to military drone networks having highly secured control systems and other networks end up with crap like these systems on them that are not supposed to be there, or sold.It was so bad after the CISA audit came out, that the Biden administration forced the head of CISA to make a public statement.That no Dominion System was ever proven to be hacked.  The part he left out, and you could see him just making a statement and leaving is ... even if they were, they could never tell.  They'd have to catch the system, immediately take it off-line when it was compromised, and do an off-line comparison.Several experts showed rootkits and total control in ways that would pass even a complete comparison, unless it was off-line.  I've just never seen that allowed in a product.  I mean, even I've done it on newer Android systems myself.  If I had a hour with these units, I could totally control an election, including instructing non-technical poll workers in the case of airgap (no network) units.I guess **that's the real point:**  If you wanted to **shake any faith in the integrity** of an election, **use a Dominion** System e-Voting machine.  Anyone in Cyber that has read the CISA audit could tell you that!  It literally killed them overnight!Yes, Dominion screwed themselves by making a product that should have never been allowed to be sold to any government entity.  At most, all Fox did was bring attention to it.  Again, even I dismissed it at first, because ... it's Fox News.  But then my colleagues in DC I work with told me to actually go read the CISA audit.  I couldn't believe it.","title":"CMV: in the US many progressive ideas and challenge to the status quo, foreign policy, or wealth inequality, is and will continue to be stifled and silenced by Americas main stream news and the obscene ubiquity of corporate interests behind it."},{"text":"This is why having voting machines is stupid.

Is that the path America wants to go on?","title":"A very simple prescription for Democrats: Just wait | Semafor"},{"text":"I think you did a masterful job in summarizing evidence and synthetizing your opinions. I agree completely on all that you say. I have been talking about trans rights to a lot of conservatives and older people in my life. I want to throw my two cents on the  \\"language doesn't matter\\". In my experience, getting to older people (and youger men too sometimes!) is way easier if I let them use \\"imprecise\\" or even offensive language. If the spirit is in support, the language can arrive after. But the moment where someone gets aggressively called a bigot, a -ist or a -phobe because they used the wrong word is the moment where you lose them and the conversation is closed. Arguing in good faith means accepting that some people just might not know what is the current acceptable word, or might have a wrong model of what being trans means. I believe that most people are not malignant, even if some of them might be stubborn. (But, as you said, most people don't really care that much.)These kind of conversations should be carried largely by non-trans people. I think the left needs to bury forever the self-righteous, aggressive activist tone. The only thing it accomplished is virtue signaling and getting people mad. And sometimes, you need to accept results over feelings. If people are gross, but support you, that's still great. The 30yo rural guy that says that trans people are gross, but they can do them and he doesn't care? That's not a loss, that's a potential win. The 60yo woman that says God will show the way to trans people so no need to intervene from above to stop them? That's a potential win. The 45yo person that thinks trans people are mentally ill, so they need to be able to cure themselves? That's a potential win.These become wins when you get these people to support your policies, not your values. The cultural shift will come in due time. No use trying to force certain things in the California college progressive way. ---I have found that the reframing in terms of personal liberties works pretty well with conservatives. But it works best when I explicitly say that \\"people should be free to take choices and make mistakes without the government trying to play savior.\\" The explicit mention of mistakes seems to really help the people who just don't get it. Look, you don't have to get it to want the government to mind its business. As for kids, pushing it on the rights of the parents to choose what's best for them works well too. Imagine if the government told you your kid can't run barefoot or work in your farm on Sunday. Another good argument is that installing all the draconian measures to control that all of these trans people are kept in check waste so much money. We don't need more burocracy and waste of taxpayer's money. Their communities will guide and help them. They will pray to God and he will show them the way. (And the way, *sometimes*, happens to be transitioning.)I'm too tired to continue. Hope my words and experiences will be of some use.","title":"Trans Issues, Elections, and the Democrats"},{"text":"So yet ANOTHER swing state where Harris lost but another democrat on the ticket won...","title":"Democratic Rep.

His admin was also very focused on keeping unemployment as low as possible. Most of the inflation was inevitable but all of these policy choices worsened the effect.

There is no way to do it where hundreds, if not thousands of people would have to be involved and somehow nobody lets the cat out of the bag. There's so much disparity between how counties/precincts/cities run their polling sites and which equipment they used that you would not only need access to the machines, you would need an intimate familiarity with many types of them. That's actually the leading reason why our elections are so secure and why switching to people being able to vote from an app on their phones would be the worst possible idea. Our voting process, however clunky, is functionally unhackable at any scale that could actually tilt an election.Millions of votes are still being counted in California alone -- approximately 4.5-5M estimated votes outstanding. Plus another 4-7M across various other states that are democratic strongholds. Once those numbers are in, the final balance will start to look less cattywampus.Practically everyone in this sub, myself included, saw this coming back in June when the prospect of Biden dropping out became obvious. At the end of the day, Harris had 90 days to run a campaign against someone who's been persistently running and holding rallies for almost a full 10 years. That came on the heels of Biden basically being hidden away from the press and the public for much of his term, where whatever accomplishments they were making were getting almost zero press because they were effectively just press releases with canned talking points. Aside from that, Harris didn't really speak much to specific economic policies, immigration, Gaza, Ukraine, etc -- she was just trying to broadly be a cheerleader for the party and the things people really wanted to hear, they did not hear.By now we should now that in order to run an effective campaign against someone like Trump, you need Sanders/AOC-like energy to cut through the bullshit with the clearest, most concise and attention-grabbing language. The Democratic platform hasn't had any energizing chants you can yell at a rally or slap on a bumper sticker -- aside from maybe \\"Defund the Police\\" -- which did far more harm than good. In an age where people get most of their news from push notifications on their phones and watches where they only see the headlines and never read the article, you *absolutely* need messaging and a platform that is that clear if you want to connect with voters.She was the most viable candidate we had, but she was also given the fuzzy end of the lollipop by Biden going full-RBG on us and screwing the Democratic party and American people over in the process.

However, I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that they had no one from their generation, except Obama to look up to. A major part of this is because of the dinosaurs who wont retire. Pelosi is rich AF, and she had the Speaker position, and was, arguably, the most successful woman in U.S. politics besides Gloria Albright and Hilary Clinton. Does she still need to be in Congress? No. She could be doing speaking engagements or teaching at a university and doing so much better for herself than she is currently. I say this as a person who freaking loved her throughout Trump's first term because she called him out for his freaking horribleness. I think she might have the country's best interest in her heart, but is blindsided and wont let a younger generation take over. I actually think this says more about how Gen X went to Trump. They have never been trusted. Their whole generation has been treated as literal children. Until recently (this election), they were regarded as the only generation who consistently stayed liberal as they got older. Something has to be researched about this, especially since MORE boomers voted for Harris in this election. So, the \\"Okay, Boomer\\" meme is basically dead as far as I'm concerned. This also tracks with the Gen Z boys are misogynists obsessed with Andrew Tate. The 44-55 demographic are the parents of these incels. When you have a generation who thinks the movie Old School (2003, in FEBRUARY, a movie dumping ground month, nonetheless) is the height of all comedy when any millennial who rewatches it is horrified with it being a glorified date rape movie, makes it clear why Trump won. What happened to Gen X? That's the bigger question here. I think this is how they always were, but they were also extremely apathetic (as are their children, but that's another story). The apathy is why they had never voted in massive numbers until now. Being an educated person tracks with a longer life expectancy. The Boomers who voted in 2016 are dead. The ones who are left are the educated people who lean democrat. This makes complete sense. What we need to figure out is what happens when people reach their forties and suddenly decide they need to vote or the world will end. These people tend to lean conservative despite never voting before. I'm a teacher, so this is just from my observations, but something is seriously wrong with most of the children raised by Gen X. They throw slurs around like they're just an everyday word. They deny the Holocaust. They think demeaning women is funny. They don't read. They treat teachers worse than probably any generation that exists. Again, these children were raised by mostly Gen X (who had kids much later than Boomers because of the Recession). As a Millennial, I find this hard to reconcile because I thought Gen X was just so cool. But, now I realize they were always misogynistic, apathetic assholes. They taught their kids to be the same. This is not about climate change, a pandemic, or existential dread making these kids apathetic. It's the jerks who raised them. I know this isn't all of Gen X, but...wow. I think theres's a correlation that cannot be denied at this point. Again, as a teacher...just...wow this generation of parents are something else. I teach 6th grade, and this year is the first year where I have parents who are reasonable. This tracks because these folks are elder Millennial (mid to late thirties and early forties). Anyway, I'm tired of hearing that millennial parents are responsible for these kids and the general apathy and terror when it comes to teaching these days (I mean go on r/teachers and see the stories). It's Gen X.","title":"Nancy Pelosi Slams Supreme Court: 'Embarrassment to Our Founders'"},{"text":"Jill wore a red outfit on election day, maybe this was a symbol of her voting choice.","title":"Who thinks Biden secretly voted for Trump?"},{"text":"Didn't dick chenny at that time/during that administration, repeal a law that forced news outlets to be honest/truthful and also allowed them to start producing misleading headlines?

To help Immigration and Customs Enforcement carry out sweeping raids, he plans to reassign other federal agents and deputize local police officers and National Guard soldiers voluntarily contributed by Republican-run states.while the Trump team would likely seek a revamp of immigration laws, the plan was crafted to need no new substantive legislation. And while acknowledging that lawsuits would arise to challenge nearly every one of them, he portrayed the Trump teams daunting array of tactics as a blitz designed to overwhelm immigrant-rights lawyers.Any activists who doubt President Trumps resolve in the slightest are making a drastic error: Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown, Mr. Miller said, adding, The immigration legal activists wont know whats happening.Soon after Mr. Trump announced his 2024 campaign for president last November, he met with Tom Homan, who ran ICE for the first year and a half of the Trump administration and was an early proponent of separating families to deter migrants.In an interview, Mr. Homan recalled that in that meeting, he agreed to come back in a second term and would help to organize and run the largest deportation operation this countrys ever seen.One planned step to overcome the legal and logistical hurdles would be to significantly expand a form of fast-track deportations known as expedited removal. It denies undocumented immigrants the usual hearings and opportunity to file appeals, which can take months or years  especially when people are not in custody  and has led to a large backlog.More broadly, Mr. Miller said a new Trump administration would shift from the ICE practice of arresting specific people to carrying out workplace raids and other sweeps in public places aimed at arresting scores of unauthorized immigrants at once.To make the process of finding and deporting undocumented immigrants already living inside the country radically more quick and efficient, he said, the Trump team would bring in the right kinds of attorneys and the right kinds of policy thinkers willing to carry out such ideas.And because of the magnitude of arrests and deportations being contemplated, they plan to build vast holding facilities that would function as staging centers for immigrants as their cases progress and they wait to be flown to other countries.Mr. Miller said the new camps would likely be built on open land in Texas near the border.To increase the number of agents available for ICE sweeps, Mr. Miller said, officials from other federal law enforcement agencies would be temporarily reassigned, and state National Guard troops and local police officers, at least from willing Republican-led states, would be deputized for immigration control efforts.While a law known as the Posse Comitatus Act generally forbids the use of the armed forces for law enforcement purposes, another law called the Insurrection Act creates an exception. Mr. Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act at the border, enabling the use of federal troops to apprehend migrants, Mr. Miller said.Bottom line, he said, President Trump will do whatever it takes.\\nSome \\"good\\" news. \\n[Trumps Deportation Vow Fuels Fear and a Potential Showdown in New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/nyregion/trump-migrants-deportation-nyc.html?smid=nytcore-android-share)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Next up on old white man says...","title":"Bill Maher has brutal message for Democrats after Harriss election loss: Losers look in the mirror"},{"text":"Is this even legit?

Speaking of black churches...\\nAs soon as Sanders announced for President, the DNC did an email blast saying how great it was that he was running and asked for donations. I have no doubt that many were confused and assumed their donations would help Sanders, who was up against the czars of fund raising, the Clintons. Immediate after the church shoot out, Sanders sent his donors an email, asking us to donate to the church. So, two hits to his early fundraising, when his supporters were most enthusiastic. Hillary took a long time to say anything and finally made a speech, period--no attempt to fundraise. BLM ended up approving Sanders platform, not Hillary's, something hella more meaningful than pandering, but it made no difference. Sanders did carry the Millennial demographic, across the board, all races, genders, orientations, etc. But most of the rest of the black vote went to Hillary.

I searched it up and found this:https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F1go7z27ptl251.jpgAlso what is your political and economic ideology?Is it... libertarian? Are you doing the 'no true scotsman' that libertarians are so well known for?I think you owe Fancy-Knowledge a delta you're admitting it's a good theory that addresses the issue.My take on this is that MAGA are populist libertarian which demonstrates that authoritarianism can be part of that ideology, too. It in no way inoculates believers into adopting smaller government or much of anything else.Consider: how do you achieve libertarian goals? Well, obviously you need authority and even in your essay you admit you need jail and prison systems.Socialists also have a problem admitting to this. If you want to transform society you'll have to throw a lot of people in jail.You need a big bloated gov't to insist that no one gives foreign aid.https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetlingThis always deserves to be part of the conversation and is a great read.I think communism is popular in North America, too. Whenever you see someone saying \\"ACAB\\" or \\"Eat the rich\\" it's primarily about class warfare. Socialists and social progressives talk about welfare a lot more than they do actual socialist policies and all you got to do is scratch the surface to find lots of class warfare.Mostly i want to impress that there is a huge difference between academic registered Libertarians and the populists that define the movement. The ideology is primarily based on selfishness; you can't trust fellow libertarians or anarchists to uphold anything meaningful when it comes to ethics or organization.[This is the most libertarian image i've ever seen](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.standard.co.uk%2Fs3fs-public%2Fthumbnails%2Fimage%2F2020%2F07%2F16%2F09%2Fdonaldtrumpposegoya16072020.png%3Fwidth%3D1024%26auto%3Dwebp%26quality%3D50%26crop%3D968%3A645%252Csmart&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=54d06eabde4983adb4f3a13d22f08597263884aa1ddd51bb52f126bd22e4b2e5&amp;ipo=images) and at the same time inherently authoritarian. The horseshoe is the only thing that can describe it.The simplest way to describe the horseshoe theory is that the more extremist you become the more you have in common with your political opponents. IMO the answer isn't to become a fence sitting apologist centrist it is to be moderate.That brings me to my main view change: it's an orb.

We actually got into some shouting matches during family gatherings. They actually went to protests in DC!  What helped get them going was actually a trip my BIL had to take to repair an investment property.  He ended up staying with his parents in Oklahoma where they watched fox news (which I don't recommend). My BIL ended up watching shows where they would say the opposite of what MSNBC would say.  He didn't all of a sudden believe what fox said but he knew that both things could not be true, he went on a fact-finding mission and saw that MSNBC was misrepresenting (to say the least) the details of certain events and positions.  He did the research and discovered this for himself, he had to figure it out, but he had to know that there was a disparity in what the media was representing.  Both things can't be true, when presented with an argument, he was able to look up the facts and see for himself what was true.I helped him along with facts (not FOX!) to help him with his awakening and before I knew it, he was deprogrammed. It took 3 months and it was a huge issue for our family. People programmed by media and college have to discover the truth for themselves.

Instead, they told Walz to stop being so mean, ignored the concerns of Arab-American voters and started palling around with a bunch of unpopular Bush-era Republicans. They had data telling them that wasn't working - that the Reagan love fest at the convention had stunted slowed their momentum - but they didn't care.  They wanted to run an aggressively centrist campaign more than they wanted to listen to what the moment was asking for, and were willing to risk a Trump presidency.

Is that right?Because just to give you a super short summary:1. Trump didn't return a bunch of presidential documents. NARA asked for them back and negotiated for about a year until he turned some of them over.2. NARA found a pile of classified documents in the boxes. This freaked them out and they contacted the DOJ.3. The DOJ requested Trump to turn over all classified documents in his posession. He refused.4. The DOJ obtained a court order *requiring* him to turn over documents. He had his aide move some of the boxes into another location, then had his lawyer conduct a search and hand over what she found, stating that this was everything. He askes his aid to delete footage of them moving the boxes.5. The DOJ, knowing he had not complied due to statements of other witnesses was forced to seize the documents and charge trump.You think that is **outrageous on the DOJ?**Some quick rebuttals to your possible complaints:1. Whatabout Joe! Joe Biden immediately informed the DOJ when documents were found at his former office. He complied with all searches voluntarily and the only additional material located was his personal journals which contained material that was classified. Due to a precedent dating back to Ronald Reagan, Joe believed that he was within his rights to keep these and the Republican special prosecutor agreed.2. He psychically declassified them! That isn't how this works. Even if it was, Trump was ordered to hand over documents bearing 'classification markings' meaning that he still obstructed justice. And even if he did psychically declassify them he isn't legally allowed to do so with nuclear secrets. Those are classified under statute from congress and Trump had them in his possession when they were taken.The fact that you honestly try to argue that it is outrageous for trump to be charged for such a blatant crime is profoundly sad.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"Shes part of the problem.

You really cant see the games until you read all the media (like you said), and even then, if you have personal sources, you can see that its just plain made up babbling half the time. There might be a tiny grain of truth hidden in the puzzle, sometimes. They really prey on emotion and bank on people having no clue, especially about finance. Thats where I see either journalists making unbelievable mistakes or deliberate lies the most. They misrepresent business practices a lot, too, trying to frame certain things as unethical while excusing other things as standard or acceptable. It never makes sense until you step back and consider who might be influencing them or what their agenda might be. Sometimes I think some journalists are genuinely just dumb with math, though. What blows my mind is the inflammatory headlines versus the information in the actual article. I read one that said Trump was a human trafficker in the headline, and the two quotes about him in the article were that *he drank Diet Coke and was always a gentleman.* That was the only mention of him at all! ??It happens on every topic, not trying to be partisan, but that was the most egregious example Ive ever seen. Another thing is to *never, ever* read a media summarization of a press conference, hearing, trial, interview, etc. Watch the whole thing or assume what youve been told is a lie. I got duped by the RFK, Jr. eating a dog thing, too, so even pictures lie! You can find the truth in whats *not* reported, and by having your own sources on the ground. I knew the Aurora thing was true because I am the one taking tenant calls and emails about how scared they are. Just talking to a lot of people will give you a greater picture of the truth, in general. Using your own powers of observation tells the story, too. For example, you can know to take crime statistics with a grain of salt when youve been robbed a couple times and dont bother to call the cops because they dont respond, or you see crimes happen all the time. I see drug deals constantly and no one is narcing on them, but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist. Everyone is capable of breaking from the mind control, but I think a lot of people are way too comfortable taking direction from authority figures. They dont trust themselves to do independent thinking.

Nobody has ultimate power in the United States government. The President is definitely the most powerful individual in the US government but he doesn't have infinite power to do anything, and in fact in some ways is quite constrained. The president isn't a legislator in any way, for example, and anything he does needs to be authorized by some law or other.In practice this means that Trump has pretty low ability to fuck with the core elements of American democracy. He can make terrible policy, of course, but only terrible policy within the ordinary space of policy. He can't abolish elections or anything like that. He has rid his administration of anyone who would stand against him and stacked it with loyalistsEvery administration replaces opposing political appointees with their own. Last time around proved that Trump is bad enough at this (or just a repugnant enough person to be around) that even people he appoints specifically to be loyal to him are often not. So I wouldn't even count on this for political appointees.As for non-political appointees, Jerome Powell (head of the Fed) has openly said that he doesn't think the President has the legal authority to fire him and if Trump tries he'll just refuse. So like, if he tries shenanigans there's gonna be way more of a fight than you think.  he has the house, he has the senate,He has the house by at most a few votes, and it's still possible at this point that he doesn't have it at all. Right now it's looking like maybe 2-3 moderate Republicans could stop legislation if they wanted. (For context, there's [two Republicans that voted to impeach Trump in the incoming House](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4980866-newhouse-valadao-pro-trump-impeachment-republicans-survive-reelection/).) Is that gonna stop bad policy, no, cuz we're still talking about Republicans here. But it would stop anything majorly anti-democratic.And he also only has the Senate by a filibuster-able amount. Not that that necessarily means anything, but they didn't blow up the filibuster last time even when they had the chance. he has the courtsThe Supreme Court and many of the lower courts are mostly Republican, yes, and this has worrying implications but it's not quite as bad as you think. Last time Trump tried to push election denialism through the courts, he got smacked down consistently. Trump actually fails in court all the time, both as a private citizen and last time he was president. They will spend the next four years fortifying the country, its laws and policies in such a way so as to assure that the Democrats are as backfooted as possible in an electionElection laws are mostly set state-by-state. It's in theory possible for Congress to make laws about elections, but it would be very unprecedented for Congress to do this explicitly to give one party an advantage. And see above: they'd have to get it past an extremely narrow House majority if they even have one at all, and then past a fairly narrow Senate and filibusterable Senate majority. And then when someone inevitably sues over it, it'd also have to get through the courts, which again are not necessarily as loyal to Trump as an individual as you might think.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"This has always been the case.

It's never really worked for Democrats. But this cycle in particular they seemed to feel the incessant need to entrench themselves firmly in the culture wars as their primary election strategy. They were hoping to game numbers with certain groups based on mixes of and gender.  They ran on abortion simply because it was successful in bringing out the vote in earlier elections. They completely took for granted how the economic classes would vote.  They also completely allowed conservative narratives to dominate the new media, and the old media wasn't doing much to play ball either. \\n \\nThey spent 4 years ignoring their base about inflation, immigration,  housing, crime,  homelessness. Regardless of how bad the problems actually were (some worse than others), they did nothing to try and change the perception.  What they did do was easily spun as being condescending, ineffective,  and out of touch. I don't know what they expected.  Republicans were working in lock step to exploit these things in swing states and places where Democrats had gotten complacent.  Bussing homeless and illegal immigrants to cities was a shit thing to do but it's a real good example.   The outcome worked to their favor.  While Democrats would go out and say how much they disapprove of this,  and then go out and devote more resources to the newcomers than they did to their cities own struggling residents.

Don't get me started on his lack of allies and legislative accomplishments for someone who spent 40 years in DC. Republican's know how to play the game. They didn't want trump in 2016. They ran everyone against him and when he won the primary they got into line and excommunicated everyone who disagreed. They got a 7-2 Supreme court out of the deal, ended roe v.s. wade and now look poised to take every chamber in the rematch. To get what you want to win and too many people who want essentially what democrats want broadly are too eager to sabotage them for what? Too feel good about themselves? Too say they are morally right? Step back 5 steps and realize that democrats largely want too fix health care, have more equitable society, protect civil liberties, fix the climate, advance sciences and protec social safety net and get behind a candidate that can deliver on this by winning general election. But this concept of strategy seems to be lost on many people who want to get some kind of intellectual brownie points.

They can't bring their phones or personal computers in. They can't bring any classified documents out. The computers that hold these documents are not connected to the internet. Even the janitors might hold clearances, or have FBI background checks, or have to be monitored at all times by security staff.The reason it's illegal to remove classified documents from these facilities, even if you don't try to sell them to a foreign state, is that they're totally insecure outside of these facilities.

I want the Democrats to win again and I believe firmly that we need to protect trans rights. However, we cannot get there by screaming down and refusing to engage with others who raise concerns in good faith. ?We did not lose the 2024 election because of any trans person or issue. We lost, in part, because we shame and belittle too many opinions held by too many voters and that needs to stop. Lets have these debates now, determine a new strategy for our party since our existing one failed, and then unite to oppose the Trump agenda wherever it imperils American values.Edit: I do think his comment about \\"former males\\" was said in an abrasive way that was more accusatory than starting a conversation.Edit 2: I received a rather hateful DM and wanted to clarify my stance. I feel this way about a number of issues, but for trans athletes in sports specifically, here are my thoughts. If someone says, \\"hey, I'm concerned that trans women may have an advantage because of exposure to high levels of testosterone during puberty,\\" rather than doing what I have witnessed some Dems do and calling the person \\"transphobic\\" and shaming them for having that question, we need to engage with the person in a conversation and calmly present our arguments (e.g., findings in research) so the person feels their concerns are being acknowledged so we dont push them away to the other side and more hateful views. When people are raising concerns in good faith, we should engage with them in good faith.","title":"Massachusetts Democrat Seth Moulton hits back over progressive 'purity test,' boys in girls' sports"},{"text":"Even politicians should have enough of an understanding of a topic that they can make some coherent remarks on the spot.

A right-wing ideology, despite the confusing name, that is associated with the Chicago School of Economics.  This is where right-wing shitheads like Milton Friedman came from.  Liberalism in economics means \\"liberalizing\\" markets from government regulations.  Neoliberals believe in letting corporations act almost without interference from the government.

Somebody on either blue sky or Twitter I can't remember which one mentioned something about it was weird because the discrepancy between the North Carolina governor's race in the President's races is so wide and why is that That's it's strange. Spoiler alert it's not strange it's within the two to 4% difference that they're usually is in North Carolina. But when I added the total of all the votes counted for the presidential race All the minor parties Democrat and Republican and then I tabulated all the votes for the House of Representatives there is a huge discrepancy of 566,000 votes. Now I thought that was odd so I decided to go back and look it up and do some research. In North Carolina the prior 7 elections from 1996 to 2020 the difference between House of Representative vote totals and the president vote totals was around 2.5%. This election it's 10.08%. And the only reason I stopped at 96 is because I couldn't find the information for the House of Representatives in a digestible way prior to 1996. I had to start going through PDFs from North Carolina's website and hand tabulating data and I wasn't going to do all that.I then decided to look at other states and I found that Pennsylvania is the same thing as well.  Pennsylvania has 556,000 more presidential votes then they do votes for the House of Representatives or 8.02%. and in the last four elections the House of Representative vote totals was an average of 3.5% difference. So still double what it would normally be. Now I don't know what this means, But it was really odd. Because I checked all the other swings states and and it's not the case in any of the other swing states and then I just checked some random states and it's not in those states either.

It was a real, legitimate concern, and it's not something that had perfect predictors of outcome, no matter what folks might say, in this sub or in the media. Yes he had low approval numbers, but there was no guarantee any other candidate would end up with better numbers, especially that late in the game. It was a real risk, and the fact that it went as well as it did was actually a surprise to people which is why it was so noteworthy. So yeah, Biden waited too long.  But in additon to stubbornness and vanity it's likely that he and his staff, and the whole of the Democratic Party leadership for that matter, were legitimately afraid that him dropping out would make it more likely Trump would get elected, and that wasn't an unrealistic way to view the situation.","title":"This Is All Joe Bidens Fault"},{"text":"what are you talking about... not sure how that's not evidence. can you clarify?","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"My gripe with the tough on illegal immigration thing is that all these Vietnamese, Jamaicans, El-Salvardorians, Cubans, etc. fled here after we absolutely ruined their homeland.

Sure, he says some batshit crazy things, but he's not afraid to do it.  Harris (and Hilary Clinton) would not.  Everything was a careful orchestration of soft questions.Look at the immense popularity of Obama and Bill Clinton.  They interviewed and came across as real people, and not as party puppets.I had this insight when watching Bush 2.0 vs Kerry in 2004.  Bush was doing a quick interview at Camp David.  He was wearing jeans that were broken in.  His dogs ran up to him to greet him.  Same news clip, Kerry appears in public as the \\"common man\\" wearing jeans that look like they came right off the shelf.  The jeans were riding like you might fit trousers for a suit.  One guy looked out of touch, and the other looked real.Personally, this shouldn't matter, but a whole lot of people aren't voting based on policies, but merely on trust.  People trust based on appearances, for right or wrong.  It worked very well for Obama, Clinton, Reagan.  It worked poorly for Hilary, Harris, Kerry, Mondale, Bush senior (who did have other things going for him though).Remember the \\"get out and vote\\" drives, \\"it doesn't matter who you vote for, just vote\\".  This is what you get.Trump may be out of touch from the daily lives of the common man, but he admits it.  When he says the system is rigged he admits it benefits him.  Not so for the Democratic Party elite -- like Nancy Pelosi for instance.Overall, I think what's going on is that the Dems are acting like they have a mandate from the people, but they forgot to bring the people along.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"That and some more ghetto twerking at the rallies and she might be able to pull it off","title":"Trump wins Arizona, flipping a swing state Biden won in 2020"},{"text":"They literally ban anyone who gives a right of center comment about anything.

This is the thing, if he cares about his legacy, he will try to win over the elites and that means no mass deportation, no screwing with the monetary system, and not too much disruption to the global order. The idea that hell push austerity is far fetched to me because he gauges success by how the stock market does. His mandate is to fix the economy; deporting millions of non-documented immigrants will hamper agriculture and the service industry significantly. The dirty secret about illegal immigration is that it largely benefits business owners at the expense of American workers. His first two years will be his time to push his most ambitious agendas. The more ambitious the idea is, the more likely it will be enjoined by the courts. While SCOTUS is now a GOP lapdog, it takes many months if not years to get them to render most decisions (with some exceptions).The only wildcard is a mass catastrophe, like another pandemic (bird flu?), escalation of war, or a serious attack on the US homeland.

(Texas has been attempting to take children from trans parents for a few years now and those kinds of attacks will become more common with Trump back)7. Right to free speech. (Being forced to go by an identity that you are not is forced speech, this includes one's legal name and gender markers; Many of the books being banned and burned right now are written about trans people or by trans people)8. Right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. (Trans prisoners are V-Coded right now and also denied medically necessary healthcare.)9. Right to be safe from abuse and violence (Trans children are often abused or abandoned by their parents to be homeless as young as middle school. That and conversion torture is still legal in many states. Many states still allow the trans panic defense which makes murdering a trans person for being trans legal or reduces the charges. )10. Freedom from state persecution.

And then there's an amount of people who vote Sanders but not Biden (they will be X) and people who vote Biden but not Sanders (Y).The first statement essentially says \\"YX\\". That the amount of people who abandon the Dems if Sanders isn't the nominee is lower than the amount who abandon if Biden is.But the second statement says \\"XY\\", that Bernie couldn't win because the amount of people who would abandon him is larger than the amount that stays. Now of course Sanders non voting progressives would be dumb if we see politics as a single line from left to right because Biden is closer to Sanders than Trump is, while moderates leaving makes sense if Sanders is further from them than Biden is.But 1.

That crystal chandelier is a classy and timeless design choice for the dining room however when you apply the word to a person usually it needs to mean more and would speak to their outward appearance and personality or character.I disagree that Marilyn Monroe was classy. While I dont know her, I would agree that she was beautiful, charismatic, and often carried herself well in the styles and clothing of the time. The sophistication piece is not there for me. Having affairs with married men and wearing clothing that shows a great deal of skin is not sophisticated, or heavy with manners and dignity, or thoughtfulness towards others. A better complimentary word for her would be charming or enchanting or glamorous.I should also add that I dont think a person needs to be classy to be a good person, its just a descriptor that doesnt apply to everyone.","title":"CMV: Elegance and Class Are About Presentation, Not Just Personal Choices"},{"text":"its upsetting that everytime trump did something like that they them ad, the harris team did nothing.

Sanders, of course, ran on a policy platform well to Clintons left  but was able to do so in a way that allowed him to win over voters that disdain the liberal label.Of the ones that switched to Trump, only about 25 percent also voted for a Democratic candidate for Congress. And we do have a little bit about what they did in 2012  it looks like they were split roughly evenly, 50-50, between Obama and Romney. So these appear to be people who are trending out of the Democratic Party.Of those Bernie voters who supported Trump in the general election, the average age was 52. Those who stuck with Clinton were an average age of 45, and of those who broke for a third party, the average age was 44. Of those that didnt vote, their average age was 35  these were the ones that got activated by Bernie, and then dropped back out when he didnt win. Its worth noting that very few of the primary voters stayed home. People who vote in primaries are highly engaged in politics  theyre not people who come in and out of the electorate.I also looked at how the Bernie-Trump voters identify themselves on the ideological scale, and very few say that theyre liberal. Only about 17 to 18 percent say that theyre liberal, in any kind of way, shape, or form, though they voted for Sanders.(Importantly liberal in these surveys is typically the left most option. It's often framed as \\"Liberal, Moderate, Conservative\\". The leftists would have picked the liberal option mostly)By contrast, about 45 percent of these Bernie-Trump voters say theyre middle of the road  basically, a lot of them see themselves as moderates. Meanwhile, another 35 percent of them are claiming to be either somewhat conservative or very conservative.And from the WaPoAnd, again, the bigger cleavage involved race. For example, in December 2011, 75 percent of Sanders-Trump voters agreed with this statement: If blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites. Only 16 percent of Sanders-Clinton voters agreed.Similarly, when how they felt about whites and blacks on a 0-100 scale, Sanders-Trump voters rated blacks 9 points lower than Sanders-Clinton voters. But Sanders-Trump voters rated whites 8 points higher.The same thing was true for other minority groups. Compared with Sanders-Clinton voters, Sanders-Trump voters rated Latinos 11 points less favorably, Muslims 20 points less favorably, and gays and lesbians 31 points less favorably.A good portion of voters are just weird af, we see that now and we've seen that then. They don't have coherent idealogies. It doesn't make much sense why a homophobic conservative old white person went for Sanders to begin with, but some small amount were.","title":"They took our vote for granted: immigrants abandon Kamala Harris in New York"},{"text":"Gen Z going full MAGA was not something I had on my bingo card, but it makes sense when you think about it","title":"Biden vows to make every day count before leaving White House to Trump"},{"text":"Yea she just was in a fluff piece for the NYT about how this election wasnt a full blown rebuttal of Dems.

The Dems lost Hispanics, Asians, Blacks, men and less educated white women while increasing their gains across white educated women and those making $100k+. The Dems lost the Hispanic and Asian vote on immigration. If the Dems think going more left on cultural issues is going to win back Hispanics, Asians, men, Blacks and uneducated white women - then I wish them luck.","title":"Harper Steele Doesnt Give a F About Politicians and Pundits Blaming Kamala Harris Loss on Democrats Support of Transgender Rights: Were Not Here to Be the Sacrifice"},{"text":"Robots.","title":"Nancy Pelosi Slams Supreme Court: 'Embarrassment to Our Founders'"},{"text":"The solution is to avoid culture war issues altogether and focus on a platform centered in economic populism.","title":"Harper Steele Doesnt Give a F About Politicians and Pundits Blaming Kamala Harris Loss on Democrats Support of Transgender Rights: Were Not Here to Be the Sacrifice"},{"text":"People have been hired based on gender and skin color for generations.

These are all changes that couldnt be undone by Biden. Biden did accomplish a lot in terms of policy, but really didnt (between not being able to and not prioritizing) secure long-term objectives for the left the same way that Trump did for the right. We can speculate on how much of what Biden did can remain after he leaves office but we still feel so many of the effects of the Trump presidency today. Imagine if the Biden administration had passed some law that could secure Americas participation in the Paris Agreement, or had packed the courts as was proposed. Unfortunately the American electorate is fickle at best so it seems that the best case scenario for any leader is going to be to find ways to guarantee the continued execution of their policies beyond their time in office, lest the next president try to unravel it all. This is clear to the right. The Affordable Care Act is standing on weak foundations as an example of a policy that has only stayed around because an alternative would be terrible, but at this point its not clear that the Trump administration would care about how unpopular ending it could be.","title":"Joe Biden and the democrats did NOTHING with this presidency"},{"text":"No. Im tired of being nice about a fucking rapist.","title":"President-elect Trump has accepted President Biden's invitation to an Oval Office meeting next week"},{"text":"Exactly.

A mini primary would have given the appearance of screwing over Harris. Giving Harris the nod was unfair to other potential candidates. 2. The war in Gaza continued and the administration had to support Israel. Netanyahu was likely trying to help his friend Trump with his handling of the war. 3. Inflation as a result of pandemic spending. A sitting republican president would also have been blamed the inflation and for so many innocent Palestinians dying from US supplied weapons. The American electorate have short memories and operate on information fed to them by billionaire owned media who sensationalize every minute of every day. Americans are also programmed by unbridled capitalism to worship money and consume products and less value is placed on ethics and decency. The majority also have a need to fit themselves into a hierarchy where they have superiors they must fear and they have people under their boot as well.

One prominent adviser to the campaign said explicitly, he wont be running for reelection. That same advisor said that by signaling this one-term run, it would make the candidate a good transition figure.That transition line is important, because its one Biden himself used publicly and on the record. I view myself as a transition candidate, Biden said at an online fundraiser in April 2020. In March of that year, at a rally where his eventual VP pick Kamala Harris was by his side, he used similar language: I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else.https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/4718993-did-biden-break-his-one-term-pledge/\\nA shitload of his advisors, friends and people aroudn him said he was stating he'd probably be a one term president and as quoted, he was on the record describing himself as a transition president, someone to get from Trump to someone new who, if he was a transition president, someone he would pick to bring up during his 4 years by attaching to legislation and gaining them some reputation with which to run for president in 2024.His age and random bouts of poor speech were a problem in 2019 while he started campaigning let alone after 4 years of being president. As he got worse through his term it became very increasingly clear he should absolutely not run again and yet did.It also sounds in part like a ploy to get the nominee, like I have name awareness, we need to beat trump, pick me and I'll help the next guy win in 2024, then when he got it, did I say that... nah I'm the guy for 2024 too, what you going to do about it.","title":"Nancy Pelosi blames Joe Biden for election loss as finger pointing intensifies"},{"text":"I dont think the American people are ready for a female president even though she was by far the best candidate.
