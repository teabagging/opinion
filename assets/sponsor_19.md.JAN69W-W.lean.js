So I'm not sure why you think that giving states at the bottom of the pile a slight boost somehow grants them disproportionate power when literally no one pays attention to them anyway.","title":"CMV: The Electoral College is not great, but is better than a Popular Vote in that it represents a closer bridge to Parliamentarianism and could bolster the integrity of State Governments (if done well), both of which I consider to be positives."},{"text":"for being a neonazi","title":"European Green Parties want Jill Stein to drop out of the race and put her support behind Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Well Abortion is the most important thing in our nation,  we need abortion, we want abortion,  yaaa abortion.....NOT","title":"I saw this and it summed up the Dems perfectly to me"},{"text":"Apologize for what?","title":"European Green Parties want Jill Stein to drop out of the race and put her support behind Kamala Harris"},{"text":"My mother, a very close friend, and a couple of casual acquaintances.

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America's most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington's humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln's moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump's conductboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6threveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump's character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246\\\\_The\\\\_Character\\\\_and\\\\_Eligibility\\\\_of\\\\_Donald\\\\_Trump\\\\_A\\\\_Critical\\\\_Examination/stats](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats)","title":"Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Michigan by 3 points in final Detroit Free Press poll"},{"text":"I dont believe this ..I think he is polling around 35 percent .and those are mostly his bottom dweller supporters ..again , if either candidate was boosted way higher than the other , that would keep people from voting the media on both sides know what they are doing","title":"Polls are polls but I feel good about Tuesday!!!!!

Our country was way more politically activated in 2020 than in 2016. I didn't vote in 2016 (to my lifelong shame) but I did in 2020. The democrats didn't gain my support, I just got off my ass. I think lots of Republicans were in the same boat. People were hyped up on both sides and the numbers showed it.I know it's anecdotal but I've seen much less enthusiasm on the right this cycle. Way less Trump signs. Way less Trump caravans. Way less red hats. Way less everything. What I've seen more of though is Harris signs. Groups of supporters on the side of the road waving Harris flags and handing out info. It feels like we rekindled the momentum when we switched to Kamala, while Republicans are just burning out.Maybe I'm off and this ages like milk.

Sure, there were gaffes, there were *reasonable* concerns about things like foreign policy, critiques of five-point-plans and such, hell, both parties even tended to agree on what problems to solve. Go back and watch an old debate.We didn't see this with McCain, Romney, etc, but then you had the 2016 primaries. Trump constantly in the news because he got more views than the other \\"boring\\" candidates. People flocking, haters and fans alike, at news about how he was an asshole towards someone. Big advertiser revenue, so they kept the spotlight on him, and encouraged him to continue the behavior. I still don't think he was planning on receiving the nomination, let alone win, but the only thing the media reported was how much of an asshole he was to other nominees, or how weak they looked by not being as much of an asshole back to him.The birth of a cult. Trump loves media attention (check out this list of his [aliases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonyms_used_by_Donald_Trump)) and his behavior got his ratings up while emboldening people who like assholes (read: other assholes). It also created an entire new generation of assholes, all celebrating his assholery. And since there's no such thing as bad publicity, his haters have been dragged along stuck in a similar loop ever since.But yeah, it's reddits fault. It's propaganda, coordinated by the Illuminati. It's not that *everyone* has been conditioned for the past 8 years now to constantly see that chud in the news, every single day, and either condemn him or applaud (and send money to!) him. We're totally not in a feedback loop. /sPolitics isn't about issues anymore. It's about whether you're in the cult or not.

After a lengthy criticism of former President Donald Trump, saying that Democratic presidential nominee \\"Harris' best asset is that she's not Trump,\\" the endorsement, written by the newspaper's editorial board, states: \\"Beyond her basic qualifications of human decency, self-control and mature leadership skills, her career path from law enforcement to the U.S. Senate to the vice president's office illustrates independence, drive and a steely spine.\\" Newsweek reached out to the Trump and Harris campaigns via their websites for comment on Friday. The newspaper praised Harris' emphasis on health care and business, noting the vice president's commitment to policies that may resonate with Texans, including \\"expanding access to affordable health care and her detailed plans to support small businessesa backbone of Houston's economy.\\" The editorial board also lauded Harris for being \\"a champion of federal protections for abortion rights, desperately needed in Texas where an extreme ban doesn't include exceptions for rape or incest or enough protections for women with severe pregnancy complications.\\" They praised Harris' \\"assertive and clever\\" prosecutorial style while accepting her change of stance on other issues, such as fracking and addressed her views on other pressing issues, including immigration. \\"She's backed a tough bipartisan border bill that Trump undermined for political gain,\\" the article said. In the endorsement, Harris was described as having \\"workable policy ideals\\" that \\"would help Americans afford their first homes and provide expanded child tax credits to the parents of newborn babies.\\" On the subject of family, Harris was commended on her role as a \\"beloved step-parent.\\" At the end of the article, readers were asked to \\"consider one question before you cast perhaps the most consequential vote of your lifetime.\\" The question being: \\"If the brown floodwaters were rising around your house and the Cajun Navy could only send a small boat, who would you trust to pick you up: Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? We know who we'd trust.\\" When asked about the thought process behind the Chronicle's endorsement, the newspaper said: \\"We, as journalists, strive for fairness when evaluating candidates, and on the editorial board, we feel firmly that Donald Trump is not fit for the presidency. \\"This decision did not require hours of debate. The question was how to relay this message, how to tell people that this is the right decision for president without inflaming them. We try to find common threads and goals. A leader in moments of a national emergency should bring people together, not separate them.\\" The Houston Chronicle's staunch endorsement of Harris follows The Philadelphia Inquirer publicly endorsing her in an opinion column titled \\"Kamala Harris for president, Endorsement\\" published Friday. Written by its editorial board, The Philadelphia Inquirer, which has the largest circulation in Pennsylvania, listed several reasons for endorsing the vice president, including Trump's ongoing legal issues, the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, reproductive rights, climate change and more. The public backings follow the recent controversy surrounding major papers, such as the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, refusing to endorse either presidential candidate this year. The Chronicle's endorsement could prove significant in mobilizing voters in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city. The newspaper's support is seen as a boost for Harris, who has been working to expand Democratic inroads in traditionally conservative areas and secure Texas' 40 electoral votes in what is expected to be an extremely close election.","title":"Kamala Harris Scores Major Endorsement in Texas"},{"text":"I don't think ~~Race Bannon~~ Pence endorsed Harris, though he did say he would not support Trump.

The Inflation Reduction Act has so many parts in it, I have no idea how you would explain it in soundbytes.That said, I do think Harris could have done a better job communicating on the economy.  Biden had a major disconnect from people because he focused on the Macro economy, which was doing really well, but failed to understand that average people didn't feel that way.I would have like if Harris, very early on had said something like \\"We've spent four years rebuilding the fundamentals of our economy, and they are strong.  But I understand that a lot of us are still feeling pain at home, so that is the next steps.  Because we have the strong fundamentals, we can now focus our efforts on making your lives easier\\"  and then lay out specific ideas for cutting costs (these came much later, and even then, I feel like she didn't focus enough on the bread and butter cost issues.If Trump does win (god please no), it will be because some portion of voters think the economy will be better under him.However, I don't think this is entirely her fault.  I actually understand why Joe thought he could successfully run again, but that decision meant that Harris had an incredibly short time to create and refine her messages, all while not undercutting her boss.  A full primary would have provided time for the creation and more refinement of these messages.  That said, for the most part, I'm amazed with how well she has handled herself despite the handicap.","title":"Michelle Obama asked the question were all thinking, but struggle to answer"},{"text":"Yeah, but the edits made him look better.

The thing is, I see +6 and think theyre actually returning +10. Allred is a good example. Hes now 45-44. But the way Cruz has been talking for weeks, those are old numbers. I expect theyre returning +4 there. Another pollster said he cant do focus groups properly anymore, because he cannot find Independent women.

Democractic Primaries are usually a race to left/progressive wing and the general is a race back to the center.  It's the same with GOP Primaries too and this is a big flaw in our political system that tends to deliver shitty candidates to the General Election.  The reason is that only the most engaged voters tend to vote in the primaries and those voters are overwhelmingly from the left/right wings of their own parties.In 2020, she was trying so hard to keep one foot in the progressive wing and another foot anchored to the center that her remarks and answers to questions were muddled and she looked indecisive.   To be fair, navigating the primaries vs. the general election is a very difficult political skill to pull off.  She didn't have to deal with that dynamic this time and I think it made her a lot more comfortable on the campaign trail.Also, despite her voting record being pretty progressive, she really is much more of a centrist than it appears.  I was all-in for her at the beginning of 2020 (I'm a California voter and have followed her career closely), but thought she was abysmal at campaigning. I never doubted her to be a competent executive.  I am very impressed with the discipline of her campaign since Biden dropped out.","title":"Kamala Harris has met the moment.

Almost every poll with a &lt;3% spread between the candidates were within the margin of error, rendering the vast majority of polls useless for making statistical inferences. More interesting, I found very few polls favoring Trump that had more than n=2000, and all were within the margin of error. Now, where things get interesting, there was [a poll that had Harris winning by %,](https://sites.tufts.edu/cooperativeelectionstudy/2024/10/28/ces-estimates-on-the-2024-presidential-election/) that had a sample of 78,000 people. [You can play around with the data on a bar graph here](https://cooperativeelectionstudy.shinyapps.io/prez2024pre/). It's interesting to see, out of people who reported to have voted or will certainly vote, the numbers are even more heavily leaning towards Harris. 3% going from Biden2020 to Trump2024, but 4% Trump2020 going Harris2024. And undecided/did not vote going 51/42 Harris/Trump (again, out of respondents who said they have voted or certainly will). Take this all with the usual statistical grain of salt, but my goal here was to cut through the noise created by 1-3% margins that don't actually mean anything. PACs can pump out statistically meaningless polling, but they still will impact the aggregate (even when weighted; those polls should be entirely disregarded imo). When you go through and compare polls that have Trump winning and polls that have Harris winning, there's a clear divide in statistical reliability between the two. That CES survey is the largest poll you'll get, by the most non-partisan organization you'll get. And it gives Harris one of the largest margins of victory of all polling.","title":"Kamala Harris ahead in enough swing states to win, Times poll says"},{"text":"I just had to call my mom who's gonna be voting in person like \\"Hey, can you do me a favor?\\"","title":"Democrat voter enthusiasm ahead of Republicans by double-digits: Poll"},{"text":"les claypool would frown upon your takes","title":"Kamala/Media edited Trump 1 minute Analogy about Warhawk Liz Cheney and turned it into 10 seconds."},{"text":"The inconvenient truth:The EC is a check on political corruption and avoids an exclusive reliance on the popular vote which has always been of questionable integrity in the US. \\"It remains true, however, t**hat flagrant examples of such fraud in other parts of the country have been documented throughout this Nations history** by respected historians and journalists,\\\\[Footnote 11\\\\] that occasional **examples have surfaced in recent years,**\\\\[Footnote 12\\\\] and that Indianas own experience with fraudulent voting in the 2003 Democratic primary for East Chicago Mayor\\\\[Footnote 13\\\\]though perpetrated using absentee ballots and not in-person frauddemonstrate that **not only is the risk of voter fraud real but that it could affect the outcome of a close election.\\"**Crawford v.

Increasing the price of foreign goods DOES NOT MAKE AMERICAN GOODS CHEAPER.2. Components of American goods come from other nations. If these are tariffed, the cost of *American* goods is subject to rise.3. America does not immediately have the infrastructure needed for domestic manufacturing on the scale needed to meet immediate needs. How does supply and demand work, again?4. For people who claim they want to get rid of welfare (Republicans obviously aren't *actually* serious about this), what will the increase in the cost of needed goods do? Probably drive more people who are on the brink to seek and qualify for it.5. Given MAGA's insistence on mass deportation, what does this do to the cost of food and construction (among other sectors of the economy) in America? Add this to the tariffs on imported food and materials. 6. Making the cost of foreign goods more expensive *does not* improve the *efficiency* of American production.

Youre just straight up ignoring all the ways during the Biden administration that state and local level Republicans have attempted to corrupt democracy in the aftermath of Trumps defeat or just continued to do things they were always doing, like voter roll purges and gerrymandering on partisan and often racial grounds. Ken Paxton is, right now, in the process of trying to stop Democrats from making any electoral gains in the state of Texas as in DeSantis in Florida The fact that activists were able to shift maps in AL and LA further towards the Dems without that law being passed also seems to support the Manchin stance of not needing to nuke the filibuster over all of that since it's working out anywayThis is pretty ignorant considering those same activists that pushed Manchin on a federal law are the people who got those House seats, making the same arguments they made to Manchin.

Watch his own words, in context, rather than listening to legacy/social media. Five points from me that you may be interested in though (as someone who didn't vote for Trump in 2016 and did in 2020): 1) Trump is more of a Conservative Democrat than what the Republican party has been of late.There is a reason former Democrats such as RFK Jr and Tulsi Gabbard are not only endorsing him, but campaigning with him. 2) Trump is anti war. He is the first president in my lifetime (I'm in my 40's) to not send troops into a new conflict. The Abraham Accords, bringing peace to the middle east, were historic. 3) Trump admits many of his pics for key positions weren't great, to say the least.Trump appointed who he was recommended, and fired them when needed, hence the high turnaround during his administration.This time around, he has a much better team around him, as well as experience. 4) Trump is better on the environment.Through focusing on domestic energy production and manufacturing (where environmental concerns are factored in, unlike China for instance), emissions decreased during the Trump administration beyond what the Paris agreement stipulated.5) Trump is better on the economy.Not only did Trump bring energy prices down and revive American manufacturing, the inflation rate when he left office was 1.4%, and he cut taxes across the board.","title":"Why should I vote for trump?"},{"text":"If its a 10% popular vote loss and a 100 point EC blowout, trump will still claim it was rigged and try to get the SCOTUS to hand him a dictatorship.

A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and its the right one.In a statement on Friday, the Trump campaign claimed that while the Post declined to endorse \\\\[Ms Harris\\\\] publicly, they have endorsed her in the dark. So much for Democracy Dies in Darkness, it added, referencing the Posts slogan.In its complaint to the FEC, the Trump campaign cited the report by Semafor which noted that, like many outlets, the Post pays a small sum to promote its articles on social media platforms.However, Semafor said that on Monday, the newspaper aggressively ramped up its paid advertising campaign, boosting dozens of articles related to the election.While the articles about Vice President Kamala Harris were relatively neutral in tonethe articles that the Post paid to highlight about Trump told a different story, the Semafar story said.The FEC reviews every complaint on a case-by-case basis.If the agency finds that a violation has occurred, its responses can vary from written warnings to a fine, according to its website.A Washington Post spokesman said: As part of The Washington Posts regular social media marketing strategy, promoted posts across social media platforms reflect high-performing content across all verticals and subjects. We believe allegations suggesting this routine media practice is improper are without merit.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/01/trump-accuses-washington-post-of-endorsing-kamala-harris-by/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/01/trump-accuses-washington-post-of-endorsing-kamala-harris-by/)","title":"Trump accuses Washington Post of endorsing Kamala Harris by stealth in official complaint"},{"text":"My MAGA coworkers have no fucking clue how the government works.

For those not in Texas, and/or dont venture to adult-oriented sites, heres what residents in that state see, (provided they dont just use a workaround of course). Long statement.Dear user,As you may know, your elected officials in Texas are requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access to our website.Not only does this impinge on the rights of adults to access protected speech, it fails strict scrutiny by employing the least effective and yet also most restrictive means of accomplishing Texass stated purpose of allegedly protecting minors.While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, providing identification every time you want to visit an adult platform is not an effective solution for protecting users online, and in fact, will put minors and your privacy at risk.\\nAttempting to mandate age verification without any means to enforce at scale gives platforms the choice to comply or not, leaving hundreds of thousands of websites open and accessible.As weve seen in other states, such bills have failed to protect minors, by driving users from those few websites which comply, to the hundreds of thousands of websites with far fewer safety measures in place, which do not comply. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place. To protect minors and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.Unfortunately, the Texas law for age verification is ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous. Not only will it not actually protect children, but it will also inevitably reduce content creators ability to post and distribute legal adult content and directly impact their ability to share the artistic messages they want to convey with it.The safety of our users is one of our biggest concerns. We believe that the only effective solution for protecting minors and adults alike is to verify users age on their device and to either deny or allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that verification.We call on all adult sites to comply with the law. Until the real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Texas. In doing so, we are complying with the law, as we always do, but hope that governments around the world will implement laws that actually protect the safety and security of users.We encourage you to:\\nLearn more about device-based age verification* solutions that make the internet safer while also respecting your privacy.\\nContact your representatives and demand device-based verification solutions that make the internet safer while also respecting your privacy.\\n*Device-Based Age Verification refers to any approach to age verification where the personal information that is used to verify the users age is either shared in-person at an authorized retailer, inputted locally into the users device, or stored on a network controlled by the device manufacturer or the supplier of the devices operating system. Whether through pre-installed content blocking and filtering software, the disabling of web-browsing permissions, or other means, the user will then be prevented from accessing age-restricted content over the internet unless they are age-verified. To come to fruition, such an approach requires the cooperation of manufacturers and operating-system providers.","title":"Meet the Democrats using porn ads to convince Trump voters to stay home"},{"text":"Melatonin is a hormone that helps you sleep.

He would have been better off just investing that money in something really conservative and living off the interest (would have increased the asset vs diminishing it - and that is when he's literally cheated people out of the payments they are owed for doing work!)  Rosie was right - he relies on bankruptcy - not PERSONAL bankruptcy but setting up companies.  It is why he never sued her - she was telling the truth. On another note - I firmly believe that those who are \\"conservatives\\" in that they want a free market don't really get what universal healthcare could actually do to free up the market.  I know people who have business ideas, would dearly love to be a business owner, but cannot leave their job because of needing healthcare insurance.Yes, there is ACA, but it doesn't beat their current healthcare plan and they have a child with certain conditions. I've looked at ACA, and there are certain coverages I get with my current plan that I can't seem to find in my state's marketplace. If I lost my job?  OF COURSE I'd avail myself of the ACA).  Actually, I'm willing to guess that there are people who took the \\"let me start my own business\\" initiative now that ACA exists.Also, our tax dollars are spent litigating bankruptcies, right?   An overwhelming number of personal bankruptcies are because the person has medical debt.  Some sort of universal health care plan would free up the courts!Wall Street doesn't create jobs, MAIN STREET does.   I think Kamala knows this, with her plan to increase the tax credit for starting up a business from $5,000 to $50,000.   I haven't looked at the details, but this is really exciting - and should be something conservatives could get behind especially if they value the creation of US businesses, businesses staying in the US, and entrepreneurship.","title":"Conservatives outraged at Julia Roberts ad for Kamala Harris on spouse votes"},{"text":"Baby is apparently wearing a chicken costume so Biden is jokingly mimicking biting into a chicken leg...

The polls being off in one direction, or off in another direction within the margin of error, is the expected outcomes. What you are doing here, is declaring that the polls have landed on Trump's side of the margin of error twice, and they will do so the third time. Meanwhile, **it's simply not that remarkable** for a coin to land on the same side twice in a row. Looking at historical polling data, it is not that unusual for one side to be underestimated twice in a row, and then the third time the \\"pattern\\" breaks on it's own because there was no real pattern in the first place.If we look at midterms too, then it is likewise not that obvious that an R, R, D, R pattern is a pattern at all. What 2022 suggests is not that the democrats secretly have a systemic polling bias against them, but that any 0, 0, 1, 0 pattern can easily be random noise.

That was my initial thought too btw.Elon Musk: hes being cancelled by media no question about it. Why? Because he literally stands for free speech. Why is that wrong? Because free speech is only for those with the right opinions. Imo Musk turned because of this; he saw the major flaws in the system we have, and wants to change it.About that press conference: somebody made a mistake and invited to the wrong place, then someone made the decision to make the most of it.

Google it and see the word pop up in all governments info pages. Btw the Russians even sent several treaties to Nato before the invasion which Nato ignored: https://youtu.be/ZrCr0_E742k?si=BtcEwmFwRtmiqBCq So we see that Nato could have easily stopped the war before it began, by negotiating with Russia and Ukraine for a peaceful solution that was ok for all. We are severely brainwashed, thats for sure. I dont buy into much of the foreign psyop stuff though. Some times truth is what will stand apart and shine, when all were used to is lies! My answer is strictly about the propaganda side of things, I am appalled by how the world has turned out, I am afraid, I dont know what side to believe (but I KNOW we are being lied to).

Here's what Newsweek said last November:[Jill Stein's Ties to Vladimir Putin Explained](https://www.newsweek.com/jill-stein-ties-vladimir-putin-explained-1842620) A [Jill Stein] campaign spokesperson told Newsweek that Stein \\"attended at her own expense to spread a message of peace and diplomacy\\" and gave a speech in Moscow \\"in which she criticized the excessive militarism of both Vladimir Putin and U.S. leaders.\\" They added: \\"The Senate Intelligence Committee later investigated the trip and found no wrongdoing whatsoever. Dr. Stein's commitment to diplomacy is more needed than ever and stands in stark contrast to the two warmongering ruling parties, which are driving us toward WWIII [World War III] and draining resources urgently needed here at home.\\" The event featuring Stein and Putin was a December 2015 gala in Moscow in celebration of the Russian state television channel RT's tenth anniversary. The channel has been banned in several countries for spreading Russian propaganda since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The channel regularly featured Stein during her 2016 campaign. When asked about the dinner by NBC that year, Stein said it was a \\"shameful commentary\\" on U.S. media that she had received more air time on Russian news as a third party candidate. Speaking to The Intercept in 2017, she said the notion that it was an \\"intimate roundtable\\" was \\"mythology,\\" and that Putin and his associates \\"weren't at the table for very long.\\" Stein said that \\"nobody introduced anybody to anybody\\" and that she \\"didn't hear any words exchanged between English speakers and Russians\\" due to the lack of a translator. Stein said that Putin had appeared to make a speech and left immediately after. \\"Nobody cared to make introductions.

This time around, Trump and Republican party officials have adapted their messaging to encourage supporters to cast their ballots before election day on Tuesday.Mr Musks prediction was based on a comparison from Pennsylvania of 2024 vote-by-mail turnout against turnout levels from this point in the 2020 race, which showed registered Republicans making up 32 per cent of the early vote compared with 21 per cent in 2020.Early voting data tends to favour Democrats as the party encourages its supporters to?[cast their ballot early](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/)?so less is left to chance on election day.Women are also voting early in large numbers and Democrats, who have made reproductive rights?[a central campaign issue](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/us-election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-november-5-issues/), see the female vote as key to a Harris victory.According to the University of Floridas Election Lab, 54 per cent of the 60 million Americans who have already voted are women.Ms Harris led Trump by 12 points among female voters in October, according to an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polls.Experts have warned?[against over-interpreting early polling data](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/election-superstitions-people-think-determine-white-house/), as the subsamples of those who say they have already submitted their ballot have larger margins of error.Mail-in and early voting began at scale in the US during the Civil War, but has seen a significant expansion since 2000.

Is there a Joe Manchin kind of person in Texas, who is experienced enough, charismatic enough, and doesn't have any obvious skeletons in the closet, to the point where they can win a primary? Like the party definitely leans towards certain people, especially people who have experience, but I think you overestimate the competition. I think of politics as sports. You have the major leagues, which are the most prestigious (mostly federal positions). All these people have more or less proven that they can win. State politics are like the minor leagues. These guys might be talented pols, or they might have only won because they're good enough for that level. The number of people that actually make it to the \\"majors\\" is quite small, for a variety of reasons. Maybe you just have a \\"weird\\" voice or you're too short, who knows. Not at the reasons are good but it is what it is.So in the end I think Dems are working with a smaller pool of people than you think. There is rarely a \\"perfect\\" candidate that clears the field and produces an upset. At this moment in time, Allred was probably the best available person, and he was chosen in the primary by the voters. So you work with what you have.Also, I do think you overestimate policy.

I actually agree with basically everything you said about what Biden should have done, but letting Trump run in the first place and possibly win is a mistake that cannot be undone by disenfranchising everybody who votes for him at this point. He should have been charged tried and jailed for his obvious and numerous crimes long ago, but it's too late for that now. If Biden did what you said, there would be a civil war and a lot of innocent people would die - and whether or not there have been historical civil wars that were for the best, it is really worth remembering here that the other guys have way more guns than we do. Even if the military remained fully loyal to Biden (which, since Trump has won the election in this scenario, is highly unlikely) it would be an absolute bloodbath for regular citizens. At this point the only options we have are to either beat him fair and square (and THEN jail him when he inevitably tries to subvert the election like he did last time) or acknowledge that he won and devote our energies to harm reduction. Those are the only scenarios where this country has any chance of surviving - a chance that simply does not exist in your solution.I also feel like it's worth repeating that in your scenario, Trump wins the election and then Biden subverts it for the good of the country. The military would almost certainly not support that, so we're left with one of two outcomes: one in which the military turns on Biden outright given that he's just destroyed democracy to save democracy (and also legitimized every conspiracy theory Trump has been screaming about for years, actually strengthening his claim to power), and another in which the military splinters and starts fighting itself leading into full-blown civil war.

My perspective probably has less weight to it, is what I'm saying. However my perspective is also similar to people mostly divorced from the election that are just forced to hear about it all the time, which is probably a pretty big group. So in 2016 I was strongly hoping Trump would win. Well, once Bernie was out that is. This was for a few reasons, in order of significance:1. Hilary was incredibly unlikeable and her entire campaign was based on her gender. My first exposure to her campaign was seeing her asked \\"So, why should you be president?\\" to which she responded with \\"Because I'm a woman\\" which is a fucking joke of an answer. Elect my Grandma I guess. To be clear I don't care about her gender, I didn't dislike her because she's a woman, I disliked her because she insisted I care about the fact that she's a woman.2. Things were starting to look really bad in North America as a whole, and as my buddy and I said back then \\"If Hilary wins, nothing will happen, normal nothing politician stuff. If Trump wins, SOMETHING will happen.\\" A rocking of the boat, hit random and pray, basically. 3. Haha funny meme manWhy are these relevant? Because all 3 have changed.1. Harris is above average in terms of likeability for a politician. Not perfect but she comes off as more human than most. Something I always respected about Obama is he didn't make his whole campaign \\"First black president\\" he made his campaign \\"I'll be a good president\\" and then he was also the first black president. Harris is, as far as I've seen, approaching her campaign in the same way. I genuinely believe that Trump only won 2016 because Hilary was so incredibly, unbelievably unlikeable. It was a miracle moment for him, bottled lightning. I will die on the hill that Hilary would have lost to literally anyone she went against, including my Grandma. 2. Things are now really bad and getting worse and everyone is scared and depressed. My buddy and I were wrong, Trump was also a \\"nothing will happen\\". He was generally pretty boring. Same thing as any other president, he said some stupid stuff, he did a few good things, a few bad things, people focused on what they wanted to, then he left. Been there done that, the boat needs rocking and he's shown he won't do it, so time for someone else I guess.3. Dead meme, boring now, tired of hearing about him. In fact that's why I'm focusing on 2016 not 2020. He was already boring by 2020, I stopped paying attention.   \\nI think it'll be fairly close. I don't actually really disagree with you OP, he's moderately likely to win. I just think a lot of the landscape has changed, it's more up in the air than before. 2016 in retrospect was actually kind of an obvious one. LikeOkay so here's the plan, we make it social suicide to voice your political views if you support our opposition, so that way our polling results will be heavily biased in our favor and very, very wrong. Then we will organize our campaign around those wrong polls, alienate 50% of the population, and say Pokemon Go to the polls so that young people hate us, and uh, win?I was gonna rant more but this is a novel. I hope I didn't get to rant-y instead of focusing on the topic at hand. God I don't even live in your country, you guys are so loud about this all the time.","title":"CMV: With how things are right now Donald Trump is going to win the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"I swear I am not one of those people from a European country that always talks about the US with a tone of moral superiority, not at all, every country has its good and bad things, but dam this election season seems straight out of a very bad, poorly written movie.","title":"Tucker Carlson, demon survivor"},{"text":"No, Jill Stein supporters have researched both and discovered that both are nothingburgers.

She's laid out well thought out policies on her website and explained them in long form interview, just like politicians always have. But she is never going to be as entertaining as Trump.

The announcement includes $147 million in awards for the Maryland Port Administration, which will support over 2,000 good-paying and union jobs by enabling the purchase and installation of zero-emission port equipment, charging infrastructure, and power improvements. During the visit, President Biden will highlight how his Investing in America agenda is making an historic impact on communities and workers in Baltimore and across the country.*$3 Billion Investment to Strengthen Port Infrastructure*Today, President Biden is announcing $3 billion in Environmental Protection Agency Clean Ports grants, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, to 55 selectees across 27 states and territories, including $147 million in implementation and planning grants for the Maryland Port Administration. The nations ports are the lynchpin of our nations supply chains and employ over 100,000 union workers across the United States.This funding will protect and create good-paying and union jobs and better working conditions by upgrading port operations and infrastructure to cleaner equipment, while ensuring cleaner air for port workers and nearby communities. The Clean Ports program will support an estimated 40,000 jobs across the economy, including over 6,500 manufacturing jobs, and is expected to increase demand for American manufactured electric cargo handling equipment at least six-fold over the life of the program.While a major economic driver, our nations ports are a major source of pollution for workers and surrounding communities. Communities living near ports and other transportation corridors are exposed to toxic pollution which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular harm, especially in children. The Clean Ports program will improve air quality at ports across the country by installing clean, zero-emission freight and ferry technologies along with associated infrastructure, eliminating more than 3 million metric tons of carbon pollution over the first ten years of implementation, equivalent to 391,220 homes energy use for one year. The funds announced today will support the purchase of battery-electric and hydrogen-powered human-operated and human-maintained equipment, including over 1,500 units of cargo handling equipment, 1,000 drayage trucks, 10 locomotives, and 20 vessels, as well as shore power systems for ocean-going vessels, battery-electric and hydrogen vehicle charging and fueling infrastructure, and solar power generation. The Clean Ports program advances the Presidents Justice40 Initiative and aligns with the Biden-Harris Administrations goal for a zero-emission freight sector.*Investing in the Port of Baltimore*President Biden will announce the funding at the Port of Baltimore in Maryland. The Port of Baltimore is one of the busiest ports on the East Coast and is a major hub for the import and export of vehicles. More than 20,000 workers support daily Port operations, including unionized longshoreman and truckers. Each day the Ports economic impact represents $192 million or more than $70 billion a year, representing 13% of Marylands gross domestic product.The Maryland Port Administrations Equipment Electrification and Terminal Decarbonization project has been selected to receive over $145 million to purchase zero-emission cargo handling equipment and drayage trucks and facilitate the transition of the port to a zero-emission facility, as well as a nearly $2 million planning grant to help the port chart a path to greater emissions reductions in the future, delivering cleaner air for the port and neighboring communities. The port is a major economic engine for the region, providing thousands of jobs and contributing billions of dollars to the local economyand this new investment will support over 2,000 jobs, including more than 350 manufacturing jobs.*Creating Good Paying, Union Jobs in Baltimore and Across the Country*President Biden is the most pro-union president in history. Hes the first and only president to walk a picket line, and under his Administration, unions have secured historic labor wins. Last month, President Biden signed an Executive Order that calls on agencies to promote strong labor standards such as family-sustaining wages, workplace safety, and the free and fair choice to join a union, and encourages agencies to implement these standards through their Investing in America programs. This builds on a record of pro-worker accomplishments throughout the Biden-Harris Administration. For example:* Workers are filing for union representation at twice the rate they were at the start of the Biden-Harris Administrationthe first Administration in five decades to have an increase in union petitions. In Maryland, union petitions increased by 55% percent. The National Labor Relations Board has met this historic moment by reducing unnecessary delays in union representation elections and by expanding remedies available to workers when their employers engage in unionbusting.\\n* The vast majority of Investing in America programs require grantees to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wages for workers. The Administration also published the first update to Davis-Bacon prevailing wages in nearly 40 years, which will increase pay for one million construction workers over time.\\n* The Department of the Treasury finalized a rule implementing prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonus credits for certain clean energy projects funded by the Presidents Inflation Reduction Act to ensure clean energy workers are paid good wages and that these projects create equitable pipelines to these good jobs.*Building on Historic Investments in Marylands Infrastructure and Economy*Todays announcement builds on a historic investment in the state of Maryland under the Biden-Harris Administration. To date, the Investing in America agenda has delivered over $13 billion for over 970 projects in Maryland, spurring over $3 billion in private sector investments.  \\n...  \\nBaltimore was also named an Investing in America Workforce Hub, where the Administration is bringing together industry, government, educators, non-profits and unions to help workers in Maryland access good jobs created by private and public sector investments in the state. In November 2023, Hub partners announced new efforts to train and hire local residents to support major infrastructure projects. These commitments include one from the State of Maryland to incorporate a Project Labor Agreement in the bidding process for nine projects covering $9 billion in investment and 11,000 jobsincluding 7,000 construction jobs. One of these commitments includes Amtrak promising to invest at least $5 million in funding received through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create recruitment and training programs for new jobs for Baltimore residents as part of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel Program.  \\n...*The Biden-Harris Administrations Ongoing Support for Baltimore*President Biden was last in Baltimore in the immediate aftermath of the tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge, which claimed the lives of six construction workers and closed ship traffic in and out of the Port of Baltimore. There, he said his Administration would move heaven and earth to reopen the Port of Baltimore as quickly as possible to support Marylands workers and economy. A Unified Command led by the United States Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers cleared 50,000 tons of wreckage from the channel, allowing the Port to fully reopen 78 days after the bridge collapse. The Department of Labor and Small Business Administration mobilized quickly to support workers and small businesses impacted by the port closure, including thousands of Longshoremen and Teamsters who rely on the port for their livelihood. And the Department of Transportation and the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force worked to limit supply chain disruptions, keep costs down, and ensure cargo quickly returned to the Port once it reopened. Today, port workers are back on the job, once again moving more than 100,000 tons of cargo per day.The President also committed to rebuilding the bridge as quickly as possible. Thanks to close collaboration with the Department of Transportation, Maryland is on the fast track to rebuild the bridge. In July, the Federal Highway Administration issued a Categorical Exclusion, allowing the project to clear a critical permitting milestone. And in August, Maryland selected a contractor to design and build the new bridge.  Immediately following the bridge collapse, President Biden called on Congress to fully fund the replacement bridge and his Administration reiterated this request in July.The Biden-Harris Administration also committed to holding the owners of the DALI cargo ship accountable for the disaster. Just last week, the Department of Justice announced a settlement of over $100 million with the owners of the DALI to cover federal government costs incurred in responding to the collapse. While the State of Maryland continues to pursue a separate lawsuit for damages incurred to the local economy, community, and families impacted by the collapse, the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to working with Baltimore and the State of Maryland to ensure the citys long-term recovery and success.","title":"Fact Sheet: President Joe Biden Announces $3 Billion to Strengthen Port Infrastructure, Create Good-Paying and Union Jobs, Bring Cleaner Air to Communities"},{"text":"I was 16, and I knew instinctively that everything Reagan said was a LIE.I watched the poor conservatives in my family, nod and smile and believe everything he said.

I want full gay rights and protectionI came around to the realization that it is actually now the Republicans who see gay rights, minority rights, women's rights, etc. as a given, as in, we don't question that they should exist.It is the Democrats that are being homophobic and racist and sexist by claiming these rights are in danger.Abortion rights aren't women's rights. Look at the recent articles about the company in Europe that tried to make a suicide booth. Is suicide a human right? \\"My body, my choice\\", right? If suicide isn't a human right, why should killing an unborn baby for no good reason be a women's right? The majority of the country does not agree. The majority of the country wants abortion to be contained to when the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest. Trump has stated this is his policy and he won't sign a federal ban. Left to the states, since the majority of Americans want abortion to be allowed in cases of rape and incest and to save the life of the mother, so when the dust settles,  that will be the law in each state. Don't forget that Democrats in the legislative branch had the chance to stop Roe v Wade from going to the supreme court, and they didn't, because they wanted to be able to leverage the issue in 2022 to get more seats.Trump waving the LGBT flag as a Republican has done more for gays in this country than any other president. It cemented it as being okay to be gay and Republican, and ended centuries of Republicans being openly homophobic. Now, many prominent Trump supporters, like Dave Rubin, Milo, etc. are proud gay Republicans.Same with race. Trump now has 60% of the black male vote, the first time in my life that a majority of blacks are voting for a Republican, because they feel safe doing so.The Democrats want you to think that Republicans are racist, sexist, homophobic, because it's the only way they can get votes. They don't actually care about ending those things because then they won't be able to get any more votes. They'll even do things to make those things WORSE just to get votes.Join the party of sanity, where we love people of all colors, genders, sex, orientation and don't question their humanity.Join us so we can actually work on fixing our infrastructure and economy.","title":"Why should I vote for trump?"},{"text":"Step to me son see how that goes for you","title":"Lawmaker Warns There May Be Blood if Trump Loses - Rep.

Trumps entire GOTV strategy relies on convincing young men to vote for him. He doesnt have a traditional GOTV operation in place to mobilize his base and other Republicans and his campaign strategy has really only focused on appealing to masculine bro energy and podcasts popular with young men. He has done almost no campaigning to try to reach women of any age. And his supporters such as Kirk have been disappointed by the number of men voting early so far.?So of you think it is a loosing strategy to rely on young people then why do you think Trump is winning? The Harris campaign isnt pinning their hopes on young people. They are basically trying to appeal to everyone. But young women do favor her and they vote in higher numbers then young men, so overall although there might not be huge numbers of young people voting, Harris only really needs more young people to vote for her over Trump and that will both kill Trumps campaign strategy AND cause her to outperform the polls (because polls ignore young people).?Trump has not won so far. The fact that he is complaining about cheating in PA shows that he doesnt think he is winning. Trump and Harris are tied in swing state polls, so who wins will largely come down to turnout. In PA, Trump is encouraging his supporters to vote early, while many Democrats are planning to vote on election day to prevent a red mirage from happening again. That means Trump needs to be running up the EV numbers with first time young male voters. But that isnt happening yet.

Thats why the President issued Executive Order 14074, Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices To Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety, which, in part, requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to establish a national database documenting misconduct by federal law enforcement officers. The National Law Enforcement Accountability Database (NLEAD) is operational and searchable by federal law enforcement agencies, so that agencies are able to hire or promote the best personnel, and avoid hiring candidates with disqualifying histories.**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing a new analysis on the size and scope of NLEAD, which has the participation of every federal agency that employs law enforcement officers:*NLEAD is comprehensive.**  As of last month, every one of the 90 federal agencies that employs law enforcement officers, consistent with relevant collective bargaining agreements, has reported into NLEAD as required by the Executive Order. The database contains 5,300 records covering misconduct for more than 4,300 past and present federal officers over the last 7 years.  There are currently more than 150,000 law enforcement officers across the federal government.**NLEAD is being used regularly.**  This year, federal agencies already have conducted thousands of NLEAD checks to identify potential misconduct before making critical decisions about hiring, promotions, and officer work assignments.**NLEAD is making a difference.**  During these checks, NLEAD revealed dozens of positive hits C meaning instances of the types of misconduct identified in the Executive Order.  When there is a positive hit, agencies can get more details about these incidents from the entity that reported the misconduct.  This process has impacted holistic employment and officer assignment decisions, ensuring that officers who may undermine public trust do not end up in positions of authority.  After conducting NLEAD checks, agencies repeatedly have made adverse employment decisions.**The Biden-Harris Administration has improved transparency around state and local policing.**  Most policing and most public interactions with police happen at the local level.  Thats why President Biden and Vice President Harris have continued to urge Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to implement policing reforms at the state and local level. But we are not waiting for Congress to act, the Biden-Harris Administration has encouraged state and local agencies to expand their use of the National De-Certification Index (NDI), a registry containing state and local police misconduct that is currently in place in all 50 states and DC.  Specifically:1. DOJ structured $471 million in discretionary grants to give priority consideration to law enforcement agencies that use the NDI.\\n2. Law enforcement agencies can obtain accreditation through accreditation bodies if they adopt certain standards.  Pursuant to the Executive Order, DOJ created standards for these accreditation bodies that includes reviewing NDI as part of background investigations for officers.  Moreover, DOJs Community Policing Development program has been giving grant funding to agencies for them to obtain accreditation.\\n3. DOJ provided $3 million in grant funding to expand the NDI so that it includes information about the same misconduct types as NLEAD.**Since May 2023, the number of NDI users has increased almost 75%, and the number of records in the database has increased almost 85%.  The average number of monthly queries has increased about 85%.**Emphasis theirs.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Advances Public Trust Through Federal Police Misconduct Database"},{"text":"1.

Like Trump threatening Macron a 100% tariff on French champagne unless France backs off raising taxes only for U.S. companies operating in France. Or Detroit moving manufacturing to Mexico to save money (while keeping the same price in U.S. to increase profits). Trump threatened a tariff on any car made in Mexico being sold in U.S. which resulted in the company staying in the U.S. (actual examples)2ndly, countries (like China) have manufacturing costs well below that of America. So let's say China's manufacturing cost for something is $10 but sells it in the U.S. for $100 ($90 profit). An American company manufactures the same product for $50 and sells it for $100 to be competitive ($50 profit). Trump calls for a 50% tariff on that Chinese product. China (nor any importer) can not sell the product for more than $100. it will just have to live with reduced profits because no one will buy it if they raise the price to $150 just to keep their $90 profit. It's just not competitive with U.S. manufacturersBut lets say that product is unique, no one manufacturers that product in U.S.. The tariff applied to that product makes money for the U.S. which can then be invested in U.S. manufacturing to make that product as wellIt's kinda a simplistic view and I might be wrong but that's how I understand Trump's tariff strategy","title":"Why should I vote for trump?"},{"text":"Im a minor, how can I volunteer to encourage others to vote?","title":"Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Michigan by 3 points in final Detroit Free Press poll"},{"text":"Yep, im in CA.

Moderates are those who will tow the party line, and usually position themselves towards the center of the party itself, but aren't inclined to advance a very liberal agenda on their own accord. You can also apply this to the Republican Party.  \\nI think voters care about certain policies, but they aren't going to investigate these things very much on their own. The typical voter's understanding of a politician's policies will come from:1. What the politician highlights themselves2. What the politician's opponent chooses to highlightIn Manchin's case, it was absolutely important for him to emphasize his break with the Democratic Party, because he needed to win over a substantial number of Republicans and Independents. Sinema, doing the same thing, was completely toast in Arizona because the voters didn't elect her to be an antagonist to the Democratic Party. Mark Kelly, although not that far off politically, is far more of a team player than she was and remains popular in Arizona because of it. He's the perfect example of a moderate imo - someone who isn't trying to rebuke the Democratic Party label but also isn't seen as a liberal or progressive ideologue. He's the generic Democrat, and for Arizona that's served him well.  \\nWhen Hegar's campaign chose to talk about policy, which was sparingly, it was \\"expanding healthcare access\\", COVID protection funding, and (in her Spanish-language ad), coming out against family separation at the border. At the time, most of those were pretty popular issues to run on. I don't know how much further you're getting if you try to run more towards the center off of that. What's important in Texas is that you take the fight to the Republicans, that's what Beto did exceptionally well (albeit against a far easier opponent). Hegar followed that road map, if not all that spectacularly, and put up a decent fight. Up until Beto, the types of candidates we put out were centrist Houston lawyers who would sleepwalk into getting beat by fourteen points. I'm not saying that Texas is ready for progressive candidates statewide, but I don't think we need to dash back to the center. Staying the course as we are, running candidates who are moderate but committed Democrats, has been pushing us closer towards being a swing state. Hegar's campaign fits right into this trend.I absolutely agree though that in states where there's some Democratic strength, but they aren't really swing or near-swing states- Nebraska, Ohio, Kansas, Utah, Iowa, and Missouri are good examples- running guys like Manchin or Osborn is probably the best bet moving forward. Democrats in those states will vote for whoever isn't the Republican, and you run a decent chance at pulling off some independents and moderate Republicans as well.  Some states are too far gone for even this to be effective, so I don't care as much, but in a lot of those states where Democratic growth is *way* off in the future, or where Democratic strength is fading quickly (looking at Florida and Ohio here), running centrists/coworker independents is the best bet at contention.","title":"Democrats haven't given up on long-shot Montana Senate race"},{"text":"What if I freak out at both polls that are good and bad for Kamala/America, because we just can't trust polls anymore?PS, I already voted,  so no worries there!!","title":"Kamala Harris has big lead among early voters, polls show"},{"text":"Oh, they just add it into the bottom of a news story. \\"Reach out to your local office to see\\" kind of bullshit.","title":"Pa.

I understand that some people have the idea that protectionism and economic isolationism are bad. On a long-term basis, I sort of agree. But the thing is, right now, we have a massive trade and labor deficit, compounded with debt. Our inflation is beyond acceptable levels. So we do need to protect ourselves and our workers.

I truly believe that he is popular because he's a bomb-thrower.

There are the people who vote and identify as \\"republican\\" or \\"right\\" (and the same for Dems) and then there is the actual \\"Inner Party\\" that actually run the parties and the government.  These are not the same groups of people.  The separation between \\"The Party\\" and \\"The people\\" are real. \\"The Inner Party\\" of the Democrats and Republicans are far friendlier, identify with one another, and are much more closely aligned then ether \\"inner party\\" and the voting public.  The Democrat and Republican party are on speaking terms, they invite each other to the same parties, they have the same friends. They coexist with one another and understand one another.  They are alike. They have far more interest in one another then either group of party leadership has with the American public. Nobody in the inner party wants any change because they are at the top. They are the winners of the current system.  If they enact change themselves then the possibility is strong that they end up on the losing side and they don't want that.   So they are incredibly invested in the status-quo and don't want anything to risk it. So when you say \\"Republicans want this\\"... it doesn't really mean anything.  They are not some unified group of people with the same outlook and same goals.  Ditto with \\"Democrats\\". As far as change...the only way there is going to be significant change is if people want it and don't give the ruling classes any choice in the matter.  It is a \\"my way or the highway\\" sort of situation.  I don't think it is necessary for full blown succession or civil war or anything like that. What is necessary is for people to start actually asserting themselves.For example it is not necessary for Texas to succeed for Texas to be largely independent from the Feds. If the Federal government says 'Hey I need you to start enforcing X, Y, and Z laws\\" the Texas government can go  \\"Lol, no. GTFO\\"and what is the Federal government going to do?  The stick and carrot the Federal government uses for forcing states to comply with their edicts is Federal funding.  They have various grants and subsidies they supply to state governments and that money comes with strings attached. So far it is rare for states to challenge the Federal government on this sort of thing because the State governments want that money and there doesn't exist any political will to oppose that. So if states want their independence they can start with that.  They can start telling the Feds that they are a bunch of bloodsuckers and if they try to enforce federal law without the state's consent then they are going to start arresting Federal agents. All of this is 100% feasible and it has happened in the past. The biggest most obvious example is legalization of weed.  It is still all 100% illegal on the Federal level.  But it is legal or partially legal in the states and it is the state's enforcement that is the deciding factor.  Not the Feds.","title":"Uniting civil war vs secession - left vs. right perspective"},{"text":"Also besides my previous post, just sit down and watch a few of his rallies yourself.I used to hate Trump prior to 2015, like despise him.

I dont know much about the charges of which he hasnt been found guilty or liable because its not my job to make judgements about them.I understand that being pro choice is important to you individually but that is not an objective metric. Not all women are clamoring to get their next abortion and not all men vote on behalf of the values of a selection of women.Regarding lawfare, the case can be made that Harris has already benefited from that, thumbing the scale regardless of the will of the people. She wasnt exactly the victor of a rigorous and competitive primary.Some might consider the current situation equally if not more unAmerican. Biden was shown to be in too poor of a mental condition to run for reelection but was not removed or resigned from office. Who is running the country now through January? Why wouldnt they continue to do so after January? Is it a coincidence that the vice president of an absentee president is running on a campaign of vibes? Harris has shown very little of her intentions if and once elected aside from the usual dangling carrots of minimum wage and abortion. I think you are perfectly reasonable to feel the way you do about trump but the point is that your standards are not very objective, and asserting that they are is an assertion that people who disagree with you are just wrong.

If it was cheaper to make products in the US they would already be made here.I have tried explaining that tariffs riser prices, its a basic economic concept, they refuse to listen.Maybe they can make an argument that its worth having US production for other reasons (national security for example). Or you might end up with a situation where another country dumps a bunch of cheap product, US industry folds, then they raise prices and nobody wants to take the risk of rebuilding industry in the US. But I have never heard them make those points. Their only argument is that by having tariffs it will make products cheaper. If they are not willing to accept a basic economic reality, then I dont think theres anything anyone can do to convince them otherwise.Heck, Trump constantly lies and they eat it all up. Harris dropped out first in the democratic primaries (hint, she didnt)32,000 immigrants were dumped in Springfield (hint, the number is much lower)13,099 illegals came in and committed murder under Biden and are running free (hint, its over 40 years and theyre just not in ICE custody)If they believe every lie that can be easily proven as a lie, expecting them to grasp an economic concept I think is like asking them to perform brain surgery.","title":"How do I explain to people that tariffs are bad"},{"text":"Funny you get insta banned once you say something like this in the conservative sub","title":"Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Michigan by 3 points in final Detroit Free Press poll"},{"text":"To be fair.

You can probably get a few nutjobs like the dudes trying to shoot trump or some bombers like McVeigh or the Unabomber, but that's about it.  The idea of uniformed militias from states doing battle is just absurd.  But....I do think there's going to be some cold war going on.  I mean, for as much as we libertarians worry about stuff and complain, the fact is that the federal government is pretty damn ineffective at everything.  Even when there are roles for it, it shits the bed and costs too much.  There's also the fact that the political issues of the day are unsolvable at the federal level because people/states don't agree.  I just don't see that changing either.  I honestly think it's amazing the US government has gotten as far as it has with 350MM people and 3 time zones (plus Hawaii).  The only other countries as big and populous as us are either very authoritarian (China) or chaotic disasters like Brazil.  And even with authoritarianism, China has reached a limit to it's growth because the next ring of people around them do not consider themselves to be very Chinese and don't want to joint China's cult.  However, the federal government still has most of the money.  And it's very ineffective.  Meanwhile, our states are broke and for as much as we all like to bitch about the DMV, it wasn't THAT bad last time I was there.  The biggest issue is how shabby and understaffed it was.  Ditto for city functions where they have to cut back on things like yard waste pick up because they can't hire enough workers or lack of officers to take a report when a homeless man is in my yard at 0500.  However, if you go to the federal building for something, they have LOTS of staff and the building is fairly new and has nice landscaping.  I just think at some point we'll have states say, \\"Whoa....when we tax our top earners at 37% for you, our position is we want to keep half of that money so the DMV can have more staff and can plant some flowers outside and the cities can hire a few officers to deal with the frustrating homeless people.\\"What would happen if - for example - Texas or Florida unilaterally did that?  It would probably be with some political grandstanding having to do with the costs of immigration, but say Desantis just says he's keeping half of the payroll tax and not sending it to Washington and investing that money immediately back into Florida schools and local government.  Who is rolling tanks to stop him?  I honestly can't see anyone being able to.  Can you?  Orwhat ifCalifornia says they are going to secede and just be the 4th biggest GDP in the world unless Alabama, et al agree to give up the electoral college and agree to popular vote for President?So I think you'll see more of that sort of state-on-state cold war.  No shooting.  Just money and politics.","title":"Uniting civil war vs secession - left vs. right perspective"},{"text":"Man if people are worried about her possible and tenuous link to crime, wait until they hear about the felonies the Republican candidate has been convicted of and who he was friends with.","title":"Puerto Ricans and Latinos For Kamala Harris"},{"text":"As a liberal you should stand for free speech, which includes even hateful speech.

Why do you think they flood our country with illegals?? Because they care for them No, it's because corporations give them big contributions to allow them to flood the border with cheap labor they can exploit for cheap wages, all while using tax money that should be going to the citizens that are here legally to support a majority of their needs.

This refutes your own argument, no?Nope. Ohio used to be a swing state, the sort of place where a pretty liberal leaning guy could be expected to sometimes get elected. Part of the problem is geographic polarization that just means there's less of these states in general, and Dems are running up their vote totals in a smaller amount of states increasingly. This makes it more important now to run even stronger candidatesBrown has gotten very lucky in his campaigns, getting elected first in a blue wave year where the Dems won the governorship with 60% of the vote, and then being helped in 2012 by Obama winning the state, and then managing to hold on in 2018 due to the blue wave conditions and incumbency advantage. 2024 is the first year where he's fighting in a state that has basically become a solid red state AND it isn't a deep blue wave yearOkay, replace her in the argument with Fetterman, who while he has since moderated was at the time widely seen as the more liberal candidate in the Democratic primary (he was perceived as representing the Bernie wing of the party whereas Lamb was the guy favored by the centrist/moderate wing), and who won his race in a state that is demographically extremely similar to Wisconsin by 4 points.Unlike Wisconsin, the GOP candidate wasn't an incumbent, and was also a weird TV quack doctor who also did a weird flip flopping on election denialism that made it easy to piss off both sides. Dems should have been able to beat him by even larger margins. Fetterman got lucky.
