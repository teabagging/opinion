I have yet to hear any other explanation than they just couldnt support Harris instead of Biden so they didnt vote at all.

Sure, some probably switched in the counties that saw an uptick for Trump, however even  10 million is very large and unprecedented dip in votes. Only election that compares in overall dip in voting was 1996, which dipped in total 7 million votes from the record breaking 1992 Clinton victory 45 mil, over Bush 39 mil,and also Perot who had 20 mil votes that year. In 1996 Perot got half the votes as he did previously, Clinton went up 2.5 mil, Bob Dole got about same as Bush did previously.  Thus, less hope for a 3rd party candidate, some flipped to Clinton while the rest did not vote. Thats the dip. Our current year, the numbers do not line up at all with historical averages and Dems just say, didnt show up en masse. Lmao. 15 million is larger than Pennsylvania mind you. Even 5 million votes spread out would likely have won it for Harris. An even better gut stomp I think is that currently Trump has less votes than when he lost to Biden. By almost 2 million. \\nVotes havent all been counted to get the exact number, but something does not add up. We wont get an explanation besides Dems arguing with Dems I guess on whose fault it is. Maybe they can eat the media who blatantly lied to them about how great Harris is doing and get a clear cut path to victory. If they blame legacy media for misleading them, causing them not to vote at all, I think thats their best bet and most effective way to hold their own party leaders and talking heads accountable for their own misinformation.

This doesnt mean the last election was stolen at allll. If that were the case, pro trump judges wouldnt have dismissed the cases on lack of evidence. Dems can accept a loss, whereas the current climate of republicans and trump himself are not capable of doing that whatsoever. And thats incredibly sad The answer to this mostly has 3 underlying issues 1 Kamala choosing to back Israel hurt her so incredibly  bad. Its a bad take when a vast majority of dems dont support what Israel is doing and want Palestinians to have their freedom and land back, and a majority of America as a whole dont even want to give Israel money to continue this war thats been going on for almost 100 years. Regardless of how people feel about the issue in general, most Americans simply dont want to give Israel money for this. So not only was this bad take as the candidate for the Democratic Party, its a bad take for the country. And better approach wouldve been is stop funding Israel. It doesnt necessarily take a side for Israel or Gaza, but it puts us first as a country. 2 Kamala didnt take a side step from Biden. He dropped out because he was unpopular. So why would she say she wants to continue certain things the administration is doing. She shouldve taken a major side step away from Biden, without pandering to historic republican voters who feel politically homeless. She shouldve focused more on a voter base she could count on for years to come 3 most dems arent willing to compromise their morals in favor of a party they typically agree with. We, for the most part at least, believe that a candidate is meant to earn our vote. Because our loyalty lies with the betterment of our country, not necessarily our political party. This is one of the biggest differences between dems and this new generation of republicans. Which is strange because republicans see themselves as the party of patriotism, but they voted for a man who has outright said he wants to throw out the constitutionI think this election cycle said much more about republicans morals values (or lack thereof) rather than the Democratic Party. We essentially gave up a presidency in favor of compromising ourselves. This certainly still hurt us massively and it will for a long time.

And either through their own inadequacies or through the clear effect of corporate bribes, I'm sorry, CAMPAIGN AND PAC DONATIONS, they have completely failed to protect Americans from corporations rising prices. They still haven't recriminalized stock BuyBacks as a stock manipulation scheme, and because of that corporations have absolutely no incentive to reinvest in the corporation. They're just going to do more and more layoffs every year, while buying more and more of the stock. It's what the executives are incentivized to do, and it's what they have fiduciary responsibility to do for their shareholders so long as it's legal. The only way that stock can continue to go up once the corporation has saturated its market is to raise prices now that it is a monopoly. Democrats have sat by for decades and watched as corporate America bought each other out until there's barely enough major companies to fill the Fortune 500 list.They've watched as monopolies entrenched themselves, were warned repeatedly about prices going up once monopolies entrenched themselves, and then looked around with shocked expressions when prices went up. If your house burns down? That's a tragedy. If your house burns down because you were playing with matches after you were warned? That's your fault.","title":"Tlaib got 70% of the vote - Harris underperformed her by 12 points.

There are no policies attacking white people or men from the democratic party.  In fact things like changing tables being put in mens restrooms because men can be dads too and expanded access to paternity leave are things democrats fought for fairly recently. \\nWhat you are mad about is completely made up and imaginary. Every few decades when the economy is good this shit pops up again.  When men came back from WW2 and found their wives making more than them they got all obsessed with John Wayne and cowboys, it happend after Vietnam, and it happened in the 90s when all of the films suddenly became obsessed with making all main characters as masculine as possible. What you feel right now isn't unique or a recent phenomenon. It happens every decade or so and pretty much everything you claim is happening that is a war on men was probably said then.  None of those societal threats against masculinity ever materialized and they never will because they dont exist.\\nEdit: the same goes for the perceived attacks on white people.  As people see characters who aren't white in media they feel like it's forced, but that's them not understanding that over 40 percent of people in the US aren't white and they like movies and video games too.

Stop trying to get them to convert to your ideals and get them how it benefits them within their own ideals. Here is an example:Medicare for all/single payer healthcare - It's most often sold as a humanitarian entitlement that is critically necessary to elevate the impoverished, counter racism and inequality, and promote equity. And it will all be paid for by the greedy corporations who refuse to provide healthcare for their employees and by taxing the shit out of billionaires who don't pay their fair share.This may all be true, but that just doesn't resonate with most people. Change the messaging to:Healthcare has become so complicated in this country that companies who have nothing to do with healthcare have to spend billions of dollars every year to research options for their employees. Car manufacturers have entire divisions with hundreds of people who do nothing but research healthcare options. Why? It's a waste of their time. We can free companies up to focus on doing what they're great at and get back to leading the world in widget research. Most people will actually see more money on their checks because they aren't paying their own premiums...&amp; etc. rah, rah, greatest country in the world, we put a man on the moon we can do anything...The goal is the thing, the job is finding the messaging that gets people to buy in.

Thats just copium and ignoring the big real reasons why she and the Democrats failed. I mean we had a black president elected to two terms not that long ago.

Their whole campaign message was we arent Trump and focused more on Trump hate bashing instead of campaign promises and what they could offer voters. The other thing they focused on was abortion but this doesnt fully resonate with the majority of voters because everyone is focused on the economy. Harris was put into a shitty position by her own party because Biden and the Elite Democrats decided that Biden should try to run again and let him go out there despite knowing full well he was in physical and mental decline and only swapped him out after a poor debate performance when it was too little too late. Harris did what she could in the little time she had but she failed to separate herself from Biden and admitted that she would have done nothing different in his position. This was a poor decision because Biden was becoming increasingly unpopular and had a low approval rating. This swayed more voters to Trump because everyone is pissed off about the economy, inflation, and the border issues whereas Trump hit home on all of those issues in his campaign promising to fix them. You dont lose the Presidency, Popular vote, Senate, and are on pace to lose the House just because some quote white dues and Latinos dont want a woman president of color.

But instead they held their tongue as Trump was convicted of 34 felonies, they held their tongue as Trump was found liable for raping a woman in the 90s, they've even held their tongue as one of Epstein and Trump's accusers, who was their victim at 13 years old, was forced to withdraw her lawsuit because of specific threats against her life, only to resubmit once Trump was getting convicted of the other stuff, and it was likely she would be safe from him. Now he's going to be president again, and based on what happened to Epstein under Trump's watch she's gonna wish she was in a federal witness protection program (which is what the doj should have done when she withdrew her lawsuit in the first place complaining about the death threats, but Biden and the DNC wers too much of a coward to respond directly to Trump)We should not allow any individuals associated with the worst child sex ring in recorded history to make any decisions for the rest of us.

Before the filibuster was tossed for federal court nominees, Ruth Bader Ginzburg, a radical leftist, was approved for the Supreme Court by over 90 Senators. Republicans hated her ideology and could have filibustered, but they recognized the prerogative of the President to appoint the Justice of his choice and behaved accordingly. The Dems poisoned that well with their treatment of Clarence Thomas and Brett Cavanaugh. The Republicans became equally partisan by preventing even a vote on Obama's Garland nomination....(God, what a terrible AG he turned out to be!).I don't know how we can ever get back to consensus politics in America.

How dangerous is Donald Trump going to be for America's democratic institutions over the course of the last four years? How should we think about assessing the extent of that danger?**Fukuyama**: Well, I think the primary threat is to the rule of law. He's been very clear in the last few months and weeks that he's really out for revenge. He wants to take revenge on all the people that he believes have been prosecuting him and or persecuting him. And I think that this is where Schedule F really matters because, in his first term, he couldn't get his own Justice Department to go after Hillary Clinton, even though he wanted them to. But he understands that that was a weakness of his first term. And I think he's going to put people in key positions in the Justice Department that will enable them to open up investigations.?Let me just give you one concrete example. The head of the IRS is subject to what they call for cause dismissal, meaning that he's got to commit some crime or some really overt offense before you can fire him. Schedule F is going to get rid of that. There are hundreds of these for cause positions throughout the government. So if Trump can fire the head of the IRS, and put a loyalist in there, then you could open up a tax audit against a journalist or head of an NGO or the NGO itself, that will be incredibly harassing and will tie the organization or the individual up in all sorts of legal fees. So, you're not talking about a Putin-style putting everybody in a gulag, but you are giving the executive incredible power against individuals and against organizations.

They all marched out to back the candidate that they shoehorned in without a primary, brought a bunch of \\"elites\\", from George Clooney to Beyonce, AND even brought in super conservatives like the Cheneys to their cause and it made zero difference in the end.  Probably less than zero seeing as how 15 million **fewer** Dems came out to vote.  It's time for a new strategy.Give me meaningful policy proposals.  Give me facts.  Give me relevant precedent to the things that you're proposing.  Make people understand that it's not the illegal immigrants or trans prisoners that are screwing over their wallets but rather the fat cats at the head of billion (hell, now trillion) dollar corporations that aren't paying their fair share in taxes and aren't \\"trickling down\\" dignified wages to their workers.  60 years ago, the CEOs on average made 20 times what their average worker's wage was.  Now, they're making something like 365 times what their average worker makes.  I don't know about you, but my boss sure af does not do 365 years worth of my work in 1 year.  Make voters understand this disparity.Diversity, equity, and inclusion are important, fighting for people to have the freedom to live and love how they want is important, but we need to shift some more of that focus to the class disparity that unites the vast majority of us.  This was something Bernie has understood and been shouting about for literally decades (it's something MLK understood when he orchestrated the Poor People's Campaign), and it's the reason I canvassed for him in '16 and in '20.

They used hate, fear, and guilt to try to force an outcome.  For American politics this is such a powerful slap in the face.  They lied, explicitly, in easy to verify ways, thinking they had a monopoly on the publics attention.  Their lies were so brazen that it was inevitable they'd be found out, it's literally things like cutting away half a sentence so that the meaning changes.  They ran identity based hate, accusing black men of being misogynist for not voting Kamala Harris.  They accused white women of being aggressively oppressed to the degree where the only reason they aren't voting Kamala is because their husbands would beat them.All of it portrays to this fantastical, reality free victim mindset that doesn't represent the vast majority of the public.  Most women don't consider themselves victims, of society, or the men in their lives, because most of them aren't.  I feel sympathy for those who are but your situation isn't the norm or the standard and if you think so, it's because you've been lied too.  If you think Trump hates black people, then you're in the same boat.

I am not favoring either side but 1. Trump wasnt elected either, he actually actively thumbed his nose by not even turning up to debate during the Rep Primary 2. There may be issues or areas you wanted more information about, but she spoke more on policy during that debate than Trump did. Trump essentially didnt give a clear policy in any topic.3. Both candidates, as most are, are scripted in most interviews and rallies etc. Trump goes off the cuff a little more, and is generally when he is the most incoherent. But he is hitting targets and has a teleprompter at ralliesand in interviews you mainly know the questions you are getting. The exemptions to this are debates, which after loosing one he refused to do, and the traditional 60 minutes pre election interview which in 2020 he walked out of because he didnt like the questions, and this year refused to do. So Kamala spoke unscripted a lot more in just her short time running.4. I guess sketch is much more opinion than anything, but both had celeb backers, and Hulk Hogan and Piers Morgan arent exactly non-sketch.5. A couple did but WAY more went in the other direction. Including major players in his last administration 6. Again, same on both sides to some degree in the media, but Harris never talked about shooting former dems, having them deported, or calling them morons, idiots, losers, etc. and Trump did with any Reps that sided with Harris or left the party.7. She wasnt on Rogan, but thats just one podcast, and by all accounts she did give the show the opportunity. They refused as they wanted more than an hour of her time. However, she did do multiple with others, and yes they were unscripted as much as they can be. As with point 3, I think you need to understand that in most cases aside from debates, the candidates have the topics beforehand. I think you are considering because her answers sound polished compared to Trump who speaks much less so as being scripted and unscripted.8. This purely depends on what network you watch. Both candidates are edited to look awful on opposition networks. Only trumps worst quotes will be relayed on CNN etc. and Harris worst quotes on Fox. 9.  Both had endorsements from various factions of the military, law enforcement, border control. Again if you watch Fox they wont mention Harris, watch CNN they likely wont mention Trumps.10. I dont like either parties foreign policy. American foreign policy has not been widely liked worldwide for a long time so I have trouble giving a positive to either side. What I will say, is as a European I can tell you Trump is not viewed as strong, he is viewed to be politely, naive. The broader world view of him is that he will side with any world leader that strokes his ego. 11. This story is so far down a MAGA rabbit hole that I literally had to take time to even find it anywhere. Lots to criticize Harris for but fluff should not be even on the spectrum.I dont think there is really anything to say the DNC doesnt consider civilians, or I am guessing you mean the working classes. Certainly no more than the GOP. I think it really came down to economics and in a global economic crisiswhich is what is going on right now, not an American one.

This election proves that more than half of this country is poorly educated and doesnt understand the issues they are voting on and I dont think 2-3million people really fucking care. Democrats did everything they could. I could list a few things but when it comes down to it these issues are not something that should come down to splitting hairs or are THAT complicated. For example) renewable energy grids - cheaper utilities - lower monthly bills- combat climate change. Our messaging can be lackluster but these are problems that an average educated middle schooler would know what to do and what we are realizing is our voting population doesnt have any idea what they are voting for and is the same warnings about education that led to WWII. Climate science is a great example because there are little guy problems and big guy problems and is something I do suggest democrats need to dial in on. Rural country old fucks DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE WORLD ENDING. They care about their monthly energy bills. Little problems being fossil fuels becoming more expensive so this would help drive down costs and create more jobs.  Big guy problems is the big picture, the idea of climate change affecting large regions, mass migration, bottleneck of natural resources such as groundwater, biodiversity boundaries crumbling and allowing more disease transmission etc etc. All in all these people have chosen the path they want to foolishly wonder down and once again we will be the ones who pick up the pieces and preserve the union. No matter how you slice it these people blatantly dont care or too fucking stupid/religious to understand anything. We have to accept the harsh reality is there are people voting in this election who hope for a chaotic president like Trump. Yes there are people who are duped, fanatical believers, simply dumb, simply racist, but at the end of the day a large portion of this country is disconnected with REAL issues and wants something different. I think this also reflects a huge mental health issue and I think people are tired of the normal and want something dangerous and chaotic. Moving forward we have to do something about the importance of education and hope new voters dont fall victim to this radicalization of right wing beliefs. sadly the only wait to see the light is to enshroud ourselves in darkness.

People want the economy to work better for them and those that actually know things about the economy know that Trump would be far worse for the economy, but the majority of people dont know that. The majority of people think that a business person, no matter how terrible they are at running their business, does better for the economy even when economists say that isnt true. But because of social media, the mainstream media, and propaganda framing that someone would be better for the economy people listen to those talking points and not look at the actual impact of policies. The only way to get people to not fall for the bs will be for Democrats to heavily mobilize to educate people on why these specific policies will hurt them and what policies specifically are hurting people when things get worse. They will have to run almost exclusively on fixing the economy Trump and the GOP will break again.

Kamala Harris just walked out, said some stupid shit and cackled her stupid fucking dolphin laugh and people hated her and hated the media for pretending she was a superstar.The result? Republicans are probably going to control the entirety of government for the next 2 years at least.

If businesses just use the extra money to pay the top cuff staff more, then the trickle down is massively reduced, or removed.I think people need to realize that at some point of riches, extra wealth needs to start funding the general welfare (aka higher taxes for non-productive assets of the rich).

Reddit is unfortunately an echo chamber unless you do a lot of digging. You will only see one side.Many people still use youtube for most of their info. Youtube, while having changed their algorithms for viewing preferences, does allow people to post and see videos from both sides. The take from myself and other independants I know was this:\\n1) Kamala was not elected to begin with\\n2) Despite \\"winning\\" the debate with Trump, Kamala failed to realize that nobody wanted or expected her to win. The win we independants were looking for was her explaining what she stood for. She instead avoided the questions entirely and stooped down to Trump's level, which failed to give a reason to vote for her (Trump may be petty, but he has put what he wants to do out there)\\n3) All subsequent events with Kamala were scripted and she still continued to dodge questions\\n4) Celebrity and Media unity behind Kamala is super sketch\\n5) Lifelong major Democratic supporters and leaders (with significant appeal to the independant parties left to join Trump\\n6) The Democratic individuals who left were immediately shamed and ostracized instead of being listened to\\n7) Failure to do JRE or any similar interview that is both unscripted and untimed provided Trump, Vance, and Musk with a huge advantage\\n8) Media coverage of Trump throughout the entire election period involved the citizens, while media coverage of Kamala spoke down to the citizens\\n9) Trump got huge endorsements from ex-military groups who retired from active service under Biden because of his policies\\n10) Biden's foreign policies have been very weak (\\"just don't\\" followed up by little-to-no action). There is absolutely no indication that Kamala would do differently. Additionally, there is nothing convincing us that Kamala will be shrewd or respectable enough to deal with Putin, Xi, or Kim. Indications are currently that she would even cave to Europe, who likes to take advantage of the US ignorant of the fact that a weakened US is bad for global nonproliferation (we are the biggest country with nukes that DOESN'T want to use them)\\n11) P-Nut (and other terrible things done in Wash, Cali and NY due to bad policies) was the final nail in her coffinThere are many factors, but it seems the biggest one was that the DNC didn't feel the need to consider the civilians who vote for them. They had big parties, paid off fun celebrities, and laughed and taunted the \\"enemy\\" with as much retoric as they could spew. But they ostracized everyone in doing so.

As the article says COVID took him out of office (economy down), and COVID fallout (economy still down, and the recovery aspect is not felt on the store shelves yet) has taken Trump back in to office.

Kamala is for they/them, one said. Trump is for you.The ads on the transgender stuff were really unsettling to people, said Deb Dassow, chair of the Democratic party in Wisconsins Ozaukee County, a Republican stronghold in the Milwaukee suburbs that broke for Trump.But others in the party said the Harris campaign simply failed to address the key concerns of voters on inflation and the cost of living.It was the economy first, second and third, said leading Democratic pollster Jefrey Pollock. How do you win when so many voters think that the country is on the wrong track? And when the voters say wrong track, they are really complaining about the economy.This is two sides of the same coin. Time spent talking about social issues either naturally comes across or is portrayed as not caring about the economy. Voters want to feel like their issues are heard and a lot of social issues simply don't hit home for people even if those voters aren't personally racist or sexist (or at least perceive themselves not to be racist or sexist).I am really not looking forward to four years of Dems in disarray articles as they have struggle sessions over something that should be pretty simple.Bernie Sanders, the 83-year-old progressive senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, accused the partys leaders of defending the status quo and said they should advocate for universal healthcare and ending US aid to Israel, among other leftwing policy changes.Healthcare is probably a fine plank to put in the 28 campaign, but no one out there (who matters) can be motivated by ending aid to Israel.Also this message comes from absolutely the worst person.

That is all they have to do, it is all the lip service they have to pay at election time and their base will show up. Democrats have to answer to EVERYONE else and make them care.  A large chunk of Americans are simply both ill-informed AND reactionary and the GOP are completely built around that and Trump exemplifies those attitudes. When the final counts are done he will not really have gained many voters but the core still showed up and he won some Latino and young white males because they are also, quite frankly, ill-informed and reactionary voters and he basically performed the same. Kamala had 100 days to appease the same big tent that Democrats always have to because have to because the rest of America is fucking fickle and wants pandered to, and she did not do that enough in her time so no one showed up. Which is definitely a case for the biggest issue was DNC complacency and Bidens hubris that he did not run a one-term campaign and they did not put a primary out there but I dont know if that would have mattered anyway. Kamala ran a good ground campaign, showed herself to have a little bit of personality, and had solid ideas. But she did not answer to Palestine enough and she HAD to be the one to because Republicans get off light on that, and she HAD to answer to protections for gay and transgender people because Republicans just honestly ignore that topic because they have that luxury of perpetuating lies about the economy and making everyone care about that, and abortion rights and on and on down the line. Republicans dont have to, they just get to say everything sucks, vote for me and it works if Democrats cant get the entire rest of the country to show up. Kamala even had a better favorability and like-ability numbers and on and on but she just lined up with generic Democrat  and generic Democrat is not good enough to get people motivated.

Thats why it is so resistant to rebuke, accountability and change. Any response to vitriolic rhetoric is met with deflection and gaslighting. Just like a regular narcissist, that is why its followers gloat and celebrate when they visibly make others upset. That is why its followers lean on cruelty and dehumanization when they take issue with something. That is why the Democratic Party struggles to face MAGA in a fair fight. All debating, arguing, and responding does is add more ammunition for the party of Cheeto Benito to twist and cherry pick. Their accusations of others are the things they fear for themselves. Their claims that the left is led by fear, is because they are acting out of fear. Their accusations that liberal men are weak, is because they themselves feel powerless. Their overreach for control of others is because they do not feel like they have control. The major thing about MAGA, is not that its followers are insufferable, and they are. It is that the people that embrace that ideology are people with a weak sense of self. Studies show that caucasians from young adulthood and up in the U.S. are much more prone to low self-esteem, and male hispanics are not far behind them, than any other demographic. The vast majority of the voter base that turned out for the Purulent Pumpkin match that profile. It also explains why they so readily become a swarm of flying monkeys for the communal narcissists that lead MAGA. The people most vulnerable to narcissism are those with low self-esteem. MAGA wont go away, no matter how blatant and abhorrent their narratives become, because theyre being treated like opposition. That is a theater in which narcissists thrive. The drama empowers them, the emotional reactions can be twisted to fit their distorted worldview. Reacting in a manner that would make most normal people step back and think about their actions, only pushes them further into their alternate reality. The problem with narcissism is that it doesnt go away. Even worse, those that have willingly become flying monkeys for a narcissist will not readily give up the imaginary empowerment theyve been granted. Some may sober up, some may wake up and realize after one too many lines crossed. Quite often it is way too late to make amends at that point.?\\tWhat does that mean for those that stayed on the left side of the fence? Well, were probably not going to fully repair the bonds broken by MAGA, those family members that gladly cast aside their humanity and empathy for a sense of belonging arent going to be the same even if they apologize and change. However, it means we should approach conflict with MAGA, like one would a narcissist. They thrive and grow on interpersonal conflict, so dont give it to them. Instead, set clear well-defined boundaries for yourself, dont cross into the mud pits with them. Think of MAGA as a shitposter on steroids if you have to engage. Dont give them ammunition to continue creating their victimhood and persecution mindset, you know that is what will happen. Let them talk, and let them eat each other. If you dont give them conflict, they will find conflict among themselves. That is what happened for a portion of 2016-2020, and a good part of why Biden got elected. Starve the narcissists, do not give them any fuel, do not give them any ground, let them turn on each other again. Do not engage in conflict with them like they are regular people anymore, they arent. That is clear by the way they voted for 2024. They are a group of people consumed by a kind of maligned narcissism that does not respond in a rational and equitable manner. Studies show most people vote along that which they most socially identify, they may not all be narcissists, but they are the flying monkeys for them. Do not engage in petty arguments with them, do not give them the responses they want to justify their prejudices and hate and do not let them have the last bit of control you have. Lets lift each other up, I am sure a lot of support systems are frayed, I know MAGA has split my family and community in two.","title":"What do we do now?"},{"text":"3 I's.Inflation, Immigration, Israel","title":"The Real Reason Kamala Harris Lost"},{"text":"Have to think long term.

In an ideal world, we may want our values to align perfectly with our interests. But in practice, many other people are going to have similar (competing) interests to ours, and thus being more flexible in our values will support our interests and goals better than others.","title":"CMV: Social values are different from individual values, and the former is overlooked"},{"text":"Its the messaging silly. Biden admin consistently was playing defense to the republican narrative.Remember the baby formula shortage? Republicans controlled the narrative on that for over a week before the Biden administration said anything. Instead of getting a head of the narrative and plainly explaining whats happening and what they are going to do to help.The price of eggs same thing, reactionary to the issue after letting the republicans control the narrative. When the ceo of Kroger on a call said they are going to raise prices just because the can and blame it on inflation. The Biden administration tried to get democratic pundits to stop talking about it.Its things like this that make many people vote the way they do even when we know the other sides policies will be worse.Republican communications falsely make then more pro worker and Democrats have been protecting the status quos which most people who arent rich hate. Thats why the democrats are the elites works so well.Also Harris saying multiple times when wouldnt have done anything different then Biden only played into the narrative.","title":"Sanders: Democratic Party has abandoned working class people"},{"text":"Because they cant win on policy so they act in desperation and prey on weak peoples emotions.","title":"Can anyone explain to me why liberals are claiming trump will take away basic human rights?"},{"text":"Maybe because Democrats cheated last election and stacked votes using ineligible people?","title":"Democrats denying the results of the election Part II"},{"text":"They dont exist, thats absolutely right.

Go on.Pretty sure I did that already.  I suggest you reread what I said.Crafting messaging to reach out to particular groups of voters =/= pushing for policy which only benefits certain groups of people.Crafting messaging to reach the most general groups of voters =/= not crafting policy for specific groups of people.The thing is, when you craft for a specific group of people, but want to keep the policy non-demographic based, the *actual* line items of benefits wouldn't include a specific demographic. Those points aren't \\"my policy is going to be for everyone\\".  Those points are \\"here is what I'm going to specifically do for a specific demographic and no other\\".So yeah, not sure how you find that so hard to understand.How often did Harris talk about it? And how often did Trump bring up culture wars?Go be honest. Trump brought it up far more. So much for introspection.Bringing up Trump when he *isn't* part of this discussion?  Doesn't matter Trump brought it up more, just that Harris brought it up too much.  This is backed by the general rhetoric feeling that Democrats were saying \\"you must follow this DEI-esque framework\\" and Republicans were saying \\"Don't follow that framework\\".  Most people don't want to feel forced to do anything they don't want to do, so it is more likely they will follow the Republicans in that sense.While it has nothing to do with Harris herself, there is also all the \\"wokeness\\" and \\"DEI\\" that is having an effect on a lot of other things- Disney being a great example of that.  People are getting sick of it being forced down our throats.  It becomes a matter of guilty by association- Wokeness is left, left is Democrat, Harris is Democrat.  The issue there is, I'm unaware that Harris addressed people's \\"concerns\\" about facing more of that private sector \\"forced DEI/wokeness\\" feeling and pressure, which reinforced that guilty by association of Harris to wokeness and DEI.  Saying \\"I stand for everyone\\" and being both historically progressive and a Democrat, also only reinforces that there would be more \\"forced\\" DEI/wokeness if she were president.So you are right, so much for introspection.Really?Clearly you haven't considered the why Republicans pushed so hard.  No, it isn't about hate or anything like that.  Republicans simply wanted *nothing* to change from the status quo, then \\"wokeness\\" and \\"DEI\\" became the forefront, with that rhetoric of \\"you must abide by *my* worldview\\", where the Right's stance is closer to \\"you do you, I'll do me, if you show me respect, I'll show you respect\\" (and forcing the entitlement of \\"you must respect my worldview\\" isn't showing respect)  So, with the Left's hard pushing from social pressure (which then would bleed into political pressure), the Right reacted and started creating laws to enforce the status quo.  Majority of people on the right couldn't give any shits about someone's race, gender, or sexuality, it is about how someone has the expectation and entitlement that their worldview is adhered too.So it stands to reason that a party that doesn't want change would spend more money to have things not change in the face of the other party that wants to have everything changed.","title":"What We Can Learn From How Kamala Harris Lost."},{"text":"And her family washed collard greens in her bathtub.

Whats more, not only did Donald Trump retake the White House, the Republicans won a majority in the Senate and are likely to retain control of the House of Representatives.\\nSuch a crushing defeat in this weeks US election is bound to elicit months if not years of soul-searching from Democrats. Did Biden hold on for too long? Should party officials have opted for a contested convention instead of parachuting Harris into the race? Has the partys socially progressive turn alienated some Hispanic and Black men?\\nThe problem is, its entirely possible both that the answer to all three of those questions is yes, and that taking action to address them would not have produced a fundamentally different outcome. Just as the answer to would Britains Conservatives have fared better in an autumn election in a lower inflation environment? is maybe, but the response to would it have resulted in a materially different outcome? is no.\\nThe reason I make these assertions is that the economic and geopolitical conditions of the past year or two have created arguably the most hostile environment in history for incumbent parties and politicians across the developed world.\\nFrom Americas Democrats to Britains Tories, Emmanuels Macrons Ensemble coalition to Japans Liberal Democrats, even to Narendra Modis erstwhile dominant BJP, governing parties and leaders have undergone an unprecedented series of reversals this year.\\nThe incumbents in every single one of the 10 major countries that have been tracked by the ParlGov global research project and held national elections in 2024 were given a kicking by voters. This is the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years of records.\\nUltimately voters dont distinguish between unpleasant things that their leaders and governments have direct control over, and those that are international phenomena resulting from supply-side disruptions caused by a global pandemic or the warmongering of an ageing autocrat halfway across the world.\\nVoters dont like high prices, so they punished the Democrats for being in charge when inflation hit. The cost of living was also the top issue in Britains July general election and has been front of mind in dozens of other countries for most of the last two years.\\nThat different politicians, different parties, different policies and different rhetoric deployed in different countries have all met similar fortunes suggests that a large part of Tuesdays American result was locked in regardless of the messenger or the message. The wide variety of places and people who swung towards Trump also suggests an outcome that was more inevitable than contingent.\\nBut its not just about inflation. An update of economist Arthur Okuns misery index  the sum of the inflation and unemployment rates  for this era might swap out joblessness and replace it with immigration. On this basis, the past couple of years in the US, UK and dozens of other countries have been characterised by more economic and societal upheaval than they have seen in generations.\\nOf course, in the case of immigration, the distinction between unstoppable global forces and issues amenable to policy is a little fuzzier than with inflation. The rise of immigration around the world, both in numbers and salience, hints at a common global element, but clearly governments are not powerless here.\\nBiden, Harris and the Democrats are not blameless for Tuesdays decisive defeat. Clearly there are lessons to be learnt. But its possible there is just no set of policies or personas that can overcome the current global anti-incumbent wave.","title":"Democrats join 2024s graveyard of incumbents: Governments across the world are struggling in this period of economic and geopolitical turmoil"},{"text":"My comparison is kinda bad.

For starters you have millions of voters that are actively discouraged from voting through deliberate disenfranchisement. You try to represent those who don't feel represented by them (minorities who lean more right on socio-cultural issues or are enthralled by the \\"American dream\\", working class who feel abandoned or unheard by Dems,..).

His party also took back control of the US Senate and appeared on course to hold on to the House of Representatives.\\nTrumps emphatic victory marked a repudiation of not just Harris but also her partys progressive agenda and its failure to understand the concerns of the majority of US voters.\\nIf you were hard-eyed and realistic about this, you would say this was the worst outcome at the presidential level for Democrats in this century, said Bob Shrum, a Democratic campaign veteran who worked on Al Gore and John Kerrys bids for the White House. The Democratic party is going to have to get its act together and move forward.\\nHarris, a former prosecutor who first ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primaries as a progressive, tacked to the centre when she became her partys candidate after Joe Biden stepped down following a disastrous debate against Trump in July. She vowed to be a president for all Americans and put country over party.\\nBut the pitch fell flat, and Trump was able to rack up big wins across the country, even running up his numbers in traditionally blue Democrat-controlled states such as New York and California.\\nThe Democratic brand is pretty bad, said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think-tank. The country has shifted pretty far to the right, and we were not aware of how deep the problem ran. The voters that we lost . . . looked at Democrats and said: They dont understand my life. I dont want them representing me.\\nAs they reeled from the election result on Wednesday, many in the party asked whether the Harris campaign had allowed Trump and the Republicans to paint them as too far left, or woke, on social issues.\\nThe Trump campaign spent millions of dollars on political ads focusing on transgender issues in the final stretch of the race. Kamala is for they/them, one said. Trump is for you.\\nThe ads on the transgender stuff were really unsettling to people, said Deb Dassow, chair of the Democratic party in Wisconsins Ozaukee County, a Republican stronghold in the Milwaukee suburbs that broke for Trump.\\nBut others in the party said the Harris campaign simply failed to address the key concerns of voters on inflation and the cost of living.\\nIt was the economy first, second and third, said leading Democratic pollster Jefrey Pollock. How do you win when so many voters think that the country is on the wrong track? And when the voters say wrong track, they are really complaining about the economy.\\nMany in the party believe that a shift to the middle is inevitable if it is to come back in the next presidential election.\\nThe only way to defeat rightwing populism is through the centre, said Bennett. Shrum agreed that having a moderately liberal, centre-left Democratic party is the only way forward if progressives actually want to win.\\nBut in a sign of disagreements on the horizon, Bernie Sanders, the 83-year-old progressive senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, accused the partys leaders of defending the status quo and said they should advocate for universal healthcare and ending US aid to Israel, among other leftwing policy changes.\\nWill the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the democratic party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? said Sanders. Probably not.\\nWith the possibility of internecine party warfare on the horizon, several top Democrats cautioned against getting bogged down in ideological battles.\\nIt is a false choice, said Pollock. We shouldnt be having an ideological debate. What we must do is connect with these voters who are clearly not responding to what we have been telling them.\\nOthers urged the party to look beyond the nations capital  and the existing leadership in the White House  for a path forward. The Democratic party still has several popular state governors, including in states that Trump won on Tuesday night. They include Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.\\nHow do we have an agenda that addresses what people want? How do we talk to them in a way that shows that we understand them and their values? said Ken Baer, a Democratic strategist and adviser in Barack Obamas White House. That comes from outside of Washington.\\nWe need a generational change, Baer added. We have had a gerontocracy of 80-year-olds running the Democratic party since Obama left. We need new blood and new leaders.","title":"They dont understand my life: what the Democrats misread about America"},{"text":"Yep. 2024 is way more in line with the upward trend of the last few years, whereas 2020 is a huge outlier.?","title":"Democrats denying the results of the election Part II"},{"text":"We've kicked the can since the dot-com bubble in 2001 with inflationary policies, increased government war spending, and bailouts to prevent a depression.

If its not for you, I hope youll take into consideration the spirit in which it is offered to you and not be offended. I definitely mean well. ??Regardless of your belief system or lack of one, the Bible has a lot of passages that are just great practical life advice, too. Im specifically talking here about being unevenly yoked. In context, as it sits in the chapter, the verse is advising people that a believer shouldnt be married to a non-believer, because it causes extra strife in the household that could be insurmountable. (Marriage is already hard enough as it is, ammirite?) But you can apply to other situations, as well. The trick (this can save you a WAD of trouble later on) is being evenly-yoked, meaning equals bound together and both pulling as hard as you can in the same direction. That is hard to do that when you and your partner are diametrically opposed, and the same is true in other relationships, such as business partnerships, political affiliations, work groups, financial matters, etc. It is better to be involved with someone that you agree with on the BIG THINGS; the little things will work themselves out with a little grace and some give-and-take.ps Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.

Time and time again Biden and Kamala tried to combat the inflation issue but it just never took because, well, at the end of the day prices were higher today then they were a year ago. Its just a global phenomenon thats been obliterating incumbents left and right, no matter how well they campaign or how popular they started off. I think Trump restrained the GOP from having a historic victory with Virginia, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Hampshire and possibly other blue states flip to a respectable one where the results were in line with what analysts expected as one of the two main possibilities (though I think the popular vote margins are the big shocker).I will say the critiques of Biden I far more agree with. He was slow and weak on the immigration issue that proved to be a lifeline to the GOP. He maintained his progressive views that played well with the base but didnt land well with independents and moderates and all that. So on and so forth.Ultimately though I think this was a fundamentally anti-Dem environment where we did about as well as we could have given the circumstances.

Women are more likely to go to college and finish then men so they are a bit more insulated from this issue. And even for college educated white men on an individual level, barriers exist in certain spheres. I used to work in education and now work in government contracting and companies and government agencies have historically used affirmative action policies to take non white people with less credentials (lower test scores, less experience, less degrees, etc) over white people as a means of correcting historical wrongs. The government actively rewards certain minority owned companies with contracts not awarded to white owned companies. This has led to many white men I know in contracting voting Trump. They were passed up on a contract for their company or a job due to their white race due to affirmative action and now want revenge. \\nThe biggest issue I think comes down to gender relations. Groups of men are finding it increasingly hard to find romantic partners compared to women. Women get bombarded on social media from various men and basically have their pick. Men on the other hand have often reported sending out numerous messages and getting no replies from women on social media. Combined with the increased competition in real life day to day physical settings where women can find more higher quality partners on social media if they don't meet one in public, men have it more difficult even matching with a woman they meet in public. Combined with the idea that a man approaching the wrong way can get him socially cancelled in certain spheres, even if not that bad....and yeah, issues. Men who complain about the above dating issues are called \\"incels\\"' \\"toxic\\" , etc and that they need to drop toxic patriarchal views and not feel so \\"entitled\\" to love and sex. That they should be ok being alone if necessary. That they are the privileged sex and such issues aren't important. Meanwhile women who complain about dating issues are often sold as sympathetic victims who need help. That toxic patriarchy is holding down strong women and that we need to support girl power. When it comes to issues like domestic violence, male victims of domestic violence are often ignored and downplayed compared to women victims even though men statistically are also often victims of non consensual domestic violence. Meanwhile Trump promises to both help these young men and also get revenge on those who harmed them (affirmative action supporting liberals, current politician responsible for the economy, feminists and liberals belittling their issues) and sells it in a way that is inspiring. A basically macho man personna sicking his middle finger up to the wrong doers. So men struggling to afford shit and struggling to get women and have a place in society and boom....backlash against the establishment when someone comes along and says it all sucks and they will both fix it and get revenge on those who harmed them.","title":"How voting demographics changed between 2020 and 2024 presidential elections"},{"text":"It doesn't have to make sense.

This was talked about at every rally, interview and townhall Harris took part in.

Go look at how Biden consistently fought and finally succeeded in raising the federal minimum wage to $15. Look at how his administration called out price gouging (all while being called a socialist by Republicans no less) which resulted in grocery prices lowering. Look at how it's only blue states which have raised their minimum wage. Then go look at how Biden continued to help rail workers get what they want behind the scenes. Go look at how Biden dealt with the dockworker strike. Go look at the legislative platform of the Biden-Harris administration:Harris supports the PRO Act, Trump opposes it. Harris supports PLA's and the Biden-Harris administration has mandated them on most federal funded projects, Trump banned PLAs on federal projects. Harris is against right-to-work laws, Trump supports a national right-to-work law. The Butch-Lewis Act saved the pensions of over a million union workers, Trump was against the Butch-Lewis Act all 3 times the law was presented to him, the Biden-Harris administration told congress they would not sign the American Rescue Plan unless the Butch-Lewis Act was part of it.Then go look at Trump introducing tax cuts skewed to the rich, not supporting raising the minimum wage, saying he supports firing striking workers, how he hates paying overtime and how he talks about supporting domestic manufacturing all while offshoring the manufacturing of his merchandise overseas.These working class people still voted for Trump though. Go look at how the majority of union members were Trump supporters still. Dems didn't abandon the working class, the working class abandoned Dems. 'Saying we want more pro-worker policies' while, time and again, refusing to show up to give Dems a mandate to do so is delusional.This is the same Sanders saying this just a few months ago, fyi: [Strong, progressive agenda: Sen.

At the time Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, who privately regarded Mr Trump as a sleazeball and stupid, called the insurrection further evidence of Donald Trumps complete unfitness for office, according to reporting he has not disputed in a new biography by Michael Tackett, a journalist.\\nYet what might seem a psychological frailtyan inability to brook criticism or concede mistakes, much less defeathas for Mr Trump been a mighty source of political strength, one that intensifies his connection to the voters he has made the base of the Republican Party. As in 2016, Mr Trump wielded his command of that bloc of voters this year to clear a path through crowded Republican primaries, and then relied upon negative polarisation, or fear of the other guys, to unite the party. Can you believe he endorsed me? Mr Trump chortled at a rally in North Carolina on November 3rd, gloating over how Mr McConnell eventually fell into line. Mr Trump felt no obligation to reciprocate. Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon, he said.\\nMr Trump has shown courage, not only in weathering assassins attacks but in insisting on views on trade, entitlements and other matters that a few years ago were heresy within his party. With his sophisticated grasp of new and legacy media and his instinct for the basic needs and fears of many Americans, he has revolutionised how American politics is conducted and shifted the policy terrain over which it is waged. In terms of disrupting what came before, he has had more effect than even Ronald Reagan.\\nUnlike Reaganor the other two-term presidents since, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack ObamaMr Trump has never been very popular, though he managed, in this third run as the Republican nominee, at last to win the popular vote. Unlike those predecessors, Mr Trump has relied upon division, not addition, for his electoral maths. In his first term his average approval rating of 41% was the lowest ever measured by the Gallup Poll, which began tracking the statistic under Harry Truman. Democrats have good reason to think Mr Trump repels many voters when he calls adversaries vermin or the enemy from within or says illegal immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country.\\nYet, after this victory, whatever disdain Democrats have for Mr Trump should be cause only for humility and self-scrutiny. As in 2016, Mr Trumps broad support will present his adversaries with a Rorschach test in which they can see their preferred image of America, and it will be ugly. For some, white supremacy and misogyny will explain Mr Trumps success, while others may attribute it to tax cuts and greed. Some will conclude that poor, non-white or female Americans have been ensorcelled into voting against their self-interest. Rather than retreat into some grand theory, they would so better ro think through how, in a divided country, President Joe Biden might have nudged the balance a few points away from Mr Trump, rather than to him. Kamala Harris was no bystander, but pime responsibility lies with the president she served.\\nMr Biden did not heed his own warnings about Mr Trump. He tried to eat into Mr Trumps support with blue-collar workers through giant investments in manufacturing and infrastructure that offered something to everyone. But, unlike Mr Clinton or Mr Obama, he ducked choices that would have respected the concerns of most Americans but disappointed left-wing Democrats. A political strategy of addition still requires some division.\\nMost egregious, Mr Biden resharpened Mr Trumps most effective political wedge by doing away with obstacles he had created to illegal immigration, with no alternative. By the time he restored some of Mr Trumps restrictions this spring, more than 4m migrants had crossed the southern border, compared with fewer than 1m under Mr Trump. That was terrible for the Democrats as a party, and worse for people they want to help and the cause they believe in: under Mr Biden, Americans who say they want a decrease in legal immigration rose from a minority to a majority, as did the number who favour mass deportation.\\n**How to defend democracy**Even where Mr Biden had accomplishments that undermined Mr Trumps arguments, he let himself be constrained by his partys loudest activists. Oil production rose to record levels, but Mr Biden did not boast about that. He was also no longer up to the demands of presidential communication that Mr Trump understands so well. He was not constantly, energetically promoting his success in sustaining economic growth and raising wages. His approval rating sagged as low as 36% just as other Democrats were forcing him to face the obvious: he should not be running again. In the short time Ms Harris had, she waged a good campaign. But any politician would have struggled under such burdens. She could not separate herself enough from Mr Biden, or from the video Mr Trumps ads used, to devastating effect, of her recently declaring positions that were alienating to most Americans.\\nWe have learned again that democracy is precious, Mr Biden proudly declared during his inaugural address almost four years ago. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. Now it has prevailed again. Will Democrats get the message this time?","title":"Democrats need to understand: Americans think theyre worse"},{"text":"Same here.

They proved themselves useless time and time again and should not be rewarded for letting Trump win to \\"teach Dems a lesson.\\"  These progressive fuckwits wanted Trump in lieu of Kamala?

Likewise, he's also a veteran, multilingual and has a lot of experience dealing with combative Republican contrarians due to his Fox News appearances.  Feel like what hurt the Democrats in 2024 was the lack of turnout more than anything else (about 13-15 million people Dem voters didn't show). So I think Democrats both need to do more to stand up against voter suppression in Republican states and to promote long term engagement.  Low turnout has hurt the Democrats before at midterms, but this is the first time I've seen it happen on this scale in a Presidential race.

It started with people like Rush Limbaugh who were excellent at creating outrage amongst the voter base. He was very good at rattling people on an emotional level and using panic, fear, anger, etc., to encourage voter participation. Other conservative media outlets picked up on this, most notably Daily Wire. They adapted more for the Millenial and Gen Z crowd that tends to have a shorter attention span, prefers quick and easily digestible bites of information, and hence the origin of the soundbyte. They have someone like Ben Shapiro who's formally trained as a lawyer, is very eloquent, and is well versed in debating by virtue of his profession. Most importantly, he knows he's likely going up against unprepared college students, which makes his job even easier. So Daily Wire started posting clips of \\"dumb college students\\" getting \\"owned\\" by Shapiro. Of course for those who knew what was going on, it was about as impressive as Lebron James slam dunking on a 3 year old (i.e. not impressive at all). However, to those who wanted to watch \\"dumb libs get rekt\\" it gave them exactly what they were looking for. Along comes Trump, and he does more of this, and arguably even better b/c of his background in Reality TV. People believe what they see, and if you can control what they see, you can control what they believe. The GOP, it's ideologically aligned media outlets, and Trump understood this very well. They were able to appeal to fear, anger, disappointment, etc., very well and ultimately it paid off.","title":"Democrats ask: Why didn't anything work?"},{"text":"Thats great, but this is still the fault of the democrats for not campaigning toward popular policies, not the voter.","title":"Voters begged the Democrats to listen to them.

Many of us are aware its improving, but exit polls and county level results suggest most Americans arent seeing it. 75% of Americans said inflation has caused them severe or moderate hardship in the last year and 70% think Trump will bring about change to the it lives,  while simultaneously having a higher approval of Harris and thinking Trump is more extreme. Reading between the lines, to me personally, means this was all about inflation. I largely agree the democrats need to pump the brakes on identity politics, but much more importantly they need to regroup on economic messaging big time. They were playing defense for 4 years on inflation in a global environment of rejecting incumbency over economic inflation.","title":"Identity politics is hurting Dems because the Republicans have weaponised it against them"},{"text":"Voted for Kamala.
