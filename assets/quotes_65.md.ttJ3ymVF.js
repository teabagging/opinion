My problem is that too many people have a knee jerk reaction to inequality, thinking that somehow the rich gain wealth by taking it away from the poor. As the rich get richer, the economic pie should grow larger, making us all better off. It is not a zero-sum game.

The rest of the 70% denials are all perfectly clear.Lets say that of those 30%, a third of them are denied life saving procedure. And of those third, lets say 2/3rds of them go into bankruptcy, and the rest of them die. We're not gonna account for anyone whose life is ruined by the bankruptcy. Meaning 1% of people they deny, they kill. The other 29% still suffer a lot but are fine. And for the 70% UHC is on the clear.Lets say that they deny a million claims every year(low ball, 48.9 million get denied every year, they are the largest health insurance firm and deny the most). This means that every year, their greed has killed 10.000 people.I have not looked up how long he worked, but lets say he worked for 2 years there, which Im sure is still low balling, but I just dont want to overestimate. And lets say that half the policies are holdovers that he hasnt gotten around to read and we're not gonna keep him responsible for those even though he is supposed to be responsible.10.000 people dead. They died because he decided on policies that helped them get around paying for as many people as possible so they can make more money. Knowing fully well that for every certain amount of people they unjustly denied, some of them were dying. He may not have sat down and ran the numbers, but he knew. Every conference, every quarter, he has overseen and faciliated changes to the company that let them deny more people.And thats a lowball remind you. If every other insurance firm is completely clean and UHC is making double the denials, then we can assume that 50% of their denials are unjust. And lets say instead of a third, 2/5ths are in life threathening conditions, only half of them go into bankruptcy and the rest decide to leave their money in their will. Lets say that he actually is responsible for ALL the policies that he is responsible for instead of half, and now thar Ive looked it up he has been the CEO for 3 years(working in the company since 2004 hence we dont need to pretend he didnt know anything). Lastly lets say that despite being the largest, UHC and the 12 largest firms have the same number of customers, and calculate their denial just by adding up the percentages and dividing them, giving us 6.9 million denials per year from UHC. This adds up to 690.000 deaths per year, or according to my calculator(since Ive been neglecting rounding errors), 2,086,400 people total.Lets say that Im wrong and its a tenth of my lowball. That would still be 1000 people killed intentionally by his decision.Wheter its 1000 or 2,086,400, Id still say he is a mass murderer.I dont have the exact number, 10 thausand and 2 million is a very absurdly wide range, but I dont think it matters much because anywhere in that range my moral analysis would not change from \\"hm, thats not someone acting in ethical ways\\"","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"Oh yeah, the one woman who kind of interfered.

So when we hear Republicans attacking queer Americans again, I think the progressive response needs to be that a trans person didnt deny your health insurance claim, a big corporation did  with Republican help. We need to connect the dots for people that the Republican Party obsession with these culture war issues is driven by Republicans desire to distract voters and have them look away while Republicans pick their pocket.That means the Democratic Party needs to shed off some of its more corporate elements, to sharpen the economic-populist contrast with Republicans and not let voters equate the two parties, he said.

Our enemies do it all the time, and we would do it to others. Soldiers are just glorified mercenaries. You live by the sword, you die by the sword. They chose to get into a violent and deadly career; I wouldn't feel any worse about a dead soldier than I would a dead racecar driver or skydiver. How about police because they put people in jail?The police are just another government sanctioned mercenary force. They tend to be corrupt and untouchable, and like soldiers they've knowingly signed up for a deadly and dangerous career. I wouldn't fault someone who felt their only way to get justice was to kill some of the cops responsible for imprisoning or killing someone they loved. It's about time that police started facing some karma. It's just maybe not a wise decision because our government is very pro-cop and will end up giving them more money to protect the interests of their rich constituents, so killing cops ultimately leads to the cops being empowered, which is the primary reason killing cops is wrong. Anyone working for defense contractors because they make weapons?Yeah, they're professional murderers, or hitmen for hire. You give them money, they give you munitions with which you can kill people. Their deaths would be karmic justice. Again, if you live by the sword, you die by the sword. If they don't like it, they shouldn't have gotten a career in the killing people business.People that work in the fossils fuel industry? Manufactures that produce gas cars?This one's a little removed, because there are a wider variety of uses for fossil fuels and vehicles than there are for weapons, and the consequences stem more from their excessive or inappropriate use than from their natural function. So I would say it depends on the person's position in their industry. If they're the one pushing for deregulation, for causing unnecessary risk or harm to the environment, or price gouging the public, then I'd say it's more reasonable to kill them than if their position is as some grunt-level worker in a refinery or processing plant. I wouldn't agree with killing a tanker-truck driver, but I might agree with killing the CEO of his company. How about the government employees that deny healthcare and put people on waiting lists to die in other countries?Yeah. If someone makes a decision that will result in the death of someone you care about, I don't think you're wrong to get revenge or street justice killing that person. If you own any electronics, or clothing its basically a guarantee youve contributed to the suffering of people forced into slave labor in other countries. Its pretty easy justifying killing someone who is paying for a company to use slaves just so they can have cheaper products.Yeah, if someone from China or wherever wanted to kill me because my technology was built using the slave labor of their people, they would be justified in doing so.  Just as a revolutionary would have been in the right to kill a slave owner, or someone working on a slave boat, or someone who was actively supporting and benefitting from any other slave-related activities.

Was Trump responsible for covid? No. But he is responsible for our response, which was the worst in the world. It has been studied to death, and that shitty response caused somewhere in the neighborhood of an excess 100K deaths that would not have happened if he acted at least as fast as other nations. Let's take it from the top...Trump came into office with a Whitehouse pandemic preparedness team, whcih he disbanded because science is for losers. He also came into office with scientists actually on the ground in Wuhan to monitor for thigns like covid and to give us an easrly warning system. It took forever to negotiate that with China but Trump disbanded that too because, again, science is for losers.Then Covid hits and instead of doing anything about it, he tried to pretend that it wasn;t real, then when it was obviously real, he pretended that it wasn't serious, then when it was obviously serious, he pretended that it would eventually just \\"go away like a miracle\\". The rest of the world was trying ot solve the problem but Trump literally did nothing but increase the amount of golf he was playing. The medical and scientific communities (which I was in) were crying out to DC for funding, coordination, and leadership but were greeted with silence. He was telling individual states that it was up to them to deal with their own problems even though the main point of a federal government is to coordinate and martial forces in the face of a national emergency. It was only when the bodies were literally stacking up outside of morgues that he took action, and by took action, I mean that he realized that the Republican party was bereft of anyone with any actual ideas, leadership, or expertise and turned to not only a Democrat, but a brown, Muslim, immigrant Democrat who dreamed up Project Warp Speed. He turned over the keys to the party of actually doing things and not just big talk, and we got a vaccine. And even with that, when we had the vaccine, Trump couldn't be bothered with providing a roadmap for distributing it, he left that to Biden. Oh, and Mr. Art of the Deal, spent billions to get the vaccine developed, which was the right thing to do, but he let Big Pharma keep the patent, which allows them to bilk the American people for billions and billions more into perpetuity.And despite all this, he's convinced soft minded people like you that he did a fine job.I'll leave you now with a tiny, microscopic sample of Trump quotes trying to weasel his way out of actually doing anything in his presidency other than running his mouth for gullible morons.\\"You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat  as the heat comes in.

If we reject the idea of two-states and accept that this conflict is to be resolved through more violence, there is no question of the outcome. Palestinians are not winning it, ever, in any reality or situation. Both sides can continue fighting. Only one side can emerge as a winner.

I dont really understand the cultural moment of the end of the Cold War, or how much our foreign policy decision making was influenced by the popular mood, but it seems as if with the threat of imminent nuclear war off the table and Y2K looming, everyone in the West (and the East too until reality set in) just wanted to have a victory party, consequences be damned. This is probably wrong, but then again perhaps that generation was truly uniquely insulated from consequences, because they actually won the battle of their lives. Looking back at history its easy to spot moments when governments should have more aggressively taken advantage of the strategic situation with big, sweeping actions, but in reality it seems even our leaders are more concerned with tangible payoffs in their lifetimes than abstract concepts like preserving their countrys hegemony indefinitely - and this is probably how it should be, because the well-being of your people should outweigh the stories told in future textbooks. In the case of the post-Cold War era though, I do suspect some bad decisions were made when integrating formerly communist states into the global economy in the name of short-term gains and the hubris that we could always just deal with issues later.","title":"Quick! the lolberts are asleep.

When you look at many (but not all) of the Israeli hardliners this is their objection to a Palestinian state. They point to various speeches or documents where some extremist parties like Hamas say that a 2 state solution won't be the end, and would be the launch pad for getting \\"whole of Palestine\\". They point to speeches Arafat made, where he describes how a 2 state solution is only the beginning in the effort to remove Israel.   \\nI myself believe that it is very much dependent on the implementation of the two state solution. What would be the final agreement, or what security arrangement would there be, and especially - what would be the political system in the Palestinian state are likely to play a huge role in seeing whether this actually comes true.So perhaps some modification of your view is that the only way I/P conflict can be solved is with a 2 state solution with the right conditions.   \\nI think this is a small, yet important point, when one wants to understand what are the steps or blocks for this to happen.   \\n  \\nThe second way I may change your mind a bit is that I feel like your description of I/P is kind of inaccurate. Israel didn't oppress the Palestinians since the start of the conflict. The start of the conflict was before there was an actual Israeli state. I feel like it's a bit reductive to say that the Palestinians are acting as reactionaries and the Israelis are always oppressors. both side react to the other sides actions in various ways and both sides oppress the other side in various ways. Not the Israeli society nor the Palestinian society are monoliths, and while some Palestinians simply want to get their own self determination, other such as Hamas want to eliminate all Jews from the land and acquire all of Palestine. Same goes for Israelis, while some simply want to live safely,  other such as Ben Gvir and his supporters want to take all of the WB and annex it.   \\nThis conflict is sadly way more complicated than putting it out in 2 sentences, which is probably why it wasn't solved by now","title":"CMV: The only way the Israel/Palestine conflict can be solved is a 2 state solution and money from the UN"},{"text":"To me that just sounds like an excuse.

Let's take a look at the details of the Camp David summit in 2000 that people often cite as an example of Palestine being unreasonable: Barak's offer of the West bank did not include areas already controlled by Israel, including the settlements, areas around the Dead Sea and Jordan Valley.  The deal effective gave Israel 10% of the West Bank with about 10% remaining under \\"temporary\\" control of the IDF.  What would be left were non-contiguous areas for Palestinians broken up by settlements and roads that Israel would control. In return for allowing Israel to annex some of the best land in the West Bank, Israel offered them a much smaller area of desert near Gaza. Additionally, the offer included permanent control of Palestinian airspace, permanent IDF military installations in the West Bank, and additional annexed land for security along the border of Jordan. The deal gave Israel the right to invade any time there was an \\"emergency.\\" It demanded Palestine be demilitarized and have it's foreign policy subject to Israeli approval. Barak refused to give Palestine any control over Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.Israel would not admit to any part they may have played in the creation of Palestinian refugees nor would they offer them a non-trivial right to return. This is not an offer of sovereign statehood or self determination. Today, Israel's government explicitly rejects any sort of two state solution and doesn't even hide the fact that their policy is to encourage increased settlement such that a two state solution would never be practically possible. It also appears they may annex and re-settle northern Gaza.","title":"CMV: The only way the Israel/Palestine conflict can be solved is a 2 state solution and money from the UN"},{"text":"wdym?","title":"President Biden, dont break your promise to go big on clemency"},{"text":"So I really want to agree with you. But allow me to ramble a bit.I hate the occupation of the west bank, truly the biggest mistake Israel actual ever made was not immediately pulling out of the west bank following the 67 war. For reasons that I dont wanna get into I dont think its to the extent of an apartheid but its clearly an occupation, one that is horrible and degrading for west bank Palestinians. Frequently I find myself thinking and just wishing Israel just woke up one day and said ' you know what? Fuck this mess' and just pulled out of 90%+ of the west bank, if not all of it.Israel pulled out of Gaza in the early 2000's and talking to my parents and grandma there was genuine hope that if not a 2SS was close, that Gaza would change for the better. The reality was obviously far far from it. A terrorist group was voted into to power, and as much as people want to say the people of Gaza were tricked by what Hamas promised they still had the explicit goal of murdering all jews in their charter.This is where I find myself in a circle of logic I cannot get out of. That if Israel just pulled out of the west bank, that more or less the same thing would happen. I see no good reason to think that history would not repeat itself.None of this is to say Israel is without blame, far from it. Since 2008 Israel has not been serious about coming to a 2SS, nor even baby steps in order to improving the situation. But I always come back to the pull out of Gaza and the disaster that arose from it.This is not to say I believe a 2SS impossible. But that a serious overhaul of Palestinian administration and more importantly education has to take place. On the Israeli side, the settlements obviously need to stop and a prime minister actually interested in taking steps to achieve a 2SS needs to come to power.Oh and as much as the UN will most likely have a role to play in a 2SS.

They want the entirety of Israel. They have stated this themselves. Its in the Hamas charter, they say so in interviews. The PLO originally started with that objective, then walked it back slightly. The Palestinians were offered a two state solution multiple times and have rejected it every time.* The conflict continues largely due to funding and weapons from Iran. Irans geopolitical motive is obvious: they want continued conflict in the region, because it strand alliances between all of its enemies (the West, Saudi Arabia &amp; Shia states). Iran doesnt care in the slightest about Palestinian people but funds its extremists. You need to resolve that source of influence and tension.* The UN has proven to be both biased and incompetent. Look at how inefficient the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon are. They basically watched Hezbollah ship missiles to southern Lebanon then fire thousands of them, then proclaimed to the word that they were powerless to police the region - but Israel is wrong for engaging with them. The UNs aid team in Gaza - UNRWA - was infiltrated by Hamas, which enabled lots of smuggling. The UN is not some above it all objective arbiter of morality - its a political institution. As a political institution it has a major anti Israel bias, as you have 23 Muslim states voting against Israel than 40 European principalities kowtowing to them because of their energy dependence - while they all vote that the U.S. and China should pay for everything (which they basically do anyways).

And with the current administration in israel, they're not going to get a deal like that anyways, not till the right wingers are out of power. Every single peace deal in the past the Palestinian leadership has either 1. Said no unless an unrealistic demand like unlimited right of return was met or 2.

The most simplified version of this is that uninsured or under insured end up costing us WAY more than they would if they had guaranteed health insurance. Instead of seeing their PCP, they let problems fester until its an ambulance ride to the ER and several days in the hospital. We also eventually have to pay for that, but its just way more expensive. Every other advanced nation on earth has guaranteed healthcare for ALL of their citizens. I personally use the ACA because I am self employed.

Healthcare is expensive because its a limited resource - there are more people needing care than doctors/hospitals able to provide it. Therefore, theres an allocation problem that insurance companies have become the ones to solve. An individuals health outcome will be best if they have a team of doctors giving them 24/7 monitoring for a stubbed toe, however due to our current limitation this would come at an increased cost.Therefore, in order to allocate our limited healthcare resources, someone has to determine which procedures/operations are necessary and which arent. This analysis must be done at a population level, so leaving it up to individual doctors isnt ideal. In a socialized healthcare system, its usually the state determining whats medically necessary. In a private healthcare system, extra treatment is available if youre willing to pay. However, if you purchase health insurance, the insurance carrier is the payer, and they are incentivized to provide the highest average care at the lowest average price.Clearly, having a heart surgeon in the room for a stubbed toe on the off chance that theyre needed isnt an ideal outcome, and that surgeons time should be freed up to someone more deserving. Now imagine the 1-in-a-million scenario where the stubbed toe leads to a heart attack but the claim was denied. Unfortunately, in a closer scenario, theres often no good solution. The reality is that due to the general lack of healthcare, sacrifices have to be made where one individuals outcomes are compromised for societal efficiency/allocation.?","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"!ping JEWISH","title":"The lefts problem with Jews has a long and miserable history"},{"text":"I respect some of your positions, either if they're not directly relevant to my OP/argument.","title":"CMV: Writing off the Syrian Rebels as 'Jihadist terrorists' plays into Russia's hands and will help whitewash retaliatory war crimes in the coming months as it did in 2016."},{"text":"Spiritual people may see these things in the terms of angelic versus demonic, or Godly versus satanic.

Its an ethnic folk religion rooted in practice more than a belief necessarily, so saying strongly religious doesnt mean what you might think it does. Israel also has strongly organized labor, socialized welfare, minority interest groups, etc. These people would always find something to hate about it. The fundamental, issue with leftist double standards on Israel is that its the one successful place that a historically marginalized group came back in power and wields it on their termsin a good way or bad way is irrelevant. Instead of being happy that a marginalized group now has self determination, theyre enraged that its not done the way theyd like it to be done. You can see this happening with other groups in real time, like the rage at the First Nations groups around Vancouver who are mass developing their land to their liking instead of leaving it as some nature preserve for white people.IMO Israel is currently using their power badly, but the fact of the matter is thats their ability to do because thats how countries work, and if Jews are to have national self determination like everybody else that also comes with the downsides of having levers of power. Where the antisemitism comes in is instead of these groups doing what they do for other countriestargeting specific political parties or actions or policiesthey revert back to the old tropes of Jews cant be trusted with what we trust ourselves to do and jump to Israel shouldnt exist at all.

I would never say that the healthcare CEO and the shooter are the same, or even massively similar. They have commonalities, certainly, but of course they are different. However, I think the moral reasoning you have developed here does not work particularly well here.That said, while there are distinctions, said distinctions can be more and less pertinent to the situation at hand. Like, if I say the CEO is like a school shooter, and someone is like, \\"It is ridiculous to compare the two in order to defend killing the CEO. After all, the CEO was responsible for many more deaths than any school shooter,\\" then that would be a really weird argument to make. With that in mind...Your comparison to a person shooting randomly into a crowd also fails to generalize here. That hypothetical involves reckless behavior in real time with immediate and foreseeable lethal consequences. The CEOs actions, while harmful, are administrative decisions made within the context of a legal and economic framework. This doesnt absolve them of moral responsibility, but it makes equating their decisions to random gunfire inappropriate. Intent and context matter when assessing moral and legal blame.Is the distinction you're drawing here really that the random shooter is more reckless? It certainly can't be that only the shooter's actions have foreseeable lethal consequences. The CEO's actions have those as well, after all. Yeah, I'd agree that the CEO is causing death in a non-random way. That's worse. You see how that's worse, right? And is it really supposed to matter to me that the CEO is acting within a legal and economic framework? Like, here's a question, was it wrong to murder slave owners when slavery was more of a thing? Cause doing that seems eminently reasonable to me.As for the vigilante example, self-defense in real time against a school shooter actively harming others is not analogous to assassinating a CEO. Intervening to stop an imminent threat is fundamentally different from killing someone who is not currently harming anyone.The CEO was currently harming people. He was actively making decisions and shaping policy right up until the day of his death. It's not like he was just like, \\"I command United Healthcare to chug along,\\" and then took a long nap.Even in the case of a hypothetical fancy token granting immunity to the shooter, bypassing the justice system with personal retribution creates dangerous precedent and chaos. Allowing vigilante action undermines the rule of law and replaces it with subjective judgments of who deserves to diea slippery slope that erodes societal stability.I would say this is the exact opposite of true. What creates a dangerous precedent, what erodes societal stability, is giving certain people and certain types of harm immunity from retribution within the system. Such a structure is inherently unstable, and is, I would say, the worst way for a justice system to operate. Why should those with the most power be held least accountable for their actions? I wouldn't call vigilantes murdering CEOs the absolute most stable system of justice, but I wouldn't call it particularly less stable than what we have now, where CEOs are insulated from consequences for all but the most overt and horrific behavior. And I definitely wouldn't call it particularly less just.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"You are chronically online. \\nMurdering people,  even bad people,  it's not acceptable in modern society","title":"CMV: Blue states should now implement universal healthcare."},{"text":"That'd be cool.

There would be no debate about whether \\"trickle down economics\\" works or not.Let's clear something up first... \\"trickle down economics\\" is the name given to Reagan economic policies by Reagan's critics. These policies were used to address the economy when it was in a particular state. In that case, the policies favored the supply side with an aim to combat record inflation (which it did, bringing 13% inflation down to 1%). The problem came in with not shifting strategies once inflation was under control. Serious economists understand that each economic state may require different strategies to address. Sometimes the needed intervention may favor the supply side, sometimes it may favor demand. Anyone who argues that only supply or demand side policies should ever be used is simply a moron.Just to show that these policies aren't really divided by party, the Harris-Waltz housing plan included tax incentives for home builders,  assistance in developing construction methods, and streamlining regulatory processes. These policies benefit the businesses rather than buyers in the hope that those benefits will aid buyers.With that out of the way, let's get to your primary assertion that there wouldn't be any disagreement if economics was a science.

It operates based on the scientific method using empirical evidence. There is a subfield in economics called econometrics which looks at historical trends and is able to determine how likely one variable (like unemployment) is correlated to another variable (like interest rates) using statistics and linear regression.One of the key pillars of economics is the idea that supply and demand form a market price. This is the most widely studied relationship and has been proven out time after time. For instance, when a hurricane wipes out a crop of oranges in Florida, the supply is reduced and price goes up. By contrast when there is lower demand for something the price of the good almost always goes down (assuming fixed supply).Another example that is in the headlines today is tariffs. We have historical evidence that increasing tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices for consumers as the companies pass their costs on to consumers. Theres also the concept of comparative advantage, where a country produces the good that it is best at producing and trades with another country for what the other country is best at producing this is the basis for why trade inherently lowers costs and is beneficial to nations.There are so many amazing concepts in economics beyond what I mentioned that have nothing to do with the national macroeconomy as you stated. I think you may be unfairly limiting the scope of economics to just predicting recessions, which is only a very very small aspect. There is also microeconomics which studies how companies operate and has nothing to do with macroeconomics which studies more national-level strategies.With Macroeconomics it is inherently difficult to predict with 100% accuracy because there are countless factors at work. But to lump all of economics into that one small bucket is not an accurate assessment of everything the field is trying to do. And even with macroeconomics, most economists realize that its not a perfect science, but still try to make the best predictions possible given the billions of different motivations and incentives of all the individual people and firms that make up a market.","title":"CMV: Economics is not a real science"},{"text":"Thats the problem right there.

It is very easy to understand how they work: they help you create antibodies to destroy the disease by injecting a tiny dose of it, so that if you encounter it again, your body can fight it off. The effects of vaccines are obvious too: illnesses that used to be leading causes of death hardly kill anyone now because of mass vaccine uptake.And yet, despite the fact that biology is a hard science and is not only provable but observable, people not only disregard it but argue against it.

Intent is central to the definition of murder, both legally and morally. A school shooter acts with the explicit intention of killing; their primary goal is to take lives. By contrast, the CEOs decisions, while harmful, lack that intent. Their actions are part of a flawed system prioritizing profit over care, not a deliberate plan to cause death. Ignoring this distinction misrepresents the nature of both situations and muddles any meaningful conversation about accountability.Your comparison to a person shooting randomly into a crowd also fails to generalize here. That hypothetical involves reckless behavior in real time with immediate and foreseeable lethal consequences. The CEOs actions, while harmful, are administrative decisions made within the context of a legal and economic framework. This doesnt absolve them of moral responsibility, but it makes equating their decisions to random gunfire inappropriate. Intent and context matter when assessing moral and legal blame.As for the vigilante example, self-defense in real time against a school shooter actively harming others is not analogous to assassinating a CEO. Intervening to stop an imminent threat is fundamentally different from killing someone who is not currently harming anyone. Even in the case of a hypothetical fancy token granting immunity to the shooter, bypassing the justice system with personal retribution creates dangerous precedent and chaos. Allowing vigilante action undermines the rule of law and replaces it with subjective judgments of who deserves to diea slippery slope that erodes societal stability.The CEOs actions should be scrutinized, and systemic reform is absolutely necessary. But framing their decisions as equivalent to murder or suggesting extrajudicial killing is justified ignores the complexity of these situations and risks escalating harm rather than addressing it. Justice must operate within the rule of law, even when the system itself needs fixing. Violence outside that framework isnt justiceits an abandonment of it.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"Eh I dont know anyone irl who isnt rich af who is upset either","title":"CMV: Blue states should now implement universal healthcare."},{"text":"i'm gonna go ahead and say you have never taken more than an intro course.  \\"Econometrics is a branch of economics that uses statistical and mathematical methods to analyze economic data.

I think there are two problems with your example. First, that theres much debate. Theres not that much tbh. Most economists at this point, and even at the time saw the problem with it. Milton Friedman was not in the majority on his view. It was just a convenient person for republicans to say look! This economist backs it! In every science theres still disagreement. We saw this during Covid where the consensus was clear, but there were still a few doctors paraded out by Fox News and the like as vaccine skeptics. Doesnt mean its not a science, just means its basically impossible to get consensus. The second point Id make to this example is that supply side economics COULD work with different policies, including much stronger regulation and much higher tax rates for the rich. So ironically the only scenario the right wing economics actually works is by implementing policies that are distinctly not right wing. But that doesnt mean theres a right and wrong here. There are different ways to run an economy. There will always be trade offs. Theres no one measure in terms of this is the best and people can disagree on what to prioritize.

They werent some unforeseen outcome that he couldnt think of.And if he did intend those deaths, knowingly took action that would lead to people dying for his own benefit, is he not responsible? Does that not make him a killer?Additionally, how much can be blamed on the system? We agree that the system is blamed for the bad outcomes, but doesnt an individual within the system have responsibility for how the system acts.System is akin to a crime ring. Sure, the Mafia is responsible for the crime, but each person in the mafia have individual varying levels of responsibility. If a member of the mafia goes to beat someone up because the mafia covers them legally, that person is still responsible for the decisions they have made directly. Arnold who told Bob when the target is alone has some responsibility, Bob who went to assault has some responsibility, Carl who talks with the cops to let Bob go has some responsibility, and the cops who agreed to the bribe have some responsibility. How much responsibility each person has differs.The CEO has responsibility for causing the death of these people through his direct and informed actions.

No one knows how to a run an economy. This is the central premise of Hayek's 1945 paper the Use of Knowledge in society. No one actor has all the relevant tacit, local information to make the effective decisions since that is inherently dispersed.

What was once the domain of right antisemitism has migrated, as it does, to be employed by left antisemitism.Which is a problem many people have exceptional difficulty with, this idea that antisemitism is bigotry against Jews, I'm a progressive so I definitionally oppose bigotry, so of course nothing I do or say is bigoted, and I can't be antisemitic.But antisemitism has never played by the rules of other bigotries because it doesn't function like other bigotries, since it's not just hatred of Jews because they pray a certain way or don't eat certain foods; it's also fundamentally a way to explain the world. It's been woven into fabrics of societies for millennia so people don't recognize when they engage in it.Izabella Tabarovsky wrote an essay called [\\"Soviet Anti-Zionism and Contemporary Left Antisemitism\\"](https://fathomjournal.org/soviet-anti-zionism-and-contemporary-left-antisemitism/) in which she details how contemporary \\"anti-Zionism\\" has Soviet Zionology not just as its roots, but is sometimes word-for-word:On August 7, 1967, an article titled What Is Zionism? appeared simultaneously in several Soviet publications. Its author, Yuri Ivanov, an employee of the KGB and Central Committee apparatus who would go on to become one of the leading Soviet anti-Zionist writers, took his clue from age-old tropes of Jewish conspiracy and influence: he presented Zionism as a centrally-controlled international system that gripped the entirety of global politics, finance and the media, had unlimited resources, and sought to establish monopolistic control over the entire world.\\nDavid Hirsh wrote a book about the issue of antisemitism in British higher education, *Contemporary Left Antisemitism*, but since October has been more applicable to American education as well:Sometimes, we define our own identities in relation to some other. Early Christianity defined itself in relation\\nto the Jews who refused to accept its gospel, and it portrayed them as Christ-killers. Some people who wanted to\\nembrace modernity constructed their identities in relation to the image of the traditional Jew with his beard and\\ncoat, standing against progress. Some others who were afraid of the new found they could define themselves\\nagainst the modernist Jew. Nineteenth-century nationalists often defined Jews as foreigner. Twentieth-century\\ntotalitarianisms, which had universal ambition, found their other in the cosmopolitan or international Jew....This book argues that a politics of position is emerging on the left in preference to a politics of reason or\\npersuasion. This tends to solidify an essentialist notion of who belongs in the community of the oppressed and\\nthe community of the progressive. The boundaries of these communities are coming more and more to be\\npoliced by coercive discursive practices and less by democratic debate and persuasion. **Hostility to Israel\\nbecomes a key marker of identity in this process. If Jews are reluctant to embrace this hostility to Israel identity,\\nthen they risk exile from what I am calling the community of the good.**The focus of this book is on that variant of antizionism which thinks of itself as antiracist, but this is only one\\ntradition within global antizionism. From its roots in twentieth-century European Stalinism and at the heart of\\nJihadi Islamist and Arab Nationalist politics, antizionism has often been uninterested in distinguishing itself\\nfrom antisemitism. Tropes, elements of rhetoric and common-sense notions migrate between antiracist and\\ndemocratic spaces, nationalist and Islamist spaces, fringe and mainstream spaces, different kinds of media and\\nthe right, the left and the political centre...Todays antisemitism is difficult to recognize because it does not\\ncome dressed in a Nazi uniform and it does not openly proclaim its hatred or fear of Jews. **In fact it says it has\\nlearnt the lessons of Jew-hatred better than most Jews have, and it says that, unlike them, it stands in the\\nantiracist tradition. It is an antisemitism which positions Jews themselves as oppressors, and it positions those\\nwho develop hostile narratives about Jews as oppressed.**...The Livingstone Formulation conflates everything C criticism of Israel but also other things which do not seem\\nto be so legitimate, such as repeatedly insulting a Jewish reporter by comparing him to a Nazi C into the category\\nof legitimate criticism of Israel. The Livingstone Formulation does not simply accuse people who raise the issue\\nof antisemitism of being wrong; it accuses them of being wrong on purpose: the accusation of antisemitism has\\nbeen used against anyone who is critical (my italics) C not an honest mistake, but a secret, common plan to try\\nto de-legitimize criticism by means of the instrumental use of a charge of antisemitism; crying wolf; playing the\\nantisemitism card. This is an allegation of malicious intent made against the (unspecified) people who raise\\nconcerns about antisemitism. It is not possible to use the accusation of antisemitism in order to de-legitimize\\ncriticism of Israel, without dishonest intent; it is an accusation of bad faith....The Jews of the Holocaust still symbolize absolute powerlessness, the oppressed; but the Jews who survived the\\nHolocaust, particularly those who found sanctuary in Israel or the USA, fit better into another ready-made way\\nof thinking about Jews: disproportionate power. In the tradition of secondary antisemitism, the Holocaust itself\\nis thought to be one significant source of that power. In the tradition of anti-capitalist antisemitism, the sale of\\ntheir souls to imperialism is the other source of Jewish power. This is the old ambivalence of the left: are the\\nJews glamorously powerless, or are they menacingly all too powerful? Are they oppressed or oppressors?\\n[Also, shout-out to Dara Horn's *People Love Dead Jews*]...The problem is that if it was to concede that antisemitism is possible within an antiracist space, then it is\\nconceded that one must be vigilant against antisemitism, that one must educate about antisemitism, that one\\nmust take care; that is why there is great reluctance ever to admit that anything that happens within an antiracist\\nspace is antisemitic. What is required is debate about what is antisemitic and what is not. In order to avoid such\\ndebate, it is necessary to deny that anything is antisemitic and that all such charges are made in bad faith.","title":"The lefts problem with Jews has a long and miserable history"},{"text":"Nobody.

It didn't get blocked, it passed.  Vermont was doing single payer/universal healthcare on \\"easy mode.\\"  They get all the healthy, working adults on their plan, and could put the elderly and infirm on Medicare/Medicaid along with the less healthy older people.  The result of their plan would be a giant single pool for the healthiest, least risky members in the state.They still couldn't get the math to work.Vermont is not very poor, largely homogeneous, and couldn't get this to work straight.  The economy of scale isn't significant in this case because health *services* don't scale like that.  You can't magically create more hours for surgery, more opportunities for office visits.  In a nation where 85-90% of the population is already covered, you've hit the scale portion already, and the only possible benefit is the negotiation aspect from a single pool (a negotiation situation that [has not resulted in lower prices for large insurance pools *now* compared to single payer and single payer-style nations in Europe] (http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-30/single-payer-would-make-health-care-worse)), but that is probably not enough to offset the significant costs that our system incurs.If we tried to do it nationally,  even at its most generous budgetary ask, would cost us close to $4 trillion/year. For context, total tax receipts in 2022 were $4.9 trillion. Even if we were to take every dollar paid toward private insurance plans and push them toward single payer, you're only looking at $1.3 trillion (of which, only $60b is profit). If we add federal, state, local spending on health care to that, we still have a gap of close to $1 trillion/year.

What about this is not science?The main problem with your understanding of economics is that money is a social construct and almost all of the variables within economics are impacted by social actors (i.e., people). Economics itself is a social study. We have created a way to describe value via a proxy concept and peoples behaviour impacts those values.And so, when people who prefer to base things on some constants try to understand economics, they inevitably end up feeling as if they are on a shaky ground. Physics has things that are constant. Economics has very few of those, if any. And thats the basic source of confusion. Someone might say that economics isnt hard science, but who cares whats hard science and what isnt? Economics is an attempt at understanding human behaviour, and since people are not perfectly predictable, we and up with estimates and not absolute facts.

This is the same way mechanics charge for services. If a surgery went longer than expected, the anesthesiologist is not paid for the extra time. The patient does not have to pay anything extra. The policy would have lowered costs which would be passed on to policy holders as lower premiums. However, the public backlash against the move, and perhaps executives' fear for their safety, caused them to rescind the policy.That is the problem with your thinking--healthcare is complicated and the mob is dumb. People have their pitchforks and guns out without understanding an issue.

When people buy a house, they do inspections, they usually have an agent, they look at many different options, etc. Because people know it's a big deal. It's a lot of money. It's important. But for some reason when people buy health insurance, or are interviewing at a company that provides health insurance, they don't do nearly the same legwork as they do for buying a house. Despite the fact that health insurance is probably more important. If you spend 30 minutes comparing health insurance plans from various companies, just using reviews on the internet. It would be trivial to notice that United denies a shitload of claims.The issue that I'm trying to bring up, is that people don't seem to regard selecting health insurance as a potentially life-altering decision. When it definitely is. They often just pick the cheapest one, and then are surprised when they have a bad product.Now I'm not blaming ordinary people for this problem. People will always be lazy and cheap  Which is why I think the decision should be made for them, using a single-payer model.

States have general power to set up health insurance plans, but...1. Self-Insured Employers: Employers are allowed to act as their own health insurance companies.  A lot of times they'll contract out to private companies for billing, but it's really the employer that is the insurance company. The last time I looked at the figures, something like 50% of the workforce is under self-insured plans. That money  that the employers are using to cover their employees is not available to a state UHI plan without a change in Federal law.  And the state would have to take that money from employers and redirect it to the UHC plan--and the way to do that is a new employer tax.  Employers are obviously going to fight this tooth-and-nail against all of this.\\n2. Medicaid: If a state can show that its implementation meets Medicaid minimum requirements, it can get a waiver from Medicaid to implement a UHI plan.  A waiver would mean that Federal Medicaid money could go into the plan. But... if the President is hostile to UHI plans, then no waiver is coming.\\n3. Medicare: There is really no way under Federal law to redirect Medicare funds into a state UHI plan.  Congress has had plenty of time to change this, and they haven't.  So, without Medicare funds, a state would have to leave seniors out of the plan (they would switch to Medicare at retirement). If the state UHI plan provides better coverage than Medicare, that's going to cause a lot of resentment.From a theoretical standpoint, there's nothing stopping a state from implementing UHI.  But, because of the way our current health insurance system evolved, it isn't really practical to do without several changes in Federal law which don't seem to be coming.There's another problem, though.  States usually aren't allowed to run deficits.  During recessions, this would mean that funds a state has to provide coverage is reduced.  Since the Feds don't have to worry about this, it's more practical for them to act as an insurer.","title":"CMV: Blue states should now implement universal healthcare."},{"text":"All evidence shows that actually tightening abortion restrictions helps Republicans win elections.That, and it's the right thing to do.","title":"Outgoing DNC Chair Says Identity Politics Should Remain Central Message After Landslide Loss"},{"text":"It was either an Interregnum or Macron","title":"Merkel-worship was liberalism at its worst"},{"text":"How can you not see that that draft registration (for anyone with a male body and only anyone with a male body) is regulating, not in part but in entirety, the bodies of all individuals with male bodies?.

A school shooter intentionally commits acts of murder with the explicit goal of taking lives. The CEO, while responsible for harmful decisions, did not act with the intent to kill. His decisions were business choices made within the confines of a flawed systema system shaped by laws, policies, and societal values. Equating the two ignores the fundamental difference between deliberate violence and systemic harm.Of course the CEO bears responsibility for his actions, but those actions arent murder. Calling them that misrepresents what happened and oversimplifies the problem. And even in the case of a school shooter, vigilantism would be unacceptable. Acting as judge, jury, and executioner undermines the rule of law and creates a world where anyone could be targeted based on subjective judgment.

And because he is murdering people en masse, a mass murderer. The same way a terrorist who thinks killing many civilians is ok in their goal of whatever is a mass murderer, even if they arent going out with the explicit purpose of \\"killing people is fun\\".And yes, due to the legal constraints the CEO is forced to make certain unethical actions to please the shareholders, however in that situation, the CEO is at best complicit, instead of resigning and living comfortably with his wealth, he is doing the unethical thing. And if he resigned and a new CEO came in, it would be that CEO's moral duty to resign. And any CEO that didnt, would be unethical. To make an analogy, lets say I have a button that does something bad, and I present it to someone and told them \\"either you press it, or I present it to someone else\\", and they refuse, so I go to the next person, and the next, and the next. If each (non-me) agent in this scenario makes the ethical decision to not press the button, then The Bad Thing doesnt happen, since no one is forced to press the button. But if an agent decides to press it, then they are making an unethical decision, and are responsible for The Bad Thing, even if they try to justify it with the existence of other bad agents.One difference here is that due to this not being a binary button, arguably the most ethical action he could take would be to do the bare minimum to make the share holders happy while doing his best to oppose everything else, thus preventing a bad agent from doing worse. But this is not the case for this CEO.We absolutely should focus on the system, and make it so that no one can press the Bad Thing button, but until then, the agents who press the button are responsible. And people being agitated towards those agents is a good thing as long as they are agitated towards the entire group and not just that one specific person. And from what Ive seen, people voicing hatred of this CEO use it as a jumping board to say \\"and everyone else who continue this system\\", Im yet to see someone argue that he was an outliar and how the system is actually fine.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"So, did he not consider some Democrats could save his nomination?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 6, 2024"},{"text":"W laid the groundwork for Trump.

For the health care industry, The incentives are pretty misaligned, And while there is a ton of regulation, none of that has really aligned the incentives to actually provide good service.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"Might?","title":"Democrats and Republicans in Congress worried that Gabbard might leak information to Syria"},{"text":"What if the citizenry just set up a non profit insurer?","title":"CMV: Blue states should now implement universal healthcare."},{"text":"Maybe Trump should just tele-commute from Mar-a-Lago since about 90% of federal government workers dont go into the office either. ??","title":"'Breathtaking speed': Trump's Paris trip marks return to global stage as leaders turn 'the page' on Biden - A former Trump State Department official says the 'Oval Office has been replaced by Mar-a-Lago'"},{"text":"He is talking about the side closest to him?","title":"Sanctimonious Obama Warns 'One Side' Is Going to 'Rig Elections and Weaponize the Justice System'"},{"text":"I'm going to speak to IL specifically since I live here. There are serious budget issues going on right now. In order to implement universal healthcare in the state, that will increase the spending dramatically which means significant increases in state taxes or piles of deficit spending that isn't sustainable. And it begs the question on if this coverage will cover medical treatment outside the state. I live right on the border of IL/IA. The closest hospital is about 5 minutes away in IA. The closest hospital in IL is about 20 minutes, and it is very small/limited. An equivalent to the closest hospital in IL would be about 35 minutes away. Part of universal healthcare being able to bring down costs is that there is one entity paying and they can negotiate rates accordingly. Are they going to be able to do that with providers in other states? Maybe, maybe not, but they will have much less leverage than they do over providers in their own state. Then we have the pay motive. If providers can't charge as much, they aren't making as much on a procedure, and the demand is higher. If you are a doctor, would you stay and have to do more work (while likely being understaffed) to potentially get the same paycheck or less or would you go somewhere where the working conditions are better and you can make more for less work?

There's probably a bunch of other ways this is a systemic failure too. So, in this case too, our society as a whole bears some degree of responsibility for the shooting.

Id argue that as long as no legal option is possible they are still an acceptable murder target because they are going to be causing death even if right now they are unarmed.Everyone's justifications are subjective, thats what subjective means. There is no \\"objective morality\\" that dictates killing a general is \\"correct\\". Its just that we as humans have decided that there are conditions where some things are correct and some things are not. It is intersubjective(objective only by the decision of the group), there is no atom of \\"that is bad\\", we just collectively decide that things are bad or good. Because ultimately you cant \\"prove\\" ethics, in the same way you cant \\"prove\\" that the + symbol denotes addition. While I can argue with someone on what ethical framework best serves our axioms, I cant argue why my axioms are \\"correct\\", because theyre things you take as given. There is no \\"proving\\" why \\"we should maximize human well being and freedom while minimizing suffering\\", because at its core it is arbitrary.Just like how I can show you that 2x3=6, as long as we agree on the arbitrary decision that x means multiplication and = means that two sides are equal. But for example if someone decides that \\"we should maximize the amount of blue clothes people wear\\" is their axiom, then you cant argue with them on the merits of being kind to others.Against many people in the world there are no legal ways of stopping or punishing them. We can both agree that no matter how many people died because their insurance coverage was denied unjustly, this CEO was never going to get in trouble. And yet this CEO would continue to make decisions that resulted in more people being unjustly denied for the sake of profit. So we have someone here who has caused and will cause untold amounts of death and suffering, and that legal options are not available. If we have such a situation, is killing him bad if it leaves the CEO chair empty for a few weeks and any planned unjust policy is delayed, leading to many people recieving coverage they otherwise wouldnt recieve?And for your examples Id say that the first one is not covered under this as it rests outside the conditions and rules Ive set for my claim. If everyone in society came together to vote for someone's death, and I thought that the decision was unethical, then I would say that it is unethical, otherwise I would say it is ethical. For example, if people voted to kill hitler2, I would be fine with it, but if people voted to kill little timmy down the street because he plays with his toys too loudly, I would oppose it.For the second one, it works the same way how we can decide that \\"it is ok to kill enemy combatants\\", and if someone goes \\"well, old enough civilians can be enemy combatants if they grab a large stick, so Im killing enemy combatants\\", we would say that thats wrong because we disagree on their definition of an enemy combatant. Similarly, I would disagree with their definition of abortion being mass murder.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"perspective, something that only comes with age, is invaluable. knowing that a decade goes by in the blink of an eye is something young people cant grasp because their lives are only 2 decades long give or take.?\\nthis is aside from the fact that old people literally built everything you have, regardless of their actual involvement. the phone you use is only possible because old people exist, the Internet and more is only around because of currently or future old people. if you cant give a small amount of respect to the old for even that then you dont really deserve any of the things you have.\\nim only 30 but i can see that the last 10 years have changed me simply because they have happened, no other reason than ive seen how time flows and changes people. ive learned things i would not have understood at 20 that i can now appreciate at 30, i can see the ways in which young people are falling into the same ways that my generation did, and see now what my elders meant when they tried to guide me.?\\nhindsight is 20/20, you cant go back and change the past but you can try to help those younger in the position you used to be in to see the path more clearly. without respect the young will just disregard what the old try to teach only to learn the hard way in the end.\\nthats why respect is important, regardless of what wisdom the elder has to share everyone has something worth sharing even if everything they share isnt correct something might be","title":"CMV: Respect your elders is merely an ingrained custom thats actually kind of baseless and shouldnt be a thing."},{"text":"Do voters in Mississippi really expect the GOP to solve problems?

But also their policies are laid out and relatively straightforward English If anyone bothers to look them up and there are plenty of reviews and complaints that people could read if they cared about shopping around for health insurance. The buyer has some onus that I don't think is being considered when people bitch about health insurance.As for why claims are denied, yeah United wants to maximize profit and line their shareholders' pockets, but the easiest way for them to do this is by increasing market share by offering a competitive product. And their strategy is to offer it as cheap as possible. Like flying on frontier airlines, they suck but you get what you pay for.Is it Amazon's fault when you order a $20 espresso machine and it sucks when you get it?

While its true that messaging shapes beliefs, many Americans genuinely support private healthcare for reasons beyond propagandasuch as distrust of government-run systems or satisfaction with their own coverage. Whether or not you agree with those views, they are a significant factor in why the system exists as it does. Its not about saying the system is good because people support it, but recognizing that this support, misguided or not, is part of the problem and cannot be ignored when discussing systemic change.As for the media coverage, its true that the deaths caused by denied claims rarely make headlines. But the disproportionate focus on this CEOs death doesnt erase the broader systemic issues. It highlights a key point: blaming one individual, no matter how prominent, oversimplifies a deeply entrenched problem. The lack of coverage on denied claims isnt the result of some grand conspiracy to protect private healthcare; its a reflection of a news industry driven by sensationalism and profit. Thats part of the same system youre criticizing.You also argue that just because something is legal doesnt make it moral, which is absolutely correct. But equating the CEO to a mass murderer is both morally and factually wrong. His decision to implement an AI system to deny claims wasnt an act of malicious intent to kill but an effort to increase efficiency, a common practice in every industry. The real problem lies in the structure of the private insurance system, where adhering to plan guidelinesno matter how harmful those guidelines may beis prioritized over care. This isnt about excusing harmful outcomes, but its important to distinguish between systemic failures and deliberate acts of violence. Murder involves intent to kill, and theres no evidence the CEO acted with such intent.Finally, your analogy about the moral responsibility of someone with the power to harm is compelling, but it doesnt fully account for the constraints of operating within a broken system. CEOs like this one are incentivized and even legally obligated to prioritize shareholder value over other considerations. While that doesnt absolve them of all responsibility, the focus on one person distracts from the real issue: a healthcare system built on profit rather than care. If we want to fix this, we need to address the system itself, not scapegoat individuals who are operating within its rules. The problem isnt just the decisions of one CEO; its the collective values and choices of a society that allows this system to persist.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"It was a stupid name for sometime you very much would care about if you had any concept of what it meant to your wallet and quality of care.","title":"Obama still doesnt get why Trump won.

In January a meeting of the Kings College London Israel Society, gathered to hear from Ami Ayalon, a former head of Shin Bet, the Israeli domestic intelligence service, who now champions a two-state solution, was violently interrupted by a chair-hurling, window-smashing crowd.\\nLast summer the Guardian columnist Owen Jones made a courageous plea for the left to confront this demon head on. Since then, however, criticism of Israeli government policies has mutated into a rejection of Israels right to exist; the Fatah position replaced by Hamas and Hizbollah eliminationism. More darkly, support in the diaspora for Israels right to survive is seen by the likes of Labours Gerald Kaufman, who accused the government of being influenced in its Middle Eastern policy by Jewish money, as some sort of Jewish conspiracy.\\nThe charge that anti-Zionism is morphing into anti-Semitism is met with the retort that the former is being disingenuously conflated with the latter. But when George Galloway (in August 2014 during the last Gaza war) declared Bradford an Israel-free zone; when French Jews are unable to wear a yarmulke in public lest that invite assault, when Holocaust Memorial day posters are defaced, it is evident that what we are dealing with is, in Professor Alan Johnsons accurate coinage, anti-semitic anti-Zionism.\\nThe fact is that the terrorists who slaughtered customers at the kosher supermarket in Paris did not ask their victims whether they were Israelis, much less supporters of Israeli government policies. They were murdered as Jews because in the attackers poisoned minds all Jews are indivisibly incriminated as persecutors of the Palestinians and thus fair game for murder.\\nWhen the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement singles out Israel as the perpetrator of the worlds worst iniquities, notwithstanding its right of self defence, it is legitimate to ask why the lefts wrath does not extend, for example, to Russia which rains down destruction on civilian populations in Syria?\\nWhy is it somehow proper to boycott Israeli academics and cultural institutions, many of which are critical of government policy, but to remain passive in the face of Saudi Arabias brutal punishment of anyone whose exercise of freedom of conscience can be judged sacrilegious? Why is the rage so conspicuously selective? Or, to put it another way, why is it so much easier to hate the Jews?\\nGrowing up in London in the shadow of world war two my pals and I talked about who might be the bad guys, should evil come our way. We agreed the Jew-haters would not wear brown shirts and jackboots but would probably be like people on the bus. It is not the golf club nose-holders we have to worry about now; it is those who, in their indignation at the sufferings visited on the Palestinians, and their indifference to almost-daily stabbings in the streets of Israel, have discovered the excitement of saying the unspeakable, making hay with history, so Israel is the new reich, and a military attack on Gaza indistinguishable from the industrially processed incineration of millions.\\nEnter the historian. And history says this: anti-Semitism has not been caused by Zionism; it is precisely the other way round. Israel was caused by the centuries-long dehumanisation of the Jews. The blood libel which accused Jews of murdering Christian children in order to drain their blood for the baking of Passover matzo began in medieval England but never went away, reviving in 16th century Italy, 18th century Poland, 19th century Syria and Bohemia, and 20th century Russia.\\nIn 1980s Syria, Mustafa Tlass, Hafez al-Assads minister of defence, made his contribution with The Matzo of Zion, and last year the Israeli-Palestinian Islamist Raed Salah, once invited to parliament by Jeremy Corbyn as an honoured citizen, declared that Jews used blood for the dough of their bread.\\nIn the 19th century virtual vampirism was added to the antisemitic canon. And the left made its contribution to this refreshment of old poison. Demonstrating that you do not have to be gentile to be an anti-Semite, Karl Marx characterised Judaism as nothing more than the cult of Mammon, and declared that the world needed emancipating from the Jews. Others on the left  the social philosophers Bruno Bauer, Charles Fourier and Pierre Prudhon and the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin  echoed the message: blood sucking, whether the physical or the economic kind, was what Jews did.\\nFor the Jews, the modern world turned out to be a lose-lose proposition. Once reviled for obstinate traditionalism; their insistence on keeping walled off from the rest (notwithstanding that it had been Christians who had done the walling) they were now attacked for integrating too well, speaking, dressing and working no differently but always with the aim of global domination.\\nWhat was a Jew to do? The communist Moses Hess, who had been Marxs editor and friend, became persuaded, all too presciently, that the socialist revolution would do nothing to normalise Jewish existence, not least because so many socialists declared that emancipating the Jews had been a terrible mistake. Hess concluded that only self-determination could protect the Jews from the phobias of right and left alike. He became the first socialist Zionist.\\nBut that was to inflict an entirely colonial and alien enterprise upon a Palestinian population, so the hostile narrative goes, who were penalised for the sins of Europe. That the Palestinians did become tragic casualties of a Judeo-Arab civil war over the country is indisputable, just as the 700,000 Jews who were violently uprooted from their homes in the Islamic world is equally undeniable. But to characterise the country in which the language, the religion and the cultural identity of the Jews was formed as purely a colonial anomaly is the product of the kind of historical innocence which is oblivious of, say, Jewish kabbalistic communities in Galilee in the 16th century or the substantial native Jewish majority in Jerusalem in the late 19th century.\\nNone of this unbroken history of Jews and Judaism in Palestine is likely to do much to cool the heat of the anti-colonial narrative of the alien intruder, especially on the left. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the retreat of Marxist socialism around the world, militant energies have needed somewhere to go.\\nThe battle against inequalities under liberal capitalism has mobilised some of that passion, but postcolonial guilt has fired up the war against its prize whipping boy, Zionism, like no other cause. Every such crusade needs a villain along with its banners and I wonder who that could possibly be?","title":"The lefts problem with Jews has a long and miserable history"},{"text":"I have mixed feelings about TikTok itself, but I don't think the legal reasoning by the appeals court (or at least what is publicly available) is strong enough to justify the US Government being able to in a very public matter block a widely used mainstream website, especially when the security concerns weren't strong enough to stop the majority of politicians from actively using it during their 2024 campaigns.  If this leads to ISPs actively blocking the platform (even if the block is trivial to bypass with a bit of knowledge) whatever mechanism is being used to in a very well known way block the platform will likely be attempted to be used to justify other websites, especially in red states (as there were already murmurs last year about targeting websites hosted overseas with information on abortion for example).","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 7, 2024"},{"text":"As a bLaCk w0mAn!![gif](giphy|l3q2uvcxdk1pDLzGM|downsized)","title":"Boston Democrat Tania Fernandes Anderson ARRESTED"},{"text":"Several unions refused to back Harris.

If enough wealthy people put money towards convincing the average person they really need to drink lead, and people in their free will choose to drink lead, you cant say \\"well the public seems happy about it\\". The fact that we are so hung up over this guy's death while his company has killed so many people without any news coverage is part of this propaganda. American people are constantly told that private healthcare causes less suffering and death than public healthcare, so they're obviously going to support private healthcare.Do you think the average american would support private healthcare if every single person who had their claim unjustly denied and had their life ended or ruined became a multiple day long news issue? Why do they not cover those deaths?Yes the fact that the laws themselves enables these outcomes is the bigger issue here, however, just because \\"law doesnt forbid it\\", does not make actions justified.

If you can, I would like to hear why this isnt murder.Just because you exist in a broken system where you are allowed to cause untold death and suffering for profit, does not make you not responsible for the death and suffering you cause. The \\"system\\" is causing suffering, yes, and he is part of the system, and he has made decisions that directly lead to death where had he made different decisions there would not be as much death.The system needs to change and no one should be in a position where they can make the decision to cause such death and suffering. As long as the current system is in place, anyone with the ability to make that decision has the moral responsibility to not cause such death and suffering.For example if I had the power to snap my fingers and randomly give 80% of the population debilitating pain, I should not have that power, as long as I have that power it is my moral responsibility to not use that power.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"Yeah, I didn't vote for Trump and my daughter doesn't deserve the consequences.","title":"Dems Sound The Alarm On GOP Talk Of Cuts To Federal Safety Net Programs"},{"text":"I'm a self employed non-BIPOC DINK that is happy with their health insurance.

Healthcare in America works this way because society allows it. Many Americans dont support universal healthcare or major reforms, and public sentiment has shaped the laws and policies that CEOs operate within. Blaming one individual ignores that these rules reflect collective decisions, or at least collective inaction.Calling the CEO a mass murderer represents profound ethical confusion and is frankly absurd. Healthcares flaws are the result of years of societal choices, not the malicious intent of one person. Denying care is a symptom of the systems design, and that design reflects the priorities of the society that built it. While CEOs face scrutiny and penalties when they break the law, the bigger issue is that the laws themselves enable these outcomes. Targeting individuals distracts from the collective responsibility we share for allowing these problems to persist.Widespread change requires a shift in public consensus, not simply vilifying individuals within the system. Blaming and excoriating this one man is proving so satisfying to the public because its a convenient way of displacing the guilt and shame we should all feel, and that many of us do.

Something like 70 30 (nyt, pay processing respectively) is probably acceptable, but pay processor can't do $0.03 per transaction. )OK,  my thoughts are:/1  if such a service doesn't exist, somebody should get on it./2 it's distinctly possible that microtransaction stuff is low prestige, making the customer base less attractive.   There's arguably arguments here for NYT.  /3 enabling micro transactions might cut into subscriptions.   There are likely a swathe of customers who would go a la carte if it was available.  But they pay subscriptions instead.  $1 a month  $0.30 for three articles they might pony up for./4 because 2 &amp; 3, I don't think NYT is the likely candidate for pioneering a micro transaction disruption.

If I believed that a civilian did this in the first place. I have no doubt in my mind that the shooter had military training. I managed to watch the video of the shooting in its entirety, and the way he handles the gun when it jams and even seems to have all of his adrenaline in check, suggests to me that this isn't his first hit. You add to that, the clearly methodical planning and the fact that he knew the schedule of someone who was visiting New York. Probably the most damning thing is those words written on the bullet. They're clearly not meant to be read by the victim and are ambiguous enough that w/o capturing this shooter, we'll never truly know what the intent is. I find it plausible that a bombshell was gonna drop at this investor's conference. United healthcare Group was under a DOJ investigation. It's plausible that Brian Thompson was cooperating with authorities thereby reducing his own potential indictment chances and screwing over others at his level. So the bullet casings could very well have a message from his own conspirators. Specifically, the deny part. As far as manhunts go, they don't usually go on this long in a technology driven world like today. It's actually incredible how much footage and images we have of this alleged shooter and still no one in custody. That would suggest to me some level of interference by opposing forces with the money to do so. One of the first responses by several insurance companies was to remove the faces of their executives from public visibility. While it's easy to argue, \\"oh, they're afraid for their lives and want privacy,\\" I see it as another nail in the coffin for transparency from our insuring companies. It's actually quite convenient for them to have this level of privacy in the context of atrocious things they do behind closed doors. It really just depends on who did this. If a civilian did this- they did it incredibly well. But life goes on. Unless insurance companies decide to triple down on inhumane practices, the masses will just keep hustling. If they did it to their own CEO...nothing is ever gonna change, unless the truth comes out.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"Is his opinion still relevant?","title":"Obama, in 1st remarks since election, says 'a line has been crossed' if 'one side' makes certain moves"},{"text":"Enjoy worshiping your Billionaire Oligarchs while demeaning the average citizen like yourself.

He 100% believed he was doing the right thing to protect children. Should we celebrate him?What about someone who kills ______ people because they believe they are all just pedophiles. Are they justified?Because in all three cases the person acted on their beliefs and took matters into their own hands because they felt the system wasnt working to solve a problem.

Revolutions historically dont fix systems; they break them further. They often replace one flawed structure with another, and the chaos they bring almost always hurts ordinary people the most. The idea that violence or upheaval will lead to meaningful accountability is wishful thinkingit usually entrenches power structures and makes reform even harder.You also suggest that change is impossible within the current system, but I dont think thats true. Look at major social movements like civil rights or labor reformsthey made real progress without burning everything down. Change is slow, yes, but history shows it happens when people organize, persist, and push for reform through political mechanisms.And as for lobbying, its not inherently evil. Lobbying gives nonprofits, unions, and grassroots organizations a way to advocate for their causes, just like corporations do. The problem isnt lobbying itself but the lack of transparency and how money distorts its influence. Fixing those issues through reformlike tighter campaign finance lawsmakes more sense than throwing out the whole system or calling for revolution. Change isnt easy, but revolution would almost certainly make things worse, not better.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"Vast majority of that southern offensive is by local uprisings and military defections, with the SFA playing a fairly a limited coordinating role.

The fact that malicious actions are taken in service of a system of malicious actions does not absolve one of moral culpability.My point is that the health insurance industry does not make malicious actions. It provides a life saving service. Everybody needs healthcare. Everybody needs different amounts of healthcare. Quality healthcare is expensive since it requires multiple people to train for many years of their lives to perform. Health insurance is what allows otherwise less fortunate individuals from accessing that system by collectivizing risk. If people cared before they got sick they could choose not to buy insurance from a company that denies claims at a high rate. People could advocate to their employer to switch providers. Hospitals could decline to accept insurance from providers that they find to be skeevy. But nobody cares until it is too late. Put it another way: what kind of car do you drive? Is it a 2021 Alfa Romeo Giulia the safest car in the world? Or something cheaper?What material is your home made out of? Is it fire retardant poured concrete? Or something cheaper? People pay for cheap health insurance and then are surprised when they get bad coverage. People work at employers that provide cheap health insurance and don't factor it in, until they need it and realize it sucks ass. United Health Insurance isn't exactly hiding that they have shit deductibles, annoying networks, and bad out of pocket maximums. People just don't care until it is too late. That's why health insurance as an industry needs to die and a single payer model needs to take over since people are really fucking bad at evaluating risk sometime in the future.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"US ??

Killing someone, no matter how much they may represent systemic injustice in your view, is not justiceits an act of violence that undermines the very principles of fairness and accountability you claim to care about. Theres no evidence that such actions lead to meaningful change. If anything, they strengthen power structures by justifying increased security and harsher measures against dissent, while discrediting legitimate efforts for reform.You suggest that the suffering of this mans family is a minor cost compared to the potential benefits of sending a message. But this framing is problematic. A wife has lost her husband, and children have lost their father. These are real, innocent people whose pain cant be brushed aside for an abstract goal. If we want to address systemic injustices, we cant disregard the humanity of those involvedeven those we might see as part of the problem.The idea that violence will scare the powerful into rolling back harmful practices is also highly speculative. History suggests that violence rarely leads to reform; it often creates backlash, defensiveness, and further entrenchment of the status quo. Real change is achieved through sustained advocacy, legal reform, and collective actionnot isolated acts of violence.Dismissing these avenues as naive ignores the fact that every major social movement, from civil rights to labor reform, succeeded through persistence and moral clarity, not through acts of vengeance. Violence as a strategy often derails these efforts, shifting the focus away from the issues and toward the act itself, making it harder to achieve the systemic changes we need.You call this killing a symbol, but what does it symbolize? Not justice, but fear, retribution, and disregard for due process. If we normalize such acts, we risk creating a society where anyone who feels wronged takes justice into their own hands, with unpredictable and often destructive consequences.We all recognize that systemic injustices exist and that they harm countless people. But responding to those injustices with violence doesnt fix the problemit adds to it. If we abandon ethical principles in our pursuit of change, we risk losing the very moral foundation needed to build a better society. Real justice isnt achieved by creating new victimsits achieved through empathy, accountability, and a commitment to principled action.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"And in all this time you have never heard anyone rebutting your point?

Executives are there to maximize the value to the shareholders (which if you have a 401k, that includes you)As long as a CEO is running this company in a manner which makes the shareholders happy (usually by looking out for the company's long term profitability,  but that isn't always the case) and who isn't defrauding the consumer, that is a perfectly ethical CEO. If people know what they're buying, they should be free to buy it, or not buy it. That works plenty well in a multitude of markets, but it does get kind of fucked in the health industry. For starters, if I am a healthy 20 something, I could gamble on my health by not paying for health insurance and just hoping to stay healthy while I keep more of my money. This is a bad incentive. We don't want people gambling on their health. That's why something like Medicare for All is better. Secondly, healthcare is complicated, and people usually don't care enough to understand a problem until they face it so they are unlikely to be rational discerning shoppers. Which again, is why something like Medicare for All is better. UHC provides a good product in the sense that it is extremely affordable compared to the cost of healthcare. Employers buy it for their employees so they can say they are providing health insurance. And employees don't usually care enough to check how lackluster their policy is until they have an emergency and get stuck with a giant bill, or even worse opt not for necessary treatment when their claim is denied. Shooting executives does not help. The only thing that would is policy change, like Medicare for All.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/w4cf4ess0f5e1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3326827552c4e65ea36d945092c89a0a6502e197I want to highlight the significance of the rebel advance in the countryside to the east.

While also believing the party line of progressive policies are only supported by the fringe left, who arent a large enough voter block to bother campaigning towards Most party Dems, because of their leaders rhetoric, simultaneously believe the left is insanely small and insignificant to bother campaigning towards but also theyre so big theyre the reason weve lost every recent election which weve lost. Sanders brought in far more Independents than other dem primary candidates, and he also brought in an unusually large number of Rs for a dem. When he lost, he still had a historically low voter crossover to voting Republican in the general, far less than the amount of Hillary voters who went on to McCain, and they went after him for being divisive and having his voters stay home.Dems have the same polling we do, and they know progressive policies are popular. They know universal healthcare is supported by 60ish percent of Americans. Theyre just bankrolled by the exact same industries the republicans are, and would rather lose to Trump than cut off their money train. They do not care, whatsoever, about enacting meaningful changes to the lives of working class people. The only time they ever ever ever mention progressive politics is when they actually hold a primary election, because they understand how popular those positions are and need to pretend to support them to secure the primary. Then they just drop them the second the general starts and begin doing everything they can to match the republicans, and the majority of voters fully do no care because its just team sports to them. Kamala campaigned on having the worlds most lethal military, allowing herself to be outflanked by Trump from the left with his fake peace and end all wars rhetoric. Kamala campaigning on expanding Trumps wall to the applause of most Dems around here. The most economically progressive thing she had to campaign on was a means tested small business loan. She outspent Trump by massive margins while campaigning towards non existent sane republicans who are disenfranchised by trump.

(Ie the anthem Anastasia time limit backtracking)You have fallen for misinformation on the anesthesia story. It was not a time limit. Insurance companies were not going to stop the flow of anesthesia halfway through surgeries and let you writhe in pain, nor would they thrust the remainder of the costs directly onto the patient. They were simply requiring anesthesiologists, the highest paid people in America, to go through a more rigorous application progress to apply for overtime when billing for their services. Most services are done on a per-service basis, not a per-minute basis, Medicare already has this same policy, this would just be expanding the policy to private insurers dealing with anesthesiologists in order to crack down on anesthesiologists exaggerating the time they worked in order to rip off the insurance companies (and thus the patients).Murder being bad isnt really a good enough excuse for complacency of those with so much power who cause so much hurtto be clear, was this murder bad, yes or no?To those who will argue he didnt break any laws I know, that isnt the point though.

Businesses exist to earn a profit. A CEO, like all executives try to work to increase profit. As long as those executives aren't committing fraud, or otherwise cheating the system, they aren't really the cause of the problem. The US's problem is employer provided private health insurance. A rational consumer shopping for health insurance could compare offerings from various health insurance providers, and could switch to buying from someone else when a provider starts to be especially shitty. The problem is that your employer doesn't have the same interests as you, they don't care if they are paying for shitty service as long as it is inexpensive. The incentives are vaguely in the same direction, but critically they are not fully aligned. This allows insurance companies to provide quite inexpensive policies, but those policies barely cover shit. This isn't some rogue CEO exploiting the process by skirting regulation before it can be put in place. This is the modus operendi of the health insurance industry and has been so for decades. We could have always fixed this problem before it got this bullshit if people bothered to care before they needed coverage. The fact is that since we live in a democracy, the electorate is at fault for being too lazy to get educated on an issue before it impacts them.All this to say, I'm not saying the executives are blameless in the insurance industry, but the actual issue is that we don't have a single payer system, or at least a public option, or at the bare minimum non-employer provided health insurance, all of which can be created with regulation. The reaction to this shooting has just been \\"eat the rich\\" nonsense. We don't need vigilantes gunning down executives on the streets. We need an educated electorate that votes in rational, effective bureaucrats into office that can pass good legislation to prevent these markets from becoming exploitative.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"I suppose I would say its down to what you value: 1:A complacent downfall into loss and death by watching the rules and laws erode in extremely slow motion.

In both cases I see little difference in quality of life, I mean, realistically were fucked either way. There isnt some magical way to unfuck a lot of these things because of how the lobbying and bribing that goes on.

I remember a CGP Grey video which drives this point home. He talked about jury nullification. Basically the practice where a jury knows that a defendant is guilty but chooses to vote not guilty because they believe the defendant did the right thing. The problem is that 'the right thing' isn't a universal. A man is acquitted despite putting to bullets in his child's rapist? Hooray jury nullification works. A man is acquitted in the racist south after lynching a black man for being too lippy? Boo jury nullification sucksIt's the same with extrajudicial killings. It's all fun and games till our 'heroes' start killing the wrong 'evils'. Here's a fun one. Do you think there are any crazy people out there who've drank the koolaid that LGBT people are all child molesters and starts blasting. What about the dipshit who shot at FEMA agents who were trying to get him and others aid because 'government bad.' Vigilantes don't sound nearly as fun anymore do they?Murder being bad isnt really a good enough excuse for complacency of those with so much power who cause so much hurt. Do I believe all at such a level deserve this? Absolutely not, but there is a sort of karmic justice in that, an untouchable gambling away what is no different than blood money, was snuffed out like anyone else.The words of every mistaken idealist. I'm gonna say this in a rough way to get the point across. Nobody gives a fuck what you or I think.That guy didn't ask our opinion when he murdered that CEO. Why do you think the next one will honour our meaningless lines? The vigilante train doesn't stop where we find it acceptable. Which is why we prevent the fucker from ever lifting off in the first place. I personally don't care for one dead CEO, but I will stand against it merely because the precedent it sets is disastrous if allowed to become the norm. We are not in a comic book.

Also could be problems in the mid-terms, because Trump's power to endorse regular GOP candidates wasn't even that strong this year when he was on the ticket, and he won't be on the ticket in 2026.","title":"Shocking: Kamala Harris \\"Won\\" Votes Counted After Election Day by 20 Points"},{"text":"I don't care what Democrats think, we're the majority.","title":"Even 68% of Democrats agree there should be case-by-case J6 pardons??"},{"text":"A random village [Al-Qaryatayn](https://x.com/AlArabiya_Brk/status/1865323376866185528) east of Homs has been taken over.

If Hunter Biden had been treated as any other person and Joe Biden had pardoned him because he's his son, then there would be cause for this furore. However, Hunter was treated extremely harshly compared with others who had done the same because of who he was. Justice was not blind in his case. The presidential pardon is used to fix circumstances where people are treated unfairly and this is obviously an instance, which is entirely different from Trump pardoning Stone, Flynn and Bannon. Obviously Hunter Biden's case meant a lot to Joe Biden and he was in the fortunate position where Joe knew about it and was motivated to do something about it, but that bias doesn't matter because the power was used in line with the norms. He shouldn't not pardon Hunter because it's also in his self-interest. If you help an old lady with her heavy bag, it doesn't make it less right to do it because she's your grandmother. Maybe if Hunter had been treated like other criminals and had still faced consequences, Joe Biden might have said \\"Fuck it, power is being abused in worse ways by Republicans, I'll sacrifice a small part of the high ground for my family.\\" That would have been wrong. Understandable, but wrong. But, we'll never know.

A great example is that most public schools and daycare centers require that your child be up-to-date on their vaccinations to attend. Hospitals, doctors offices and nursing homes may require that their employees be vaccinated to work there.      \\nVaccine mandates at places like these were already a thing long before Covid, with requirements varying by state and business. The Federal mandate during Covid only applied to Federal employees, agencies &amp; contractors, eventually only applying to Federal healthcare workers due to lawsuits.\\nAll other mandates were decided by states, cities and individual businesses, with regulations ranging widely depending on where you worked and lived.      \\nBut every business and establishment had (has) the right to insist that their employees or customers be vaccinated, and not just from Covid - you either follow your employer/schools guidelines or you don't get to work/attend.Everyone was SUPPOSED TO have the right to be exempt if they had a reason to abstain due to religion, medical conditions, and even cultural, ethical and philosophical reasons, depending on where you live.      \\nUnfortunately this right, which is protected by law, was regularly steamrolled by employers, schools, etc. who refused to accept exemptions because they were ignorant of this clause. Doctors even refused to write medical exemptions for people who had health issues that obviously would be put at risk by the Covid vaccine, perhaps due to pressure from agencies and perhaps because they thought that people seeking exemptions were only doing so due to the massive amount of disinformation spreading at the time.","title":"On Joe Rogan : The House released a 500 page report on the Pandemic.

The Republican party had literally just recently been created for the purpose of pushing Abolition because the whigs wanted to downplay abolition and focus on industrialization. The \\"Moderate\\" goal of Lincoln was to ban Slavery in all new states. That means that eventually republicans would have a overwhelming majority in congress with more and more non-slave states and be able to pass a constitutional amendment banning it nation wide in the future with little resistance. This is why Lincoln downplayed any immediate attempts to do so, because the goal was suppose to be more of a long play. You see this with republicans now, telling politicians not to overstep by pushing Federal bans, but focus on state bans instead.That is a far, far cry from saying we should have a moderate stance in general, I.E. Abortion should be allowed on some level in all states or we should be tolerant of abortion. Lincoln and the Republicans were moderate in strategy, not ideology and long term goals. In the end the goal was always the abolishment of slavery.

I had the privilege of living in Sweden for a bit for some schooling and let me tell you, even my milquetoast Dem Iowan family were cracking jokes about how much better their healthcare system is. Just an anecdote, I know, but I think a lot of people know Americans are getting the raw end of a deal.Democrats should campaign on it, they just need to campaign all season.

Trump and the people he's nominated have made absolutely clear, through repeated and unambiguous statements, that they plan to go after their perceived enemies. It really doesn't matter if there's anything to the charges, the people they go after will get bankrupted by legal bills. I mean, they went after Joe Biden as being \\"corrupt\\" for a couple years of congressional investigations, turning over every rock, and found absolutely nothing. It was the usual totalitarian BS where the conclusion comes first and the investigation comes after. In this case, Biden didn't have to pay the defense bills because he was president, but once he is out, he's probably on the hook for it. Same with pretty much anyone in his administration, anyone who ever spoke out against him, and probably the 41 out of 44 of his cabinet members who wouldn't support him and said that he was a threat to America. Trump, in his usual mode of always claiming victimhood, always claimed that the Dems had \\"weaponized\\" the DOJ but could never actually prove it. This was cover for him to ACTUALLY weaponize the DOJ to go against anyone who has ever opposed him. Again, he's made no bones that he plans to do this. Much like with Putin, every accusation against his enemies is actually an admission of what he's doing or plans to do. So, should Biden pardon the most likely people that Trump will go after? Or should he rely upon the decency of the American people to rise up and shut that down, a la McCarthyism? The latter would obviously be better for democracy, but a significant portion of America has shown that they now think decency to be an outmoded concept, one for losers and suckers.","title":"Biden considers preemptive pardons for officials and allies who fear retribution from Trump"},{"text":"But Paul Pelosi's hammer attack was super hilarious.

Virus particles are more easily transmitted when mucus from the nose and mouth becomes airborne, typically from a sneeze or cough.     \\nThis is why we are taught from a young age to cover our nose and mouth whenever we sneeze and cough, to prevent spraying our infected bodily fluids out as a fine mist or onto surfaces and making other people sick. Wearing a mask to help prevent the transmission of a respiratory illness isn't a new concept. People were encouraged, and in some places forced, to mask up during the [Spanish Flu of 1918](https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2020/04/15/wear-a-mask-and-save-your-life-the-1918-flu-pandemic/).    \\nAround the same time it became standard practice for doctors and nurses to wear face coverings during surgery and while working with patients who had diseases that were transmissible. Germ theory helped the medical community learn about ways to prevent the spread of infectious illnesses. Even before doctors understood germs and how diseases were spread they wore masks. During [the Black Plague](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7309199/) physicians wore beak-like plague masks packed with herbs thought to be antiseptic because they believed that 'bad air' would make them sick.      \\nIn several Asian countries mask wearing has been normalized in urban areas for a long time, considered common courtesy. Citizens wear masks when out in public whether they are sick or not because it both helps prevent them from inhaling viral particles and catches their own mucus. Masks were promoted during the Covid pandemic because we actually have a great deal of proof spanning at least a century that covering your mouth and nose when sick with a respiratory disease helps prevent transmission.      \\nIt's just basic common sense that children can comprehend and something that has been practiced for centuries. People during the Middle Ages were able to grasp the concept of 'bad air'... It's extremely unfortunate that we are living in an age where misinformation is so prevalent that people refuse to understand that something as simple as preventing mucus from spraying out of their face is a practical and proven protocol for slowing the spread of infectious diseases.     \\nWash your hands too folks!!!","title":"On Joe Rogan : The House released a 500 page report on the Pandemic.

It was only used when some sheriff wanted to teach them long-haired commie queers a lesson by putting them in jail with some big homophobic rednecks and let the cells know what they were in for. This is very much like the Ruby Ridge sawed off shotgun charge that kicked off the events that lead to the massacre. I hate people like Randy Weaver - the guy was a Nazi and a criminal who deserved jail. But virtually framing him with the weapons charge was some keystone cops level of bullshit that got his dog, son, and wife killed, along with a deputy marshal. Randy beat the murder charge and won $3.1M in a settlement against the government. It, along with Waco, were cited as the motivating incidents by Timothy McVeigh. Anyway, theres an estimated 50-60M Americans who used cannabis in 2023, with 35M self reporting as using monthly. Theres a similar number (60M past year, 37M in past 30 days) for illicit drug users. Obviously theres considerable overlap from populations in prohibition states, but even so, thats a pretty significant slice of the US population. About 1/3 of American adults say they own a firearm, including 45% of republicans and close to 50% of the rural population. Feel free to make some guesstimates about things like drug use in rural communities, percentage of people who have a drug or felony conviction, etc. that will give you an estimate of how many millions of people did what Hunter did.

Thats less than a single three class (low capacity) 747.So despite this rarity of filed referrals and even greater rarity of filed charges, Hunter Biden was charged with and convicted on three felony charges for the same checkbox on the same form: making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm, making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a federally licensed firearms dealer, and possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substanceThe guy was railroaded, whether you think he was a nepo baby or not. It was flatly ridiculous. It absolutely does not need to be justified by saying Biden was protecting his some like any father would do, or that it was justified because Trump pardoned Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Charles Kushner, Steve Bannon, George Papadopoulos, Albert Pirro, Rod Blagojevich, Lil Wayne, Kodak Black, Clint Lorance, Edward Gallagher, Joe Arpaio, Dinesh D'Souza, Michael Milken, and other co-conspirators, supporters, or people with a couple million dollars to make sure Trump saw their email.

First, Vovchansk began to suffer what every other Ukrainian frontline settlement has endured C total destruction.  Using S-300 missiles (these are air defence weapons lobbed in ballistic trajectories that cannot be intercepted), 500kg glide bombs, 220mm thermobaric rockets launched from TOS-1A Solntsepok, and 240mm mortars lobbed from 2S4 Tulpan, the Russians began to methodically destroy Vovchansk, focusing first on the industrial area.  Accuracy and timeliness of targeting was poor (and a hazard to Russian civilians; Russian media sources report as many as 93 bombs have fallen off the pylons of aircraft, the most deadly the bomb that hit an apartment block in Belgorod City).Next the Russians began to target bridges in an effort to complicate Ukrainian logistics and isolate the town.  The major bridges at Zybine and Stariy Saltiv further south were hit, the latter by a Kh-38 missile.  Several minor bridges in the town and outskirts were also attacked. On 28 May, Su-34 dropped three glide bombs on the major east-west bridge in Vovchansk.  However, Ukrainian engineers somewhat mitigated these attacks by speedily erecting pontoon bridges or using German-supplied bridge layers.The Russians did not have it all their own way.  Emboldened by the arrival of desperately needed munitions and partial suspension of the prohibition on using NATO weapons against targets in Russia, the Ukrainians mounted a clever and effective campaign against depth targets in Belgorod.Over a period of a month, as many as 300 HIMARS rockets were reportedly launched, especially targeting Russian S-300 and S-400 air defence systems and radars.  This had two important effects.  First, the daily rocket attacks on Kharkiv City abated.  Second, safe corridors were created for Ukrainian strike aircraft (launching JDAMs) and helicopters to mount raids on Russian positions.  In a first, Ukrainian Su-29s mounted a cross-border raid hitting a command post and ammunition storage site near Belgorod.# Poor Russian morale and obsolete equipmentWestern Military District-ZVO (today the Leningrad and Moscow Military Districts) has consistently been the worst performing and least motivated in the war. Putins foolish special military operation has relied on cannon fodder from poor Siberian and Far Eastern communities, as well as minorities such as the Buryats. This has been evident again in the fighting in Kharkiv.A surprising number of Russians have chosen surrender despite being only five kilometres from the border.  In one incident, as many 30 were reported captured, the largest haul at the time.  In another, a Russian abandoned by comrades hid for three weeks then surrendered as Ukrainian troops re-took lost positions.The meat attacks have lowered morale. Out of a hundred people, 12 are left, complained  contract soldier Anton Andreev from 5th company, 1009th regiment in a recorded video. Soldiers from 153rd Tank Regiment (47th Tank Division) have refused orders. Terekhov Vadim, a contract soldier serving in a Storm V unit in 128th Assault Brigade, told how his commanders ordered him to commit suicide with a grenade if captured. Why should I let myself die? he queried.   In another video, a Russian PoW dressed in mixed clothing complained of lack of provision and told his captors: This is what we find in the houses, thats what we wear.To stem desertions, a Chechen Akhmat battalion was deployed to act as barrier troops (i.e. threaten soldiers attempting to run away). On 3 June, Russian opposition outlet Verstka reported Russian military authorities had suspended trials of refuseniks and were simply sending hundreds of objecting Russian soldiers to the front. Head of the State Duma Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin recently revealed as many as 10,000 migrants had been forcibly rounded up and sent to Ukraine. Duped Africans have been conscripted in a so-called Africa Corps. The Russian Army is desperate. Borrowing Solzhenitsyns phrase, it has become our sewage disposal system.ZVO was traditionally the premier district receiving the latest and best kit.  Yet in one attack west of Vovchansk, Ukrainian drone pilots destroyed or immobilised T-62Ms, BMP-1s and 2S1s.  These are all vehicles dating to the 1960s.  For a British reader, it would be as if the Army were still fielding Centurion tanks, the Saracen APC, and Abbot self-propelled guns.# The battle for the Aggregate PlantBy July the fighting focused on the Aggregate Plant north of the Vovcha River. On the Russian side, this took on the aspect of a pathological obsession. The cost of this fixation has been hundreds of lives. High losses forced the Russians to withdraw units.Reinforcements were then fed into the battle from multiple formations.However, Russian forces continued to suffer heavy losses all through the summer. According to one Russian milblogger, forces attacking in Vovchansk had already suffered a third of the casualties that Russian forces suffered in their four-month campaign to seize Avdiivka. This resulted in the withdrawal of some of the reinforcing units, including 83rd VDV, defeated by 116th Separate Mechanised Brigade (that boasts an eminently sensible motto: Live to Win). Separately, the commander of 83rd VDV, Colonel Artyom Gorodilov, was arrested on fraud charges. There was speculation this may have been punishment for the poor performance of the paratroopers.   Eventually, on 24 September, following a carefully orchestrated operation, the commander of GUR unit Timur confirmed the capture of the Aggregate Plant. Multiple special force groups, in fact, had been involved: Stugna, Paragon, Yunger, RDK, BDK, and Terror.  Around two dozen prisoners were captured and several dozen Russian dead were found on the site.  The 10 October was the first day since the incursion that no fighting at all was reported in Vovchansk.# Concluding thoughtsThe incursion into Kharkiv has once again displayed the blundering incompetence of the Russian Army. A town that was meant to be captured in two days, five kilometres from the international border, has still not been captured five months later. An offensive was launched on an anniversary date, to please Putin, with poorly motivated and ill-prepared troops. Intelligence was woeful: the Russians had no real idea of Ukrainian dispositions and simply advanced to contact.  Incapable of all arms operations or even effective coordination above company level due to the lack of a working tactical radio system, the advances were checked, albeit by a chaotic and scrambled Ukrainian response.Faced with resistance the Russians resorted to meat attacks.  A captured doctrine manual shows the Russian high command expects company storm detachments to last no more than two days before they are destroyed and need to be replaced. The corpses, as countless YouTube videos testify, are left in the fields for days, or not recovered at all. In a videoposted by a Russian soldier, as many as 18 blackened corpses in advanced stages of decomposition could be seen: How will they be identified now? he lamented.  In the usual way, civilians have been shot, Ukrainian prisoners abused, and homes looted (all incidents captured on video).  Frustrated Russian soldiers have shot at each other, recorded by a Ukrainian drone operator.  Others have committed suicide (the 32ndYouTube video this author has viewed of a Russian soldier shooting himself; a youngish man who blew his brains out).Putin and the robotic Gerasimov see none of this. Neither has been anywhere near a frontline trench. Putin C the bunker grandpa C resides in the luxurious, Soviet-era presidential complex at Novo-Ogaryevo, with its indoor, Olympic-sized swimming pool. Gerasimov retires to a government luxury apartment. (If the assassinated Prighozin could read these words now he would be cheering the author loudly). Hundreds of kilometres from an avoided reality, they grasp a single, bankrupt strategy:  destruction of lives, Russian and Ukrainian; destruction of towns and villages; and destruction of Ukraines countryside. A resident in occupied Kherson City perfectly expressed the mentality of the brainless Russian Army and captured the universal psychology of an oppressive totalitarian state: It is like sexual intercourse with an impotent person, she wrote, who has to endlessly repeat that he is strong.!ping Ukraine","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Actually written by an adult woman.

Summary:# The Volchansk-Lyptsi offensive operation is launchedThe day after the 9 May Victory Day parade, the Russian Army launched an offensive across the Belgorod-Kharkiv border.  The attack had been signalled for weeks. Even so, it came as a surprise. According to captured plans shared with The Economist (May 25th C Under Russian Guns), the intent was to encircle Kharkiv and bring the city under artillery range C Putins long-threatened buffer zone. H-hour was intended for 15-16 May but brought forward to coincide with Victory Day. However, within one week, the assaults stalled.Around 32,000 soldiers were deployed in Belgorod Oblast for the offensive on Kharkiv but only around half were used (likely due to insufficient equipment). The commander of the so-called Northern Group of Forces was the luckless but loyal Colonel-General Alexander Lapin who has been in and out of favour in the war. Most recently he has been appointed commander of the new Leningrad Military District. Major formations under his command on this front include 11th Army Corps (Kaliningrad), 44th Army Corps (Leningrad), 6th Combined Arms Army (Leningrad) and 1st Guards Tank Army (Moscow).Captured Russian soldiers revealed that units involved in the initial wave included 128th Storm V Assault Brigade, 138th Motor Rifle Brigade and 25th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade. They had the task of capturing Vovchansk in two days. Ukrainian sources also reported limited elements from 1st Motor Rifle Regiment (2nd Motor Rifle Division, 1st Guards Tank Army).[...]The offensive was launched at 3am with heavy artillery and rocket barrages and glide bombs.  A massive EW attack suppressed all Starlink terminals, most GPS receivers, and most Motorola radios C the primary tactical radio system in the Ukrainian Army.  The vanguards were supported by a large number of FPV drones. Advancing units displayed a new tactical symbol: rhombuses with two crosswise stripes. It was believed this referenced Odins spear (the Gungir rune).Two salients were developed 35 kilometres apart and separated by a major water feature (the Siverskyi Donets River). The western axis was pointed at the small town of Lyptsi and the eastern axis at Vovchansk.  By the night of 10 May, it was reported Russian troops had taken control of the border villages of Streleche, Krasnoye, Borisovka and Pylnaya,advancing with four to five infantry battalions. The eastern salient appeared to develop one day late. Ohirtseve, Hatyshche, and Pletenivka (north and north-west of Vovchansk) were not reported under attack until 11 May.  On 12 May, Russian troops were on the outskirts of Vovchansk having driven down the T210B minor road from the border just five kilometres away.  Vovchansk is a large town with a pre-war population of 17,000 people.  Crucially, it sits astride the Vovcha River, a feature that would play an important role in the ensuing battle.[...]# The Ukrainian reaction C confusion and controversyThe immediate Ukrainian reaction to the Russian offensive was confused and controversial. The story is worth telling because it illustrates challenges that continue to test the Ukrainian war effort.At the turn of the year, command of the Kharkiv OTU was vested in a General Hrytskov, an officer of poor reputation and reported drink problem.  With growing evidence of a Russian build-up he was replaced by General Yulii Galushkin on 24 April.  However, Galushkin was an old-style, managerial senior officer with no combat experience.  Two days after the launch of the offensive he, in turn, was replaced by General Mykhailo Drapaty.  Thus, in the space of seven weeks, there were three changes of command in a sector the Ukrainian high command knew was about to be attacked in a major new Russian offensive.The deployment of forces to this sector was similarly inadequate.  The single 125th Lviv Territorial Defence Brigade was deployed to the border area. However, only the command element deployed (all 28 officers have been subject to dereliction of duty charges, whether fairly or not).  The brigades two organic battalions did not deploy. Instead, the brigade was allocated two battalions it had never worked with (415th Separate Rifle Battalion from 23rd Mechanised Brigade, and 172nd Battalion from 120th Vinnytsia Territorial Defence Brigade), and one drone company.  This grouping was allocated a 45 kilometre frontage to defend.Support was completely insufficient. All the brigades support weapons (mortars, grenade launchers etc) were bought, not issued, by the efforts of the Lviv City Council and the Return Alive fund.  The formation deployed with no artillery or tanks (albeit three guns and two tanks were allocated on the eve of the Russian offensive). The brigade was supplied just 1,700 anti-personnel mines C to cover 45 kilometres C and a larger number of anti-tank mines.  Fortifications in the first 3-5 kilometre belt from the border were few, but the Kharkiv City administration has explained it was very difficult to construct obstacles in this area due to Russian targeting (the main defensive lines are at 12-23 kilometres and 20 kilometres from the international border).On 28 April, the brigade was informed of the likely Russian offensive and began to make preparations for the defence of its sector.  On 4 May, less than a week before the offensive, the Commander of OSU Khortytsia, Lieutenant General Yuriy Sodol, and Commander of the Kharkiv OTU, General Galushkin visited the brigade (Sodol was Galushkins commander; on 24 June he was sacked, lasting only four months in post, and was replaced by Brigadier General Andrii Hnatov).  Yet nothing came of this visit.  There was, it seems, under-appreciation of the weak state of the border defences and difficulties the brigade might face.  The only change was 125th Brigades subordinate battalions were ordered to deploy to forward positions (which they would abandon within 48 hours), and 42nd Mechanised Brigade (an under-manned formation battered in fighting in Bakhmut) was ordered to backfill vacated rear positions. On the day before the assault, three GUR sub-units also deployed to the area. These would prove invaluable in stiffening the collapsing defence line.Remarkably, no units were deployed behind the border guards north of Vovchansk.  The minor road that leads from the border to the settlement was open. If the Russians had known, they could have simply driven into the town as if on parade(Cold War students will remember memorising templates showing Soviet recce groups tens of kilometres ahead of the vanguards; these have vanished in the war, nobody attempts deep or even close recce in vehicles because of the threat of drones).[...]For all this disastrous start the situation was quickly recovered by General Mykhailo Drapaty.  Reinforcements were rushed to the town: the veteran 82nd Airborne Brigade, 71st Jaeger (Mountain) Brigade, 2nd Battalion 36th Marine Brigade, and a Lyut police battalion (these are battle-hardened infantry, not civilian police). The Russian advance was checked and confined to the north-west industrial quadrant of the town, north of the Vovcha River.  On 14 May, two unsupported Russian tanks attempted to push further south and were quickly destroyed (these are the only Russian tanks that have made an appearance in Vovchansk, a measure of how the tank has disappeared from the battlefield).  Very quickly, large meat attacks became small meat attacks. Eventually the Russians resorted to infiltrating assault groups of no more than five people, quickly destroyed by the Ukrainians.  Within a matter of days, stalemate reigned.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"See, I know there's various opinions on this, and I'm not a lawyer, but that reasoning seems off to me (if you mean in terms of public perception I've got no argument).

Not only are they misled in their false beliefs about being able to control the climate, but they are willing to force everyone else to be just as miserable in life as they are to continue trying to prove that they are right about the climate.  This means that you cant have nice things like a house that you want or big cars.  They also dont want you cooking with natural gas or using incandescent light bulbs.

What can you say? I mean, how many people in this survey could name ten presidents, never mind comment on their administrations?The primary reason people soured on Biden is because of \\"the economy\\" when we have the best economy in the entire world, by a long shot. Look back at the data points that Trump used to constantly tout as \\"proof\\" of what an economic genius he was - GDP, unemployment, job creation, business starts, energy independence, etc. - and pretty much all of them are not only better under Biden, they are much better. And keep in mind that Trump inherited a great economy from Obama while Biden inherited a complete disaster. We came out of the shutdown faster and stronger than any nation on earth, but somehow \\"the economy\\" sucks, according to so many people. I'm originally from the midwest, and while talking to friends and family back home, they were absolutely convinced that the stock market had crashed and that unemployment was at a 50 year high. The exact opposite was the reality. They would complain about high inflation when we had.some of the lowest in the world and when, up until five minutes ago, Republicans agreed with economists and historians that presidents have little control over inflation.Trump was even talking about having Jamie Dimon as his treasury secretary until Dimon mentioned to others in the finance industry that we were experiencing the best economy in decades. Well, Trump needed a doom and gloom message, so that was it for Dimon.I think that covid made people acutely aware that they were getting screwed by the system, so they blamed it on Biden instead of looking for the actual cause. no one wants to hit the books and look at neoconservative, trickle down economics over the last 40+ years that has made the rich literally richer than at any time in our history and has hollowed out the middle class. Both the Republicans and Dems have been responsible for this suite of policies, though mostly Republicans. But no one wants to deal with the details. The irony is that until we do, and start voting over matters of policy rather than personality, or what letter someone has behind their name, the beatings will continue until morale improves.What is galling to me though is that these people voted for Trump, a man who spent like a drunken sailor on the dumbest shit imaginable, gave billionaires a multi-TRILLION dollar tax cut, and \\"paid\\" for it by putting it onto the national debt, raising it by about an astonishing 25% - something which hasn;t been done in almost a century. We now pay over a trillion dollars a year just to service that debt, making it the second largest line item in our national budget, even more than the military.

This pardon was the most in-character action that Joe Biden has taken in his entire presidency. I knew Hunter Biden was going to be pardoned as soon as the entirely reasonable plea agreement fell apart, and I think almost everyone who was paying attention knew that Biden would not be able to resist pardoning his son. The only surprise is that he did not wait until Christmas Eve.Biden's statement accompanying the pardon was utterly reasonable. The sentence from the court was unreasonably harsh. It was unjust. A pardon would have been appropriate, especially if the president were unrelated to Hunter Biden.---I disagree with Elie Mystal. The president's and governors' pardon powers are a good feature of our government. The law is a somewhat mechanical institution that can be applied with inappropriate harshness, and is in thousands of cases each year. The pardon is far from a perfect mechanism for fixing injustice, but sometimes it works as intended.I would rather see 10,000 unjust pardons, than a civil war in the USA. The lack of pardon power might have been the cause of the Roman civil wars.

And I can actually see how people might think this, in part because this is been the cultural message for, Democrats always can be counted on to put up a fight and stop Republicans from doing things they say they want to do. From all of the polling and testimonial evidence we have, it does seem like there are a lot of people simply dont believe that Trump and Republicans will actually do a lot of things Democrats say they will or they think that the courts and Dems will stop it. I think it would be nice to imagine a world in which you can adequately warn people of threats without having to have it knock on your door for people to take it seriously, but unfortunately, weve tried that; we tried it a lot. Whatever qualms people might have about Democrats, I think the only way to get them to really recognize Republicans as a threat is for them to actually see.Another Narrative we need get in front of here is that I know Democrats are going to fight (and its probably the right thing to do), but there are going to be efforts to say Democrats did nothing to stop all of this and you shouldnt vote for them because they arent a real opposition or something similar. Its a perfect divisive message for people who want to keep the public divided against the true threat. But it is worth reminding people that this is what the American public voted for and it is not the job of Dems to answer for the misdeeds of republicans.
