I'm one of those people. I'm a guy that wanted Ron Paul to win back in 2008 and 2012. I had already been put off to politics after the 2000 election, and once I started down the conspiracy trail around 2005 stopped giving any attention to politicians. But I learned what to look for to see if they were part of the system.Do they belong to any collegiate secret societiesDo they belong to any of the \\"in-groups\\"CFR, Bilderberg, Bohemian Club, Committee of 300, Rhodes Scholar, Masons, Rosicrucian's etc etc etc.Are they married to any of the old money families like the Astor's, Carnegies, DuPont's etc etc etc.And lastly, how does the captured media treat them? Because going all the way back to 1915 we know that JP Morgan took over print media, to coax us into WWI, so his companies could reap some of the benefits of war time industry. So rich men have been taking over the media to promote their corporate interests ever since then. Remember when NBC was bought by General Electric(A weapons manufacturer and environmental polluter). It's almost 2025 and they are still cleaning up PCB's dumped by G.E.

Nitrogen runoff is bad for the environment regardless if it came from animals or a fertilizer plant. Nature did not intend for animals to all relive waste in the exact same location at the same time.Inorganic is the only possible way you would be able to feed 7 billion people especially if you want them to cut animals out of their diet.Due to the lower crop yield of organic farming, you would need to level more forest, water more deserts, etc, to make up the deficit which just exchanges one evil for another.

The Supreme Court that he installed gave the presidency blanket immunity up to and including the assassination of rivals, based on him privately holding public documents.

He has been supported by the billionaires who also want to be above the law - Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Ackman, Peter Thiel, Joe Lonsdale, Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Patrick Soon-Shiong, Miriam Adelson all in some way have shown pretences to Trump.

Either they become invasive species and get shot down, starved because of limited food supplies because they all compete same food. They might even eat clean some other species of bugs and corps. Their predators will strive and grow in population and even more was-animals will die in the following months because nature.Now you will have a once number in tens of billion population, reduced to a billion if you are lucky.

I grew up on a farm. I think your reaction is mainly based on different background. I understand that if you didn't have an opportunity to raise your own animals for food and be in an environment where it is normal, that vegan video about pigs (with dramatic music in the background and color filter) would make a strong impression on you.In my village (Central Asia, not US) people spend a ton of effort looking after their animals. And it's a big source of food for farmers themselves. Their living conditions are quite alright, they get to walk in pastures and hang out with the other animals. They are killed in the end yes, but when I'm  quite ok with taking an animal's life to feed my family.What plant-based alternatives should I consider, in your opinion? Where I live, we already spend all plowable land on crops: we grow and sell them. Cows, lambs and horses are pastured higher up in the mountains where land is too hard to plow. Pigs eat our own food waste (before you ask: they quite like it, the pleasure is evident from loud chewing and grunting noises). Raising both is quite cheap when there is enough cheap labor around. A lamb where I'm from costs like $100 and supplies a family with meat for a couple of weeks (pig could be $200-300 and it gives a lot of food). What plant-based alternatives will give us as much protein and fat?Most of your points seem to be about factory-farming. If so, I have no objections. I just wanted to clarify that farming, like most human activities, is very diverse in different parts of the world (and even parts of a single country), and that video about pigs you watched may not be giving a good coverage of all of it.Another thing to reflect on: if you believe that those plant-based alternatives are as available to everyone as they are to you, and your social class has sheltered you from ever encountering animal killing personally and you had to watch a video online to see what it looks like, it may be a good moment to think of your priviledge. There is a chance that you can afford to not see it and be disgusted by it, because the society has assigned it to someone else who is more financially vulnerable and for whom it is part of everyday life. Them doing it has brought our society to have the food abundance we have now, and might still be necessary today to maintain that abundance (together with a class of city people who are disgusted by it).","title":"cmv: eating meat is one of the most disgusting and depraved things someone can do"},{"text":"That better not be why.

Like a social \\"stamp of approval\\" gives us the permission we need to find fulfillment. Tell us its okay to think this, believe this, say this, or be this. People seeking purpose within society, rely on a shared understanding that justifies our sense of purpose. The broader culture, that \\"Nation of support\\", validates the paths in life we take, our values, even identities we embrace. Which is necessary for many who struggle with self-acceptance and worry about being \\"on the right path\\".Personally, I have the perspective that meaning is deeply personal and doesn't inherently require external validation. People who have inner strength, emotional intelligence or take an unorthodox path can find meaning without that social reinforcement. For many though, just knowing they belong to a supportive social fabric will strengthen confidence in their purpose. \\"This crisis of meaning, compounded by ideological extremism and technological amplification, has pushed America into an existential quandary\\"YES, it has indeed contributed to an existential quandary in America. From the way we perceive truth, meaning, and our collective identity. At the intersection of these forces, polarization has been intensified with widening distrust and echo chambers, which only serve to amplify radical views. Making calm discussion impossible.Social media has magnified the reach and impact of extreme ideologies. I wish more people understood how rapid sharing platforms are designed to invoke an emotional response with sensational and divisive content. Instead we need calm, collected discourse. Worse, someone gets trapped in an algorithmic loop, that is just reinforcing specific beliefs and creates online communities that validate the user but only serves to further isolate them from a more nuanced reality. This is why people find it impossible to find common ground and has so many feeling confused about what's true or moral. Leading to existential unease and rigid ideology, pulling people towards simplified narratives which only serves to comfort those beliefs which hinders that open-minded exploration we need more of. The more complex the world becomes, that rigidity can only lead to people feeling more alienated. How can we ever achieve goals for the betterment of society in this state? As Americans we urgently need to find ways to bridge this divide- balancing the technological with more meaningful and genuine dialogue. And maybe teach more about building resiliency against extremism. Empathy, curiosity, and understanding is the only way our country can get past this existential crossroads.","title":"CMV: It is only when the meaning of life has social proof that we require a nation of support to be comfortable with ourselves."},{"text":"So you would say the percentage of informed, knowledgeable and/or experienced voting-eligible adults with developed brains is basically equal to the percentage of informed, knowledgeable and/or experienced kids with developed brains?Maybe in the future when we have better systems of understanding different people's cognizance, awareness of politics etc we will change things.

Their argument for illegal immigrants, rights, and so on do not make too much sense. Also, the democrat's propaganda and ideas do not make sense. It is not a vote against Kamala or support Trump. It is a vote for Republicans to cool down the Democrats so the next time, democrats will have a better idea for the country. I am not in either party, but I also think Democrats seem to be full of hatred. In another way, many of the democrats calling others fascist and racist sounds like they just resort to pure emotions. In a debate or convincing others not to support the other side, you should not call people by those things. Saying that is pushing many people to the other side. They might still be in the middle. Winning a yelling contest might mean losing the election. So, almost all my college friends went for Trump. Personally, saying Trump will destroy the country and all that extreme stuff may not be as realistic since Trump was president before, the country did not collapse. Also, the Democrats did not remove all of Trump's tariffs in the last 4 years. This indicates that even the Democrat leaders actually supported the tariffs but didn't want to admit them. They probably wanted to do that as well, but none of the previous presidents wanted to be the bad guy. But Trump did it for them, and they probably liked it. Otherwise, they would immediately remove it. Bidden is still in control now. He and the Democrats can try to remove it now, but it seems no plan for it. This means they want the tariffs there. To me, all people, especially politicians, all lie. So, Trump or Kamala does not matter. In terms of plans, Trump is giving some plans, and even if he won't do what he says, it is at least some plan. Democrats need some plan. Plus, laws under Democrats are too loose. It needs to be tightened a bit before going back to Democrats. If Kamala said to remove and handle illegal immigration better, give police more power to knock down crimes, and have more of those conservative ideas. I am going to vote for her. True democracy is not absolute freedom nor letting things go out of control. The country focuses on fixing the major problems before looking at more minor ones. I also want freedom but at times, I would give up some of the freedom just to fix certain problems.","title":"Trump wins Arizona, flipping a swing state Biden won in 2020"},{"text":"tiktoker modern_warrior__ has a video on this topic to explain why the percentage is %64","title":"Trump overwhelmingly won native American votes, 64%"},{"text":"Very smart.

That gives a total right now of 145,567,696 votes. When I ran the numbers on Friday there were 144,479,583 total votes. Calculating that out (144,479,583 / 92.9 * 100) gave an estimate of 155.5m votes total. Doing the same calculation with the numbers right now (145,567,696 / 93.6 * 100) gives the same estimate of 155.5m total votes.

Which you are pretending that it is. It's true that meat production causes animals to suffer. However, virtually every human activity causes some amount of animal (and human!) suffering somewhere. We can't make food without giving land over to agriculture instead of habitat; we can't have roads and infrastructure without interfering with animals' movement; we can't have electronics and consumer goods without polluting some parts of the planet with mines and factories. Overall, the moral thing to do is reduce suffering by avoiding activities that increase suffering of animals (and people!). So, overall, people should consume less, support environmental protection, find ethically sourced products when possible, etc., etc. But it is impossible to eliminate all suffering of animals (and people!) due to human activities. If we accept that people are just, you know, allowed to exist as modern people with the level of consumption and waste that comes with that, there is a certain amount of suffering that they are just going to inflict on the world. We can only reduce suffering, we can't eliminate it, so it follows that it's just kind of okay for people to do some things that cause suffering if, on balance, the benefits are worth it to them. So why should meat-eating be any different? With every other kind of human activity we take a utilitarian approach and say that well, this does harm some animals, but it's beneficial enough that people can do it within reason. So shouldn't the same be true for eating the animals? We should reduce consumption, we should try to be ethical in how and what we consume. But there is no good argument here that eliminating meat-eating is required","title":"cmv: eating meat is one of the most disgusting and depraved things someone can do"},{"text":"It is not just censorship but rather the precisely planned psychological brainwashing that is going on.

So, we are being advised (by the MAGA redditors under this post) to hush up and accept the outcome because Trump won the election?? Hmmmm.... Sounds like a marvelous and very mature idea.

We are not ignorant enough to disrespect LE/Captial Officers, who would just be doing their jobs, unlike a very disrespectful and unpatriotic group of people that caused serious bodily (some fatal) injuries and physiological trauma that led some Capitol Officers to unalive themselves because the VP at that time didn't attempt to manipulate the will of the people. ??3. We are definitely not planning to run around in soggy diapers crying about fraud (like a certain cult of people). I don't mean ponder on it, either. I mean all out  tears (that are wetter than we've ever seen before). ??4. We aren't even contesting the presidential results due to the kaboom threats executed by the Russians, who were obviously putting in work for ya'll (\\"unbeknownst\\" to those with the utmost, credibility ??), to make damn sure that their pal, which of course, isn't shady (said no one except MAGA), won the election. ?? 5. Our dignified canadiate very tactfully and with integrity,  conceded with unifying positivity. We also know that our candiate has enough love inside of her soul and realizes that if she exercised her right to challenge the results, we would be even more divided than we are now. Unifying us and sparing the country unnecessary drama is very selfless. ??Ya'll mean to tell us that we can't peacefully and respectfully protest for a LEGITIMATE cause of making our voices heard because we are demanding to make it UNAPOLOGETICALLY clear that our rights are to be acknowledged and remain protected?? That we won't roll over and allow treacherous and unethical acts to destroy our democracy?? (Thinking to self that something is not quite right around here.) Sounds like great advice, but wait a minute. What about January 6...2021?!!! We remember that day. How could we possibly forget about the treacherous and unethical acts that were incited by 45/47... because their side didn't accept DEFEAT, nor did they have dignity, tact, or integrity. ??

Trump has never advocated for nation or race above the individual.2. Trump has been moving the government AWAY from being one that is centralized.3. Trump is not autocratic.

Trump is strongly against social regimentation6. Trump has not forcibly suppressed his opposition.Also.. Lets use some information from someone who truly understands what fascism is. Well use Mussolini: *Against individualism, the Fascist conception is for the State; and it is for the individual in so far as he coincides with the State . . . . It is opposed to classical Liberalism . . . . Liberalism denied the State in the interests of the particular individual; Fascism reaffirms the State as the true reality of the individual.*So, the state governs and the individual is only free so long as his concept of freedom coincides with the state.

I thought of an unknown valuable lead We got from Reddit ..About 2 years ago - Steven is going along working on the ciphers and making headway..He made a post about a line of text in the z340 I believe it was.. and there was 2 (Ts) at the end of the line.. one T was right side up and the other T was upside down..90 % of the line, Steven translated properly in the post, but held back on the real meaning of the 2,Ts..One user kept bugging him about saying the 2 Ts meant T-Top, as in the removable tops that came with the WestFalia version of the VW Bus..One of the Zodiac crew was called VWBABE, because he drove a VWBUS..No one else on the planet brought up this criticism.., and the guy wouldnt stop..So Steven sent him a comment that no one noticed and said, Ok, I will tell you the real meaning of the 2 (Ts) .. they mean transgender top ..The guy writes back, ok, I am watching you ! Steven hit the floor, because he knew he was talking to someone who knew what was in the ciphers A few days later that user sends a comment with a question: it read So, you are saying that they used the ciphers and letters and codes to talk to each other?Steven had never ever ever even thought ?? of that possibility and knew this guy was sending him a clue ..That broke the case Wide!! Open! - that is when all this other stuff embedded in the letters became apparent and started to be discovered and read and viewed by Steven, who was able to learn more about the patterns and systems of the Zodiac until he reached a point where reading the ciphers and codes was like reading personal letters ..Names, places, dates, members , arguments, motives , meeting places , espionage and now these embedded images .. it turned everything around..And then thats when the FBI showed up and asked Steven in a round about way - to not reveal the detailed extortion information in the z408 and z340 ciphers and offered him a job ..Steven said, no , but agreed to protect the reputation of a certain person ..Now were here..Steven kept his side of the bargain ..Thats all I can sayBen","title":"12 hours they fought our single post of a random image, while ALA Netflix and Trump post rolled we were accused of spamming"},{"text":"I'm not going to say that it's not terrible, because it's definitely a throat-punch for the Democrat Party.

For a deep red state we have a small coalition of dem voters. We have a small but mostly open gay community. We are racially mixed including a large black population, Hispanic mostly immigrant, Asian immigrant and Native American. People used to get along fair enough beyond snide remarks and the occasional loud drunk redneck. 80-90% white voters are rightwing to varying degrees but heavily Christian. We all just tried to be nice, get along, and stay out of each others way.?Since Trumps first run its been dicey putting our yard signs but early on theyd mostly get knocked down or stolen. Covid made people more reactive to dem items and you could expect to take some heat for wearing a mask. But we still got by, just less comfortably.Sometime during this campaign I felt the right leaning peoples rhetoric becoming less snarky and condescending and far more aggressive. Security would have to be called in the stores more as people would act out towards workers. But we remained hopeful. All we needed was one more election and at least Trump wouldnt be able to run and the culty part would die down again.The day after election you could sense the shift. One of my kids working in Walmart has had to have cops called to protect him several times. Hes been to with Trump elected they dont have to follow the rules around gun purchases. When I go to the store I take someone with me or avoid running into men or older churchy women at all costs. I wear very plain clothes and keep my head down. The workers, especially minority workers eye me warily. I have no way to signal to them I am not a threat without outing myself. Im in a religious minority (in very real danger of persecution), I have gay family and friends, some of my best friends are black and Native American. We all feel the same dread.I vote every election, including primaries. Ive voted for Bernie, to Biden and Kamala, to the least dangerous republican in races with no democrats.The fact that Reddit, YouTube talking heads and intellectuals think I should grovel at the feet of people who pointed this loaded gun (Trump and the GOP) at my head and pulled the trigger (letting them get elected by not voting) because either they think its a strategy game or to feel morally superior disgusts me as much if not more than the Trumpers.

But it's also going downhill at a much faster rate.Putin's early years were mostly pragmatic; he focused on careful crowd control that didn't involve a lot of blatant oppression, and he didn't poor a lot of ideology or religion on top of it. Abortions are still not exactly banned. Official anti-gay propaganda also escalated very slowly until recently. Putin was trying every step very carefully, testing it on TV pundits for many years first, before officially embracing it. The brain rot in the public discourse came much later. And the only reason he was starting wars was because he was afraid of specific revolutionary movements (the Rose revolution in Georgia followed by the Orange revolution in Ukraine).Trump, on the other hand, starts with \\"deport 20 million immigrants\\" and \\"death penalty for my political opponents\\" right off the bat. And as you see in this very thread, the neonazis are already out of the closet in full force controlling the public discourse and normalizing gas chambers. He's way ahead of his entire cabinet on fascist rhetoric, only outpaced by open neonazis.Additionally, the US is significantly less corrupt. While Russians never had a non-dysfunctional government or a functioning military, the US knows a thing or two about both. And I can easily see how this could result in a fascist government that's also significantly more \\"efficient\\" for its vile purposes. The US could figure out a system to prosecute the undesirables in a way that simply wouldn't work in Russia. And if the US decides to conquer some land, they will be much harder to stop.It took Putin 20 years to brainwash the country so much that it cheered on an open war in Ukraine - that was considered nothing but a brotherly nation in his early days.So I'm quite worried about the upcoming special military operation to \\"denazify\\" gay people in Canada, fully supported by 85% of US voters.

The same goes for destroying the ukrainian identity and culture, as in putins eyes there is no Ukraine.You are partially right, before the 2014 invasion ukraine was pretty divided on whether they wanted to lean more towards east or west. \\nHowever, after 2014 that already started changing and with 2022 and the full scale invasion the scales tipped completely towards most ukrainians seeing their future with western europe, as a free country, as ukraine.So while it is not looking good for ukraine militarily right now, their resolve isnt broken, which is what putin ultimately intended and was why he thought 3 days is all it needs.\\nEdit: spelling","title":"Trump Should Not Let Putin Claim Victory in Ukraine, Says NATO Official"},{"text":"So is this just based on your arbitrary assumption about how the LGBTQ+ community votes, or do you have anything else to back up your [election denial conspiracy theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_denial_movement_in_the_United_States)?","title":"Trump wins all seven swing states"},{"text":"lol kinda funny how the norm every election now is to call it rigged if your side loses.

I don't think people understand the importance of free speechThe moment you allow the government control the narrative is the moment you lose your democracy.Without TwitterX, everyone would have accepted COVID19 was an accident, the vaccine was safe, Kamala Harris won the 2024 election, etc.I don't understand why anybody thinks they should allow NATO or any independent group to tell us what we can and can't say. This is insane.We need to stand up against tyranny. Who owns you? Who gets to decide what you can say? If you allowed the US government to define misinformation, they would have thrown you in jail for stating that COVID19 was human engineered and for stating the vaccine killed more people than the virus.Even though you would have spoken the objective truth. Many people will wrongly assume that getting rid of misinformation would be a good thing, and therefore, they see nothing wrong with enacting laws to fight against it.The problem is that \\"misinformation\\" is not a fight  to ensure the public gets factual accurate information online HELL NO! To the government, misinformation will be any information that you share online that does not align with what the government narrative is will be categorized as misinformation, and they'll consider that a criminal act. This is happening in England. Do you think it's reasonable to go to jail because the government tells  you that fluoride in your drinking water is good for you, but you refer to several studies that state the opposite is true, and because of that they throw you in jail? This is marxism, an ideology that translates to communism in practical terms.Doctors were silenced for warning the public about the vaccine and youTube and Twitter silenced people who said the virus was created in a lab and not created via natural spillover.Even though the government narrative were complete lies, they considered anybody who told the objective truth to be guilty of misinformation because it contradicted the message the government wanted to brainwash people with.I don't know if people understand why it's tyrannical for a government to pass laws that make it a crime for telling the truth. Honest people don't feel threatened by free speech. Only people who want to spread lies want to shut people up for telling the truth.It's absolutely insane for anybody to think it's a good idea.  If you want to live in a communist country, then yes, it's a great idea.

Biden renominated Trumps federal reserve chairman in 2022. He also made picks before this to the federal reserve board, some of whom are voting fomc members. This chairmans big achievement was walking back the feds 2% inflation target in 2020, ie, before Trump left office. The new policy was allowing inflation to go moderately above 2% when its been below 2% for some time. It also ended some preemptive rate hikes that were traditionally used to head off expected inflation increases. Powell was actively calling for higher inflation. This reduced the feds credibility on 2% inflation and made higher inflation all but guaranteed. Had the fed not changed their inflation targeting in 2020, prices would not have risen to the extent that they did. The fed would have raised the fed funds rate higher than they did. So while most of the inflation increases happened before Powell was renominated, Biden to nominate other members before this and could have selected inflation hawks. Inflation had been low for so long that people were anchored on it and allowing it run high was quickly perceived as abnormal and undesirable by regular people. Despite being a policy that ostensibly was designed to support the economy, it made regular people think the economy was doing poorly.","title":"Trump wins Arizona to sweep swing states and secure 312 total electoral votes"},{"text":"Funny how on Truth social if you post anything negative about Trump you're immediately censored.","title":"Trump speech on ending censorship, Reddit is fucked"},{"text":"What do you think voter suppression means?","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Addresses the Nation on 2024 Election Results"},{"text":"Chad the alpha","title":"Big Techs Hotbeds of Employee Activism Quiet After Trumps Victory"},{"text":"It's not hope, it's inevitability.The hope, in the sense there is any, is that it won't be irreversibly bad.

The plan reads much like Project 2025.Investigations started on a ton of crimes Berlusconi had committed throughout the years (including connections with the mafia) so as PM he passed a number of laws to stay out of jail, literally turning his crimes into legal actions, he accused the judges investigating him of being politically motivated and called them communists. During his entire run as PM he was preoccupied with staying out of jail, totally ignoring the country's needs. He did, however, conduct private business with world dictators like Qaddafi while in power.Details of sex parties, possibly with minors, also surfaced. Nothing seemed to be able to hurt him. The media loved it and the opposition parties failed (on purpose?) to remove his massive conflict of interest (he owned the largest private TV network, publishing house and film distribution company in the country, among others), because of which he shouldn't have been able to enter politics.Most of his trials ended with him being granted statute of limitations, meaning he was found guilty.Despite all that, we Italians elected him 3 more times!Trump, for us Italians, is just a rerun of Berlusconi. Same kind of person, similar shady business and sexual dealings, a string of crimes that went unpunished, and a cult that refuses facts and sees him as a godsend.If history plays out like it did for Italy, the US is in deep trouble until Trump dies.","title":"None of the conventional explanations for Trumps victory stand up to scrutiny"},{"text":"Reddit isn't fucked at all unless they coordinate their censorship with the feds.","title":"Trump speech on ending censorship, Reddit is fucked"},{"text":"Man, some people are into cucking.

How would you propose they do that seeing as all the seat are full, filled by Donald Trumps first administration?

We dont have the SCOTUS, so if Dems had one branch for 4 years, the best they could do was attempt to halt far-right legislation from Congress. Others have already mentioned some of the great, albeit less flashy changes the Biden administration has made, many of them have made peoples everyday lives better in some way.

Sometimes it does sting hearing people talk about white men in a blanket way but I get it. I donno if I'm gonna arrive at a logical conclusion here but I'm gonna try. I'm also going to be fairly sympathetic but not entirely.I think they're seeing these influencers flexing their wealth and getting all these girls and they're feeling like they're losers. They're still living with their parents in a lot of cases yet they're still working. It's hard to bring a girl home when you're living with your parents and being able to afford a place is so difficult. Not to mention that that situation is likely to turn off prospects for them. Even if they are out of the house and they're renting they're paying out the ass and it's got to be insanely hard.I haven't tried out dating in this era so I may be off in some of my assessments here but I'll try. From what I've seen the 'app' dating scene appears to be a nightmare for men. Dudes are out there spending hours putting this incredible effort into finding dates and being confronted with a lot of shallow women who demand they be six foot tall etc. I'm not preaching gospel here with these anecdotes and maybe some women here could offer a counter. I graduated school not too long before the financial crisis hit in 08. It was difficult, I had an awful apartment with too many roommates. I struggled to feed myself at times. Finding good work was hard. I feel that today it's even worse for young people, and I'm afraid for my stepson because I know he wants independence but that's gonna be such a difficult battle for him. There's people seizing on that, and they're blaming the left and they're blaming women. These guys are impressionable and they are falling for these goofs that treat women like shit. Half these dicks just had rich parents, that's why they can get girls and show off on social media. They're not smarter or more alpha or any of that bullshit.

The cult of tradition. One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.\\n2. The rejection of modernism. The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.\\n3. The cult of action for actions sake. Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.\\n4. Disagreement is treason. The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.\\n5. Fear of difference. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.\\n6. Appeal to social frustration. One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.\\n7. The obsession with a plot. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.\\n8. The humiliation by the wealth and force of their enemies. By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.\\n9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.\\n10. Contempt for the weak. Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.\\n11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.\\n12. Machismo and weaponry. Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.\\n13. Selective populism. There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.\\n14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.","title":"What Does It Mean That Donald Trump Is a Fascist?"},{"text":"My first thought would be that newscaster is lying, but after seeing the video I mentioned in my previous comment, it honestly wouldnt surprise me if that newscaster filled her daughters head with that crap.","title":"This is what happens when you are propagandized by the lies of legacy media nonstop day and night, year after year, and you believe every word of it."},{"text":"That doesn't look like the same image, for instance their clothes are completely different.In any case, the post is real and the Twitter account is a real person doing real analysis of Russian state TV.

In PA there were several incidents in key counties where Republican poll watchers werent permitted to observe. Unlike in 2020, the lawyers were on it, getting orders and injunctions.Not as many drop boxes for ballot harvesting around the cities. They didnt have the 400 Million from Mark Zuckerberg to put the boxes in deep blue areas. (I think Zuckerbucks was illegal, actually, but no one stopped them in 2020). They still had drop boxes, but not nearly as many since The Zuck decided he should sit this one out (mostly).The Democrats tried to keep emergency Covid rules in place for 2024 in contravention to state laws; Republicans took them to court in the months prior to the election, resulting in the removal of many of these lax emergency Covid rules. If you recall, in most (all?) states voting laws are drafted and passed by state legislators and then signed into law by the governor. During Covid, because it was an emergency, many governors, Secretaries of State, and election officials just bypassed the legislation and made their own rules. One example from 2020 was how ballots were counted that were not postmarked by Election Day (illegal). Other new rules instituted included the practice of simply blasting out mail in ballots to addresses without a particular request. The typical way is that traditional absentee ballots are only mailed out with a specific request (i.e. I have a broken leg and cant drive). This led to a cyclone of mail in ballots going out to old addresses, duplicate ballots, people who werent even registered, etc.Many states also cleaned up their voter rolls. [Not] Shockingly, when Texas, Florida and Virginia did it, republicans crushed it in Texas and Florida  and almost won Virginia (amazing given Northern VAs composition). Why?

People like OP need to accept that, in this contest at least, they're the minority.I'm not saying they shouldn't organize and fight to be heard, but the real issue no longer appears to be Trump - it's our electorate. Any attempt to prevent another Trump term or a similar candidate in his place needs to address that MANY of our countrymen want a so-called fascist leader. All this focus on Trump is glossing over the fact that the people are very dissatisfied with our current country and believe the GOP has better solutions than Democrats.In other words, we keep villainizing Trump to avoid having to accept America has become a very conservative country (or at least moreso than we thought). Men, women, Hispanics, immigrants etc. all had increased turnout for the GOP. Moving forward, Dems need to start addressing working people's concerns rather than talking/complaining about Trump, because the latter is now a proven failed strategy in multiple elections.This whole election Trump has mostly been speaking directly to his voters, and Dems have just been complaining non-stop about Trump. It's definitely been hammered home this election cycle that even bad publicity is good publicity. No one has proven this better than Trump.","title":"Anti-Trump protests erupt across US from New York City to Seattle | Protest"},{"text":"And what did Biden do about these problems?

Also, considering Kamala got 20 million less votes than JB did in 2020, this would obviously impact every state to some degree. I personally think those 20 million votes were obviously fraudulent. If they committed voter fraud in 2020, why not now? Perhaps KL did actually lose! I don't think it's possible, but I'd definitely like an investigation done for transparency.

We will have a great Fifa World Cup and a great Fifa Club World Cup in the United States of America! Football Unites the World! Contrast that with the silence of Thomas Bach, Infantinos counterpart at the?[International Olympic Committee (IOC)](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ioc/), which would not confirm whether its own president had sent even a private message to the man now destined to play a key role in the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.If America and the wider world is deeply divided over Trumps election to a second term in office, the same can be said for sport amid huge anticipation and trepidation about what the future holds.For Infantino, Trump completing arguably the greatest political comeback in history could hardly be more welcome or more timely. The two presidents hit it off from the moment of their first Oval Office meeting, after the US was awarded the 2026 World Cup C along with Mexico and Canada C during Trumps previous term. Their special relationship continued even after Trump was voted out of power in 2020 amid a refusal by current president Joe Biden to grant Infantino a similar audience, a snub emblematic of four turbulent years for Fifa and its leader.That turbulence has coalesced around a proposal to change the World Cup from a quadrennial to a biennial event, which subsequently mutated into the almost equally divisive launch of a?[32-team Club World Cup](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/10/27/gianni-infantino-bid-to-woo-lionel-messi-club-world-cup/). Fifa has appeared increasingly desperate in its attempts to lure broadcasters and sponsors to back the new tournament, which is being staged in the US next summer as something of a World Cup test event but still does not have a fully confirmed match schedule. It would be no surprise to see Infantino try to leverage his relationship with arch-dealmaker Trump, to prevent the inaugural 32-team competition ending up an expensive flop.**Read more:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2024/11/10/donald-trump-fifa-gianni-infantino-ioc-thomas-bach-golf-pga/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2024/11/10/donald-trump-fifa-gianni-infantino-ioc-thomas-bach-golf-pga/)","title":"Brace yourselves for President Trumps impact on global sport"},{"text":"He is afraid of 'religious zealots inflicting their misguided beliefs on him and his family,' so he inflicts his misguided beliefs on them and kills them.","title":"Minnesota dad kills his family because of Trump."},{"text":"What about the Epstein records","title":"Will Trump Buckle Again on the JFK Records?"},{"text":"Horrified my assThey knew she was doing this","title":"This is so evil, pure malevolence"},{"text":"Simple.

I think the shift to populist politics is here to stay unless a viable centrist party comes along, and even then it better be a centrist party that prioritizes the needs and concerns of the working class.

Damn near every voting demographic has shifted to the right and away from Democrats because our platform and messaging has become too alienating, its just irrefutable at this point. I care about Trans rights and other social justice issues, but the fact of the matter is that the centering of those issues turns off a lot of goddamn people who arent dyed in the wool progressives. I think those issues are obviously important, but they need to become features of the platform and not anywhere near the focal point if we want to win back disenchanted non-college educated working class voters. Roughly 62% of Americans dont have college degrees and for most of them, the economy is, without exception, the number 1 priority. Its really simple math; 62% is larger than 38% and that means the Democratic Party needs to start worrying a hell of a lot more about what the 62% wants if we want to start winning elections again, especially since the party is already disadvantaged in the electoral college.","title":"Trump's win maintains his hold on the GOP.

Privately I've considered that possibility for a few reasons, but until there's actual evidence I don't think it'll be useful to start social media chatter that might amount to nothing and will narratively lose us the moral high ground as far as preserving faith in our elections.Having said that, it's a little weird that Kari Lake, whose whole deal is that she will loyally support Trump, lost while Trump won. It's a little weird that Harris and Tammy Baldwin were campaigning together in Wisconsin toward the end, with Harris losing and Baldwin winning. It's a little weird that, in Michigan, Harris got more votes than Elissa Slotkin, but Slotkin won and Trump beat Harris due to a little under 100000 voters who apparently had an opinion on the Presidency and no opinion on the Senate.It's a little weird, but back in 2012 we had 8 split tickets outcomes, and in fact every election had a lot of split ticket outcomes until 2016 ([source](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/the-postwar-history-of-senate-presidential-ticket-splitting-part-one/)).

I agree completely on all that you say. I have been talking about trans rights to a lot of conservatives and older people in my life. I want to throw my two cents on the  \\"language doesn't matter\\". In my experience, getting to older people (and youger men too sometimes!) is way easier if I let them use \\"imprecise\\" or even offensive language. If the spirit is in support, the language can arrive after. But the moment where someone gets aggressively called a bigot, a -ist or a -phobe because they used the wrong word is the moment where you lose them and the conversation is closed. Arguing in good faith means accepting that some people just might not know what is the current acceptable word, or might have a wrong model of what being trans means. I believe that most people are not malignant, even if some of them might be stubborn. (But, as you said, most people don't really care that much.)These kind of conversations should be carried largely by non-trans people. I think the left needs to bury forever the self-righteous, aggressive activist tone. The only thing it accomplished is virtue signaling and getting people mad. And sometimes, you need to accept results over feelings. If people are gross, but support you, that's still great. The 30yo rural guy that says that trans people are gross, but they can do them and he doesn't care? That's not a loss, that's a potential win. The 60yo woman that says God will show the way to trans people so no need to intervene from above to stop them? That's a potential win. The 45yo person that thinks trans people are mentally ill, so they need to be able to cure themselves? That's a potential win.These become wins when you get these people to support your policies, not your values. The cultural shift will come in due time. No use trying to force certain things in the California college progressive way. ---I have found that the reframing in terms of personal liberties works pretty well with conservatives. But it works best when I explicitly say that \\"people should be free to take choices and make mistakes without the government trying to play savior.\\" The explicit mention of mistakes seems to really help the people who just don't get it. Look, you don't have to get it to want the government to mind its business. As for kids, pushing it on the rights of the parents to choose what's best for them works well too. Imagine if the government told you your kid can't run barefoot or work in your farm on Sunday. Another good argument is that installing all the draconian measures to control that all of these trans people are kept in check waste so much money. We don't need more burocracy and waste of taxpayer's money. Their communities will guide and help them. They will pray to God and he will show them the way. (And the way, *sometimes*, happens to be transitioning.)I'm too tired to continue.

You do that and all of a sudden you're coming to ridiculous conclusions like \\"oh my god, Nazi Germany wasn't nationalist!\\"  Which is just as silly as saying the USSR wasn't nationalist.  Heuristics are a tool for initial quick judgments and understandings, don't overthink them or read too much into them.

Its just absolutely batshit crazy to think that you cant signal support for men without it diluting your support for women, but theres been an unwillingness on the part of Democrats to directly acknowledge and address the issues being faced by men. Its a bad blind spot in Democratic politics.Quoted from the article above, I think that's a bit of leftist dogma that it's frowned upon to say you care about men, even though there's nothing actually wrong with saying it. For the longest time, clickbait-style online discourse centered around sniping at men in general, or \\"white men\\", and using \\"cishet white man\\" like an epithet. This didn't pop up in 2024, or even after #metoo, it's just how leftist/feminist online media talked since the mid to late 2000's. Men were bad, and we should ban them (when prodded about it, they'll say well don't actually mean that, it's just shorthand for \\"the patriarchial system causes grief to women\\"). This is not traditional academic feminist discourse, but online discourse which is pithy and lacks nuance, and amplified a hundred fold by people on tumblr or twitter (as it used to be). When young men read stuff like that they'll think \\"what the heck did I do?\\", or at least feel it on a subconscious level. So young men feel like, at the very least, leftists and feminists don't care about them, or they hate them. So when right-wingers come along and say \\"we see you, we care\\", guess who those young men will listen to? People like Jordan Peterson or Joe Rogan, and social media algorithms being what they are, they find themselves sliding towards the even more extreme like Andrew Tate or Nick Fuentes.  \\nA lot of thinkpieces stop at \\"the left is silent on men's problems\\", but don't go one step further in terms of introspection: maybe you need to get rid of the dogma that says \\"we shouldn't listen to men's problems\\".","title":"What Just Happened With Trump and Men?"},{"text":"A quarter of America didnt want this.

Her main campaign ethos was that america is great, our institutions should be preserved, and that Trump is a threat. But top party dems completely missed why this race was close in the first place; people dont feel like the institutions are working for them so why should they be preserved.People want change, people just want to have a better life with more affordable homes, and healthcare, and more affordable groceries. Yes, Trump either had no plans to address these issues or his plans would have exacerbated the issue, but  Trump was able to effectively communicate that he hears peoples concerns and spoke to them about this issue.

Elon, Vance, and RFK Jr. all vocally opposed Trump at numerous points before the election cycle. Vivek ran against him.

If loyalty means never opposing or having opposed Trump, then all four would have been out of Trump's circle a long time ago.I take more of the stance that Trump is simply more revolutionary now than he was when he was first elected. Trump's first administration picks were bad. He had bad cabinet picks and the MAGA/AF movement wasn't fully ideologically matured. That's why you saw war hawks like Haley and pure incompetents like Devos take roles in his administration.

Yet they all have certain experiences that generally overlap. And THEY have people they trust which are only there now after being associated with trump. That means that trump can do his usual stand back shit that got us 2020 in the first place and it will actually be handled with ruthless efficiency.Dont expect any republican member of congress to get a position that takes them away from their current position i.e. Cruz to SCOTUS or AG or anything like that.I think were gonna find out that any predictions we have for cabinet positions are gonna come from people WE have no clue about until theyre announced and then when we look them up well find out theyve been apart of this coalition for a couple years now.RFK is pretty much a given but I guess I dont actually know if thats technically a cabinet position.Obviously we have the chief of staff now.Vivek could very well end up in a very prominent position but not press secretary because hes better than that. But also not a sexy cabinet position. So hes gonna get a lot of coverage and then well likely never hear about him again.I think tulsi gets UN ambassador but POSSIBLY sec of state/def.

Are you doing the 'no true scotsman' that libertarians are so well known for?I think you owe Fancy-Knowledge a delta you're admitting it's a good theory that addresses the issue.My take on this is that MAGA are populist libertarian which demonstrates that authoritarianism can be part of that ideology, too. It in no way inoculates believers into adopting smaller government or much of anything else.Consider: how do you achieve libertarian goals? Well, obviously you need authority and even in your essay you admit you need jail and prison systems.Socialists also have a problem admitting to this. If you want to transform society you'll have to throw a lot of people in jail.You need a big bloated gov't to insist that no one gives foreign aid.https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetlingThis always deserves to be part of the conversation and is a great read.I think communism is popular in North America, too. Whenever you see someone saying \\"ACAB\\" or \\"Eat the rich\\" it's primarily about class warfare. Socialists and social progressives talk about welfare a lot more than they do actual socialist policies and all you got to do is scratch the surface to find lots of class warfare.Mostly i want to impress that there is a huge difference between academic registered Libertarians and the populists that define the movement.

Did you really think we forgot, or decided it didn't matter anymore?I chose to vote for a candidate directly against the genocide, among many other policies and positions I agree with and not for Trump.But I absolutely understand why others chose that path.You see, capricious, vain and self-serving he may be, but Trumplestiltskin is not nearly as dangerous to the people, or the world at large, as Kopmala and more importantly, those behind her, have been/would be.For an interesting historical comparison, you should read a book called 'A Century of Dishonor', to see what the neolibs of the day were up to.For it is *exactly* those kind of people who conducted the genocide against mine. They were just as sure of their moral and indeed racial superiority. Their own, erudite and eminently qualified judgement. Just as unctuously, aristocratically sneering and smug, declaring that the horrors they committed against us were 'for their own good\\".My grandfather lied about his age at 16 years old, just so he could go overseas to *kill* motherfuckers like that in WW2.And don't think we forgot about Obomber saying \\"Let's just see how it all plays out' as images of my people with shredded limbs, frostbite and hypothermia inflicted by the fucking mercs he sent after them flooded the internet.For daring to object to their destructive practices.They are scum and as such, everywhere they go, they make enemies. Though amazingly, they actually think they've made friends, rather than just more bitterly resentful subjects who would see them undone at the earliest available opportunity.And in the end, that's all really Trumplestiltskin is: the first heavy branch or fist-sized rock that the public's groping hands found to use as a weapon against the predators which are feasting upon us and our loved ones, swallowing great bloody goblets of humanity into their never-sated maws.People like that do not cease.

We actually got into some shouting matches during family gatherings. They actually went to protests in DC!  What helped get them going was actually a trip my BIL had to take to repair an investment property.  He ended up staying with his parents in Oklahoma where they watched fox news (which I don't recommend). My BIL ended up watching shows where they would say the opposite of what MSNBC would say.  He didn't all of a sudden believe what fox said but he knew that both things could not be true, he went on a fact-finding mission and saw that MSNBC was misrepresenting (to say the least) the details of certain events and positions.  He did the research and discovered this for himself, he had to figure it out, but he had to know that there was a disparity in what the media was representing.  Both things can't be true, when presented with an argument, he was able to look up the facts and see for himself what was true.I helped him along with facts (not FOX!) to help him with his awakening and before I knew it, he was deprogrammed. It took 3 months and it was a huge issue for our family. People programmed by media and college have to discover the truth for themselves.  You can't push!Trump has a website that shows the lies and the actual video/proof of what happened, I don't recall what it is.  Hopefully someone can help provide a link or I will look for it and edit this post. The website links to some reliable sources (not all!) but should get the conversation started.You can't argue, they need to understand how to find the facts.My little sister went through a different process where she saw me and my older sister go through all this crap on a couple holidays and remained a hater for Trump for quite a bit of time. She finally came around once she had a kid.   My little sis is actually waaaaaay more MAGA than I am comfortable with and I talk to her about it all the time! I am hopeful that we are entering a new phase of the discourse with Trumps crusade to fix the media. I am not good with how far Elon has pushed things on x so we all need to look at this with a massive grain of salt.  Be skeptical and verify everything.  Everyone misleads and Trump does also to an extent.
