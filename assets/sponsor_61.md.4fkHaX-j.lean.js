It's not the only place people rant about politics or conspiracy theories. You're on a competitor right now. So the idea that because they're a monopoly, they should be mandated to allow harm to the public doesn't hold water. I'm not sure why protecting fascist propaganda should be a goal of a government that has historically been concerned enough about the spread of fascism to go to war about it. Twitter is an international company. If it wants to elevate fascist propaganda, it can do so. It will find advertisers in fascist countries. But here in America, our government being antifascist is constitutionally pretty baked in.  Not that our government is stopping Twitter from hosting fascist propaganda. It's not.Our government asked that all the major social media companies *look into* the people telling the masses not to trust vaccine science because it was an immediate driver of pandemic infection and death. Nobody made a law. Nobody sent an enforcement arm. The propaganda wasn't actually removed unless the social media companies chose to remove it, which was about advertiser pressure, not government intervention. There are currently people spreading vaccine misinformation right now on every social media platform. *at most* moderation ads a \\"hey, this is likely bullshit and you might not want to make medical decisions relying on it\\" tag to the posts. Becsuse the government did not force them to moderate the content nor force them not to do so. \\"The government should protect destabilizing fascist propaganda\\" seems as ludicrous as \\"the government should protect destabilizing communist propaganda.\\" Why would our government do either of those things? We are neither communists nor fascists in our governmental structure, constitutionally. And neither is constitutionally protected from private corporation deplatforming based on ad dollars, which are allocated based on broad customer engagement. That may honestly be one of the most democratic ways of deciding what is permitted. The people decide with their engagement. The government isn't protecting either \\"side\\" or any of the fringe nonsense either. The free market is applying the effective pressure on those fronts.","title":"CMV: Social media moderation isn't a form of leftist government censorship."},{"text":"I wonder how much electricity is \\"wasted\\" by the fact Wifi router antennas broadcast in all directions but the target device is only using 1/100000000th of the radiated signal on its receiving antenna.

What she's promising is actually in two parts:  Tax incentives for builders building starter homes.  I'm more or less okay with that.  Go for it.But there's the other part.  $25k in down payment assistance for buyers.  This actually isn't the first time such a program has been implemented.  In 2009, it was done to - and check this out - help stabilize plummeting house prices after the real estate crash.  And it'll do the same thing again, more than likely.  As in, it'll likely raise prices by increasing demand.  In the worst case, the cost of the assistance will get baked into the price of homes.  But in the likely best case, it'll raise the cost of housing some percentage of that $25k.Combined, that might eventually have a knock-on effect of lowering prices as supply goes up(higher prices in the smaller homes category combined with incentives will increase supply, more likely than not).But there's a rub.  Demand.  What happens if we don't solve the border and retain our continuous influx of migrants?  Demand for houses goes up at a rate that will likely outstrip supply.  Raising the prices.And, of course, we have to consider that when it comes to tax cuts, Trump seems hell-bent on ending taxes one tax at a time.  Allowing you to write off auto loan and generator costs.  No tax on tips(which, admittedly, Kamala decided was a good idea and copied).  No tax on OT.

We can not keep just handing out things to everyone. We are forgiving billions in student debt ( loans that individuals took out the mass population will now have to repay for them). 25K for 1st time home buyers, 50K for people who start businesses ( 50k that you only get to use to go towards owed taxes- not 50k you get handed to start your business). Where is this money coming from? Its coming for the American tax payers. In conjunction with helping to pay for Americans bills, we are also being forced to pay for illegal immigration. The current administration has stream lined access to the USA, so they like to try and say they arent illegal because they have given them temporary status by applying online thru an app. I dont play these reindeer games, a spade is still a spade.

Then as moderation slipped, the quality of advertisements itself also slipped which led to more advertisers fleeing, this is largely because there are differing degrees of professional advertisement and twitter has slipped a few levels, its slightly above porn advertising right now but its full to the brim of conspiracy theory shit, questionable supplements, the old adware shit among other things. It looks bad for major advertisers to have their advertisements in the same pool as those worse quality ones so they also began to pull out. Twitter like most socially media has always had a bot problem but there was still fairly reliable estimates on how many actual active users it had that advertisers were using to estimate certain things. Twitter also had the advantage of being a bulletin board for lots of famous and important individuals to make posts which gave ideal advertising space in amongst some very notable figures own personal comments. This sort of shit added extra incentives to twitters advertising even though it tended to have less active members than many other social media sites.","title":"CMV: Social media moderation isn't a form of leftist government censorship."},{"text":"Pinged WATERCOOLER ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20WATERCOOLER&amp;message=subscribe%20WATERCOOLER) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20WATERCOOLER&amp;message=unsubscribe%20WATERCOOLER) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=WATERCOOLER&amp;count=5))[Root comment link](/r/neoliberal/comments/1g3a3t7/discussion_thread/ls065me/)[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"At my thesis internship my manager was very worried I was getting burnt outI clocked in at 9, had an hour lunch at 12, and clocked out at 4!ping WATERCOOLER","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The funny thing is they done it so much even all the leftists and antifa grown tired of it and secretly want Harris gone.","title":"Reddit is currently social engineering the election."},{"text":"Whether it's an assault on free speech absolutely depends on where the line is drawn though.

It seems to involve a lot of faulty logic and very naive views of human behavior without any consideration of group psychology.There are always a lot of short-term benefits from any technological innovation. For example, deep fakes are obviously not on the same destructive level as these, but there were short-term positive byproducts of the proliferation of chemical weapons (agricultural pesticides) after WW1 and nuclear weapons after WW2, too (avoidance of wars due to mutually assured destruction).How does that actually constitute a good, though, when you consider the long term?*With regards to sex, people have been recording and sharing nude/sex recordings non-consensually since well before AI became a thing. And that's caused great damage to the people in those recordings. Today, if someone gets blackmailed with such a video, or such a video is released of them to their network, they can claim that it was a deepfake as a way of mitigating the shame and impact around such a video. And that, in among the broader harms of sexual deepfakes, gives a little (not a great lot of) power back to victims, as the recording doesn't have that same power of having their identity and privacy misappropriated. The flipside of that is that people who watch such recordings can no longer be sure that they're watching the real thing, which to some won't matter, but in general it devalues those recordings which is a good thing.*Do you really believe that humans are so rational and moral that they would stop stigmatizing people who, for example, have been victims of revenge porn or any other privacy violation, even if the victim has the option to deny the authenticity of the content by claiming it's a deep fake?The group psychology of public shaming and mobbing  doesn't work that way, dude. This is primitive stuff; it may occur digitally but this is primate behavior based on in-group-out-group dynamics. Don't think of the nobility of the human spirit, think chimps, baboons and macaque social hierarchies and then you are much closer to the reality and dynamics at play.It makes no difference whether what is being shared is content or gossip, whether its real or any evidence to the contrary because all that is incidental. Those kinds of things are superfluous to the social cohesion and enjoyment derived from the collective attack and degradation of the other due to whatever petty grievance or maybe none at all.I don't think it gives back any power to the victims of these kind of things and I don't think it reduces their trauma either. Surely, legislation, advocacy and support groups are better options than an appeal to content being deep faked.*I am not arguing against investigative journalism as such, rather I'm saying that investigative journalism only adds value to public discourse when it can point to different sources of evidence that corroborate each other, and more importantly when it can put together a meaningful and verifiable theory or picture of the reality. People losing trust in what they see and hear on their screens is not a bad thing when you consider how much lying and manipulation have been endemic to media and politics throughout history. I believe that it will force both creators and recipients of media to piece together a more diligent and complete picture of reality instead knee-jerk reacting.*Mhmm, okay, you are breathtakingly cynical about the media, and I don't disagree with you that systemic lying and manipulation are built into the media. But you conflate healthy public skepticism to mass media with distrust of reputable media and media disengagement.You also assume that people will react rationally to a loss of trust in the media and that they won't be more influenced by emotional and cognitive biases that lead to solipsism as well as the influence of bad actors. I think recent history suggests otherwise and I don't think your good faith argument adds up.What do you mean by a \\"diligent and complete picture of reality\\"?*And to be clear- I am not completely arguing against the use of such media to represent truth. If recordings need to be verified in a court of law,* [*there are ways to do that*](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/05/1241446778/deepfake-audio-detection)*. But the line between truth and artifice in media will be much more blurry, and if people lose trust in media as a result, so be it.*With the loss of trust in media, democracy, civic life, and duty all go out the window, opening the doors for any kind of totalitarian system. Seriously, this is very Orwellian stuff, dude. Have you read 1984? If not, you might want to pick up that book.Also, if you haven't already, you should check out what Nina Schick has been saying and writing on the topic of deepfakes and AI for years. It will be a game changer, but I don't think in the way that you expect. My personal feeling is that things are going to get hellish in every sense.","title":"CMV: the proliferation of deepfakes will give plausible deniability to people who have had videos shared about them without their consent, and that's a good thing."},{"text":"you can buy home filtration systems that remove fluoride .

So without publishing in these peer reviewed journals, academia wound perish. It will not be replaced as it is too profitable for the businesses that run them.

For example most peer reviewers do not get paid for reviewing. To publish, you may have to pay $1000s to get your paper into a reputable journal, or other institutions will have to pay $1000s to read it. If an alternative popped up it would just get bought out by these massive companies, as they wouldn't want to lose their golden goose.That's why I think that the classic peer reviewed study will slowly lose its automatic credibility and the scientific community will move to a new kind of communication medium.

Peer review has partly kept these junk AI papers from spreading. Sure, AI can put names on to claim peer review, but respected journals have better safeguards as well as editors who tend to be familiar with the key researchers in their subject area. I think science journals will use more tools to root out AI submissions and confirm authors/reviewers while continuing to lean on human expertise so they're not embarassed by publishing fake papers, which could be a fatal mistake for some of them.","title":"CMV: Peer-Reviewed Scientific Studies will be replaced by a new medium of academic communication"},{"text":"imagine if Biden had done that holy shit lol","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"According to CIA Director Burns, only a handful of people were informed about going to war, so Putin very much is the issue.

Then he suggests that is what the ANC has now done to the former center right to right wing opposition (DA, FF Plus, IFP).He laments how pathetic the new official opposition, MK and EFF, are, and what disarray they are in.And he closes by pointing out the only person who has really won here is Cyril Ramaphosa, with his vision of a corporate driven social democracy. He criticizes how hollow this vision is and implies it isn't likely to succeed.The context is the new coalition government has been in power now for just over 100 days. Also, the National Prosecuting Authority decided to not pursue any charges around the Phala Phala scandal where hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were found to be hidden in a couch in Ramaphosa's house.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"She needs those undecideds.

She was a serving Senator and there was no guarantee that a Biden/Harris ticket would win. If they lost, her chances of a successful presidential run in 2024 would be slim.?Biden got her to join the ticket by promising her that he would only serve one term and then guarantee she would get the nomination. If he had said publicly that he was not going to run in 2024, there would have been another long primary battle. That would divide the party and cost a lot of money that could be better spent campaigning against Trump.?So Biden waited until he had the nomination locked up, then threw the debate. Once Trump was sure he would win, he really didnt need a strong VP candidate, or even one who would attract undecided voters. So he picked Vance who has all that Silicon Valley money behind him, and appeals to the MAGA base.?The Biden sprung his trap. He withdrew and immediately named Harris as his successor.

He has stupid interviews but he has good ones too.One of the biggest issues with the Democratic Party is the inability to discuss things on a topic by topic basis. Thats what drives most republicans mad. We can disagree on shit, thats fine, there are plenty of Joe Rogan interviews I straight up skip or dont listen to, but there are some I listen to and am excited for. If Kamala does a Joe Rogan interview, I would be excited for that. Sometimes if you disagree with someone, its important to sit there and listen to them talk. The danger with shows like Joe Rogan, that I think he doesnt even understand, is that when he gives some of these people a platform to speak and doesnt fact check them, he gives them an opportunity to dupe anyone listening, and unfortunately too many listeners arent educated enough to think critically for themselves and fact check their own information.Now does Joe know this and does he prey on this? Im not sure. I hope not. I think he genuinely doesnt understand that that is what hes doing. (Maybe I have rose tinted glasses).For something like having Bernie on the show, or Kamala? Yeah, great, go for it, but fact check them on the fly. Do the same with Trump if he goes on the show too. Equal playing field.

In more detail: Cities tend to be more Democratic because they are, statistically, more diverse and more connected places which both correlate to more left-leaning policy preferences. Additionally, cities have populations that greatly outstrip those of the country, even swing counties. As just an example, my own state of MA (which isnt a swing state of course but its what I know) has a population of about 7 mil, give or take. About 1/2 of that is in the Greater Boston area (Boston and its immediate suburbs).While of course not every person in a city will vote Democratic, you would be foolish not to concentrate on that area if you were interested in winning a statewide election. And while they are strongholds never forget that with your own example of Milwaukee, Clinton lost 2016 because she did not take the time to shore up that support in that stronghold.  Now, as you pointed out, a city focused leaves quite a few areas high and dry. And Harris and team do know this, she has been going through more red areas to try to peel voters away from Trump. But then you run into that most damning issue of all: time. Even if you had the whole year to campaign, which Harris didnt, your time is limited. You cannot possibly visit every single state or county, because each visit takes time in more ways than one: travel, accommodations, setting up the venue, getting the word out, arranging visits to local businesses, meeting major donors. And thats just the stuff at the top of my head, there is probably more. So all of sudden visiting those red areas seems like an expensive waste of time and energy. Better perhaps to reach new voters in area you already perform strong in, or branch out to suburbs near the major cities which can be purple but with a lot more room to grow support than in more rural areas.","title":"Bernie Sanders rallies voters in Milwaukee, promotes Harris' health care plans"},{"text":"Alternate headline: Statistical Noise Vanishes After New Poll Taken","title":"Kamala Harris erases Donald Trump's gains with Black voters: New poll"},{"text":"Rogan wont push back on all his lies though It really sucks that the media is normalizing so much of his lies","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 14, 2024 - 22 days until election day!"},{"text":"It was made illegal in the first place so Nixon could go after black communities, so no, it's really not","title":"Kamala Harris pledges to support federal cannabis legalization"},{"text":"A bit of backstory.

In particular I suspect we will see a declaration of funding become standard practice to prevent corporate paper mills from cooking the books. I also suspect we will more explicitly state the peers who review a paper and perhaps if were very organized, set up a system of randomized peer review to prevent biased passes.Thankfully science is one of the few fields not mainly run by malicious businessmen. Most scientists still want to do good in the world and it means there is a lot more room for growth.I dont think it will replace the peer review system however, just add additional layers to meet the challenges of our more complex world like we did when introducing double-blind trials after data science revealed the effects of bias on studies.","title":"CMV: Peer-Reviewed Scientific Studies will be replaced by a new medium of academic communication"},{"text":"Its near the top on WaPo NYT however has like 3 anti-Harris stories and nothing on the town hall","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 14, 2024 - 22 days until election day!"},{"text":"My hope is that most of the people talking about \\"abandoning Harris\\" weren't going to vote Dem regardless.

Theres almost zero chance we dont flip any or lose seats in either chamber. currently its 64-35 R in the state assembly and 22-11 R in the state senate  looking at the maps and Chazs predictions (which I believe are too bullish on Rs, especially in the assembly), flipping at least 8 seats in the assembly is near a foregone conclusion with 4 more favored to flip blue, but competitive in addition to 5 tossups. 8 flips puts us at 56-43 R assembly at absolute worst and 52-47 R assembly when adding the 4 competitive races favored to flip blue which I would pick Ds to win all 4 atm, despite dealing with some pretty strong, intrenched R incumbents in some of these races. Looking at the state senate, 1 senate flip is near a foregone conclusion with 2 more competitive, but favored to flip blue with 1 toss up race. That would put us at 21-12 R senate at absolute worst and 19-14 R senate after adding the 2 competitive races favored to flip blue which I clearly would pick Ds in atm given there is little R money being poured into the senate this year, so Ds have outspent Rs pretty badly. Adding in the tossups to the D column results in best case scenarios for this year of 52-47 D assembly and 18-15 R senate although we probably will not win all the tossups, especially in the assembly where Rs are directing most of their money and resources towards Long story short, Ds will flip seats in both chambers and possibly take control of the assembly for the 1st time since 2008, the question is how many seats flip blue.

In Michigan it has become so much easier now to vote early, even from 2022. So I just find the best comparison is to see how much of the vote is compared to overall turnout of the 2020 election. The more the early vote makes up the vote total, the better for Dems. There are obviously certain states that is not true like South Dakota, but it is usually a good thing in swing states. In Michigan's case, all these votes are mail ballots. And we know mail balloting is still pretty heavy Dem. In person early is more split, though still usually leans dem, but that type of voting has not yet begun in Michigan. To get 10% of your vote in just from mail ballots that are heavy Dem is pretty impressive.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 14, 2024 - 22 days until election day!"},{"text":"She has a much better chance winning with Trump alive.","title":"Biden warns Iran any assassination attempt on Trump would be a declaration of war"},{"text":"Even the minimum salary for a Fox News host is about $5M per year.Most people would lie and gaslight on ANY topic for $5M per year.I wonder if we should have a maximum salary / max comp for people like this.I think people should know why they're being lied to.

Vote so that the 14 year old kid who thinks they might be trans, can afford the help they need, rather than being bullied into suicide or abused by their classmates or family. Vote so that you can leave a better world behind than when you found it. Voting is not a right, it is a duty. Every single one of us has a duty to keep the American experiment going. Our forefathers did not sail an uncharted ocean on disease-ridden ships while starving, build 13 colonies out of dirt and sticks, turn them into thriving cities, wage war on their captors for their independence, and give us every right and advantage possible, so that we could let Donald fucking Trump take that away from us. For anyone who has read this far, and still does not have enough reason to vote, maybe this dose of patriotism mainlined intro your veins will do the trick:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all\\nmen are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.I honestly cannot think of any written work that summarizes our current political environment more succinctly than that. It is our duty to provide future security for our nation, handed down to us by our forefathers.

First off, all those promises and ideas that Harris has, why has none of it ever been implemented during the last 4 years under the Biden HARRIS administration? If she has all these plans that can magically fix the economy or the border why has none of it been done? Also she has come right out and said on the View that I wouldnt change a single thing thats been done under Biden. So if you want another 4 years of the same BS then thats your prerogative. As for Trump, until Covid hit we had a strong economy, jobs were available, gas and food prices were down, the border was much more secure and we didnt get involved in any more wars/combat during his entire administration. As for the grab them by the ** comment. Either youre female or you have never been in the military or played sports or anything like that at all. Right or wrong guys talk shit. Its that simple. Im pro choice and believe that the Roe decision was accurate. Its not something the federal government is supposed to be regulating. Its 100% a state issue per the constitution of this country. The bottom line for me is that Trump actually DID GOOD things for this country during his presidency and if Covid hadnt have hit, he probably would have had a second term.Do I agree with everything Trump says or does? Nope. But I do certainly believe that hes the best person between the 2 choices we have in front of us. Put it this way, you have 2 contractors youre interviewing to do work on your house. The first guy shows up in a brand new Tesla truck, is polished, dresses nice, speaks well and says all the right things but they have never actually built anything with their own hands and hires out unknown subs to do all the work. Hes got pretty pictures of everything he says he can do and promises itll be done 2 weeks early and under budget. The second guy shows up in a beat up Chevy. Hes a little older, swears, his pants dont quite fit right, sometimes showing the crack of his ass. Hes owned his business for 30 years and has sketched out what he can do for you on a piece of paper. He tells you that the timeline youre asking for isnt really feasible due to the type of work and the budget he gives you is a little higher. But hes able to explain to you exactly why its going to cost you more and take a little longer. Hes got pictures of work hes actually done himself over the last decade and where possible does all the work himself. Are you going to pick the first guy just because he talks nice and kisses your ass or are you going to pick the second guy whos able to tell it to you straight even if its not the right way to say it?Trump doesnt know when to keep his mouth shut sometimes and he can be a little blunt but in my mind hes the right person for the job","title":"Help me understand."},{"text":"Hopefully history will do right by him in the long run.

They take those points and make it sound like he's senile when he's clearly not. He sounds like an average 80ish year old.Meanwhile, Trump has sounded like a dementia patient for a while now and has been clearly declining. I'm not speaking hyperbolically here. I'm coming from the perspective of I've seen relatives around Trump's age with dementia who talked in the exact same kind of word salad he does. And he does it on recording for all to see! What do we hear about that? Nothing. Zilch. Nada. Zip. Pure sane washing and running interference for him instead of pointing out that he's very clearly mentally unfit for the presidency, not even getting into the whole convicted felon indicted on a bunch of other charges factor.I never want to hear another peep about the media being biased towards Democrats when Trump clearly proves otherwise, to say nothing of the sane washing of the rest of the GOP. But I also know that that \\"liberal media\\" rhetoric will never go away, so here I vent.OK, end rant.

His whole campaign went down in flames.  A speech.  He had personalized portions of the speech, but it was the same speech, the media called him out on it.  Fox news wasn't even a thing back then.  The incident opened up the field for Gary Hart to be the front runner for a bit.  Then once Hart denied having affairs and demanded reporters follow him, which they did and caught him having an affair.  It was Mike Dukakis who ran as Democrat.

The motivation isnt foreign parties is usually to sow division among the population on foreign soil, without having any risk to their domestic interests/people etc.You could argue that the rise in Marxism and socialism are both natural, and also inflated via bot farms from the east; as another means of cyber warfare.You can also help stifle population growth in a country by doing this, especially when it comes to pushing neoliberalism. Marriages are down, divorces are up, hookup culture is up, birth rate subsequently down. And we havent even gotten into microplastics yet. The effects of lowering population growth are devastating all round, however China and Asia will be more at risk - as their culture is largely built around the young spending their time assisting the old. With not as many young people around to assist the old; we will see entire pillars of eastern society and industry collapse; the age care being one of them.One could argue it is China/russia doing this in efforts to try and run out the clock, by slowing down the U.S as much as possible; hopefully allowing them time for technological growth to take over, that or another aspect- I.e BRICS etc. to fully take root.That all being said, these are all missions known intimately to the deep state elite.For added context, heres some more info on how the west works, especially politics:Donors. These donors for either party, all have jobs. Blackrock owns over 80% of corporations in America alone, there are also State Street and Vanguard which own these as well. See, Blackrock owns and sits on the boards of all of State Streets companies, and vanguards too. Vanguard sits and owns all of blackrocks and SSs, and vice versa for state street.We call this the corporate blob. They own and fund everything. They also make up the entire (meaningful) donor list to either party.The Deep State Elite = the corporate blob + big banks + the military industrial complex.Ill make a post about this in depth soon, but yes in short, fear mongering, promoting division, dissenters, etc. Its another aspect of cyber warfare.","title":"Dead Internet Theory: help!: Kamala Harris proof"},{"text":"He can't even remember what day the election is, no way they're letting him do any real interviews","title":"Kamala Harris could join podcaster Joe Rogan for an interview - sources"},{"text":"Are Republicans more intolerant than dems?","title":"Hey Dems, stop doomscrolling and go win the election"},{"text":"No problem queef!","title":"Media is Biased"},{"text":"Is it?

It sucks that its coming to this, that people like Stein are taking advantage of it, and it'll probably be cited as a major reason Harris loses if she does. Harris would be better on this than Trump, but Biden is aiding and abetting a middle eastern genocide with American taxpayers money, thats as evident as water is wet, broadcasted everyday straight to the ears of young voters that grew up through the Islamophobia and war on terror that ensued after 9/11, and the other voters that lived through that as well who consider this an issue. That will alienate people. Saying this Objectively, it will alienate them. Harris is the VP of the current administration, she has no say in how it is run, but her name is on everything. What are Muslim Americans supposed to do? Hope AIPAC comprises and threatens less elections and political candidates in this cycle than they did the last? Democrats honestly aren't doing them any favors besides letting Israel, a *vassal state*, pummel it's neighbors, in a region they have been charged with keeping stable, with expensive rockets and artillery and tank shells more slowly than a Republican would allow them too.

He's recently been denying any connection, but he had some of the people behind it on his cabinet last year. Additionally, they have 100% guaranteed spots on his hypothetical cabinet, the Heritage Foundation (think tank behind Project 2025) supports Republicans, Trump himself and JD Vance has praised the project and the Heritage Foundation, and some right-wingers are mad at Trump trying to distance himself from it.So, what is Project 2025? It's the far right's plan to transform the US into a Christian dictatorship, only allowing the 'perfect' white, heterosexual nuclear family as citizens. Note only one sect of Christianity will come out on top, others (like mine, Catholicism) will likely be stamped out. For proof, look at the Pilgrims' reason for fleeing Europe, the Salem Witch Trials, and the reason Rhode Island was established in the first place. It means the end of the freedoms that make America, America as we know, never mind destroying democracy. Basically, all the Amendments will go bye-bye, along with most of the Constitution.If you want more reasons, show her clips of Nazis at Trump's rally. His 'concepts of an idea' bit from the debate regarding a plan around (I think) healthcare. The times he's called the city he's campaigning in trash. His 'I don't care about you, I just want your vote' bit he told supporters at a rally. How he won't release medical records over being shot (it looks like a piece of glass chipped him, not the bullet). Hiding behind a pixeglass barrier from assassins while preaching gun freedom. His 'grab them by the pussy' comment. His looking at underage teenagers at a show he owns because he can. Him being found guilty of rape. Telling people to inject bleach into their veins to combat Covid. His somehow bankrupting casinos as proof of his economic prowess. If you want more examples, just ask.But but but but but, if all you want to do is live with your wife who you obviously love, then ask her to not bring up politics. Ask your family to do the same.

I thought we valued the rule of law in this sub?Edit: alright, this was in fact dickish and in bad faith. Having worked in intergovernmental affairs, I just have a hard time with the argument that jurisdiction isn't an important factor. Legally it severely limits what the federal government can do - seriously, their tools become asking for change and offering funding in exchange for fairly general conditions. Politically it limits what you can do, because every time you wade in to provincial jurisdiction, you use up political capital until they are unwilling to engage with you. It also creates a bad deal for the federal government, because they spend the money, while provinces (or cities in the case of the Housing Accelerator Fund) deliver it and take the credit (this is an issue going way back to when Chretien introduced the Labour Market Transfer Agreements and got zero credit from the provinces). In some cases, provinces just turn around and convert the funding into tax breaks, since it all goes into general revenue at the end of the day (many provinces did this after receiving emergency funding during COVID).So yes, jurisdiction is a hard constraint, and even if there are some options for the federal government to wade into housing policy, they tend to be limited. I think if a level of government owns jurisdiction over an issue, they should own the issue first and foremost, and Canadians should respect that.","title":"Justin Trudeau is killing Canadas liberal dream"},{"text":"It's not democrats.

I did not have any idea how a human throat could possibly produce those noises, and could only imagine an entire childhood of her being yelled at whenever she laughed, such that she was constantly torn between letting the laughter out (sharp, high-pitched HA-s) and containing it (pained gurling). I thought she was dying every time she laughed. Maybe she was. I didn't have a savior complexreally!but I wanted to save this girl from this laughter in particular. I could envision an entire character arc about nothing but fixing this laughter, and the final scene would be her giving a quiet, normal laugh, and everyone watching would weep tears of joy and clap until their hands went numb out of sheer enthusiasm for what grand development and growth had occured. It would be like all of Shakespeare's characters morphing together into one singular uber-character who experienced uber-growth concentrated exclusively on her laugh. That was how character development worked, I think.Also, to be clear, despite comparing her laughter to the output of a malformed toad, I want to firmly re-establish that she did not have a toadlike appearance. She had a very pretty face, all things considered; if you have ever yearned in your heart \\"I wish I had a goth GF\\", you could guess that her face was much like the face of your ideal goth GF.

The feds are the last to blame, except for their dumb demand-stoking measures like the first time home buyers savings account.https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2024/04/12/announcement-canadas-housing-plan","title":"Justin Trudeau is killing Canadas liberal dream"},{"text":"Jiminy Christmas, I wasn't expecting an Alfonse D'Amato reference today.

It wasn't that the framers didn't understand the role. They didn't settle that the PM had to lead the Commons until 1923 (also the last time the king had strong influence over the choice of PM). The first time the PM signed a document as \\"the prime minister\\" was 1878. The legal fiction that the king is the chief executive but the PM exercises \\"royal perogative\\" on his behalf wasn't fictional then. They were still selecting their own ministers, and sometimes dismissing them. It was so set that all of the \\"PMs\\" of the time denied that such an office existed. The framers were used to a system where the king had real power. It happened to be the case that George I and II didn't speak English and relied on their ministers, and that George III was bad at ruling before going mad. In retrospect, that was part of the process where the monarchs lost all their de facto power, but the framers couldn't have known that in 1783.","title":"What is the solution to Americans voting too often (too many elections) ?"},{"text":"And there going to be the first ones on the deportation bus as well and i will not feel the least bit bad for them","title":"They will vote against Harris: Arab Americans in Michigan desert Democrats over Gaza"},{"text":"MAGA's really have a hard time understanding how Biden could step aside.","title":"Tensions rise between Harris and Biden teams as election nears"},{"text":"Loads of seniors dont remember how to change the TV channel, and/or just leave it on Fox News ALL DAY ALL Night \\nso in some respects Harris is directly reaching audiences in a DIRECT way that will not be twisted or watered down or worse.

Its a moot point. The Trump shit show is OVER!  Good riddance.Im not interested in opinions.  Ive seen the math.  Im NOT talking about the silly polls.The polls are such a small sample that its no wonder they arent very accurate.The demographics are the best available information based on recent state and national election and the results are immediately available in a number of sources.A quick google search brings you to a number of reputable sources that confirms the math.Question?How do you win an election when 60%-65% of all women and 80%-85% of people of color vote for the other candidate? (Thats not even counting the other voters hes lost including REPUBLICANS because of Jan 6 and on and on.)Answer: You dont.Common sense alone should inform any reasonable person that Trump has alienated too many groups of people to have any chance of success.The only group he appeals to is his base. Thats not going to be enough. The polls are too small to accurately measure the Harris landslide that will happen.Donald Trump has been criticized for alienating or insulting various groups, including:Women - Through derogatory comments and policies perceived as anti-women. His support of abortion is known to be a Republican campaign killer.People of Color - Including African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans, often through racially charged remarks.Muslims - With proposals such as a travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries.LGBTQ+ Community - Due to policy decisions and rhetoric perceived as discriminatory.Immigrants - Particularly from Latin America and the Middle East, often depicted negatively in his speeches.Polish Americans - through his negative remarks and lack of support for Nato.Disabled Individuals - For mocking a disabled reporter.Veterans and Military - Criticized for comments about military service and veterans issues.Journalists and the Media - Frequently labeled as fake news, leading to tensions with the press.Young people - including his recent tweet on his social media in which he tweeted in all caps: I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.Never Trumpers:  A faction of conservative and Republican individuals who opposed Donald Trumps candidacy and presidency. They reject his style, policies, and rhetoric, believing he poses a threat to traditional conservative values and the integrity of the Republican Party.Trumps rhetoric and actions have already impacted his support among these groups in various elections.If you think that you win elections by insulting and alienating people, then you are either very na?ve, a blind partisan or mentally challenged.","title":"Kamala Harris erases Donald Trump's gains with Black voters: New poll"},{"text":"And if youre not in a swing state there may be down ballot issues worth getting involved with!

Combined with the already hilariously expensive market, this might have been one of the worst times in some 25 years to expand immigration to the extent that we did. Just about every city saw year over year decreases in housing starts regardless of zoning regs. Like, Edmonton had a pretty loose regulatory environment to start with and abundance of land to expand into if necessary. It's historically weathered high growth pretty well and moreover they significantly upzoned the entire city at the beginning of this year. Despite recent improvements, permitting and housing starts are still only maybe on par with like 2015 levels. Meanwhile housing costs are up significantly and rising, the schools and hospitals are full, and unemployment is at 9% during a \\"labour shortage\\".My cynical side tells me this immigration policy had less to do with the long-term economic health of the country, and was more of a hail-mary to temporarily stave off a technical recession until the election at the expense of an already overheated housing market that stood basically no chance of adapting in the time needed to accommodate new comers.","title":"Justin Trudeau is killing Canadas liberal dream"},{"text":"I mean it obviously is?

In fact, I think the Joker is not even a real aspect of Arthur. I think the violence of the first film was purely a stress response, and that when he is Joker-ish in this film, he is pretty much just faking it because he feels like that is what people want of him -- and all Arthur wants is to be wanted.To your point about the musicality, and the end goal being Arthur's detachment from what society thinks. I think this is just a pure impossibility. Arthur is utterly dependent on society's opinion, and I think his rejection of the Joker persona once and for all largely lies on the reasoning that the part of society that idolizes the Joker as a success is just as awful as the part that idolizes the Wayne family as a symbol of success. He truly wants ALL of society to crumble, and be rebuilt in a better way, but also knows that the Joker is nowhere near the type of figure that should be doing that rebuilding. With that vision, things would turn out the same -- or worse.I am in agreement that Quinn is a bad usage in this film, and I agree that it would have been much better to have a male character for that position. Ultimately, if one of the messages of the film was to reject the incel, red-pill crowd, then Harley Quinn's depiction in this movie is awful. In fact, it seems to sympathize with many of the incel positions, ie. women want the \\"chad\\" and not the sad, real you; women will abandon you as soon as you show weakness, or aren't successful; women will manipulate the weakest parts of your psyche, etc.I think this movie is not meant to feel as though it has high stakes, because really, it doesn't. The only person with a stake in this movie is Arthur. Everybody else thinks they have a stake in this movie, but their stakes are trivial, and all rely on Arthur damning himself to his death sentence by being the Joker they think he is.I do agree that the ending is a bit of a statement toward comic book films and not giving the average comic book moviegoer what they cam for. However, I disagree a lot with the statement that killing Arthur was a fuck you to those who were invested in him. I was invested in him -- as were many people I know who also enjoyed this film -- and we knew there was no way he wasn't dying from this. If he wasn't killed, I have little doubt that he would have killed himself. The ending is showing the audience the ironic truth that Arthur has realized: when he was the Joker, everybody showed him attention for the first time, but afterward, they only want to show the Joker attention, and he becomes wholly separate from Arthur as an idea, and suddenly not only is he invisible to society, the idea of Arthur Fleck is actively subdued in favor of the Joker. In this sense, death is the only catharsis for the character, and for the audience","title":"CMV: Joker 2 is one of the best movies of the year"},{"text":"!immigration","title":"Justin Trudeau is killing Canadas liberal dream"},{"text":"The only aggregator that has her losing is Real Clear Politics which is right leaning and still includes Rasmussen, which is regularly 2-3 points in Trump's favor in nearly every poll they run.Literally everyone else has the swing states in the MoE with MI, WI and PA narrowly for Harris, NC, GA and NV basically a complete dead heat and AZ narrowly for Trump.","title":"Kamala Harris erases Donald Trump's gains with Black voters: New poll"},{"text":"Theyre suddenly realizing they dont have the election in the bag","title":"Arrows are penetrating the pillar of democracy.. wtf"},{"text":"So she's Republican.","title":"DNC launching Wisconsin ad attacking Green Party candidate Jill Stein"},{"text":"Please.","title":"\\"It is time to scrap the cap, expand benefits, and fully fund Social Security.\\" -\\nBernie Sanders"},{"text":"He'll ask her tougher questions than she has faced so far, which is obviously an incredibly low bar.
