A lot of this is generated fear from the same people that take partial out of text comments to demonize any and everything that rational moderate republicans says. He is in no way saying that if you are not a true blood America - then good bye. His wife would be included if that was the case. Permanent residences of the US are legal residences. Im sure your family is one of the many that has called American home and wants to see it restored to what it was several years ago. Not what we see today as some celebrate burning the American flag and trying to destroy the community in which they may reside. I understand and sympathize your familys fear but I think its unfounded and legacy media is playing up on those fears in the most disgraceful ways. Trying to paint Trump as a hitler figure is straight out wrong and offensive to so many people in this country. It pisses me off. If you actually watch his long interviews you can see his comments taken completely out of context repeatedly. The illegal immigrants committing crimes and causing chaos through the communities are at the heart of the issue. The non-vetted illegal immigrants with gang member ties that have been green lighted to kill Americans cops. Those who are flooding the nation with fentanyl. The illegal immigrants from multiple nations from both borders on the terrorist list. There is absolutely no justification for any of these individuals from other countries, individuals who have committed crimes and been deported in the past (even repeatedly) and show back up on US soil to do it again. Then you have the Biden admin flying immigrants from countries like Haiti, as we heard about in the last few weeks, and dropping them in these very small communities that DO NOT have the resources to provide the necessities to help them BUT its somehow its the republicans fault when its exposed in the media! Its an utterly deplorable situation created 100% by the Biden/Harris administration who has purposely allowed this to happen, they dont give a shit about the people in those communities NOR the poor Haitian dropped off like hot potatos for political gain. There is a God Damn reason Trump, as much as I personally hate the orange man, won the election. This is just one of many reasons. so again no, your family is completely safe as they are in legally US residences.

Mulroney resigned office and allowed Campbell to take over as PM, with the party officially appointing her to the position (parliamentary governments are weird). The campaign was so bad that her party went from being in power to dropping down to only have two seats out of a possible 108.  She finished third in the popular vote that year.

I'm strongly aware that many people's education and upbringing are beyond their control. Jumping to Canada politics for a second. Almost half of BC residents, for example, are functionally illiterate - which is obviously a failing of the government and not the individuals. We know these lower education and literacy rates are in more rural communities, which is where people overwhelmingly vote conservative. As I've discussed elsewhere, this doesn't mean only \\"dumb\\" people vote conservative. But it does mean the conservatives know how to talk to the less educated and craft soundbites they resonate with. I'm in firm agreeance with you that people don't choose their initial worldview and political stance. But the vast majority interact with many people throughout their lives, and have access to the internet. At some point before voting age, and especially after, someone has questioned your views. If by then you have statistically harmful views and have not bothered to try to educate yourself in good faith, then yes I think you are now the problem and my respect is gone.I've never heard someone say \\"educate yourself\\" in the manner you're describing, to anyone who is actually open to changing their beliefs, or in the process of doing so, and not ignorantly arguing in bad faith.Edit: ironically, \\"educate yourself\\" lol.

You used to get thrown out of office when you have 6 percent unemployment and were hemorrhaging jobs. Not the case now though.

Basically, they could have took a 2nd bite at the issue in 2025 and passed whatever policy they deemed was inadequately addressed in 2024. Instead, It also sets up a scenario in which an overestimation in the public's appetite for hard-line efforts (the deportation camps, family separation) might occur, drawing a public rebuke.The delay in achieved results could make the replacement theory extremists to feel it necessary to act ([as they did in El Paso and Pittsburgh](https://www.newsweek.com/great-replacement-theory-inspired-terror-attacks-recent-years-1706953)) to achieve goals, drawing more public disgust with the echoing rhetoric and conservative hyper-focus on removing immigrants by all means available.","title":"Donald Trump wins most popular votes by a Republican ever"},{"text":"Not surprising considering she was in charge of small business in trumps last term","title":"The right-wing organization in Trumps ear replacing the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025"},{"text":"He invaded Crimea under Obama and Eastern Ukraine under Biden.

But it would still hurt Joes ego and legacy, so I think he will not resign anyway. But if he did resign, Kamala could appoint someone really partisan as the new Vice President, so he or she could preside over the opening of the ballots on January 6, 2025. The new Vice President could get the Senate to invalidate all electoral college ballots cast for Trump on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendments disqualification clause. The next step would be to pick a moderate Democrat or an Independent senator as a unity President.I think Joe would not go along with this because it would be too extreme and would hurt his legacy. Instead he will let Trump become President.If the Sisonites want to foment a lot of trouble, all they have to do is distribute their personal arsenals, such as those used for training during Socialist Rifle Association and John Brown Gun Club meetups, to everyone facing deportation.

After viewing his overall performance, his teardown of the RNC, and his coalition-building with Vivek, Junior, Tulsi, Musk?  I have more trust than ever.

I gave up on that possibility when I noticed he was watching the live coverage on Jan6 with a joker grin and a weird, creepy laugh. I used a droplet approach for 1.5-2 years prior to giving up on J6. He refused to discuss politics so I made sure he was at least hearing some of the info that was being left out or lied about. I limited it to only major topics instead of it being a daily or weekly thing. We had two sentence discussions. Id include as much of the key info in my sentence and his sentence was consistently, Idw to talk about politics. For some topics, I was able to remove details specific to politics to discuss the general topic. Hed share his thoughts and Id eventually add the link to politics. Halfway into 2020, he started occasionally bringing up things he saw or heard to ask me if those were true. The goal was not to change his views or opinions, it was to make sure he had more of the info in order to form his own views and opinions (&amp; hopefully not fall for the lies). The only exception to that was conspiracy theories. I found out there was a conspiracy theory about Sandy Hook when he confidently and smuggly stated it as fact. That started the whole process because I tuned out politics and current events on purpose prior to that, but believing a school shooting was an elaborate hoax was too shocking and too disgusting to stick with not paying attention to politics and current events. He knows the Sandy Hook CT was a lie now and does not fall for conspiracy theories anymore.

This is why there are liberal areas where liberal families live and raise liberal kids, same with conservatives.If someone comes from an area with deep ideology and is able to reject that culture and worldview and build their own, because they disagree with it, thats amazing and those people should be commended, but people who cant do that (vast majority of people) should not be demonized.Simply looking up information is the entire solution. It also depends on if the individual is open-minded, uses critical thinking skills, and has a basic understanding of media literacy. While all of these are partly dependent on their upbringing and community, they still have the ability to look information up themselves. This access to information is exactly why it doesn't matter where you grow up and if that location has some deep ideology. I don't see where you get that the vast majority of people can't build their own world view considering nearly everyone in the US has that easy access to differing viewpoints and credible information.There's more factors that go into where people get their political ideologies from. Peers, media, education level, life experiences.I cant stand people with their self righteous educate yourself BS. These people act like they get up at the 4 am every day to read everything under the sun to make sure they choose the correct moral stance on a given issue, and anyone who hasnt looked into it or come to the right conclusion is less than. Its honestly pathetic and its pure mental bias.No, you don't need to wake up at 4 am and spend hours reading article after article about something. If someone is doom scrolling Reddit or Facebook or watching Fox News or CNN for hours, they have the time and ability to lookup information from more credible sources. The vast majority of households in the use have internet access. Educating yourself is free and accessible. It's safe to say that people are a few articles away from educating themselves on a subject.If you are proud of your worldview and you think it makes you a better person, believe me you are lucky to have it and its a gift. You didnt work for it and no one owes you applause, and youre dead wrong to make villains of people less fortunate.I 100% did work for my world view. I do my best to not trust anything I read online at first glance or hear from someone else without any background context and credible sources of information. My household and much of my community was conservative growing up, yet my siblings and myself educated ourselves. I spoke with others who didn't share my views. I often try to look up opposing beliefs to challenge my own beliefs. Anyone can do that.No one owes me an applause because of this. Instead of just believing in something simply due to their community or something they saw on social media, it should be an expectation that people try and educate themselves to better themselves and others.

Information is available to all of us, so it's not \\"elitist\\" to have access to knowledge of what is going on in the world, and how things work. As far as the time to research it, you don't *need* to have a strong opinion on something you know nothing about. If you don't have time to research it, stay out of it. I'll lean towards the idea that you may be more privileged than others if you have the time to really dig in to the facets of every nuanced tiny detail about how the world works, but that's not what people are expecting you to do when they tell you to educate yourself in this instance. They're telling you that if you're making a strong decision or stance, then you should educate yourself on that stance and how it will effect the world before you make strong claims about it.It's true that you're a product of your environment. But we are all capable of critical thinking, and most of us make a choice: do you choose to research for yourself and make the best decision, or ignore reality and just move forward with what sounds cool? Decisions in relation with the latter for important things like elections, absolutely are a detriment to society. I would argue either educate yourself there or simply don't get involved. There are some situations where you quite clearly do have a higher morale ground than others, in my opinion. Take the extreme of someone that kills or rapes someone, you obviously think that you'd be morally superior to them. So that concept exists in some capacity, undeniably. Now extend that to a hypothetical situation where people are being killed outside of your town left and right. You've heard from someone that's being accused of being responsible, that it's actually their accusers that did it. You have a group of people that went over the hill and saw evidence of the person being accused actually being responsible. But you refuse to walk to that hill and peer over; instead you blindly agree with the man that was accused. If you refuse to \\"educate yourself\\" in that situation, then yes absolutely, others are morally superior to you because they investigated, found the truth, and took action on that truth; whereas you took a strong stance with no evidence at all.I'll also add because you added a lot of political coloring to your post, that if it's genuinely just a difference in opinion, then \\"educate yourself\\" is being used toxically. For example, if people acknowledge the risk of the US pulling out of certain areas where we are posturing to maintain free trade and relative peace, and say it's worth the risk due to other clear benefits -- they aren't speaking out of ignorance. They have a different opinion on what matters, what level of risk should be allowed, and what actions we should take because of it. What *would* be an \\"educate yourself\\" moment would be someone denying that the US played an incredibly strong role in global peace and the free trade we experience today especially since the end of WW2, because that is an undeniable fact.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"So, did you vote for the person with better policies that would be better for our country but with weaker communication skills or the better communicator with the worst policies for our nation and the world?I agree that what you are saying as part of why she lost, because being a better communicator makes you more likely to connect with people on an emotional level and most people are not rationally-driven voters, but it wouldn't cause me individually to vote for the worse candidate for our country just because he's more charismatic and engaging because I don't vote primarily based on emotion.","title":"Charlamagne tha God admits Trump 'speaks to people's grievances better' than Democrats"},{"text":"I've had countless \\"debates\\" with these fucking idiots, and every single time I walk them into a corner, they just stop responding or try and change the subject.

Slavery wasnt completely abolished after the Civil War.  Felons in prison can be forced to do labor.  Trump could very easily set up kangaroo courts to rubber-stamp convictions and turn internment camp inmates into slaves. This is pretty much par for fascist regimes.  Stalin had the gulags, Hitler had his concentration camps, and Mao had his re-education camps.  Trumps team is putting his deportation camps, and the special paramilitary units that will abduct people from their homes to fill them, as their first priority.  By this time next year neighborhood raids will be common.  By this time the year after he will be well on his way to enslaving 5% of the population.  Many of those will be the enemy within, aka his political opponents and others that are insufficiently loyal to him personally. Could we escape this fate?  Probably not; the slide from democracy into fascism is historically a one-way trip.  We had a chance last Tuesday to hang on a bit longer but the MAGAs decided fascism would be fun, so were sliding fast now. Authoritarian regimes eventually crash from their own rigidity and incompetence, though, and Trump is old, so hopefully in the next 4 to 40 years we can try a new democracy.

Very rarely do actually educated people tell somebody to \\"educate themselves\\" as opposed to trying to explain or argue their side. So, from your title, it's a line most commonly used by people parroting beliefs or memorized phrases they've internalized as the \\"correct view\\" on a topic they're not properly informed on. It would be elitist if they actually knew the topics they've stated that on, but that's almost never the case.  \\nTo add on to that, from what you've stated, this seems much more like a left versus right argument as opposed to any form of intellectual elitism. This statement falls into the same trap you see other statements like, \\"do better\\" fall into where it leaves the end open. Do better how? Educate yourself on what specifically? These are poor attempts to end an argument putting the person stating them on, like you said, some semblance of a moral high ground, but provides no actual information to reflect on and can easily be turned on the person stating them if they're arguing with somebody informed on the topic. It's an easier tactic for leftists to use due to the growing understanding of intersectionality and critical theory playing into identity politics and these being burgeoning topics in social science. However, it all circles back to a defensive argument that an actual educated person would likely come with an argument as opposed to retreating. Are there cases where the person you're arguing with doesn't have the depth of knowledge to make a case and maybe they do need to go educate themselves? Sure. However, that's really more for higher level, specialized discussions and much less for any form of moral argument. If you're expected to have a philosophical discussion on moral/ethical frameworks, maybe go read a philosophy book and be amazed at how the outcome is there can't be an outcome. But if it's Suzie down the street saying you should have voted for a certain person, just ask them to name the actual policies that person supports, how they've voted previously and other topics along those lines.

It can be very easy to dismiss someone with an opposing view or less awareness on the subject and this response runs the risk of the other person \\"educating\\" themselves with flawed or dishonest sources. If you aren't willing to educate someone on a topic, someone else will.That being said, I think this term is valid when trying to discuss something in depth and nuanced when the other side has put far less time and effort into the subject. It's like trying to coach a varsity team with someone who doesn't have the basics: if you want to be a quarterback, you gotta come in knowing how to throw. Discussion works the same way: For arguments sake, you say Columbus doesn't deserve the acclaim he's been given, someone asks you why. You can tell them about his connection to the early slave trade, about his views of the natives, how Columbus Day was started to ease tensions with Italian immigrants and not out of respect, etc. This person now understands the topic, or at least your view, better. They have more to go on and can further their own education.Now, have that discussion ten more times. Fifty. One hundred. Sometimes with people who demand sources out of thin air, as if you have the book shoved up your ass for just this occasion. Sometimes with people who are emotionally invested in the topic and won't be asking in good faith. It has suddenly become your job to defend a position that can easily be researched, to have sources at hand, and to be able to overcome resistance and bias. ( And for a topic that you may have no real attachment to)Is this your life now? Forever arguing over Columbus and lecturing folks? Having to devote more time to explaining your view for others' sake?\\"Educate yourself\\" is not always a dismissal. Oftentimes, it's a surrender: I can't have this discussion again, I'm so tired of having to explain and defend my position from square one each time.It is a clear, concise suggestion to someone honestly interested in the topic and a dismissal to anyone asking in bad faith.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"it's probably going to take a war. unfortunately.","title":"Donald Trump and the New World Order: The End of the West"},{"text":"In retrospect, the Trump folks kept fighting the war from 2020-24 while Democrats stopped paying attention in large numbers.

Then, in June, Biden finally issued an executive order to stem the flow of undocumented migrants and limit asylum. If his administration had listened to voter concerns and acted sooner, Harris would have been in a stronger position. But she wasnt.Trump has been elected on a promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants. Vance, now the vice-president-elect, has also been clear that he is fully committed to that policy. The Trump 2.0 immigration agenda is bound to generate waves of international outrage. The UK government will come under pressure to denounce the incoming administration as a far-right tyranny. This could further exacerbate tensions between Labour and Trumpworld, especially after the fuss over 100 Labour activists being sent across the Atlantic to canvas for Harris. Moreover, if Trump and Vance move quickly to end the war in Ukraine, British politicians may feel compelled to denounce Republicans for rewarding Vladimir Putins aggression.But 2024 is not 2016, and Trump can no longer be dismissed as a freakish aberration from politics as usual. He is the new normal.Will the British political establishment be shrewd enough to recognise Trumps mandate? Its almost certain that the UK now has a pro-British president, said Nigel Farage. Labour must roll out the red carpet.A more final point about Trump 2.0 is that he will be 78 at his inauguration C 159 days older than Biden was when he became Commander-in-Chief in 2021. On the one hand, that could mean that Vance, as vice president, will do much of the executive legwork. On the other, it means Trump doesnt have to govern for re-election. That means he can focus on things that matter in the long term, like debt, says an adviser. This could be Trumps greatest challenge yet.","title":"American titan: inside Donald Trumps remarkable political comeback"},{"text":"LOL... he was so close to figuring this out but still fucking missed by a mile.No one in this country, including Democrats, seem to understand what inflation actually is and why Trump is gonna make it worse, again.Rising prices are a lagging indicator of inflation and a great way to measure it. Inflation, however, is actually devaluation of currency, usually due to increasing the money supply, which Trump did during the pandemic. The only people rampant inflation benefits are those with sizable investments ($10M+) in the stock market or real estate. Everyone else gets diluted. The practical effect of inflation is the transfer of wealth to the richest people. Its been a huge trend since the early 90s that has only widened the wealth gap between the ultra rich and the middle class and it will not end any time soon.There is a reason this billionaire Trump and his billionaire friends love uneducated voters: They will get even richer than before.

It is a decisive victory and even Trumps bitterest enemies should recognise him for what he is: an American titan, the most extraordinary politician of our time. He has just pulled off arguably the biggest comeback in US history C a feat greater even than Richard Nixons Lazarus-like return in 1968.To understand the scale of his victory, recall how weakly he began. On 15 November 2022, when Trump launched his now-triumphant bid to regain the presidency, he did not seem himself. His formal campaign announcement, delivered in the ballroom of his club in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, lacked the zing of his famous entry into the 2016 race, when he floated down the escalator of Trump Tower in New York.The Trump of 2022 had countless legal problems and hed been widely blamed for the Republican partys disappointing performance in the mid-term elections. Republican donors and the right-wing media were lining up behind Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, the coming man. Back then Trump looked disgruntled. I dont like to think of myself as a politician, he said. But I guess thats what I am. I hate that thought. Critics called his performance low-energyC turning one of his favourite insults against him.But the Donald was only ever down, not out. Trump fatigue, as people called it, turned out to be a mirage and the Trump of 2024 is jubilant, albeit exhausted, having accomplished his extraordinary re-election mission. Ill never be doing a rally again, can you believe it, he said in his victory speech, sounding truly sad. But, he added, success is going to bring us together. Whatever else you think of him, it would be hard not to admit that Trump has grit. He has survived eight years of the most brutal political warfare C two impeachments, two assassination attempts, four criminal indictments, endless media ridicule and opprobrium C and emerged victorious again. He has won back the presidency.It was at around 10.30 in Palm Beach on Tuesday night when the mood at the Trump campaigns watch party started to brighten. Nobody wanted to speak too soon, but the crowd began to whoop louder and louder as the good news poured in from Georgia and North Carolina. The Democratic Blue Wall C Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania C took time to fall. But there was a quiet confidence that the Democrats were about to face a great repudiation. Weve delivered for people in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. And [Kamala Harris] hasnt, said Corey Lewandowski, Trumps long-time adviser.In 2016, Trump forged a new working-class coalition to beat Hillary Clinton. That coalition fell short in 2020 so he strengthened it by adding more Latino and African American voters. He became the first politician to engage successfully with the manosphere, the growing group of disgruntled men who feel ignored and alienated by progressive policies. In key swing states, young men leapt on the Trump train. This is karma, ladies and gentlemen, said Dana White, head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, who joined Trumps victory speech. Nobody deserves this more than him.Of course, Trumps enemies wont accept his victory just yet. The results may well be contested, as Democrats indulge in exactly what they accused Trump of four years ago: election denialism. The lawfare against Trump, paused for the election, will be waged anew. But the Republicans will probably have the House of Representatives and the Senate, too, which will limit what the Democrats can do. Theyve kind of shot the bullet when it comes to legal challenges, said a cautiously optimistic Trumpworld insider on Monday, sitting near the heart of power on Capitol Hill. But I guess the question is: how crazy is the left? And the answer is we dont know.The irony is that from last year onwards, the lawfare against Trump turned out to be his political salvation. The deep state really was out to get him. Each of the four criminal indictments against him boosted him in the polls and eased his path towards the Republican nomination. The clever-clever theory among Washington insiders was that the Biden administration felt so confident in its ability to beat Trump that it was happy to let him be the Republican candidate. Well, if that was the ploy, it backfired spectacularly.The 2024 presidential election has proved that political polls cannot divine the future and that the so-called legacy media C print newspapers and most television networks C are increasingly unimportant. The pollsters went to great lengths this year not to underestimate the strength of Trumps movement C so much so that self-appointed experts on both sides of the Atlantic (such as Rory Stewart) argued that most surveys had, in fact, become biased against the Democrats. We were told that the high quality polling, with its ingenious modelling, showed Harris with an edge. The less sophisticated data pointed towards a Trump victory. But once again, polling companies managed to exaggerate the Democratic partys popularity, for the simple reason that Democrat-leaning voters are more likely to respond to surveys than Trump supporters, who regard the polls as suspicious at best.Some will argue that what swung it for Trump was Elon Musks support on Twitter/X, arguably the worlds most influential social media platform. More significant perhaps was the fact that legacy media has lost its credibility and with it, the ability to shape the conversation. Since 2016, journalists have taken it upon themselves to act as the sanctioned opposition to Trumpism. In recent days, major news networks have repeatedly insisted that Trump actually threatened to kill his opponent Liz Cheney at the end of last week. They grossly exaggerated the number of pregnant women dead as a result of abortion bans and lost the trust of ordinary, undecided, voters.The Democratic party and its cheerleaders must ponder a painful question: might Joe Biden, for all his apparent senility, have won? Kamala Harris is more threatening to swing voters than a dead Joe Biden or a comatose Joe Biden, said James Carville, the veteran Democratic strategist, in July. So if Joe has to go, its gonna be Kamala and if its Kamala, its gonna be harder.Biden will go down in history as a failed one-term president. But he was the only Democrat who beat Trump. Harris will blame sexism and racism for her defeat, as she did when her first presidential campaign flamed out in 2019. But even with a billion-dollar war chest this year, she was unable to overcome her glaring flaws. She gave a decent speech at the Democratic National Convention in August and outfoxed Trump in their first C and last C debate. But she fluffed her lines in her biggest interviews and seemed unable to answer difficult questions.She campaigned at times almost exclusively on the emotive topic of abortion and seemed to go out of her way to put off men, especially blue-collar men who tended to prefer Biden to Trump. One of the Democrats late campaign adverts, starring Julia Roberts, encouraged women to lie to their husbands about how they voted because the voting booth is the one place where women still have a right to choose. An odd pitch, to put it mildly.The Democrats all but forgot that they are meant to be the party of the working man. Team Trump made the GOP the party of the forgotten man. Team Harris-Walz spoke more to working-from-home women and affluent college graduates. In other words, the people for whom the system, as Team Trump calls it, works. But a large majority of Americans feel their country is on the wrong track and the system works against them.Harriss campaign message was confused and confusing. Im not Joe Biden, she said. But as vice president, she also had to present herself as the continuity candidate: Bidenism with a fresher face. She posed as a force for moderation against extremes, yet her record as a senator put her far to the left of the American mainstream on culture-war issues.As someone who seemed to have no knowledge of international relations, Harris stuck to the Biden administrations line on Ukraine and Gaza. But voters tended to agree with Trump and his more eloquent vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance: the world seemed safer with Donald in charge.The economy seemed better off, too. In the 2022 mid-terms, anger at Bidenflation and the exorbitant cost of living didnt translate into a sweeping set of victories for the Republicans. But as Trump put it in that downcast campaign launch address: The citizens of our country have not yet realised the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through. They dont quite feel it yet. But I have no doubt that by 2024, [they] will. The results proved his point.An even bigger Democratic mistake was to ignore what has always been Trumps strongest campaign issue: the crisis at Americas southern border. Since Biden took office, more than seven million illegal immigrants have entered the United States.","title":"American titan: inside Donald Trumps remarkable political comeback"},{"text":"Beautiful clean coal.","title":"Put Them in Trauma: Inside a Key MAGA Leaders Plans for a New Trump Agenda"},{"text":"Russia is located in both Europe and Asia.

Although proposals to expand private schooling suffered high-profile defeats in several states, Trumps victory has brought new optimism to advocates of supporting school choice at the federal level. One of their main priorities: tax credits for donations to organizations that provide private school scholarships.\\"\\n\\"Private school choice comprises several ways of using taxpayer money to support education outside of traditional public schools, including vouchers, education savings accounts and tax-credit scholarships. The idea of giving this option to all families regardless of income  known as universal private school choice  has soared in popularity in recent years and is now enshrined in law in a dozen states. Nearly three dozen states have some form of private school choice.\\"\\n\\"Concerns about diverting money from public education appeared to gain traction in deep-red Kentucky and Nebraska. Ferial Pearson, the chair of an organization in Nebraska that advocates for public education, said it would continue working to provide public schools the support and resources they need to thrive.\\"\\n\\"During his campaign, Trump touted school choice as a form of greater parental rights, aimed at countering what conservative critics describe as leftist indoctrination in classrooms and promoting a free-market approach to education.One of his platform pledges is to serve as a champion for Americas homeschool families and to protect the God-given right of every parent to be the steward of their childrens education. He proposes allowing homeschooling families to use 529 college savings plans for spending on their childrens educational expenses, an option he advanced for private-school families during his first term.\\"\\n\\"With a more favorable Congress, those initiatives could have a better shot. U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and the frontrunner to chair the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has supported tax incentives for scholarship donations. And Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he will focus the next Congress on maximizing school choice for parents and holding woke university administrators accountable.\\"\\n\\"In Texas, various pro-voucher legislators endorsed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott won their races. Abbott had sought to unseat GOP legislators whod voted against a plan to subsidize private school tuition with public money. The newly elected candidates could give Abbott the votes needed to pass that voucher legislation.\\"","title":"A push for school choice fell short in Trump's first term.

Studies shows the most wealth comes from inheritance, either through money, connections, education etc. Even starting with nothing you know that you have a security net, you still have connections, you master the words and language of the elite.So a poor person has basically no chance to imitate your success without being incredibly lucky. \\"Try to educate yourself on poverty\\" adressed by a poor to a rich person doesn't come from a position of privilege. It comes from a position of oppression. If you're truthful and are really interested, there are a lot of books on the subject of racism, sexism or homophobia. Why should oppressed minorities be you free teacher? You're argument about the conservative South is non-sensical: I'm positively sure most slave-owners kids sincerely believe black people were inferior and meant to be slaves.Do you believe that recently freed slaves should have tried to educate these kids and that refusing to do so would mean the former slaves were \\"snobs\\" or \\"elitists\\".If you want minorities to talk to you about their struggles, put yourself in a position where they can believe you have a sincere interest. You cannot ask from a woman to teach you how to clean the  bathroom under the pretense you were the golden child as a kid . You cannot ask from a black person to explain to you why the n-word is racist. The very fact you asked your question without first questioning the power dynamics at work between \\"educate yourself\\" and \\"pull up yourself\\" is a strong indicator of an unwillingness to question your worldview and is a synonym of waste of time for most minorities educating you.Also, thinking that educating individual people about racism and sexism somehow helps against racism is also a right wing idea cherished by white male liberals. It's ideological. They believed that racist people are just misled individuals with no political agency. In fact we can observe uneducated people are perfectly able to perceived their gender or racial privilege and cultivate it to gather economical or social advantages.People voted for Brexit because they are simply racist and now they only regret it because their racism was economically detrimental.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Of course.

It started with learning about John Locke's philosophy, and learning more and more about our own history.Basically if you lived in somewhere that education is well funded, and pay attention to facts, even your inherent bias can be overturned because what Republicans say largely disagrees with reality, and with Trump this is more obvious than it has ever been. So the conclusion I've come to is, people who voted Trump or were undecided are most likely lacking so much fundamental information, about how the world and government works, that they cannot see the ways which he is obviously a horrible candidate. It is objectively true that he incited and insurrection and invited Russian influence into our elections and policy, and that alone should've barred him from even running. The only way you can be in disagreement with that is if you reject what is verifiably true. So when people are curt with you saying things like \\"educate yourself\\" it's likely due to the fact that they feel your understanding of reality is so warped they cannot hope to reach you. Essentially if you're not willing to learn, no one can teach you. And it's not that you need to wake up everyday and find the morally correct stance, the correct stance is often obvious, however when complicated issues arise we would live in and infinitely better world if people would take a step out of their own lives to ascertain what's true before coming to conclusions.On the topic of empathy. I saw something recently that explained it very well, and I'll do my best to paraphrase. When one ideology breaks the social contract of tolerance, for example amplifying hatred or harm towards others, then there is no longer a moral obligation to be tolerant towards that ideology. Basically, it's ok to punch Nazis. And even if you're not a Nazi yourself, you're aligning yourself with a political group that is following the same path. People are so frustrated right now because you've had nearly a decade to realize who Trump really is. And the only way you don't by now is because you haven't honestly taken the time to evaluate information about him. Trumps policies are said to cause massive economic disruptions and people are already preparing for it. And you basically just voted to have millions of your neighbors rounded up and deported, as well as potentially endangering the lives of all the women in your life. So I don't think you deserve tolerance if you stand behind these things. Imagine if people had done more to stand up to and oppose Hitler and Nazis in their rise to power, because that really could be what's at stake here, and why would you even play around with that possibility without finding out all the facts? You can't stand behind the marginalization of other human beings and ask for politeness and tolerance. So ask yourself, is that what you stand for? Because if not you may want to find out you really voted for, sooner or later you won't be able to ignore it.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Left leaning myself, lol.

What about meat obtained without fear, pain, or poor living conditions of the animal?

You deciding that the chicken's life matters because you presume its experience is closer to your own and the lettuce's does not because it is different enough is more morally suspect than a meat eater who decides there is not much moral difference between a fox tearing apart a chicken \\"like nature intended\\" vs. it being made into nuggets.

Breeding dogs when we know we don't have the capacity to care for the dogs we already have is needless cruelty. Being willing to raise animals to eat them does not mean that someone needs to support pointless cruelty. Would you ever kill an animal? If not, i don't think you have the right to be eating meat.Basically everyone is willing to and has killed an animal before. Even religious zealots like those monks who tiptoe around trying to avoid killing ants and such are certain to have killed at least one accidentally.

Trump very carefully sowed that field with seeds of doubt. In the extreme scenario of it being verified, Biden could choose to not certify but again with the fields trump has planted that would almost certainly lead to validation of maga even more.Alternatively, when the republicans were crying election fraud, it was just comment sections filled with people having the opinion there was fraud and no stories on a scale like this in the link I gave infact in that same link, there are a lot of users saying we dont need to copy them arguing against it like polar opposite discourse.","title":"Trump Won, So Jim Jordan Is No Longer Worried About Election Fraud"},{"text":"They had 100 days to get their message out to his 4 years.

For these people, a little bit of inflation is good because those assets gaining value over time is what facilitates a comfortable retirement. The problem is that the percentage of people who have those things has shrunk, and is heavily age divided. If you're under 40, you probably don't own a house. You probably don't have a retirement plan, so all inflation is doing is making your life harder. The Democrat messaging to these people was just \\"No, this is good actually.

I saw people struggling and suffering all around me and I simply sat and thought about why it was happening. I didn't go to college until I was 27 years old, so it wasn't access to 'Liberal' ideas in college because my world view was already very well formed by then. I had already written hundreds of songs that are quite specific about what I thought the problem was.none of my friends were anywhere near as political as I was and would often dismiss points that I made mostly out of apathetic indifference. I did have one friend who I had many long conversations with that despite his being confused on about a lot of things really helped me clarify and organize my beliefs.my parents were huge influences on my thinking, and maybe their focus on morality, critical thinking, and anti-racism created the foundation upon which my world view was built. but my politics are quite different from both my parents. my father voted for Trump in 2016 and my mother is a registered independent who thinks that both parties are the same.and maybe having a slightly higher IQ than average played a role.but I worked very hard to come to the understandings that I did. I spent a lot of hours contemplating the way Society worked and everyone's role in it. I saw the ugly parts of my own humanity and imagined what effects that might have on others if I was in positions of of power. and as I figured things out I wrote songs about it so that I would never forget. and anytime I was confronted with information that conflicted with what I already understood and believed, I adjusted my beliefs to better match reality.after looking at the amount of suffering created versus the amount of capital created, and who that Capital typically went to and in what proportions -- I came to the conclusion that the only truly honorable job where you weren't going to be part of the problem was fireman. Then a few years later I found out that if there are two fires at the same time the fire department has to go to the place that's more valuable.and so I have lived a life of poverty out of protest because I refuse to be part of the problem. I think the shareholder system is the best way to spread around the blame so that it's so thin on any one individual that no one can be held accountable, and there is an additive effect where you take in combination the small amount of greed that exists in each investor, which is why so many corporations are doing truly awful things and everyone seems to be okay with it except the people that are directly affected.in my opinion you couldn't have a more perfect system for harnessing Collective greed and dissipating individual accountability. if there is an actual devil, it is his greatest Triumph aside from 'convincing the world he doesn't exist'.I have worked very hard and suffered a great deal not only to come to the conclusions I have but living by them.if this shit was handed to me I would have dropped it like a hot rock a long time ago.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Then why downplay evidence of election fraud?","title":"Donald Trump wins most popular votes by a Republican ever"},{"text":"Its all what his master Putin wants.

My own view has come with time and exposure to the shocking lack of effort people use to learn things.For example: In law school, I met many people who went to law school without googling \\"should I go to law school?\\" They hated law and blamed everyone but themselves for their trajectory. One person reacted to my critique of this lack of reflection as a mark of my privilege. But Google is free. If you make important decisions without *attempting* to educate yourself, you are giving your power away.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"History is written by the winners.

Say someone and I are arguing over why the Earth has seasons. We can simply google it, or go to a library, or look through an encyclopedia or something very quickly, and we both end up knowing more and not needing to argue more. Then lets look at pull yourself up by the bootstraps. This implies that hard work will get you anywhere without the need of other people. Say the scenario is someone is having major financial issues, through maybe a broken bone and has some insane medical bills and not the money to pay it without going far into debt. They don't have the time, money, or ability to learn and get hired fast enough with enough time to make the money needed to pay it off. So while effort can solve some issues, many times it can just end up being pointless without outside help.All in all, educating yourself is feasible and a quick thing to do. Pulling yourself up by the bootstraps can take immense amounts of time that you quite literally do not have, resources and money you don't have, and skills you don't have simply because you didn't go to a school for them or learned them from someone else.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Yep, 100% rigged.","title":"2024 election inconsistencies"},{"text":"It may be narcissistic behavior, but it stems from viewing life (and by proxy, politics) as competition.

Taiwan hosted US nuclear weapons until the 70s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_and_weapons_of_mass_destructionIf the US would like to withdraw military support for Taiwan then they must formally allow Taiwan to either purchase or develop domestic nuclear weapons for its own defense.

This is the problem with an ambiguous stand on Taiwan or playing a shake-down game acting like it's some kind of joke. The stakes are high. If the US refuses to honor its commitments, it has to allow Taiwan to obtain nuclear weapons. Once again, it is the US that is preventing this from happening.

You didnt work for it and no one owes you applause, and youre dead wrong to make villains of people less fortunate.You're conflating a lot of things here.First, basic education -- the more you have the more likely you're liberal, for a bunch of reasons including exposure to differing ideas, different people, knowledge, etc.Second, you don't need formal education to understand things like tariffs are paid by the importer not the seller, or that horse dewormer is not a treatment for a respiratory virus, or that the economy is better under dems, or... these are not things that require lots of formal education. There are often primers put out by news orgs for many, many basic things. When people say 'educate yourself,' ime, they mean this, not 'go get a master's.'Third, they're not universally less fortunate -- they're often willfully ignorant and willfully angry.The people in coal country had a choice. Trump said he was going to bring back all the big, beautiful coal jobs. It'd be booming. Hillary said coal was going the way of the dodo, but she would not forget the coal workers and towns and had a plan to bring in educational options, help with transition, help for the towns.Those areas voted Trump.Then coal did not come back. It died further. The counties fell into economic problems, more people out of work, no industry. It got worse.They voted for Trump by a larger margin.That's not the result of being less fortunate. It doesn't take an economics degree.I am incredibly fortunate and grateful to have been born to well-educated people who prioritized education for their children. Absolutely.It doesn't make me better than anyone. It makes me fucking lucky. Same as being born in a country with clean running water.However, other people born in the same country, even without the benefit of higher education, a liberal area, can, if they so choose, figure out that 'gee, he promised X and that totally and completely didn't happen. Perhaps that was a bad choice.' instead of 'hur hur f the libs.' That doesn't take a ton of education.

I always vote democratic because the Republicans are infected by a theocratic fascist ideology that wants to put more power in the hands of the private sector oligarchy, but the Dems have pissed me off for a decade now by being too fucking soft to do anything hard lined that could be viewed as overreaching. The republicans have painted a picture of the Dems as the party of governmental overreach (even though thats actually what the GOP does in other aspects) and because half the nation is brainwashed to believe that theyre constantly overreaching the Dems are afraid to perform any overreach in a benevolent effort to save the fundamental fabrics of our democratic republic. Theyre too worried about how they will appear in the FALSE reality that the GOP has constructed so they fail to act appropriately in the REAL reality that is separate from the construct the GOP &amp; MAGA has created. This is what I mean by the Dems are too focused on the National Psyop. Theyre basing too many of their actions around the false reality that MAGA has created instead of acting appropriately. We have many new up and coming and some older Dems in the House &amp; Senate that act as they should, with fervor and strength. But too many of the Democratic leadership are weak pussies who wont use the power they wield for benevolent purposes. We need strong leaders who will match the fervor the GOP has introduced. If the Dems are worried about balance then they need to meet the GOPs standards. By not stepping up to bat, and acting moderate too often they actually allow the scales to consistently tip in favor of the GOP because they wont be as tough in the other direction. Democratic leadership MUST match the energy the GOP &amp; MAGA is putting out or else they will get absolutely nowhere and leave the sane thinkers of this country left stranded in a world of chaos and insanity because they werent strong enough to do anything to counteract against them.

The conspiracy is that we are doing just enough to keep them going as we want Russia in this war for as long as possible. It's much more damaging to them to continue fighting a war they think they can win then to just give Ukraine everything and have them pull out, or worse.\\nWe wanted them to invade. We prepared Ukraine for 8 years to take the Donbass and Crimea back. In early 2022, the Ukrainians had achieved strategic criticality for this. If they had been allowed to do this, there would be nothing to legally stop Ukraine from becoming a member of NATO.\\nhttps://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR3000/RR3063/RAND_RR3063.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJgvzt0beJAxXVjYkEHTM7BhcQFnoECA4QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1rdZwYquVo2fJ7KYnfhsSN","title":"Whats going to happen with the massive astroturfing of the Ukraine war now that trump won?"},{"text":"Elon Musk looks like a beached whales impression of Joseph Gordon Levitt","title":"Elon Musk and the GOP already have their knives out for Jack Smith"},{"text":"This is the best Ukraine can hope for.

Would voter support of third party candidates have somehow lead to better candidates?  Who could possibly say for sure?  However, given that voter support of Democratic and Republican candidates does not seem to have an effect on the quality of future candidates, would seem to be evidence against your theory. Ronald Reagan got almost 60 percent of the vote. Did that lead to better Republican candidates in the years since?  Democratic leadership seeing a third party candidate as a potential threat does not necessarily say anything about the candidate. It seemed to me that they were worried not about her being a serious contender, but that she might bleed away just enough votes in swing states to deny Democrats a victory. This did not turn out to be the case, as even if every single voter that chose a third party candidate had chosen Harris, she still would have lost. I have yet to see any evidence that popular support of a party, any party, somehow creates better candidates.  Politicians are not created by popular support. Being popular does not somehow empower them to be better.  Politicians are just like anyone else, theyre shaped by their life experiences. You are exactly right about fear. Many voters, millions probably, dont want to waste their vote in a third party candidate they feel has no chance when their vote for a less palatable candidate might cause them to win over an even worse won. Trump v Biden is a perfect example. However, there is no reason that a particular politician who is normally a third party cant run for president under one of the two primary parties without changing their platform. Bernie Sanders is a great example and he might have won in 2016, but seemed to be sabotaged from the top of the DNC.

I dont think this is necessarily a foreign or domestic issue, or a party one, but a global one. The fact is that people are globally facing economic pressures and that global governments are increasingly unpopular. Historically, wars are a great way to distract a populace and redirect their anger in an unnecessary foreign conflict.I think its reasonable to assume that Iran may want a war to keep its population under the regimes control. However, Id say the same for the US, Europe, and Israel.Both can be true. Iran may be plotting to start the war and assassinating T would be an easy means, as that would make his anti-war/isolationist base much more pro-war. That said, I think there are many western/domestic groups/elements that may also want that, and are concerned with maintaining slipping control.Example - Bin Laden may have done 911, but he was almost certainly a prior CIA asset and Al-Qaeda fought with American weapons. The US population got then pulled into a series of long failed wars that kept the US government totally distracted from fixing domestic issues, and kept the US population distracted, while also keeping the Middle East in a power vacuum that led to todays WW3 setup. So, while 911 was not a direct inside job, I think there are clearly nefarious elements internally that benefited from it.I think the same would be true of this assassination plot issue","title":"Conspiracy thought has turned a lot of the \\"America first\\" crowd anti-American."},{"text":"Have you even studied how fascism takes hold?

And you could not question any of it at all of you were labeled homophobe or sexist or a Nazi. The McCarthy like black balling (canceling) of celebrities. A few people tried to warn the dem party that they were gonna lose socially conservative dems if the loudest message always coming from the camp is just identity politics. I personally watched my Latino neighbors and subs I hire go from dems voting for Hillary, fuck Trump, to voting for Biden because still fuck Trump, but not to happy with the party and switch to Trump. The subcontractors that I use frequently, would hear something on the radio related and would be saying Im tired of all this gay shit they lumped all of LGBTQ just into G. The grew up in religious and more conservative culture. I live in a progressive college town and the Latinos here get along with everyone no issues, gay trans they are chill. I set down with my Latino neighbors like a year so back. I asked why Trump guys he is always trying to deport people and maga is full of racists. It wasnt intolerance or hate. They felt like being a democrat made people associate all of it with them and they were getting labeled and it that bothered their beliefs.","title":"Trump Is the First Republican Presidential Candidate to Win Miami-Dade County Since 1988"},{"text":"What will happen to his felony convictions?
