They don't know who they're dealing with. It'll break the country up like some Yugoslavia shit. If they realize how difficult it is to actually deport millions of people, they might just settle on creating ethnic Bantustans in the U.S. and forcibly move Latinos into them. Like say in Florida they force all the Latinos to live in the Miami area and create a sort of puppet state there. Or in the Southwest, force all the Latinos into a corner of Texas or some shit. You might say they'll just kill us like the Nazis did to the Jews, but the Jews didn't own guns by the millions. We do. Half the Latinos I know own guns. They're playing with fire if they're thinking of going after us just for being Latin.","title":"'This is a realignment': Shattered Democrats grapple with Harris' loss"},{"text":"Im with you my friend","title":"It was nice to see my vote count."},{"text":"Who would the military be rounding up to take to camps?

Note that the last immigration reform happened in 86 under Reagan!\\nThe shares are actually staggering: half of all agricultural workers are here illegally, and IIRC the share is around 1/3 in construction.

We would have to raise wages to ludicrous levels probably.

The House of Representatives is gone. The Senate is gone. The White House will now be run by a traitor to democracy:JD Vance. This nation is going to go into its darkest, and possibly last age. With it will come violence that dons a mask of perverse patriotism, wrapped in the colors of a flag that have faded and stitched together with a necklace bearing a Christian cross, upon which a white Jesus sits. The violence that happens here will not be alone. Many other nations will suffer as the bastion that once kept others at bay, such as Russia, Iran, China and North Korea will instead become their allies. The policies that will dictate this will be mirrored, unless you separate from us. Unfortunately tonight, America has become your enemy. We have whiddled away at our own education, and weaponized fear in concert with plans that were laid out by our own leaders these last seventy years to erode both.  The anger in this nation will likely see violence from those who stood against it. Brother will fight brother, and eventually the ones who are slain will be boasted as traitors and terrorists. And then when the violence from those who are angry does out, because it comes too late, it will continue in secret, out of the representation of media, and will make those in power smile. You must distance yourselves from America. You must be ready to fight this country immediately in the morality, and possibly on the battlefield in twenty years. Do not let what has happened to us happen to you. Save yourselves. And if you voted for Trump: Fuck. You. I hope when you find me, you end it all violently because I am tired.

Because this makes me speculate that the reason our turnout cratered this year but was really high in 2020, matching GOP turnout, might be because Dems only turn out when Trump *is* in power. Meanwhile he's not as scary this cycle because he's not constantly in the news for every harmful thing he does.Taking this theory to 2028, that would mean Dem turnout will be really high while GOP turnout will crater. That is, unless they're able to capture the Trump appeal in a new candidate. I think it's very unlikely such a person makes it through the GOP primary at that point, because there would be no system or swamp to decry but Trump's own.Anyways I know this is massive copium, but if an election really does come down to something as simple as \\"Trump being on the ballot,\\" then I don't think it's hard to imagine such an optimistic scenario in 2028.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 6, 2024"},{"text":"No. All you have to do is look at Twitter and the MSM.

The reverse of that, is that marijuana is legal on a federal level, but states have the right to decide if it's legal or not there. If the US gov't decides that it will no longer classify marijuana as a controlled substance, should it then make it illegal for states to make it illegal? Marijuana isn't a constitutional right, but this analogy implies that we need the federal government to give us the right to smoke marijuana.If states have the power to decide of marijuana should be illegal, because lets say like, Alabama hates pot and the majority of Alabama citizens get together and vote to outlaw it because they're angry, they hate the smell of pot and they hate stoners. Should the federal government then make it illegal for states to make it illegal? Or should all the marijuana users just fight back for their rights to puff it in Alabama?And also if we have a first amendment right, why doesn't the government take action on social media platforms that have selectively silenced any who oppose the current political agenda? Do we beg government do it, or do we just move on and go to a new platform that will give us more freedoms?Honestly, I really don't know the best answer to the abortion subject but I think legalizing it on a local level is the best effort we have to making it eventually fully legal and accepted by more people as time goes on in the same way that marijuana has become legal, because at that point you won't even need federal government involvement in it.","title":"It was nice to see my vote count."},{"text":"I mean voter turnout has been fairly predictable but for some reason in 2020 20 million more people showed up.

No not that one, the other one.The Democratic Party has lost control of both the White House and the Senate. As of this writing it is still unclear which party will secure control of the House of Representatives. Turns out campaigning on the promise of continuing a genocide while courting endorsements from war criminals like Dick Cheney is not a great way to get progressives to vote for you.One interesting point is that Donald Trump appears to have taken the battleground state of Michigan, where Kamala Harris was soundly rejected by the large Arab American population of Dearborn despite their voting overwhelmingly for Biden in 2020. Back in August, Harris famously shushed Muslim anti-genocide protesters at a campaign rally in Michigan by admonishing them with the words Im speaking.Well, whos speaking now?To be clear, this is not a good result. A good result was not possible this election. The warmongering Zionist genocide monster lost, which means the other warmongering Zionist genocide monster won.Donald Trump is still bought and owned by Adelson cash, which means we can expect him to be just as much of a groveling simp for Israel as he was during his first term. The president elect has publicly admitted that when he was president the Zionist plutocrats Sheldon and Miriam Adelson were at the White House probably almost more than anybody asking him to do favors for Israel like moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and acknowledging Israels illegitimate claim to the Golan Heights, which he eagerly did.Trump closed out his campaign tour alongside his former CIA director and secretary of state Mike Pompeo, which should be enough to dash the hopes of even the most naive Trump supporters that US foreign policy is headed in a positive direction in January. As CIA director, Pompeo led a plot to assassinate Julian Assange and cheerfully admitted that we lied, we cheated, we stole at the agency. This odious swamp creature has remained in Trumps good graces for the last eight years, and is reportedly expected to have a position in Trumps cabinet once again.Speaking at a campaign event in Pittsburgh on Monday, Pompeo boasted that he has been called the most loyal cabinet member to Donald J Trump and said that when Trump is re-elected we will take down the ring of fire; we will support our friends in Israel. The ring of fire is think tank speak for Iran and the militias in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Palestine who oppose Israel.So things are probably going to get uglier and uglier. But they were getting uglier and uglier under Biden, and they would have gotten uglier and uglier under Harris as well. Thats just what it looks like when youve got a dying empire fighting to retain planetary control like a cornered animal. You dont get to be the US president unless you are willing and eager to do ugly things.Democrats exaggerate how destructive Trump is relative to their own bloodthirsty psychopath candidates. While we can expect Trump to inflict tyranny and abuse upon Americans, it will be nothing compared to the tyranny and abuse hes going to inflict on people in other countries, and it will be nothing compared to the tyranny and abuse his predecessor has been inflicting on people in other countries. All the histrionic shrieking we see from US liberals about Trump only works inside a western supremacist worldview that does not see the victims of US warmongering as fully human, and therefore sees scorched earth genocidal atrocities as less significant than comparatively minor abuses concerning US domestic policy.Abandon hope that any positive changes will come from this election result.Abandon hope that Trump will do good things.Abandon hope that Democrats will learn any lessons from this loss.Abandon hope that liberals will suddenly remember that genocide is bad and start protesting against the US-backed slaughter in Gaza.Abandon hope in US election results, period.US elections do not yield positive results. They are not designed to benefit ordinary human beings.Nothing changes for those of us who are dedicated to fighting against the abuses of the US empire. It will be the same fight after January 20 as it was on January 19. We fight on.","title":"The Democratic Party has lost control of both the White House and the Senate.

As for abortion, Trump literally took it completely out of the partys platform. He officially has no stance on it and hast stated that hed veto a nationwide abortion ban on the federal level. It is up to each state to decide what they will do. Look at Missouri as an example.

The Democratic Party hasn't had a competitive primary since 2008. The Democrats nominated Hillary in 2016 because it was \\"her turn\\" and without a competitive primary. She lost, leading to Roe being overturned, and a whole lot more. The Democrats were *sure* she was going to win in 2016. Why? She didnt. They were *sure* Harris was going to win this time. She didnt. How can they be this oblivious? They botched this whole 2024 process (or lack thereof) with someone who was the first to drop out in 2020. And so, in every single metric, Harris did worse than Hillary Clinton. And the Democrats had a good message over the summer, about the economy, but dropped it to focus on things that are misunderstood or are abstractions to most voters. \\"Fascism\\" and \\"democracy on the ballot.\\" While most voters are saying, \\"why are eggs so expensive?\\" Harris dropped all that good summer stuff about affordable rent, college, gas and power bills, corporate responsibility, minimum wage. Just poof. Exit polls in swing states showed that Biden had a 60% disapproval rate there. Harris did nothing to distance herself from him or his record (even for political reasons).The Democratic Party thinks it's a majority party, but it's not. America is high school. The Democrats are the theater kids, the AV club, the chess team, debate team, the kids taking AP classes, Tracy Flick and Mark Ratner. The Republican (voters) are the kids taking regular classes, playing sports, fixing cars, having keggers, Stacy and Brad Hamilton. The \\"regular kids\\" aren't going to follow the theater kids, unless someone comes along with super charisma like Bill Clinton or Obama. *And* speaks about the economy. It's always the economy. People throw names around like \\"socialist\\" and \\"fascist\\" but it's always the economy. Trump supporters, 49% said that the economy was their #1 issue. For Harris voters it was 12%. Almost everyone who was worried about the economy voted for Trump. Because nobody knew who Harris was or what she was going to do (a) differently than Biden, and (b) to help.Clinton won in 1992 on the economy (and hope), then Obama in 2008 on the economy (and hope). Mondale in 1984 ran on [some of the right things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j62LweomMEM) but Reagan had god-tier popularity. , [Dukakis in 1988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVZVyv_h6M0) was about working people and healthcare. Gore in 2000 [ran on military strength](https://www.c-span.org/classroom/document/?17267) which was still something the Democrats felt they were losing on. Kerry in 2004, similarly, ran on a douche chill \\"I served, let me take over this war\\" platform. I can't even remember was Hillary ran on, other than \\"Trump bad.\\" You can't get elected president as a (D) by saying the (R) is bad but not offering anything. The other way around? Sometimes. That brings us to 2024.Abortion is incredibly important, but it's not something that most Americans (including, we discovered, most women) care about enough to swing things. Abortion is a \\"tomorrow problem\\" for voters. Maybe it'll be a problem for them in the future. The economy is a problem for them now.This was so botched.

I mean, with how promising exit polling seemed, and all those Russian bomb threats, it's not inconceivable that there's something awry, right?

BUT Israel and America ties is a messy complicated issue and I dont expect a radical policy change so soon or at least during a presidential race. \\nConsidering how either left or right was most likely going to give weapons to Israel and be lenient on their actions I voted for the left bc 1) as a queer person who has sisters and nieces, loved ones ect of multiple backgrounds their well being is a priority for me. Even if it was so personal I will vote to protect the rights and well being of my own countrymen first bc its impossible to have ur cake and eat it to when it comes to protecting everyone or many at risk groups/peoples in the world. Hell the US maybe barely does it for themselves and 2) the left wont be as bad as the right on the the Palestine Israel issue which is something when having to make a choice between 2 things and 3) any perceived improved economic or social status from either not voting left or voting right is just wrong  and even if they were to improve my economic status is not worth compromising point #1. But if it is worth it for some people I have nothing to say to them. Back to Israel Palestine which is showing to be a really big issue for voters. It sucks to be in that choice or which one if both are gonna support weapons and administration that kill children but thats how the 2 party system works right now. I want more diverse and progressive candidates but I believe that starts with local, state and then rep/senate voting choices. But its a long slow road to getting that in a presidential race and not compromising on that single political office is short sighted in my opinion. So yes its very far from ideal but no matter what which administration won its likely there will be more dead children and innocent people but I can still vote for an administration that will be better for its own people and hopefully better for those in other countries.","title":"Voters begged the Democrats to listen to them.

Here are some potential reforms:1. Increase Transparency and Accountability\\t?\\tPublic Financial Disclosures: Require more detailed, accessible financial disclosures on how DNC funds are raised and spent, including campaign contributions and vendor payments.\\n\\t?\\tClearer Decision-Making Processes: Make decision-making processes, such as primary debate rules or candidate support, transparent and subject to clear guidelines that are publicly available.\\n\\t?\\tEnhanced Oversight: Establish an independent ethics and oversight board to investigate conflicts of interest and hold DNC officials accountable.2. Promote Democratic and Inclusive Representation\\t?\\tDecentralize Power: Reduce the power of top leadership to make unilateral decisions. Empower state and local party chapters to have more influence in decision-making, especially in setting primary rules and selecting candidates.\\n\\t?\\tSuperdelegate Reform: Limit or eliminate the role of superdelegates (unpledged delegates) who have disproportionate influence over candidate selection, giving more power to pledged delegates chosen by voters.\\n\\t?\\tDiverse Representation: Ensure that DNC leadership reflects the diversity of the partys base, including more representatives from underrepresented communities and younger voices.3. Modernize Primary and Caucus Systems\\t?\\tStandardize and Simplify Voting Procedures: Standardize the primary and caucus processes across states to reduce voter confusion and streamline the delegate allocation process.\\n\\t?\\tIncreased Accessibility: Encourage vote-by-mail options, early voting, and same-day voter registration to make primaries more accessible to all voters.\\n\\t?\\tReduce Influence of Wealthy Donors: Reduce reliance on high-dollar fundraisers and corporate PAC donations, and prioritize small-dollar fundraising to better reflect the grassroots base of the party.4. Strengthen Grassroots Engagement and Empowerment\\t?\\tInvest in Local Organizing: Dedicate more funding and resources to grassroots organizing at the local and state levels, ensuring that the DNC is consistently engaged with voters outside of election cycles.\\n\\t?\\tCreate Platforms for Policy Input: Develop mechanisms for regular feedback from party members and activists, such as open forums, town halls, and digital platforms where members can submit policy ideas and proposals.\\n\\t?\\tEmpower Volunteers and Small Donors: Recognize and reward the contributions of small-dollar donors and grassroots volunteers, making sure they have a voice and feel included in the decision-making process.5. Foster Internal Democracy and Party Unity\\t?\\tEncourage Internal Debates and Open Forums: Allow more space for debate within the party, avoiding a top-down approach where dissenting voices are discouraged. This can be done through regional meetings, issue-based caucuses, and a stronger national convention.\\n\\t?\\tBuild a Clear, Cohesive Platform: Establish a clear, unified platform that reflects the partys core values and policies, with input from all wings of the party. This can help bridge gaps between moderates and progressives and present a unified message to voters.6. Adopt Modern Campaigning Techniques and Data Practices\\t?\\tEmphasize Data and Technology: Invest in data science, digital engagement, and innovative campaigning techniques, equipping local chapters with tools for voter outreach and engagement.\\n\\t?\\tProtect Digital Privacy and Security: Ensure robust cybersecurity measures to protect voter data and prevent interference in digital campaigning.7. Implement Term Limits and Leadership Rotations\\t?\\tRegular Leadership Changes: Introduce term limits or rotation policies for DNC leadership positions, allowing for fresh perspectives and preventing stagnation in the leadership.\\n\\t?\\tEncourage Young Leadership: Create opportunities for younger leaders and activists to rise through the ranks and contribute new ideas.8. Increase Voter Engagement Through Policy-Driven Initiatives\\t?\\tFocus on Core Policy Issues: Emphasize policy-driven initiatives that directly address the concerns of voters, such as healthcare, climate change, economic equality, and social justice.\\n\\t?\\tDevelop Community Programs: Launch community programs on important issues, allowing voters to see the DNCs commitment to real, impactful change in their daily lives.This kind of reform would be ambitious and complex but could make the DNC more democratic, more effective in addressing the needs of its base, and more capable of inspiring voter enthusiasm.","title":"Sanders Slams 'Big Money Interests' and Consultants That Control Democratic Party After Loss to Trump | Common Dreams"},{"text":"Youre not recognizing by what means.

Gen Z, and especially Gen X males broke for Trump in a big way. (I feel personally ashamed of that as I am Gen X.)  I could make a solid argument that Biden was not the best candidate to get Trump out of office, but everybody knew we would need to run a white male.

I think the roots of a lot of this perception go far back - to at least the 60s and 70s. Plenty of guys I served with in the military during the height of the post 9/11 days and early OIF days continued to associate Democrats with being anti-war hippies and Jane Fonda. Hell, in 2004, I recall someone in my command refusing to use Heinz ketchup because of Kerry's wife. So this shit has been happening long before the social mediasphere amplified it.And unfortunately, the Dems did not wrap itself around the flag the way the GOP did in the 2000s. IMO, that was when the modern political split/polarization really grew and divided the country - and it's been an uphill battle for the Dems to talk about loving the country when people automatically associate them with not loving the country, however true or false that may be. A lot of people simply do not believe Democrats love this country, and that immediately puts you at a disadvantage.One of the big things for the Dems, IMO, is that they absolutely lack a strong set of core values to unify around. Yeah, yeah, big tent coalition and all that makes it hard. But throughout the 20th century, the Dems built coalitions around certain core values while agreeing to ignore the less savory parts of the coalitions, e.g., racist Democrats in the South were welcome if they voted for the New Deal. Hell, Democrats were at the forefront of fighting communism (Truman with Korea, JFK and LBJ with Vietnam), so it was hard to argue against Democrats not caring about the US and democracy and capitalism and all that. IMO, the best bet foot forward for the Dems is to find and amplify those members that are the exactly opposite of how people perceive Dems in order to down out the insane internet twitter idiots. People like Mark Kelly, Ruben Gallego, etc. are great examples of Dem officials that can be called anything but radical leftists.

Too many of the close call primaries, some as few as a couple of hundred votes always seemed to go Hillarys way. I think Bernie, won the first couple of states and then Schultz started putting her finger on the scales. Bernie polled better and they also showed that he would beat Trump in the general. But Hillary was ordained. It was her turn and she and Bill made sure that Schultz got to head up the DNC. At the convention they did everything to stymie Bernie - speaking times at unfavourable times etc. of course she got to run but it wa obvious to everyone but her and her husband that she was not the best candidate but Hillary was chosen any way. That must have been a bitter pill for Bernie to swallow but the mark of the man was that he campaigned as hard for her as he would have for himself. After the election she had some character defining (for her) choice words to say about Bernie showing in the primary being a major reason why she lost.

If you're old enough to remember Occupy Wall Street in 2011, I'd think you're old enough to remember the last months of the W. Bush presidency of 2008 and just how unpopular it was.You're in for a few unpleasant surprises if you're optimistic about a presidency, Congress, and Supreme Court that are under the control of Republicans. They're guaranteed to get fully righteous with their entitlement to power and empire, skyrocketing the national debt while waging world wars.I know it's become a thing to claim Trump didn't start any new wars, but he brags about assassinating Iran's top General, Suleimani. The whole point of something like that is to start a war. We can all see now that the Iranians have been very patient with the Israelis, putting up with quite a lot while avoiding war. I've found that this is because Iran's economy is growing and its technological capabilities are increasing and improving whereas Israel's professionals are steadily leaving Israel, and the U.S. military capabilities in the Middle East are decreasing due to age and wear. Israel's Iron Dome isn't working as advertised, as Hezbhollah has been steadily wearing it down, using drones and rockets against radar and whatever other sensors and detectors it has in the north, and one day Hezbollah flew a drone over a major Israeli port and uploaded it for the public to view.The U.S. needs to get a war going against Iran ASAP because the longer this is put off, the more advantageous it is to Iran. J.D. Vance likes to talk tough about how much he'll bomb Iran if ever given the chance. Trump says similar.Trump's is best buddies with Mike Pompeo, one of America's most notorious deep state intelligence operatives and a neocon. Trump's putting him in as top advisor, which indicates a Bush-like, neocon foreign policy. This means a major war in the middle east, and we know Iran is a main target.Trump already bragged in his previous administration that he ordered U.S. soldiers to remain in Syria \\"to protect the oil fields\\". Trump was in a low-intensity war with Russia over Syria, as was Obama, as Russia saved the Syrian government from annihilation by the ISIS/Al-Qaida alliance that the U.S. was backing. We still back these right wingers of the Middle East, and still plan on using them some more. Though thanks to Iran's General Suleimani, those right wing Sunni's were mostly wiped out, which is why Trump had him assassinated.Trump and Vance are going to have to defend the southeast Syran oil fields from the Syrian/Russian militaries which are going to try to get them back at some point. I'm guessing over the next 4 years, but who knows when. If the U.S. goes to war with Iran, this means ending the war in Ukraine first to focus on the Middle East. And this is what Trump and Vance are claiming to prioritize. They'll start out their administration with euphoric, utopian talk of \\"peace in Eastern Europe\\", and our media will celebrate this, and all the Trump supporters will use this as proof of what peacemakers Trump and Vance are. But it won't be long before they then start bombarding the media with reasons to be afraid of Iranians, who are trying to be \\"The Next Hitler\\" by trying to conquer the whole Middle East and that America needs to wage a major war there to protect humanity from The Iranian Hitler. Trump and Vance are eager to show how tough they are on foreign policy, and all the Trump fans will be managed by the usual Ivy League mind managers who are really good at being \\"authentic\\", and this means really \\"relatable memes\\" about how tough our 2 executive branch leaders are against The Iranian Hitler.Of course, Trump and Vance are going to have to skyrocket the national debt to fund the whole thing. They also want to go to war with China over Taiwan. The Chinese have already said they're certain they're going to war with the U.S. over Taiwan, and have been working the past year or more, re-configuring their whole society for a war with the United States. That's what all the talk in the economic news is about China having economic problems. It's not really suffering due to communism like they say, but re-configuring for domestic production instead of exports to the United States, as they knew the U.S. would eventually block trade with China in anticipation of the war over Taiwan.With these wars that the Trump admin is required to wage, this means massive control over the media and social media. Trump in his first administration already told us about \\"Chinagate\\" and how the Chinese are manipulating our public discourse, spreading fake news, and that Trump's fans need to be policing the Interent to crush any dissenting views regarding his wars, on Reddit, X, and everywhere else.Plus Trump and Vance inform us that Iran is also meddling in our Internet discourse, so you all need to be ganging up on and pummel out of existence anyone who seems to talk like Americans on the Internet but is too critical of Trump's war politices.Sorry to burst your bubble, but this next Trump admin is just more of the same, but worse because the U.S. capitalist establishment always prefers Republicans, and now it has everything it wants, which means the capitalists are going onto the offensive BIG TIME!This is what's coming. I know it. It's going to start out about a happy peace with Ukraine and Russia, then descend into right wing capitalist madness, as always. Though the Russians via Medvedev on Twitter/X a few months suggested Putin has particular reservations when it comes to any possible peace deal, and Trump's ideas might not be adequate. So Trump/Vance might not even actually get out of Ukraine. Mike Pompeo in the top White House position guarantees neocon influence, which means permanent war against Russia.So then we'll just be bogged down in the current situation, but with Trump and Vance telling us to suppress freedom of speech to protect us from Iranians, Chinese, and North Koreans, who are spreading fake news and disinformation on Reddit and Twitter/X.","title":"I'm a right wing populist trump supporter, and I want to meet you guys where you're at to find a way to move forward together for a better future"},{"text":"The problem is that they arent letting you pick.

These acts are insurrection against the Constitution according to a plain reading of both Amendment XIV of the Constitution and of the words of the people who **wrote** the damn thing, and they are also insurrection and sedition according to the United States Code paragraphs 2383 and 2384.  No presidential candidate has committed actions even remotely resembling this since a very similar set of events took place in the 1860 presidential election.Yet, given all that, Trump was not disqualified from holding office as Amendment XIV requires.So, no, the Constitution does not protect us because our legal and political systems betrayed their responsibilities to the highest law of this nation and to us, the citizens.Your exhortation to stop \\"misusing words\\" is going to fall on deaf ears when you can't cope and contend with basic reality as I laid out above.EDIT: fixed wording","title":"Obamas congratulate Trump, urge good faith and grace"},{"text":"Don't worry, I'm very aware and will have zero sympathy when Trump comes for them?","title":"Team Biden vs Team Harris: Democrats reckon with what doomed the 100-day campaign from the start"},{"text":"It wasnt the party, it was the voters.","title":"If you didn't vote, or voted 3rd party, in protest - IT DIDN'T WORK.

If your extended family is from a ranch or a small town in Mexico, the above from OP is all true. If you're from a big city, it's not like that in my view. We're from Leon, my parents were hardcore PAN people for economic opportunity but turned very liberal once they immigrated to the US. We were actively pushed to pursue an education, further ourselves ahead and actively pushed out of the house to experience the world because that's what they were told to do in order to survive and experienceda life themselves.My dad was youngest of 13 and my mom was 2nd oldest of 12. They abhorred the traditional \\"family values\\" they were told they had to conform to so they just came here in their 20s. We laugh because my dad is probably the biggest feminist we know and my mom is the biggest misogynist we know. My dad says everybody is equal in our household so we all learned to do everything (including cooking) and my mom says women are useless and to not take care of one so we shouldn't have to rely on one to survive (her brothers are useless because she was their caretaker growing up) so she taught us how to cook and clean. I fight a lot with my wife's family because they're from a small inbred ranch (literally) that even in 2024 doesn't have paved roads or central plumbing. My wife and her sister are the first women in their entire city to work. And my mother in law still thinks my wife shouldn't be working (despite my wife easily making $80-100/hr) because \\"it's not right.\\" I grew up watching all the women around me working and holding down a household (with my dad's help) so it's what I expected out of my partner too. Like to me, taking care of someone who isn't a kid is a non starter, just never an option because that's not how I was raised. So even from my experience, a lot of conversations I have with people my age (30s) in our surroundings, it's fucking wild that people still want that \\"traditional lifestyle\\" and yearn for it in a word with so much freedom to do stuff.

She performed well at her convention and sole debate, the two events for which she had ample preparation time. But she offered no big-picture rationale for running and no real answer for how shed substantively break from the status quo. It was turn the page and platitudinous variations on Americans having more in common than not and Trump being a low character.This is not to dismiss her challenge: there are, sadly, no small number of voters who were uneasy with her because shes a woman, Black or both.Yet since her first years in elected office, Harris has been cautious to a fault. And here she was once again, at a moment that demanded risk. As with other steps of her career, Harris was best when working from a script and unsteady when forced to speak extemporaneously. Faced with deep structural challenges  the unpopularity of incumbents worldwide and a multi-racial, working-class realignment at home  she was badly outmatched. Talking about Trumps enemies list and her to-do list was, in hindsight, laughably short of the moment.She may have done the best she could. As one person close to her told me Wednesday, there was no example of her privately confronting Biden on immigration or the Middle East. Claiming any real break with him wouldve had to have effectively been invented.And here again is where Biden must shoulder some of the blame. He picked somebody who had been senator for two years before running for the White House. Her only political grounding was in deep-blue California and a race-to-the-left presidential primary; she had never spent significant time campaigning for votes in Green Bay or Saginaw. And beyond criminal justice issues, she had no real policy expertise.Upon entering the White House, she was given a thankless assignment (immigration) and otherwise nudged to handle Democratic constituencies. She clashed with the West Wing, some denizens of which had little faith in her, and quickly burned through staff before finally stabilizing her office.Needless to say, Harris was never sent to a VFW convention or Farm Bureau gathering. Then, basically overnight, she had to introduce herself in the Midwest, a region she knew largely from what was in her briefing binder. Of course, her grasp of the Mideast also was largely derived from her briefing papers.It was all a high-wire act.","title":"Team Biden vs Team Harris: Democrats reckon with what doomed the 100-day campaign from the start"},{"text":"Cuba or Venezuela.

And the Harris defenders believe Bidens undeniably at fault for creating the forbidding political environment she proved unable to overcome.The early-hours recriminations, though, only highlight the denialism of both factions in the wake of what will be the first GOP popular vote victory in two decades. This failure has many fathers.First, it was the height of irresponsibility for Biden to insist on running for reelection in his 82nd year. It was also an abdication of leadership by his advisers and elected Democrats to never even question his determination to seek a second term until he forced their hand with a catastrophic debate performance. You know what ad would have replaced the trans surgery spot, had Biden not quit? An endless loop of his unintelligible answers at that debate.Its also rich of the presidents loyalists to criticize someone who was only the nominee because then-candidate Biden made her his running mate in 2020. He revived Harriss career after her flop of a primary bid, kept her on the ticket this year despite her low approval ratings and then crowned her within minutes of dropping out of the race in July. With the Democrats next-generation talent on deck, Harris would never have been a competitive candidate for her partys nomination had Biden not made her vice president in the first place.At the same time, how can Harriss defenders grumble about being dragged down by Biden when she could not find one substantive policy issue on which to break from the unpopular incumbent? She waited three months, blurted out on The View that she couldnt think of any difference with Biden and then eventually settled on vowing not to be a continuation of the current administration.Yes, she was pressed into difficult circumstances, but where was the daring? There was no full-throated attempt at defensive politics and reassuring the country shed govern from the center and reject extremists in both parties. And exit polls suggest that she paid a price for that with independent voters. If the other side assails you as a liberal without any clear and sustained response, well, voters will believe the attacks.

Hitler and the Nazis blamed the fire on communists, stirring fear of a potential uprising. This led to the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended civil liberties, allowing the government to arrest political opponents and curb freedom of the press and assembly.Soon after, Hitler pushed for the Enabling Act, which gave his government the authority to enact laws without the Reichstag's approval. For this, he needed a two-thirds majority in parliament, which he secured through intimidation, political deals, and by banning or arresting many opposition members. Once passed, the Enabling Act effectively made Hitler a dictator, as he could bypass legislative processes entirely.With the Enabling Act in place, Hitler moved swiftly to eliminate other political parties. By mid-1933, the Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany, and all other political organizations were banned. This ensured that no opposition could legally organize or challenge Nazi rule.","title":"First President 2028 Odds ReleasedMichelle Obama vs JD Vance?"},{"text":"At the end of the day, it signifies a disrespect for women and men, and our children.

Today, there is no they, only we. We cling to that illusion of division like its the last life raft, pretending were not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Arent we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, The war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it. (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). Its hard to pretend were separate when were all in the same sinking boat.At some point, we sold our future for pocket changesacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like weve won. And yet, most dont see how deep Project 2025 and those innocent tariffs will cut into their lives. Weve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, were too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, We are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice. (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.If this is MAGAs promised land, then surebring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me thats about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can save the economy while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorablelike watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means theyre invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, Markets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional. (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).When the reckoning comes, at least well have the privilege of saying, we told you so. Not that itll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though theyve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame the others when theyre the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacleif it werent so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, Blaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess. (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).This countrys moral compass is so broken, its practically a modern art piece. Were hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned itevery dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, The problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up. (Zinn, A Peoples History of the United States, 1980).  ?","title":"\\"While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign\\": Kamala Harris gives her concession speech"},{"text":"The only way to break the cult is to have their leader break them.

They win then immediately let off the gas for the next election and pursue their little pet agendas, assuming that their changes will be rewarded electorally next time.

Why punish Palestinians for the crimes of Europe? the actual deals with the UNOk so we agree it's colonialism.

He explains that it would only work in a country where Jewish immigration was definitely legal, and would fail if Jewish immigration were made illegal.Yes, great context.

And he described what he meant as a plan to acquire land and jobs and specifically squeeze out the natives so they get desperate and then Zionist find work for palestinians in other countries so they leave and ethnically cleanse themselves.

Sanders: \\"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\\"He's right, of course, but it didn't happen in a vacuum.The Democrats were the party of the working class from 1933 till 1984. They dominated elections for 50 years running on the New Deal until the GOP found the opening it needed during the civil rights movement. That was just the wedge issue the GOP needed to start carving up the working class. Southern Dixiecrats fled into the open arms of the GOP. Right to work laws diminished unions. The GOP increasingly used social wedge issues such as abortion to carve up the Democratic working class base. Walter Mondale (1984) was the last New Deal democrat. As things got worse for the working class, the GOP used AM talk radio and Fox News to blame anyone but the GOP politicians the working class was increasingly voting for.Starved of voters and funding, and no longer needing to appeal to a socially conservative base, the Democratic party pivoted from the New Deal to so-called New Democrats (Clinton) which constructed a coalition from socially liberal but economically conservative wealthy urbanites, plus Black voters who were loyal to Democrats for advancing civil rights, and a traditional but shrinking union working base.Under Clinton, the party got too far in bed with corporate America. It would continue to sell out the working class, hoping to make it up for it with more urbanites and voters of color who while not naturally Democrats for social reasons, didn't feel at home in the GOP.But the Democrats would continue to hemorrhage white working class voters as it adopted trade, economic, and social policies that benefited capitalists more than they benefited labor.Obama started to turn some of that around, but was saddled with an imploding economy and an Iraq War that he inherited from terrible GOP policies. The Obama administration also didn't address the anger in the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements. So we got Trump in 2016.Biden was a real return to the Democrats' traditional support for pro-labor policies, but it was too little too late. There were obviously issues of age, and many other missteps made by the Democrats.And here we are at Trump v2. People are _angry_. But Trump and the GOP will not bring them the relief they seek. The GOP does not represent labor. Never has, never will.So yes, the Democratic Party abandoned the working class, but that was only after the working class started to abandon the Democratic Party.I don't know how we find our way back, but I really hope this is our bottom.","title":"Sanders: Democratic Party has abandoned working class people"},{"text":"As a European, Bernie Sanders has always seemed to be only sensible, pro-worker choice.
