In that time, she racked up the kind of record I'd expect from a Dem; Americans for Prosperity (Koch Industries) gave her an F, while Progress Florida gave her an A (90%).  She voted exactly as you'd expect a standard Dem to.My take, at a glance: She didn't win by much in 2022 in what used to be a very blue district, and she was uncontested in 2024 while the district really moved right again.  I think she's just a coward who values her job more than her principles.  Or she got some nice bribe money, the Florida GOP is usually good for that.But the point is, while you should do your research, it's not always obvious.  I remember Tricia Cotham giving a passionate speech about her abortion...and then, years later, switching parties and *immediately* voting for an abortion ban over Roy Cooper's veto.

The real threat is the idea that we can't trust any Democrat because 'what if they switch parties?'  An idea I'm already seeing injected into the discourse.Here's why: * We have 435 House reps.  One of them, Jeff van Drew, was elected as a Dem and switched to the GOP.* We have 100 Senators.  None of them switched from Dem to GOP.  Even the Independents still caucused as Dems and voted the same way they did before, or were always Independents who caucused with Dems.* Across the country, we have over 7,000 elected State Reps and Senators.  Over the last few years, we had *four* elected Dems flip to the GOP.  Tricia Cotham in NC (defeated next election), Meisha Mainor in GA (defeated next election), and these two ding-dongs (top of the target list in Florida in 2026).  Most of the conservative Dems from the South who already had essentially Republican beliefs have already made the switch.The point is: *Most Dems can be trusted to remain Dems.*  That includes moderates, progressives, and folks on either side of your pet issue.  The real danger is deciding, for sketchy reasons, that a Dem is *totally* going to flip and not voting for them.  Then you get a Republican for sure.The danger isn't another Republican in the FL Legislature who we're going to boot out in 2026.  It's the effect it has on people's willingness to show up and work.

Along comes Clinton and his ilk with a way to win, by shifting rightward on a few issues while still advancing left policy in others. This sparks a backlash on the left who thinks he's not left enough, leading to Nader, which gives us GW Bush. Bush fucks things up, Obama comes in and establishing the pattern we're seemingly stuck in, which is:\\\\-Democrats get elected, push for better policies, but don't do so aggressively enough to satisfy the left.\\\\-The Right wins the next election, because left/progressive voters stay home, and proceeds to fuck things up royally.\\\\-Democrats win control back, and we're back to step one.The left argues that Democrats need to move more aggressively, but the problem is that has yet to be proven accurate at the voting booth. We've seen time and again them make attempts to improve things, only for the public to turn around and respond by giving the Right control again. It's utterly foolish on several levels, one being because it just reinforces the notion that the public doesn't like progressive policy, not to mention the damage being done by the Republicans in the meantime, especially to vulnerable people.Asking for a sudden hallelujah moment where the Democrats suddenly have the power to pass the entire progressive agenda just isn't going to fucking happen. Even FDR with his massive post-depression landslide and supermajority couldn't pass his entire agenda. And quite personally, I'd rather us NOT have to go through another Great Depression equivalent hellscape in order to get to that.The answer is bleedingly obvious too, but people don't like it because it means sometimes you have to vote for the lesser evil. That is, you vote relentlessly for the leftmost viable candidate in every primary and general election, WHOEVER THAT IS. If someone turns out to be a shitbag, like Sinema or now Fetterman for instance, fucking primary them. But staying home in the general election? No, fuck no. That's how we lost the Supreme Court (due to Republicans taking the Senate in 2014 because left/progressive voters stayed home), not to mention so many other elections since, and thus ended up putting us on the road we're now on.","title":"Democratic strategist calls for new generation of leaders as party plots response to Trumps victory"},{"text":"By culture, does Vivek mean *willing to take lower wages* ?","title":"Conservatives are calling for Vivek Ramaswamy to be arrested and tried for treason"},{"text":"Waiting for them to finish each other off","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 27, 2024"},{"text":"I called it a few weeks ago.

The West simply doesn't want Russia to exist as a nation that works in the best interests of ordinary Russians and put Russia in an existential position.Also, if Russia were looting Ukraine, as you dishonestly claim, why doesn't Ukraine have a huge exports of energy before 2022 from Ukraine to Russia? Hint: Before the conflict and even during the conflict, Russia was exporting energy to Ukraine. As I noted, Russia was in the 1990s being looted by the West. Europe is still reliant on Russia, although since Putin has taken over, forced to pay the Russians fairer (though still favorable to Europe) prices. By contrast, to prove my point, we can see the Europeans were reliant on Russian resources and now that they have stupidly sanctioned themselves, Germany is deindustralizing, while Europeans as a whole see huge increases to living costs as a result of their increased energy costs.","title":"Musks rise is symptomatic of our neo-feudal capitalist times | Trumps billionaire boys club has parallels in other supposedly liberal democracies around the world."},{"text":"What was it Dems and their leftist allies in the media called it when Trump said the same thing about blocking Biden after an extremely flawed and suspect election?

Religious conservatives raise the population/populists. Wealthy Democrats who have fewer children seek to replicate their elite by leaving their inheritances to just a few, while wealthy religious Republicans dilute their wealth over the generations, turning their young into populists because of their modest financial resources and the pressing need to earn money.Wealthy Democrats want communism in order to enslave the masses to the woke corporations that they control, while wealthy Republicans want something closer to the status quo. However, the offspring of wealthy Republicans end up becoming populists, even though Democrats try to lure these offspring away using the education system. Neither populist or religious conservatives support this repurposing of the education system.Democrats are more afraid of people aligned by religion than by race, because they know that racial alignment is weaker and more prone to fail. That is part of why they hate religious Americans so much. They want to force an alignment by race instead of by religion. Another part of it is the geopolitical consideration. Democrats, being the ones who control things more in recent decades, feel the responsibility for managing global politics. They, representing the centuries-old concern of Americans, are worried that a more-united Eurasia will do bad things in North America just like with what happened hundreds of years ago. Back when the Soviets were atheist Communists, they had to keep Europe Christian so they would not be willing to align with them. But now they afraid of what will happens if Europe and Russia consolidate an alliance due to their shared Christianity.Democrats are afraid that a revival of conservative Christianity in the United States will inevitably spread to Europe, causing them to align with Russia, furthering Eurasian consolidation. So instead they create wokeism and try to infect Europe with its weirdness so Europe will be too weird to align with anything else in the Eastern Hemisphere.","title":"Religious Right or Populist Right: Comparing These Two Coalitions, Which Has Greater Influence on Republican Presidents, Republican U.S. Senators &amp; Representatives, Republican State Executives &amp; Legislators, and Republican Party Officials?"},{"text":"You unskilled and unreliable American workers.

If she had 'announced an immediate retirement due to health' around then, or even sometime later, I think the seat would have just sat empty until January anyway. Too close to the regular election to set up a special one (depends on how the Texas law on special elections reads, but that's likely -- most states don't refill a term with under 6 months remaining.)People don't realize how often a few seats in the House sit empty for a bit, when a rep dies, or resigns to take a position in the Administration, or just resigns to go back to the private sector (sometimes that's innocent, sometimes it's avoiding a pending ethics investigation or something), or actually gets expelled (rare, but 'George Santos.') Special elections do usually fill the seats within a few months, but around the regular election time, sometimes they just sit empty until the next session of Congress is sworn in.[https://clerk.house.gov/Members/ViewVacancies](https://clerk.house.gov/Members/ViewVacancies)Matt Gaetz's seat is empty just now, as well as a few others.","title":"Case of missing congresswoman sparks uncomfortable conversation | \\nRepublican Rep.

With so many looming convictions, I'm sure he planned on cheating to ensure victory.  He had the backing of super billionaire Elon Musk who literally wore a black hat and claimed voting machines could be hacked with \\"one line of code\\".  Musk also feared being convicted of crimes, so he had everything to gain by cheating.But it's impossible to hack our elections.  After all, our government builds the best software systems.

Youre right that they probably wouldnt have been successful packing the court. I wouldve liked to simply see them try. It creates important national conversation and normalizes certain attitudes among the base. I do recall now that Colorado did take Trump off the ballot for violating the insurrection clause and SCOTUS found otherwise. Forgot about that. Labor strikes happen with organizing. But class consciousness needs to develop; big platforms like the DNC could help Americans understand and be more willing to utilize this option. I agree that nothing I cite is likely to succeed, except for the prospect of labor strikes. And it is true that the DNC doesnt organize labor, and has conflicting incentives.I also agree that it is important to vote, volunteer, and donate. As I did for Harris, Biden, and Obama, as well as certain state/local races. I also think it is important for us to be critical of the Democrats even while supporting them. This is dire and we commitment to people, not donors or institutions. And frankly, I doubt voting frees us from this threat, even as we continue to try. Russia holds elections too.

Trump should seize any and all US land and assets owned by China, unless it is owned by Chinese Americans. Trumps war against the Cartels, reclaiming Panama, Annexing Canada, and buying Greenland are all excellent ideas that strengthen America.By contrast, I could make a very strong argument that democrats have become outright traitors in the last 4 years. Ukraine is the most corrupt nation on Earth, and Russia is fully justified in their war and their concerns. The western globalists have treated Russia unfairly for decades. The war in Ukraine is unwinnable, only serves to drain us, it drove Russia and China into an alliance, and Russia can outpace all of US and Europe in Manufacturing.The things Democrats have done are designed to collapse us and make us weak. They create inflation, most of which is being held back for the moment until the time when riots are okay, then all of a suddenly it will be $100 to buy a loaf of bread, and only the newcomers, who are getting 10k a month in UBI, virtually ALL new jobs since 2018, AND free houses will suck the tit of government and thrive, while real Americans would be denied and starve.For this reason alone, if Trump doesn't get into office, there will probably be Civil War in America. If the democrats remain in power, all real Americans, especially white people, would need to either join the protests, which would begin peacefully, or leave the country.Biden has shut down 20,000 farms per year since 2020, and is seizing all the farmland via eminent domain. All while most nations are ditching the dollar, it's getting to where we can't trade with anyone, and our ability to even make food at home is threatened. Meanwhile millions of new mouths to feed come into the country every year. We are burning the candle at both ends, and from the sides.Everything Trumps want to do would strengthen us, while everything Biden Kamala, the democrats, and other traitors like Mike Johnson want to do is designed to weaken us.Why? Because what other nation has freedom and a constitution like America? China can't be the future, it's a social credit dystopian communist hellhole. If America falls, I give God full permission to destroy this world. I would even volunteer to become the son of perdition so that we can get started.The globalists want to siphon all the wealth and military power of America, while in the end, collapsing it along with Europe to erase white culture and a free way of life. All to usher in a world where it's illegal to say that the sun shines. By that I mean, a world where obvious science is denied for political reasons. To get people to accept such a society is the most dangerous thing for humanity, for all males and females. They have created an absurd idiocracy and deliberately dumbing everyone down.Everything Biden is doing now, billions here, a few billions there. Billions to other nations, billions wasted on stupid cases, it's all designed to waste money, and most of the money going to Ukraine goes into the pockets of Zelensky, the elite, and the military industrial complex.I could go on and on, but in conclusion: we need to get out of the wars we shouldn't be involved with, and get into the wars we should be involved with. Everything going forward is either to strength or collapse America. Not one single thing the democrats are doing is good for America.This and that US should seize any US lands held by China, foreign powers should be allowed to own farms and territory in other countries, especially if they refuse to trade with said countries.EDIT: Tried to make this a post, but it gets auto removed for whatever stupid reason.

Wealthy Americans send their kids to these schools too because they understand that the risks of someone being shot on USC campus is not actually high; there is a higher risk of drinking-related harm and traffic accidents. Thats not to minimize crime, it is a problem in the US, but it isnt the existential danger in everyones lives as you seem to think. Its cartoonish to think people are just getting randomly shot at Stanford or Yale. You are right that the majority of international students are not going to T50 but most are going to T100 (undergrad). The largest schools for international are schools like USC and UIUC, both in the T50. But there are also many at places like Michigan State. Some of those students could do great at a place like Toronto, sure. But thats a decision for the student and their parents to make, not yours. There are plenty of people who help them arrange studies in Europe, Australia, Canada if they want to go that route. Dont insult the parents by patronizing them; they know other countries exist and understand the pros and cons of being in the US. One more note about crime its very different from place to place. There is a lot more crime at Toronto and McGill than Dartmouth or UC Davis. Some European universities have a reputation for crime issues near the campuses too. The idea that everywhere in the US is more dangerous than anywhere in Europe or Canada is just not true. If these families wanted safety and to experience less racism against people like them, honestly they would never look to Canada or most of Europe which also have iffy reputations. Theyd stay in Asia.","title":"US universities urge international students to return to campus before Trump inauguration"},{"text":"If you think the election system is screwed up now, implement these changes, and it will be a mess.

Whatever rules those are that you speak of, or whatever conventions you expect, he does things his way, my brother.

He warned them that if there was a problem with Russia, Germany would suffer. Why would you give your money to Russia and help them build up a war chest, he asked? Im also old enough to remember him telling NATO that they better start paying their fair share, because if they didnt, America wasnt going to haul their freight any longer. He said that NATO needed to get serious and pay their dues, because their equipment was falling into disrepair, they were neglecting their flight hours, and they were half-assing it in joint exercises. He did this very publicly. Many NATO countries laughed at him  surely this kind of talk was inappropriate and against convention! Then they threw a temper tantrum when they realized he wasnt kidding. And guess what? They started to pay, and prepare for a war they didnt believe would ever really happen. On both counts  Germany buying Russian gas and NATO dues  I remember some saying Trump was living in the past, that there would never be another WW2-style land war in Europe. A few years later, Russia rolls the tanks into Ukraine.Trump sees something here with Greenland and is saying this now, in a very public way, for a reason.

Lastly, they could be opportunists making common cause against the common enemy (equality and democracy) until they no longer need one another.2) The central idea of conspiracy theories does not matter. The brain chips can be swapped out for chem trails, flat earth, child sacrifice, or whatever at a moment's notice as long as their replacement can be used to blame the same people for supposedly being in a conspiracy. That's what these conspiracy theories are: they are ideological constructs that justify and amplify a preexisting hatred for people and institutions.

Still low, but we have two big Saturdays of early voting coming up with additional locations.Other stats - 2,806 mail ballots have been returned out of 11,710, for a 24.4% return rate with 11 days to go.  47 of those ballots need to be cured due to issues, but shout-out to the one voter who's already cured theirs!Big picture: We have a lot of mail ballots to go, and voters can still apply for one until end of day today.

It is one part the equivalent of a ballistic missile defense system and one part global outreach. Most Americans have never seen or heard any messaging directly from the GEC. Should I be opposed to a U.S. agency blunting anti-US narratives among our allies? Even if that effort is propagandized with pro-US sentiment? Notably, if Im aware of that spins existence?

Even if that narrative is outward facing.ETA: I am particularly against a single source of information, that does not mean I am opposed to sanctioned contextualization.

This goes far beyond wealth and is a very personal thing...most of us never reach it because we need to focus on more pressing needs like 'shelter', 'food', 'love &amp; belonging', 'self-esteem'.These people want to open the path for others to reach their own potential...they don't care about race, or background.  Their pleasure and happiness now comes from 'giving back'...it's what drives them.  Look at Bill &amp; Melinda Gates - their charitable foundations.  Musk offered all of Tesla's costly battery technology research to other car companies for free.  So they cut bureaucracy, reduce taxes, support better economic policies.

What a joke.","title":"Out: Trumps campaign promises. In: War with Panama and Denmark?"},{"text":"Only after winning last month did Trump fess up, belatedly acknowledging he cant bring prices down. Id like to bring them down, he told Time magazine. Its hard to bring things down once theyre up. You know, its very hard.You could do a whole analysis piece on just this one line, because it shows both how Trump gets away with this with both his base and the media, and how Democrats keep falling on their face every time they try to communicate something.First, with the media. Their double standards are obvious. They demand that Democrats have detailed policy documents for absolutely everything, and pick through every single line to find something to attack them on. Republicans, and you can see this in all the headlines that get voted to the top of even this sub, just have to \\"say things.\\" How many articles are written every day that use the \\"Republican says they'll do [impossible thing]\\" or more generally \\"[liar] says [lie]\\"? Because Republicans get full credit for just saying shit, media treats them as if they're miracle workers who can do anything.To the MAGA base, even this rare acknowlegement of failure uses the \\"I want to do this thing, but it's very hard\\" format, which, while removing the effect of the magic wand that the media usually lets them wave, at least acknowledges the desire for the thing among the people, and his desire to make it happen if he could.Meanwhile, all the \\"responsible people\\" take the *profoundly ineffective* track of \\"you don't want that thing that you want, and I'll tell you why.\\" It's even in the lead-in to this piece:Alas, it is virtually impossible to reduce prices; the overall level of prices almost never falls unless an economy is really sick (as it was during the Great Depression, the last time we saw widespread deflation). The best that economists generally hope for is for growth in prices to slow and for prices themselves to more or less plateau.And this is absolutely true, but rhetorically, it's completely useless. When given a choice between \\"I hear what you're saying, I want it too, but it's extremely hard to do\\" and \\"You're wrong, you don't want that, and I'm not even going to try to deliver that to you because you don't actually want that\\", is it any wonder why a casual listener would lean toward the first? The promises of the conman selling snake oil are more appealing than harsh reality, at least until the consequenses come.And what's worse is that Democrats DO have a price-lowering argument that doesn't involve a catastrophic recession. Remember [greedflation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greedflation-caused-more-half-last-100000899.html) and the reporting early this year that companies were jacking up prices far higher than inflation \\"required\\" them to? How about taking on market consolidation and monopoly or near-monopoly megacorps? The recent health insurance news shows that people across the political spectrum are extremely open to \\"the people vs the corporations\\" messaging, especially when they are or are made aware of how badly they're getting screwed.","title":"Consumers Finally Realize That Trump Could Worsen Inflation: Fearing high prices, some are stocking up for what could be an expensive four years"},{"text":"Shed boil your kids rabbit, for sure.","title":"Unexpected MAGA Civil War update: MTG sides with Elon &amp; Vivek over Trump"},{"text":"Probably a much more sinister motive than just money.

I know there are deep concerns about how extreme Trump's agenda is, but mass deportations in the millions, even some of the tariff proposals I think are hyperbole and won't be fully implemented, as at the end of the day most Americans are still more moderate than these terminally online weirdos, and will strongly oppose a lot of excesses.In response, there will be a massive revolt against Trump from online alt-right spaces, him being seen as a traitor to the cause. This entire drama originated with the mere suggestion from Elon and others that talented people should be able to immigrate to the US easier. This was an almost universally accepted bipartisan position only a few years ago. There is a rapidly accelerating radicalisation taking place online into increasingly delusional and horrifying ideology. And it will slowly begin to infect mainstream politics, as we've already seen in our current climate.This will continue, Trump and his coalition will not be enough to satiate this appetite for extremism brewing among young men. The end result I can see is a genuine neo-Nazi movement taking hold in mainstream politics, way worse than even the craziest of Trump's camp. The counterpart on the left will be radicalisation to Communist ideology, and general political violence like with the UHC shooter.IMO this is the natural end result of social media becoming one of the main mediums of communication in society. People like to blame X for this, and it has accelerated this trend, but it's something you see across all platforms. Social media is the root cause of the increasing insanity we see, and this is what it will lead to.The best way to avoid this dystopian future imo is for a mass re-evaluation of our relationship with tech in the age of AI, to use these platforms as positive tools for the world rather than sleepwalking into an ever incomprehensible mess. I'm actually optimistic that this will happen and sanity will prevail; these psychos are still a small minority, and we'll figure it out as a society. But there is massive risk we face in allowing and even tolerating this descent into radicalised insanity.","title":"The Trump-Elon coalition is collapsing because Elon is only 99% closie"},{"text":"He's just a leech who got lucky by pushing founders out of companies and feeds on the public purse","title":"He means Trump voters."},{"text":"Did he?

In the early 1930s, Germany was in an economic and political crisis.\\nBeginning in fall 1929, there was a world economic crisis known as the Great Depression. Millions of Germans lost their jobs. Unemployment, hunger, poverty, and homelessness became serious problems in Germany in the early 1930s.\\nThe German government failed to solve the problems caused by the Great Depression. Germany was politically divided. This made passing new laws almost impossible because of disagreements in the German parliament. Many Germans lost faith in their leaders ability to govern.Radical antidemocratic political groups like the Nazi Party and the Communist Party grew in popularity. They became more and more visible in the press and on the streets. These groups took advantage of the economic and political chaos and used propaganda to attract Germans who were fed up with the political stalemate.How did Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party attract voters in the early 1930s?In the early 1930s, the Nazis campaigned in national, state, and local elections in Germany. Their major breakthrough came in September 1930, when they won 18 percent of the vote in the national parliamentary elections. They also did well in state and local elections that year. This shocked some Germans, especially those who recognized that the Nazis were an extremist, fringe political movement.During election campaigns, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis won followers by playing on peoples hopes. The Nazis promised to\\nfix the economy and put people back to work;\\nreturn Germany to the status of a great European, and even world, power;\\nregain territory Germany had lost in World War I; and create a strong authoritarian German government.But the Nazis also played on peoples fears and prejudices. They falsely claimed that Jews and Communists were to blame for all of Germanys problems. The Nazis promised to unite Germans along racial and ethnic lines. The Nazis planned to exclude Jews and others from German society. How did Adolf Hitler come to power in 1933? Adolf Hitler came to power through Germanys legal political process. The Nazis continued to win over voters in the early 1930s. In the July 1932 parliamentary elections, the Nazis won 37 percent of the vote. This was more votes than any other party received. In November 1932, the Nazi share of the vote fell to 33 percent. However, this was still more votes than any other party won.The Nazi Partys electoral successes made it difficult to govern Germany. Hitler and the Nazis refused to work with other political parties. Hitler demanded to be appointed chancellor. German President Paul von Hindenburg initially resisted this demand. However, he gave in and appointed Hitler Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933.\\nHindenburg appointed Hitler to this position as the result of a political deal. Certain conservative politicians convinced President Hindenburg to make the appointment. They wanted to use the Nazi Partys popularity for their own purposes. They mistakenly believed that they could control Hitler. In January 1933, Hitler did not immediately become a dictator. When he became chancellor, Germanys democratic constitution was still in effect. However, Hitler transformed Germany by manipulating the democratic political system. Hitler and other Nazi leaders used existing laws to destroy German democracy and create a dictatorship.\\nIn August 1934, President Hindenburg died. Hitler proclaimed himself Fhrer (meaning leader) of Germany. From that point forward, Hitler was the dictator of Germany.Sound familiar?","title":"\\"Divorce is coming soon\\": MAGA civil war erupts after Trump allies accuse Elon Musk of \\"censorship\\""},{"text":"Yeah - lets start by kicking out musk and Melania.","title":"Trump's incoming \\"border czar\\" details plans to track down undocumented minors"},{"text":"K","title":"Trump's boss Leon gets criticized for not really inventing anything ever.

If Trump and Vance want to benefit citizen wage laborers, they need to require all employers to start using E-Verify or something similar, with real social security numbers. In order to benefit citizens who aspire to the next steps up the economic ladder, Trump and Vance need to reduce H-1B visas, not expand them. I dont think either of these indicators can easily be fudged. If Trump and Vance limit immigrant work opportunities in this way, then I think the effects will be visible, and may even lead to significant inflation, particularly in food and construction. I dont think there is a way to avoid the risk of inflation if youre trying to induce a broad increase in wages at the lower end of the scale.This is a big one. If Trump actually does deliver here, it will be a big change that could do the \\"realignment' that  is being hyped.The credibility of the Democratic party is completely shot at every level, and Democrats are not in control of whether it can ever be regained. The only way the Democrats have a chance in 2026 and 2028 is if Trump and Vance blow it. That could certainly happen, but it wont be the result of anything the Democrats do between now and then. Instead, the Democrats will probably carry on with their most important role of blocking and tackling for the oligarchs by using dirty tricks and litigation to prevent any viable third party from emerging. That will leave the field completely open for Trump and Vance. Well see what happens as a result.Yep - the Democrats have totally discredited themselves and betrayed the working class in favor of the rich.Most of Reddit seems to be in denial about this.

On average here meaning \\"Most of them make less than half.\\" Most of them are paid minimum prevailing wage, meaning that any given H1B visa employee is the lowest paid person on the floor or area in which they work. They can't unionize. They can't fight for more rights. They can't be promoted past the point of usefulness without the company going to extreme lengths to support the person in getting a citizenship, and they are under no obligation to do so regardless. Nobody who wants/actively promotes the H1B visa program (from a political standpoint) wants beneficial, equitable employment for the people they would employ under such a program. They want a bunch of Slave 2.0s that don't talk back under fear of SWIFT deportation, because the tech industry has ICE on speed dial. The program needs started over, from scratch, with equity and equality at the forefront. Nobody should be lured here under the guise of the American Dream only to have it be revealed as a brain-sucking octopus who wants the benefit of extremely skilled labor without the requirement to uplift those who are throwing themselves into the fire to actually do the work. The visa program started in the 90s and it's the reason the tech industry in the US was ahead of the curve for SO LONG. We still are, in some sectors. H1B Visa holders fueled that boom, but I guarantee they saw less than a percentage point of the mountains of wealth their work generated. Google is built on a mountain of Visas.

So you can basically purchase a seat in congress as long as there isn't an incumbent occupying it.\\nBut wait, there's more! There's a philosophical problem with term limits as well. On paper they make sense, but what if you finally found that man or woman who really seems to look out for their constituents? You agree with their core political philosophy, you like the way they vote... but the Koch Brother(s) think you should be forced to elect someone new. Why? If the people of Vermont think Bernie Sanders is too old they can force him into retirement. They can do it in the primaries or the general election. We have term limits, it's just up to the voters to exercise them.","title":"Case of missing congresswoman sparks uncomfortable conversation | \\nRepublican Rep.

He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \\"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair.\\" This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.[He] was incredibly lazy... wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him.He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked).

In fact, they are usually fully aware that an injustice is taking place. However, these types relish an opportunity to deny dignity and justice to someone who they feel is not like them. ** Malevolent flying monkeys function as gatekeepers. Often they are foot soldiers of a larger system of oppression, i.e. sexism, racism, etc. and they engage in the conflict for the sole purpose of protecting a hierarchy that serves them.\\" *","title":"All-Out MAGA Civil War Engulfs Trump Already"},{"text":"This is what you voted for, enjoy staying poorer and dumber.","title":"After backing Trump, low-income voters hope he doesnt slash their benefits"},{"text":"I thought the Speaker serves indefinitely?","title":"House Speaker Fight May Delay Trump Win Certification"},{"text":"Theres an old saying, If youre 20 and not a liberal, you dont have a heart.

They require protein, fat, vitamins (like taurine and A, B, D), and minerals.A face contains skin, muscle, fat, and connective tissue, which could provide some of these nutrients, but faces lack key organs (like liver) and bones that provide essential micronutrients like calcium and phosphorus.\\nCaloric SufficiencyThe average human face weighs about 2-3 pounds (mostly skin and muscle), providing approximately 1,500-2,500 calories depending on fat content.An adult leopard requires around 3,000-4,000 calories daily, depending on activity and size. This means one face might only be enough for half a day's energy needs.\\nDietary VarietyEating only faces would result in nutrient deficiencies over time.
