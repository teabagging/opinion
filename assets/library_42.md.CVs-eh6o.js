Even the First Palestinian Arab Congress declared: *\\"We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds.\\"*Note that I don't dispute that a Palestinian national movement that is indigenous to the Levant has emerged by now.

But you forget to mention that the reality for Palestinians isn't the same as the reality Sudeten, Silesian or Prussian Germans faced. There are no permanent Sudeten refugee camps, they are nominally free to move back, they don't live under martial law or any type of occupation.That's because, while the Sudeten Germans were incorportated into the German nation, the surrounding Arab nations denied Palestinians this opportunity. The Arab League passed Resolution 1547, explicitly instructed its member states not to give Palestinians citizenship, in order to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their rights to return to their homeland. That is why the refugee camps still exist generations later.I'm not denying that the Palestinian national movement doesn't exist *now*, but Palestinian Arabs didn't consider themselves a separate ethnic group at first. Quoting from the First Palestinian Arab Congress: *\\"We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds.\\"* I don't see why the Sudeten Germans wouldn't have emerged as a distinct ethnicity either under these conditions.

Properly used, indigenous doesnt mean had an ethnogenesis somewhere it means was colonised, or is under threat of colonisation. indigeneity isnt something that exists in a vacuum independent of colonialism; the French arent indigenous to France, Bretons are.Good point! However, Jews *did* undergo an ethnogenesis in modern-day Israel, and were colonised: first by the Romans, and then by the Arabs and Ottomans.

The British certainly published the Balfour Declaration and permitted Jewish immigration in the 1920s, but the Russians actively organized Armenians resettlement. The right parallel to the Russian resettlement of Armenians would be the Turkish settlement of Turks in occupied Northern Cyprus where the Turkish government literally paid, bussed, and shipped Turkish peasants to live on Cyprus. It was an organized migration, not a permissive standard. Additionally, after the Palestinian Civil War of 1936-1939, the British prevented Jewish migration to Palestine under the White Paper of 1939, leading Ben-Gurion to famously say, \\"We shall fight the War as if there was no White Paper, and the White Paper, as if there was no War.\\"\\\\ I agree that their primary focus was a state in West Armenia, but that's not because they didn't consider East Armenia a part of that state. They simply viewed Russians as an ally against the Ottoman Empire and didn't want to antagonize them.This is true.\\\\ ...sources like Wikipedia indicate that the Armenian national movement was already at play in the 1860s.?There were Armenians who wanted more rights as early as the 1860s, like the Armenians who would become part of the Ottoman Parliament of 1876, but without a unified standard, it didn't mean much. The Dashnaks and Hunchaks provided such a standard.

Its members have been called snowflakes, mocked for performative slacktivism and embracing trigger warnings, and described (favorably and unfavorably) as climate warriors and gun-control activists. Some older commentators have even proclaimed them the nationslast hope. (The number of people whove argued that Gen Z might save the world is  not small.)But that progressive reputation was called into question when Donald Trump won last weeks presidential electionpartly thanks, it seems, to Gen Z, which encompasses voters ages 18 to 27. Exit polls and county-by-county analyses, however imprecise, indicated that young voters had shifted right since 2020. Thats especially true for young menmost of all young white men, who made up one of Trumps most supportive cohorts. Democrats also lost ground with young women, though. According to some national exit-poll data, the partys lead among 18-to-29-year-olds was cut nearly in half. And county data (which are considered more reliable, though still imperfect) indicate that counties with large populations of 18-to-34-year-olds moved 5.6 points rightward since the 2020 election.People had good reason for thinking that more young adults might vote for Kamala Harris. Surveys have shown that the group cares about blue-coded issues such as the environment, firearm safety, diversity, and inclusivity. One 2023 poll found that, compared with Baby Boomers and Generation X, Gen Z is more concerned about criminal-justice reform and racial equity; in 2020, Pew found that Gen Z members are likelier to say the government should do more to solve problems rather than leaving things to business and individuals.But, as researchers told me, priorities change; young adults can care about progressive causes and still be moved by messaging that speaks to their deep unease and uncertainty. Many of them are strugglingto feel financially secure, psychologically safe, or hopeful. Trump, in his campaign, managed to mirror what many young people already felt: The world is a frightening place, and its not getting better.So what nerve did Trump hit? One common thread preoccupying many young people, Grace told me, is a desire for security. When you think about things like their passion for the environment, desire for school safety, financial success, affordable housing, she said, all of those things have the same spin on them: I just want to feel safe. They generally want to go to class without worrying about shooters, to grow older without witnessing the planets demise, to pay rent without draining their whole paycheck, to believe they can make ends meet. Trump campaigned on fearhe warned of an economy in shambles, crime and danger lurking, undocumented immigrants taking work from forgotten men and women. Much of that wasnt rooted in reality: Violent crime rates are down in the U.S., for instance, and undocumented immigrants tend to fill jobs that American workers say they dont want. Still, fear resonated.But another person who might have nudged Gen Z rightward is Kamala Harris. The vice presidents campaign hardly mentioned climate change or gun controlissues which, though theyve dropped in importance for young voters more recently, might still have been unifying across race and gender if theyd been highlighted, both Grace and Seemiller told me. Harris did talk about some economic policies, such as lowering housing costs and instituting a price-gouging ban. But she also hammered home that shed save Americaand democracyfrom Trump, and piece together the norms he shattered. That wouldnt necessarily have resonated with Gen Z, the oldest of whom were only 21 when Trump was first elected in 2016, the researchers I spoke with told me; a world with Trump is the only world theyve really known as adults. In Seemiller and Graces 2021 survey, access to voting and political dysfunction were pretty low on the priority list. They might not have been hearing the issue that mattered to them, Grace told me. And so it really had to be simplified down to: Do I care about the economy or do I care about this other thing theyre talking about?","title":"The Not-So-Woke Generation Z - The same young people once derided as liberal snowflakes are moving to the right."},{"text":"I just wanna grab everyone that trusts him and say:\\"We've all been fucked over by someone we've trusted at least once in our lives.

It was not an attempt by Armenians to create a national state; Armenian nationalism did not really come to the fore until the founding of the Dashnaktsutyun Party over 50 years after these resettlements largely took place AND we should be clear that the Dashnaks were primarily oriented towards creating an Armenian State in West Armenia (modern Turkey) because Russia was sponsoring them, so they would not want to directly threaten Russia.I'm not sure if that's entirely true, as sources like Wikipedia indicate that the Armenian national movement was already at play in the 1860s. I agree that their primary focus was a state in West Armenia, but that's not because they didn't consider East Armenia a part of that state.

What is your response?"},{"text":"Excerpt:...Though it may be hard to believe this fate has befallen the party of FDR, these changes didnt happen overnight. Democrats were long considered by many Americans to be the party of the common man and woman. Mark Brewer, of the University of Maine, has found that in every presidential election between 1952 and 2004, the trait voters said they most liked about the Democrats was that they were the party of the working class. By contrast, the biggest mark against the Republicans was that they were viewed as the party of big business and the upper class.These perceptions created a clear divide between the parties coalitions during that period: Democrats were likelier to win lower-educated and lower-income voters while Republicans were the favored party of many college-educated and affluent Americans.At the same time, the parties had also begun to polarize along racial lines. Following the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act under President Lyndon Johnson, black Americans almost uniformly threw their weight behind Democrats while white votersespecially white southernersbegan moving toward Republicans. For a time, this came at the expense of the Democrats: from 1968 through 1988, they won the presidency just once, in 1976.However, by the 1990s, the country was growing more diverse and better educated. Bill Clinton was a beneficiary of this new reality, as he made sweeping gains with women, young people, voters of color (specifically, Hispanics), and college-educated voters. Importantly, he also retained significant support from white Americans and lower-educated voters, who made up the vast majority of the electorate. As Clinton rode this coalition to victory twicemarking the first time since FDR that a Democrat had won two full terms as presidentsome political observers saw the emergence of a new majority, one that could consistently win elections using the formula Clinton had used.In 2008, Barack Obama built on the Clinton coalition, bringing in even higher levels of support from almost every major party constituency, including blacks, Hispanics, Asians, young people, and women.1 But that year saw the rise of another trend as well: Obama became the first Democratic nominee since at least 1988 to decisively win voters who held a bachelors degree. He also fared far better with high-income earners than past Democrats had. These were the first signs of a growing professional class whose cultural values had aligned many of them with Team Bluea departure from the past.Obamas two wins led Democrats and Republicans alike to believe in the emerging Democratic majority thesis. Gone were the days when Democrats needed to win a majority of white voters, a feat they had found nearly impossible to achieve since the 1960s. Now, the party that represented Americas demographic future stood to lead it as well.But no sooner did that consensus emerge than Donald Trump arrived on the scene. Trump disrupted the Democrats plans for building a dominant coalition and, in the process, helped precipitate a dramatic realignment between the two partiesone rooted in economic and social class. This change has tipped the demographic advantage in favor of Republicans and left Democrats at very real risk of losing many of the voters who not long ago were expected to deliver them a permanent majority.**In 2016, non-college-educated voters, a group that had backed Obama by four points in 2012, swung to Trump, who won them by six.** This was a core driver of Trumps win, as these voters made up a whopping 63 percent of the electorate that year. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton gained substantial ground with college graduates, who went from also backing Obama by four points to supporting her by 15. This was an early sign that Democrats would struggle to win without a critical mass of working-class voters behind them.Four years later, as Joe Biden defeated Trump, the education gap grew even wider. Biden improved on Clintons advantage with college-educated voters by three more points, while Trumps margin with non-college voters remained virtually unchangedlikely the difference in the outcome. Even in Bidens victory, though, there were signs that the traditional Democratic coalition wasnt holding. The clearest example was the rightward swing of Hispanic voters, who had backed Clinton by 38 points but supported Biden by only 26. There were also more modest signs of eroding support among black and Asian voters. In fact, a key driver of Bidens win was improvements with white Americans: he lost them to Trump by only 13 points compared to Clintons 17-point deficit.It seems plausible that because Democrats found success in 2020 and unexpectedly did so again in the 2022 midterms, they overlooked real problems under the hood of their coalition. Now, these problems finally caught up with them.Initial data from the 2024 AP VoteCast survey shows that Kamala Harris matched Bidens margin with white voters, but Trump made historic gains with non-white voters. He earned the highest share of Asian support since 2004, the highest share of black support since 1976, and the second-highest share of Hispanic support ever (he even nearly won Hispanic men outright). All this points to an American electorate that is becoming less polarized along racial and ethnic lines. While that may be a welcome development for society, it comes at the obvious expense of the Democrats, who had hoped these voting blocs would help them build a demographically dominant coalition for years to come.Meanwhile, the transformation of the parties along class lines appears to be moving full steam ahead. Harris came close to matching Bidens level of support among college-educated voters, winning them by 14 points. But perhaps just as telling: she carried voters earning at least $100,000 by seven pointsby far the largest margin for a Democratic nominee in the modern era. On the other side, Trump became the first Republican nominee on record to win low-income voters, narrowly carrying them by three points. He also continued growing his advantage with non-college voters, winning them by 13 pointsthe largest margin for the GOP since at least 1988. And his 44 percent support from union households marked the greatest share for a Republican since Ronald Reagan.Looking at this picture, its hard not to see that the Democrats have now become the party of the very thing they have long fought against: the elites. This stands in sharp contrast to their longtime image as the party of the working class, which is further and further in the rearview mirror. According to political scientist Matt Grossmann, college-educated white voters this year became a plurality of the Democratic coalition for the first time ever, surpassing both non-college whites as well as voters of color.On a more practical note, this new coalition also risks putting the Democrats on electorally unsound footing. Although college graduates are more reliable voters than their non-college peers, they also constitute a much smaller share of the population. Without a meaningful share of working-class voters in the mix, the party will struggle to be competitive.Strategists and pundits will argue in the months ahead about the best path forward for the Democrats, but suffice it to say: from both an electoral and moral standpoint, the partys aim should be to return to its roots as the party of the people.","title":"\\"In every presidential election between 1952 and 2004, the trait voters said they most liked about the Democrats was that they were the party of the working class.

Quoting from the First Palestinian Arab Congress: *\\"We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds.\\"* True, a separate movement emerged in the last 50 years. But wouldn't it have emerged among, say, Sudeten Germans too, if they weren't allowed to integrated into the broader German nation? In the case of Palestinians, the Arab League explicitly instructed its member states in Resolution 1547 not to give Palestinians citizenship, in order to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their rights to return to their homeland.Second, they is already a country where Palestinians are the demographic majority  Jordan. Around 60% of Jordanian citizens are descendant from Palestinian Arabs and consider themselves Palestinians. This is not to say that other Palestinians should just leave and go to Jordan, I'm only pointing out the fact.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"Are they?

You seem to be saying it's no less justified than other forms of nationalism. That's a fair bit more specific a claim. You could easily argue that German nationalism as a concept was justified, but the actions undertaken in the *name* of a German nation were so reprehensible and completely cancel out any reasonable claims to self-determination.It's also pretty hard to detach nationalism from it's historical context. Nationalism was the dominant ideology in the early 20th century, as an antidote to imperialism (in name anyway).

If we compare Zionism to Greek Nationalism, Turkish Nationalism, Bulgarian Nationalism, German Nationalism, and other ethnonationalist movements, there were certainly regions where the given nationality was a minority -- Greeks were a minority in Western Thrace, Bulgarians were a minority in some regions of Eastern Rumelia, and Turks were a minority in Smyrna -- but the overwhelming majority of the territory claimed by these movements (and ultimately subsumed by the resulting ethnonationalist states) did have locally-extant majorities of the named ethnicity.By contrast, Jews had to make a large-scale migration to Ottoman/British Palestine in order to become a sizable population in any part of that territory aside from the city of Jerusalem. Jews had to immigrate in large numbers to push themselves up from being roughly 8% of the Mandate of Palestine population to 35% in 1948. You try to compare this to the Armenification of the Erivan Khanate, but we should note that the Armenians who moved into the Erivan Khanate under Russian control did so because of Russian motivations. The Russians wanted to have a loyal population south of the Caucasus to defend the position from the Persians. The Russians wagered (successfully) that creating an Armenian enclave there would allow the Russians a natural bridgehead and protective line -- especially as the Cossacks were tied up with the Circassians in the Aul-Wars (and later Tsitsekun). It was not an attempt by Armenians to create a national state; Armenian nationalism did not really come to the fore until the founding of the Dashnaktsutyun Party over 50 years after these resettlements largely took place AND we should be clear that the Dashnaks were primarily oriented towards creating an Armenian State in West Armenia (modern Turkey) because Russia was sponsoring them, so they would not want to directly threaten Russia. Dashnaks only really began pushing for Armenian independence in East Armenia (modern Armenia/Georgia/Azerbaijan) when the Russian Civil War broke out, weakening Russian power south of the Caucasus.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"  I bet he doesn't even accomplish 5% of what they are threatening.

Such figures indicated that there had been a \\"relatively minor contribution\\" to Ashkenazi paternal lineages by converts to Judaism and non-Jews Hammer et al. add that \\"Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.\\" Two studies by Nebel et al. in 2001 and 2005, based on Y chromosome polymorphic markers, suggested that Ashkenazi Jews are more closely related to other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than they are to their host populations in Europe (defined in the using Eastern European, German, and French Rhine Valley populations). [Feder et al.] also found that \\"the differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.\\" It supported previous interpretations that, in the direct maternal line, there was \\"little or no gene flow from the local non-Jewish communities in Poland and Russia to the Jewish communities in these countries.\\"","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"I can kinda understand why the people of Ukraine didn't think an invasion would happen though.

The other 90% of the land wasn't all Arab property C it was first Ottoman and then passed to the British empire. What's important is that the land where the Jews settled had been legally purchased. Jews constituted 33% of the Mandate's population. They were given 56% of the land, because most of it was the barren Negev desert and the swamps in the North. Most importantly, they were the *majority* in the lands that were alloted to them. Regarding your second point, the evidence for Israel's involvement in the Baghdad bombing is questionable at best. What is uncontroversial is how Jews were treated. When Algeria and Libya got independence, they denied Jews citizenship. In Syria and Iraq, Jewish bank accounts were frozen, their driver's licenses annulled, there were quotas on Jewish employment etc. Jews were also arbitrary arrested, Jewish businesses were seized. In most cases, Jews were eventually expelled and had their property confiscated by the state. If you want to go further back in history, you'll discover how Jews were persecuted under Muslim rule for centuries. You'll also learn about the never-ending anti-Jewish pogroms, which continued well into the 1940s.In any case, your second point doesn't dispute my argument because, at its worst, the formation of other nation-states (e.g. Armenia, Czechia, Poland) was definitely no better than Israel's.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"Im both jealous but have also read youve been importing these beliefs, so seems like that could change?","title":"Oklahoma Superintendent Demands Students Watch Him Pray for Trump"},{"text":"Elon seems like someone who annoys your the more youre around him.

Especially when Jews were systematically denied entry to other countries when they were trying to escape mass genocide in Europe?The problem with the argument anti Zionists make is that they neglect to mention that the Palestine was a failed Arab national movement that was a complete counter to Zionism. They never accepted the Jews right to self determination and never actually had a state so to call it their land is categorically false. They never intended Jews to be there or to have peaceful coexistence, whereas the Jews basically accepted a two state solution (in the form of the UN partition plan) from the very beginning.Others also conveniently ignore the fact that Arabs attacked Jews prior to the formation of Israel, collaborated with Hitler to try to bring the final solution to the Middle East, and were the beneficiaries of the USSR throughout the Cold War (which is basically why we still see a similar alignment to this day with Russia and Iran supporting them, with the US supporting Israel). If Palestine was an actual country that had their land stolen they would have had a national currency or a prime minister (or something similar)  but they didnt! Thats cause it never really existed, and they dont support a 2SS either because doing so would force them to acknowledge they cant have it all back.

I genuienly didn't understand why it was special. Keep in mind, I come from an Indian background, though I was raised in Africa. It was just 'natural' to me that tribes fight and kill each other. Hindus and Muslims fight and kill each other. That's just what tribes do. I was just like okay... German tribe kills Jewish tribe. No different than say Hutu killing Tutsi or something like that.

Boys will killed. Women raped and mutilated. Breasts were chopped off. That's expected. You'd have to provide me proof it didn't happen for it to be surprising. The civility and professionalism of some populations is defintely the exception and not the rule in life and history. \\nThere was a period I thought the Palestinian situation was also special, but it's not really special either.

Unfortunately they will also try to mitigate the logistical constraints by likely killing the non-productive enslaved people in concentration camps across the country. It is not good.What is likely to happen if national guards get used against other states is that blue States will welcome in undocumented immigrants to work the farms due to the exact same issues but will have to import through their ports which they have a massive advantage on. The red States will likely have to use Texas and Louisiana ports to export their agricultural products to import more mechanized goods that might get tariff relief.The supply chain is going to get cut in three ways most likely with red States holding the center and a divided blue Coasts making up the opposition.

But over the past three election cycles, theres been a slight?shift rightward,?particularly among Black men who have increased their support of?[President-elect Donald Trump](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/06/metro/trump-massachusetts-election-2024/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).The trend has confounded some local Black leaders, who say they dont understand how Black voters?would support a candidate that has?[demonized?Haitians](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/09/11/metro/trump-harris-debate-ohio-immigrants/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link),?[questioned Vice President Kamala Harriss Blackness](https://apnews.com/article/trump-black-journalists-convention-nabj-1e96aa530e88013ed6f577feaf89ccb6), and reportedly called the?[first Black woman nominee a bitch.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/politics/trump-campaign-election.html)?It has also, however, brought to the fore a challenge to Democrats to reexamine how they can now?energize the Black voting base.It wont be enough anymore to sell Black voters on the[?barrier-breaking potential of electing one of their own](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/23/nation/kamala-harris-2024-women-of-color-hope-fear/?p1=StaffPage&amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), some said.

This is a time to be honest about where we are because we could be moving in the wrong direction.To be sure,?Black voters supported Vice President Kamala Harris more than any other racial voting bloc, according to exit polls. However, since 2016, the percentage of Black voters?nationally backing Trump has risen from 8 percent to 13 percent this year, according to?[CNN exit poll data](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/).?The increase is more pronounced among?[Black men](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/10/nation/trump-new-coalition-swing-state/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), 21 percent of whom voted for Trump this year,?a roughly eight-percentage-point jump from 2016.?Trumps support among Black voters ages 18 to 64 has grown steadily, too.In 10 Massachusetts towns with the highest share of Black residents, Trump gained 5.8 percentage points on average compared to 2020, a Globe analysis of census and election data found. Thats in comparison to an average of about 4 percent statewide.In Brockton, where two in five residents are Black, Trump improved to 27.6 percent of the vote, from 22.3 percent in 2020.In Springfield, where one in five residents are Black, Trump earned 32.2 percent of the vote, compared to 24.9 percent in 2020.The gradual increase in Trump support has some Black leaders in Boston concerned that some community members have pinned their vote on one issue without realizing the potential consequences.Sometimes, its going to take people seeing the actual?harms of policy implementation to realize the magnitude of their vote, said the Rev. Rahsaan D. Hall, president and CEO of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts. As an individual, you may not have been harmed \\\\[by Trumps proposals\\\\], but what about the broader community?The GOP tickets pull on the Black electorate in recent years has been minimal when compared to other demographics. For example, roughly half of Latinos  regardless of race  backed Harris this year, compared to 65 percent for Biden in 2020. With Asian voters, Trumps support rose from 27 to 39 percent since 2016.Black leaders who spoke with the Globe said they feel grateful to live in a blue state like Massachusetts, where abortion rights are protected, elected officials are prepared to?[combat mass deportation efforts](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/07/metro/healey-says-administration-will-protect-undocumented-immigrants/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), and policies are often written with an equity lens.

I support communities seeking autonomy from oppression. Anyone here want to say something about Ukraine being corrupt? Bring it on. I can respond with twice as much, twice as severe corruption on part of the Russian government.  Corrupt or not, oppressive or not, Ukraine was far better for its people on both accounts before Russia started stealing their lands.  Again: I support communities seeking autonomy from oppression.  Few people on this planet are completely free from oppression. The people of Ukraine realized they would face less oppression under their own government than if they remained under Russia's thumb.   If Russia had really wanted to overthrow ukraine, they would have simply taken it by force completely overwhelming them  Riiiiighhht. They totally planned to withdraw from the farthest reaches of their invasions in the early days. All those failures to maintain supply lines, all those tanks without any fuel being hauled by Ukraine farmer's tractors... all an elaborate ploy to make money for the oligarchs.  Russia totally thought that was worth it so that they could get movie companies to donate tanks they were using as movie props.   You're argument is hypocritical and ridiculous at the same time.

There are voters who already have children, older voters, and voters who for a plethora of other reasons thought that abortion was important, but not important enough to make it their Nr 1 priority.Sure a different way they could have worded it is they 'didn't care enough'. You could also say \\"majority of voters care more about cost of milk than they do about lives/rights of women\\" which would also be true. That was prices due to inflation, debt servicing, lack of affordable housing, and yes, to a large swath, immigration. When you're struggling, it's hard to prioritize things you feel are less important at that moment.The issue I have on this is I'd love any voter who prioritized on inflation to tell me what exactly Trump et al will do to lower costs. His main \\"plan\\" seems to be adding tariffs to imported goods. That won't do anything to lower the cost of goods in America. I do get that people need to prioritize issues and will likely prioritize things that impact them directly (i.e. people who don't have child bearing age women or girls in their lives probably do care more about lowering  prices more than protecting the lives/rights of strangers) but it would be nice if part of their \\"prioritization\\" included prioritizing actual solutions to the problems they care about rather than just sound bites/assuming the other side is better without evidence.","title":"'Voters just didn't care': The abortion-rights movement grapples with Trumps return"},{"text":"And if they're too stupid or too unprepared to recognize a threat and make strategy on it, how the fuck are they generals anyway","title":"Donald Trump Is Preparing to Use the Military to Carry Out Mass Deportations"},{"text":"Meanwhile, his secretary of health is openly talking about labor camps","title":"Donald Trump Is Preparing to Use the Military to Carry Out Mass Deportations"},{"text":"Ummm they know he is not a detail oriented person...right?","title":"Undocumented migrants hope Trump mass deportations only 'for criminals'"},{"text":"Homan, the incoming border czar, in a recent Hannity interview stated clearly that he believes every undocumented immigrant is a criminal.

Demand-side economics focuses on stimulating economic growth by boosting demand for goods and services, often through government intervention, such as increased public spending, tax cuts for the middle and lower classes, and social programs. The idea is that when consumers have more money to spend, businesses respond by increasing production, which leads to economic growth.In contrast, supply-side economics emphasizes boosting economic growth by incentivizing producers and businesses through tax cuts, deregulation, and policies that are believed to enhance productivity and supply of goods and services.Does this help clarify the economic perspectives?me:so in essence there is  \\n  \\nsupply side economics where the businesses are either (-) taxed or (+) given grants/subsidies   \\n  \\ndemand side economics where the people/citizens are either (-) taxed or (+) given grants/subsidies   \\n  \\nin actuality, both coexist at all times, but usually the (+) of one side corresponds with a (-) on the other.   \\n  \\ndoes that make sense?copilot:Youve summarized it well! In essence:\\\\- Supply-side economics focuses on policies that benefit businesses, such as reducing taxes on corporations or providing subsidies, with the goal of increasing production and supply.\\\\- Demand-side economics focuses on policies that benefit consumers, such as tax cuts for individuals or increased government spending on social programs, with the goal of boosting demand for goods and services.And youre right: in practice, economic policy often involves a mix of both approaches. The balance between supply-side and demand-side measures can vary depending on the goals and priorities of policymakers at any given time.It's a delicate balancing act where changes in one side often influence the other. ?Does that align with what you're thinking?me:100% has anyone ever written about this topic, or economics in general, using the concept of yin/yang and taoism? i mean obviously a lot of the old parables from taoism are fundamental concepts that govt is built on, but has there been any modern writings that take both the old and new into account?copilot:Yes, there have been some modern writings that explore the intersection of Taoism, yin/yang, and economics. One notable example is [Peter Ping Li's work on the epistemology of yin-yang balancing and its application to economic and social systems. His writings discuss how Eastern philosophies like Taoism can offer a holistic and dynamic approach to understanding economic and social phenomena, contrasting with Western dualistic thinking.](https://academic.oup.com/book/2915/chapter-abstract/143555783?redirectedFrom=fulltext)Additionally, there are discussions on platforms like Reddit where modern Taoist thought is applied to contemporary economic and governmental issues. These discussions often highlight the relevance of Taoist principles, such as balance and harmony, in addressing modern economic challenges.so i realize this is from an AI partially so some of it might be technically incorrect but thats kinda the point of that final back n forth. only a sith (or bad politicians and economists) deal in absolutes.","title":"What programs do republicans fund that can be considered wasteful or controversial?

It falls apart the moment you take a second to clearly think through the situation.So, Trump gets into office and begins his massive deportation effort. The largest forced migration of people in human history. Immigrants are rounded up by the millions and sent to concentration camps near the Mexican border. Now, something similar was done in the 50s - Operation Wetback - And we know from that smaller, targeted, and more organized effort that it is pretty likely that Trump's goons round up and remove American citizens as well. But, let's pretend that doesn't happen and Trump is miraculously able to pull this off without any abuses of police power and that nobody accidentally slips through the cracks.What next? You've got 11 million people sitting in camps at the border. A common response is that we'll deport them, but guess what? That requires the cooperation of wherever we deport them to. No country on Earth is going to let us just roll up with dozens of ships and millions of people to dump on the beach. Mexico isn't going to let us shuffle our humanitarian crisis across the Rio Grande. Do you know why we release a bunch of illegal immigrants back into the country? Because we can't find anywhere to deport them to and courts have ruled that after 180 days they must be released from custody unless they're arrested for an actual crime.So, we have 3% - 5% of the American population in concentration camps at the border. We have nowhere to send them and the bill is escalating quickly while increasingly deplorable conditions begin to draw a great deal of scrutiny from the public. What then?Trump enacts his Final Solution? All 11 million are pressed into slavery as justification for their \\"crimes\\" in order to make up for suddenly removing 45% of our agricultural workforce? He just opens the cages and lets them all go into the desert without any support or transportation home?

Simply removing the tipped minimum wage and banning tipping would actually result in a decrease in wages for nearly every tipped employee being paid minimum wage, and I dont see how getting paid less is a more fair wage.?And its hard to judge price differences just based on your personal experiences, considering cost of living and other factors can vary by a lot more than 20% state to state, city to city, and even restaurant to restaurant. So its hard attribute what is cost of living differences and what is due to a difference in tipping culture. But just because you have one experience doesnt mean others cannot have a different one. This is a democracy, where all voters experiences are factored in.Average people certainly arent going to the streets about it and restaurants are not closing over the burdenYou could say the same thing about places tipping is encouraged.

Basically, we are talking about a large number of very tiny transactions to try and track, we are talking about a cash-incentive to discourage card tips which would otherwise be the easiest to tax, AND we are talking about pretty small sums of money. In my opinion, not taxing cash tips to servers is less of a \\"because they're so poor they need help\\" situation, and more of a \\"why should the IRS waste so much time and effort chasing pennies when there are dollars to be found elsewhere\\" because try as they might, even 100% collection of these taxes is a whole lot of work for not all that much revenue.","title":"CMV: Servers should pay taxes like everybody else"},{"text":"They made many mistakes this year, and here is another.

The US was once comprised of British colonies, and yet you probably support all the deaths of that war when the rebels went to war against Britain to take over Britain's rightful colonies.War is simply a rich mans game, you should look to see who profits from it and then you can start pointing fingers.

After all, there is no basis for the idea in written law - the words presidential mandate do not appear anywhere in the U.S. Constitution.

This idea can be appealing to many people, especially for presidents who consider it a free pass for doing what they want in office.No one should be blinded by the idea of an all-powerful mandate that gives the president the right to unlimited power.

Lets break it down:**\\"The filibuster is still a guardrail\\":** If Republicans really want to nuke the filibuster, they will. Theyve already proven theyre willing to break longstanding norms when theyre in power (e.g., Merrick Garland vs. Amy Coney Barrett). When the stakes are high enough, theyll make it happen. And once its gone, theres no going back.**\\"Moderate Republicans will temper the house\\":** This assumes that GOP moderates have any real influence or backbone left in the current climate. In the MAGA era, moderates like Kinzinger and Cheney were purged, and Trumpist loyalty is the currency of survival in the party. The vast majority of Republicans in competitive districts will likely fall in line, fearing primary challenges from MAGA candidates more than they fear losing general elections.**\\"Economic realities will hurt Trump\\":** While its true that the economy affects political fortunes, Trump has an uncanny ability to frame bad outcomes as someone elses fault (Democrats, globalists, immigrants, etc.) while claiming credit for anything remotely good. The GOP base has shown incredible resilience in sticking with Trump no matter how bad things get.**\\"Lawsuits will grind the executive branch to a halt\\":** Trump and his allies have already demonstrated that they can overwhelm the courts, outlast lawsuits, and ignore unfavorable rulings. Theyll use delays to their advantage while implementing as much as they can through executive orders, national emergency declarations, and other loopholes.**\\"Mass deportations will make Republicans lose support\\":** The GOP has increasingly relied on structural advantages (e.g., gerrymandering, the Electoral College, and the Senate) rather than broad popular support. Mass deportations may alienate some voters, but its a rallying cry for their base and unlikely to erode their grip on power in heavily gerrymandered districts.**\\"They wont be able to stop elections\\":** This is technically true, but they dont need to outright cancel elections to undermine democracy. Restricting voting access, manipulating state legislatures, and sowing doubt in election results have already proven effective. The focus isnt on stopping elections entirely; its about gaming the system so thoroughly that outcomes are predetermined.**\\"He cant be a dictator because of the Constitution\\":** This point grossly misunderstands how power works in a corrupted system. The Constitution is only as strong as the people enforcing it. If key institutions (like Congress, the judiciary, or the military) fail to act as checks, Trump doesnt need to formally suspend the Constitutionhe can simply govern by fiat and dare anyone to stop him.**\\"He has no sweeping mandate\\":** Trump doesnt need one. He governs through the loyalty of a fervent minority, amplified by the GOPs structural advantages. His base doesnt care about winning the popular vote or having a mandate. They care about power and owning the libs.This post feels like someone clinging to a na?ve belief that institutions and norms are unshakable, even in the face of relentless erosion. It underestimates how far Trump, his administration, and the GOP will go, especially when backed by a base that thrives on dismantling the very systems this person thinks will protect them.","title":"Schiff says hes not going to be intimidated by Trump"},{"text":"So I guess his mother was asking for it when she pushed back against his dad cheating?","title":"Donald Trump Jr. says pushback against Cabinet picks proves theyre the disrupters voters wanted"},{"text":"Al Franken springs to mind...","title":"The real reason Trump picked a sex fiend, dog killer, and anti-vaxxer for his cabinet"},{"text":"That only matters if there is someone to enforce that law or if youre the type of person that does what you should when nobody is watching.

If that leader says that Trump is a godly man then, in these people's minds, he is just shy of Jesus. I grew up in churches just like this - where religion and politics were amalgamated into an into an entire belief system.

One of the basic underlying premises of providing public health insurance to is that keeping people healthy, able, and out of the hospital is a pretty good way of ensuring that they show up to work.  The bottom line is that people need to be healthy to work, and people who arent healthy cant.Because Medicaid works as a work support, [a work requirement] would be a bit of a vicious cycle, Katch told me. She outlined a scenario where a hypothetical poor coal miner in West Virginia suffers from two problems rather common to those in his occupation and regionback problems and associated opioid use. He fails to secure work thanks to the back troubles, the addiction, or lack of treatment for either. If he were subject to a work requirement, said coal miner might be kicked off the very programMedicaidthat pays for treatment that might allow him to re-enter the workforce. That could lead to a downward spiral of sickness and poverty. Medicaid, like the rest of the American safety net, is intended as a failsafe for those not able to find work, and taking it away for those who cannot work subverts its purpose.Cutting Medicaid will also send hospital closures soaring, since, you know, sick uninsured people will still go to the hospital, but now the hospital won't be reimbursed.[Rural Hospitals in Greater Jeopardy in Non-Medicaid Expansion States](https://stateline.org/2019/01/22/rural-hospitals-in-greater-jeopardy-in-non-medicaid-expansion-states/)Its not just Texas: Nearly a hundred rural hospitals in the United States have closed since 2010, according to the Center for Health Services Research at UNC Chapel Hill. Another 600-plus rural hospitals are at risk of closing, according to an oft-cited 2016 report by iVantage Health Analytics. ...In Texas, expansion would make 1.2 million more people eligible for Medicaid, according to a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. An Urban Institute study in 2014 estimated that not expanding Medicaid would deprive Texas hospitals of $34.3 billion in federal reimbursements over 10 years.Without that money, many rural hospitals in Texas and other non-expansion states have closed obstetrics units and other expensive services, forcing patients to travel long distances to seek treatment at the next-closest hospital, which is sometimes hours away.","title":"Trump allies eye overhauling Medicaid, food stamps in tax legislation"},{"text":"I am worried that the troops picked to carry out the deportations will be screened to make sure they have the appropriate personality and attitude for the mission.","title":"Donald Trump Is Preparing to Use the Military to Carry Out Mass Deportations"},{"text":"Someone make it stop, how many more faces can the leopard eat?!!","title":"Project what now?

Yet nothing you've quoted, and nothing I've seen, indicates that there was any proof Manafort knew Kilimnik was an asset/agent, let alone that he took any orders (or even suggestions) from Kilimnik.  One-way sharing of some internal polling on one or, at most, two occasions is, again, a long, long, *long* way from the sort of collusion we spent more than a year claiming had happened.Even assuming Manafort knew Kilimnik was a Russian agent and he did engage in substantial collusion with Kilimnik--which, again, your quotes get you nowhere close to--that would only give you a single collusion-related indictment of a person \\"in the campaign.\\"  Where are the rest of the \\"bunch of indictments\\" you mentioned?","title":"As Trump looms large, can Keir Starmer save the world?"},{"text":"What Social Security?

New immigrants, legal or illegal,  take those hard low paying farm jobs because it is stull better than where they came from AND when they have kids, those kids born here, seek better paying less difficult work.  As farm workers get too old,  they get replaced with new immigrants and the cycle repeats.  Break the cycle and food will cost much more, either because of tariffs, food rotting in the fields, or farmers being forced to pay higher wages to bring in the harvest.God, MAGA cult followers are stupid.","title":"Trump confirms plans to use military to deport migrants after declaring national emergency"},{"text":"Absolutely.

Manafort was in continued contact with Kilimnik during the period in question, not a years previously and years later association. Manafort shared sensitive campaign data and strategy with Kilimnik. Kilimnik was more than a Russian asset, he was a Russian intelligence officer. Did you read the link?Through numerous regular email exchanges, Kilimnik conferred with Manafort after Manafort became Donald Trumps campaign manager in April 2016 and requested that Manafort give private briefings about the Trump campaign to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire and close ally to Vladimir Putin.[20][36][37] On 2 August 2016, Kilimnik met with Manafort and Rick Gates at the Grand Havana Room at 666 Fifth Avenue.[38] The encounter which, according to prosecutor Andrew Weissmann goes very much to the heart of what the special counsels office is investigating, included a handoff by Manafort of internal polling data from Trumps presidential campaign to Kilimnik.[39] Gates later testified the three left the premises separately, each using different exits.[39]According to Muellers court filings, Kilimnik was still working with Russian intelligence when, during September and October 2016, he was known to be communicating with the Trump campaign. Both Rick Gates and Paul Manafort were in contact with him at the time.[15] Manafort has said that he and Kilimnik discussed the Democratic National Committee cyber attack and release of emails, now known to be undertaken by Russian hacker groups known as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.[30]Kilimnik and Manafort had been involved in the Pericles Fund together, an unsuccessful business venture financed by Oleg Deripaska.[13] In July 2016, Manafort told Kilimnik to offer Deripaska private information in exchange for resolving multimillion-dollar disputes about the venture.[13]In a 2018 classified State Department assessment, Ukraines former Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko allowed Kilimnik to escape from Ukraine to Russia after the US federal grand jury charged Kilimnik with obstruction of justice.[21] The New York Times reported on 31 August 2018 that an unnamed Russian political operative and a Ukrainian businessman had illegally purchased four tickets to the inauguration of Donald Trump on behalf of Kilimnik. The tickets, valued at $50,000, were purchased with funds that had flowed through a Cypriot bank account. The transaction was facilitated by Sam Patten, an American lobbyist who had related work with Paul Manafort and pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent.[40] Kilimnik attended Trumps inauguration.[41]In January 2019, Manaforts lawyers submitted a filing to the court, in response to the Special Counsels accusation that he had lied to investigators while supposedly co-operating with them. Through an error in redacting, the document accidentally revealed that while he was campaign chairman, Manafort met with Kilimnik, gave him polling data related to the 2016 campaign,[21] and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan with him. Most of the polling data was reportedly public, although some was private Trump campaign polling data.[a] Manafort asked Kilimnik to pass the data to Ukrainians Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov.[42][43] Manafort also asked Kilimnik to pass polling data to Oleg Deripaska who is close to Putin.[21] In its August 2020 final report on the 2016 election interference, the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee characterized Kilimnik as a Russian intelligence officer who worked with Manafort while he was Trump campaign manager to deflect suspicions of interference away from Russia and onto Ukraine.[3] The report mentions Kilimnik about 800 times,[53] although most of the details about his intelligence connections were redacted. However, the sharing of intelligence with Kilimnik by Manafort and others represented a grave counterintelligence threat.[3] The committee acquired sufficient evidence to assert that Kilminik may have been involved directly in the plot, not only to hack the Democrats computers, but to pass on the information to WikiLeaks.[54][55]","title":"As Trump looms large, can Keir Starmer save the world?"},{"text":"Dude caved to the fast food peer pressure real quick","title":"Trump forcing RFK to eat Mcdonalds"},{"text":"A suspension of the constitution literally violates the oaths those officers took","title":"Trump confirms he will declare national emergency to carry out mass deportations"},{"text":"Death or Lies ?

Those big tax refunds would not be happening without those. So in reality a low income waitstaff worker who has kids would be worse off by making tips non-taxable.

That is all it does.For better or worse, that's not really true. In 1997 [Adrian Thompson used evolutionary programming](https://gwern.net/doc/ai/1997-thompson.pdf) to create an FPGA that could identify the presence of a particular tone, despite having no hardware designed for tone detection. That was AI coming up with original ways to use hardware *27 years ago.*\\"But Mr. Carob,\\" you'll say, \\"LLMs aren't using evolutionary programming like that.\\" And you'd be right. But they can explain evolutionary programming. They might even be able to design an experiment using evolutionary programming. And if they can explain it, and they can design an experiment using it, the only thing standing between them designing an experiment and running an experiment is integration code giving them API access to the necessary systems and equipment. LLMs don't really have to get better to be able to do that, we just need conventional programming to connect them to the appropriate systems.At the end of the day, most innovation comes down to identifying a problem, determining how you'd know when you had a solution, and trying a bunch of different things at the problem until you've identified a working solution. To avoid an exhaustive search of the problem space, you develop intuitions around when you're getting closer to a solution and when you're drifting further away and stop trying things that are taking you the wrong direction, effectively pruning off large portions of the search space. There's nothing involved there that LLMs are inherently incapable of, we just haven't had access to them for long enough to develop the integrations that would enable them to do it.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk is going to have too much power in the future of AI."},{"text":"Source?

Not sure if serious? Trump's famous for horrible fearmongering about immigration and alarming attacks on immigrants, both around his first term and actually ratcheting things up [this time around](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/12/trump-racist-rhetoric-immigrants-00183537).  \\"They're eating the pets\\" ring a bell for example? And calling immigrants [vermin and poisoning the blood of the country](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-03-22/factbox-bloodbath-vermin-animals-trumps-rhetoric-on-the-trail) is straight up Hitler talk. During COVID, Trump was not antivax nor pushed it's agendas. He left it up to states and even got vaccinated himself. Eventually. He denied Covid even was a thing at first. [Maybe this will jog your memory](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/timeline-of-trumps-covid-19-comments/). You don't remember all the bullshit about Ivermectin and how horrible Trump handled this? The absurd attacks and threats on Fauci? Ivermectin etc? I'm going to ask you, what if it was found out that COVID vaccines were in fact NOT thoroughly tested and we took a giant risk on people's lives? Are you open minded enough that, that revelation could change your mind? What if? Vaccines aren't a new technology, and they not only worked in the United States but all around the world. Vaccines are an obvious solution to controlling a global pandemic. We have advances in high tech medical technology now and understanding of how the human body works that allow for far more predictable results than randomly injecting people and hoping for the best. Multiple Covid vaccines were developed by different experts that all worked, with minimal cases of any bad reaction.  RFK questions a lot of things and I've said in other comments that we shouldn't blindly look at that as anti science.[RFK Jr is well known to spout complete bullshit](https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-factchecking-robert-f-kennedy-jr/) and spew fringe conspiracy theories for personal gain. He's an [anti-vax lunatic](https://apnews.com/article/how-rfk-jr-built-anti-vaccine-juggernaut-amid-covid-4997be1bcf591fe8b7f1f90d16c9321e) and is no more qualified to give medical advice than Alex Jones or Joe Rogan.People make fun of RFK Jr for dumping the bear carcass in central park but the part that bothered me about that, which people don't seem to talk about, is that *he expected somebody else just to clean up his own mess*. Some poor park employees who aren't getting paid enough for that shit. And that's how he will treat America's health. He will make huge messes and slink away and somebody else is going to have to clean up the mess. Have you heard any stories of businesses paying the illegals extremely low wages to get their work done? We don't just lose jobs but also revenue in taxes.Undocumented immigrants [pay loads of taxes](https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/). And granting lawful resident status to undocumented workers would only increase the amount they pay into the system.Certainly when companies pay less than minimum wage, that is bullshit. But why not go after those companies to fix that problem? It would be a hell of a lot more efficient, and make a lot more sense, than disruptive mass deportations. On your last point, I think you're misunderstanding the right wing media reporting Kamala Harris ran on trans inmates rights. They reported that that's what she ran on in 2020 and suddenly she's flip flopped on so many policies. Do you not see that as well?I am well aware of the advertising campaigns against Harris, including focusing prominently on her 2019 comment about supporting trans inmates. I also find it likely that far more money was spent on those messaging efforts than what gender-affirming care for a minuscule fraction of prison inmates would cost over a period of decades. How is the illegal alien working for dog wage any humane? Plus, why should we accept them at all? There's a legal way to do things, you're more than welcome, but illegally it hurts us all. We HAVE to agree on this basic point. I don't agree that immigration hurts us, even illegal immigration. It's a net positive overall. We should be looking for ways to make it much easier for immigrants to get legal status - doing that would also make it simpler to identify actual criminals and dangerous persons, who are of course only a fraction of immigrants.If lowering crime rates is a reason to go after immigrants, we'd have better results [deporting \\"normal\\" citizens](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate) than immigrants.To end this, I'll just say, if Russia hoax was founded to not be a hoax, he'd be in jail already. They haven't found anything conclusive that's why he's not in yet. They've found more dirt on Hunter Biden than Trump, yet he's immune. As an act of bipartisanship, Trump however has come out saying he'd pardon Hunter so there's that. This circular logic overlooks the fact that it's extraordinarily difficult to prosecute a current or former president. We've seen how ongoing investigations have been wrapped up just since the election, as it would be practically impossible to pursue them while Trump is back in office. That doesn't mean Trump is innocent, and those legal protections [did not extend to his associates](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us/factbox-people-indicted-convicted-investigated-in-trump-russia-probe-idUSKCN1LU2BH/) who did face legal consequences.They've found more dirt on Hunter Biden than Trump, yet he's immune.He partied with consenting adults? (unlike Matt Gaetz lol) Didn't allegedly assault anyone. Got charged for lying about drug use on a background check? Hardly a menace to society here, and he did not get off the hook. And more importantly he's just some random guy who happens to be related to Biden. Never ran for office. The Hunter Biden red herring is nuts. He's not an elected official or had any plans to be.","title":"Bill Maher says 'my head's not exploding' over Trump picking RFK Jr. for HHS: 'We do need shaking up'"},{"text":"Was applying for a federal job and pulled my resume.

By matching the tariff other countries charge us we at least level the playing field.They can eliminate the tariff they charge us, or reduce it. Either way, utilizing tariffs as leverage, ultimately leads to the opportunity for the customer to be charged less, with the reduction or elimination of tariffs other countries impose on us.

I gave another scenario using an oven that can't heat above 300 degrees unless you pay more or buy the gas company's brand of oven. I asked him how he'd feel about that and he'd say \\"I wouldn't like that! That's not fair.\\"He generally understood. I brought the focus back to the Internet, and said, \\"Now what if suddenly a website you visit can't be visited anymore unless you pay more, or, if you don't, the website runs slow or is blocked? What if you couldn't stream movies over Netflix because your ISP has a movie platform they want you to use, and to use Netflix you need to pay more for your monthly Internet service?His response: \\"I wouldn't like that! That's not fair.\\"So I said, \\"That's exactly what President Obama is working to ensure doesn't happen by keeping net neutrality in place.\\"Him: \\"No, I disagree, we need competition, and net neutrality limits competition. It's bad and we shouldn't have it in place.\\"He understood everything, related to everything, and was against it, until I said \\"Obama.\\"Anyhow... the moral of the story is, screw any idiot who wants to destroy the Internet in the name of telecom lobbies.

Why? So they can make entrance into the market near-impossible for other players to compete. If you want AI to prosper and grow, it needs realistic regulations, not utopian ones.If we remember, Elon Musk was a major proponent against OpenAI's play for more private work because he wanted it to stay open source.Lets talk about AI.Whate we have now is not AI, its more like \\"AI\\". It has little to no actual value. It costs way too much money to generate just a search model (let alone anything more valuable). The RAM and energy usage to use the search model is drastically higher (by two factors) than regular searches, with menial gains.Right now everyone is using OpenAI as their baseline , the issue is GPT 3.5 was built off of 100 TB of text data and it took two super computers two weeks to generate the model (a cost in the deep 9 figures).Ask Gemini or ChatGPT the average income in USA and Canada, they will give both answers back in dollars, even though they use different currencies. Whereas any intelligent search would see the two queries and understand it needs to be in the same units.Elon Musk is one of the few people (in the world) who could actually assist with AIs growth, since he has dealt with so many different companies and firms, some successful (SpaceX and Tesla) and some not (Solar City and Boring Company). The issue is that most people who want to talk about AI and what needs to be done to nurture it's success are either tech gurus or activists.Tech Gurus and activists do not care about it's success, just what they can do to get them more money in the future. Look at V1 of Gemini, it was so poorly made by trying to \\"correct\\" for responses, the CEO of Alphabet had to apologize to everyone for the fact it offended everyone (equally).Look at California's new bill around responsible AI, it's going to drastically increase the cost of getting into AI for start-ups. This is on top of the inordinate costs of running models, Amazon and Microsoft are looking to build their own nuclear reactors to power it.If we want AI to succeed, we need smart people who understand business and technology, not sociology majors who read a headline on Facebook and are now experts on the subject matter. Elon should lead the effort, not because of who he is, but what he will do. If we use examples from all his companies he will instead hire the best and brightest and give them all the rope they need to succeeds (or hang themselves with it). He will take considerations where they are needed, but anything that doesn't actually help the product (but is more virtue signaling and hurting the outcome) will be pushed aside.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk is going to have too much power in the future of AI."},{"text":"TikTok and instagram have ruined the minds of young people.
