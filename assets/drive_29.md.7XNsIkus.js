I agree that Trump killing the bipartisan immigration bill was a cutthroat political move. Trump did not want to hand Biden a win. And in the short run, he believes chaos at the border is a winning strategy for him.  But if Trump should regain the presidency, I do believe he will make good on his promises to implement what is outlined in Project 2025, such as ending protections for Dreamers, using temporary facilities like tents to do a mass detention of immigrants, and removing violence as a reason for an immigrant to seek asylum. Of course, Trump will once again have Stephen Miller, to help launch executive orders that will target millions of immigrants and their families, or in Millers words, Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown.  Of course, during Trumps first term, Miller was largely responsible for some of the administrations most draconian and cruel policies, including its Muslim ban and its family separation policy.

The bipartisan bill was arguably the best negotiation of bipartisan interests in recent memory.  But it was a compromise. And that is not Trump. He doesnt quit. He doesnt shut up. He doesnt admit defeat. Thats his character on this issue and this thread runs true to an extreme fervor. Trumps official platform is that he wants to conduct the largest deportation in history (official platform statement number 2).  This compromise would have been woefully short of this and not at all consistent with his vision for making America great.

Unlike the hordes of store-bought flying monkeys that regularly assault our sunny shores here at WoTB, the actual real-world dem voters with whom I used to associate are being *very* quiet this cycle. There are a few, of course, who hate Trump more than death itself- the usual array of TDS-related syndromes always manifest with them. But a sizable number are really uninterested in talking politics *at all*, and frankly- the silence is downright wonderful. These are the active-dem people who *didn't* walk out of our county convention with myself and most of the other Sanders representatives in 2016. That was the year that the party \\"leadership\\" summarily overturned the overwhelming Sanders caucus wins, and threw the county's delegates to the state convention entirely behind HRC (and banned all debate as well). I don't even have to remind them of that inconvenient fact to have them see me coming and walk the other way, this cycle. That is quite an unexpected feeling of power.I do honestly believe that a large number of semi-politically-aware dem-leaning people have watched the 2024 dem travesty unfold, and are left very disquieted. I think it more likely that many will simply stay home, rather than voting repub. But there are definitely some who are planning to do exactly that. Can't blame 'em.It seems to me that the dem management's patent willingness to stoop to *any depths whatsoever* to keep the empty-suit puppet-show going has hollowed out their formerly solid voter support, hereabouts. Well, that, and their unceasing drive towards World War III. That might have something to do with it. Just imagine if the news actually covered that.I could be totally wrong, but the utter lack of Harris yard signs is pretty telling- whereas the usual and expected huge jacked-up coal-rolling pickups, festooned with American flags and Trump spooge, are literally everywhere.There will be popcorn popped come the first Tuesday in November. And the book to follow will very likely be entitled \\"What Happened (Again)\\". I'll be very happy to drop off my Stein vote in the county dropbox as soon as the ballot arrives in the mail, and then sit back and watch the fun- assuming, of course, that the current dem administration doesn't manage to get us vaporized before then. Where I live, we're within fireball radius of no less than 5 priority-1 targets, so we'll be the first ones to know when the balloon goes up...Oh, and on edit: **check your voter registration status early, and often**. The method for checking varies from state to state, but can almost always be done quite trivially on line via the Secretary of State office in your state. The DeRP splinter parties, via their respective lawfare addictions, have gotten large numbers of voters deleted from the registered-voter rolls in several states. In years past, people have been surprised when their ballots didn't arrive, or their name didn't appear on the rolls when they went to vote in person on election day. If you still care about your voting rights, it is easy to find out if you have been one of their victims (collateral damage, nobody could have foreseen, and the usual litany of dem electioneering excuses). And right now, it is early enough that you can *correct* it, should you need to do so.","title":"I can't help but feel like there's gonna be more \\"shy Trump voters\\" this cycle"},{"text":"You mean in 2020?

The same bill literally gave 3 times as much money to Ukraine.Wrong. Ukraine aid was passed in a different bill along with other foreign aid.

That we should kill using deadly force for trying to cross the border? Sinking a ship that may have children on it is a bit cruel, I can see that you've already convinced.Are you by any chance an atheist or do you identify with some religion? Could share that with me? \\nYour religious views have nothing to do with this matter, but I do something like a survey of religious beliefs every time someone makes a morally cruel proposal or present unethical view. \\nThere is plenty of those cases on reddit, so that kindly made me curious because even though I didn't met so far someone truelly evil here in more of those cases person have rather good intentions, but it's clearly visible, that many people have some issues with defining when presenting views that are way out of line.\\nHowever, I think that your approach to securing the border is valid. There are some moral implicatiobs whe letting illegal emigrants in, and I think that not regulatade immigration can get out of hand. when you don't have the right resources to train newcomers and integrate them into the job market, you're basically condemning them to live on welfare, bordering on poverty, on the fringes of society. This is passed on between generations, so you're condemning not only the person, but also their descendants to live outside of society. It's inhumane to not take that into account and let everyone in. Every country should be careful when taking responsibility for someone's life.So I would only suggest replacing deadly force with a simple stop and turn back without letting anyone into your territory. It certainly will not solve the problem definitively like killing, but the border guard will improve their procedures over time and make it so that the people carrier will not be worth it. Additionally, publicizing that the border is closely guarded and no one will be allowed in will weaken some people's enthusiasm to set off.","title":"CMV: Countries should use deadly force against illegal migrants much more frequently"},{"text":"Republicans will remove the filibuster if they ever have a supermajority.

Statement from HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra:HHS launched our Health Workforce Initiative last year to make sure our country has enough health workers, and that those health workers are receiving the support they deserve. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to invest in recruiting, training, and supporting the health workforce, so high-quality care is accessible for all, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. It is especially important that we address workforce shortages in underserved and rural communities, where access is often lacking.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $100 Million to Grow the Health Workforce"},{"text":"I mean who really cares about what the voters in Omaha think? -Lindsey graham","title":"South Carolina Republican Sen.

Who said Israel is committing a genocide? Tiktok? As for Apartheid, it's not. Palestinians have had plenty of opportunities to agree to a two-states soltuion. They still have that opportunity. They are stateless by choice, not by force. And they are not entitled to Israeli citizenship.  The whole rules based international order is based on preventing these crimes yet the US is facilitating them in Israel. That's the point. Israel is not committing any of the crimes you are accusing it of committing. You want to know what Apartheid is? Look at the Middle East. Every country in the Middle East outside of Israel is some kind of gender, religious, or ethnic apartheid. There are countries in the Middle East where women are not even allowed to speak in public. Or, maybe even look at the history of Jews in the Middle East. Oh, and by the way, speaking of Apartheid, 22% of the West Bank is comprised of Jew-free zones. Meaning, Jews are not allowed to enter those zones of Area A for whatever reason. That's what Apartheid looks like. But since Palestinians are not allied with the West, even tho they are one of the biggest recipients of aid from the West, they are allowed to do whatever the fuck they want and we won't bat an eye. Heck, we'll even march to express our support for their cause to \\"free Palestine from the river to the sea\\" and make the entire Levant a Jew-free zone.

Her email scandal looks tame back then and was clearly Russian intelligence but it (along with Pizza Gate) clearly worked where it counts.The electoral college is a malignant institution that has plagued our nation since it's inception. It's entire pretense is to give more power to states where less people live and doesn't make sense. However, until it's gone, the popular vote is just a number. Hilary failed to achieve decisive wins in key states and failed to appeal to broader audiences than the party so she lost.Kamala feels like a breath of fresh air in comparison. I supported her when she was running against Biden and the Kamala vs Pence debate really sold me on the ticket. Biden for me really highlighted how awful our two party system is and I felt like I was voting for the candidate that I still disliked but despised a lot less than the alternative. I'm feeling a lot better about this election than I was six months ago.It also is worth noting that watching the repubs, a party now solely running on and consisting of derision and hate, self-destruct and devour themselves while it feels Dems are coming together has been empowering, entertaining, and exciting.

American arms embargo would absolutely hurt it, but not nearly as much as it would in the 80s. Further, in the 80s, Israel began a strategic stockpiling of American munitions. They already have a vast amount, enough to continue prosecuting their war for some time. Indefinitely? No, of course not. But they have much more significant avenues to resist American leverage on the point of an arms embargo than they once did.On the flipside, there are severe political and IR consequences to freezing sales to Israel for the US, especially this administration. Like it or not D's rely on voters sympathetic to Israel, if not necessarily the current administration. If, following an arms embargo the Israel, some new terroristic threat like 10/7 occurred again, voters could (reeasonably or otherwise) blame the US for contributing to it. Further, like it or not Israel is an imperfect democracy in a part of the world without many others, and it is actively threatened because of its identity as a Jewish state. There are legitimate IR reasons to supporting its existence independent of the current abhorrent war and leadership.The calculus has shifted significantly from the 80s.

He knew this was something serious in the Middle East and he keep goading it.American Presidents have been promising to do this for decades.  Trump actually did it.  Israel did it long ago.  It was only a serious issue for Israel's enemies, which were never going to be made happy. His weakness enabled Putins action in Ukraine, Chinas retake of Bangkok and its threats to Taiwan.Had Putin been counting on Trump weakness to invade Ukraine, he would have invaded while Trump was President.  Notice how all his invasions took place before and after Trump's Presidency. Chinas retake of BangkokWhat? and its threats to Taiwan.China has been threatening Taiwan for half a century.  It is now poised to invade Taiwan, and Biden has put us in a position where we probably can neither prevent it nor act before it is over. I recall one of those UN meetings and he again tried to BS the international community and everyone laughed. I recall that meeting too.  Trump warned the EU against becoming dependent on Russian natural gas, and they laughed at him.  They're not laughing now, and are reactivating mothballed nuclear plants because they had to use coal for heat after Russia cut off their natural gas supply.Incidentally, everyone was very angry about Trump's threats to the EU regarding their military spending and NATO.  Those threats got EU countries to substantially increase their military spending and meet their commitments - which they are very happy now that they did.  We no longer live in the WWII era where you can rebuild a modern military in a year or two. The truth however is China and its allies are eager for Trumps return to build more on BRICS and destroy US and its allies economically.Biden's weakness as demonstrated in Afghanistan (and his public statement that the US might not respond if Russia's invasion of Ukraine wasn't too serious) are what caused the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Biden's decision to not enforce Iran sanctions enabled Iran to arm, train and fund Hamas and Hezbollah for the attacks on Israel.  His awful international diplomacy caused Russia to move to the Chinese Banking system, and Saudi Arabia to allow the Petrodollar agreement to expire.Next month, there will be a BRICS meeting in Russia, which 126 countries are attending, which will determine whether the dollar remains the world's reserve currency.

The old talking fillibuster went away when the Senate adopted the \\"Multi-tracking\\" procedural system. The old procedural system worked similar to Roberts rules of order.  Only one bill could be \\"on the floor\\" at any point in time.    A member had to move to consider the bill, and then once it was on the floor, it remained on the floor and under debate until one of three potential conditions were met: 1.  A senator moved to table the bill or send it to committee - which would pass on a majority vote, debate would cease and the bill would not pass. 2. No further senator wished to speak on the bill, at which time the bill would move to an immidiate vote.  However, any single senator could stop this by standing up and talking. 3. If senators continued to wish to speak, debate would continue unless a senator at some point made a Motion for Cloture (to close debate). 60 votes were required to file a motion for cloture.  If the motion passed, debate would close and the bill would immediately come to a vote. A fillibuster was the idea that as long as you had at least 40 members who were willing to oppose a motion for cloture,  a relatively small number of senators could indefinitely delay the business of the senate, preventing anything else from being considered, until the other side gave in. In some instances, even one or two senators could delay the business of the senate for days, and realistically, even 6-7 could delay business indefinitely. When they adopted the multi-track system they eliminated this idea and moved to a system where bills were given statuses for specific periods of time and votes were scheduled well in advance.  \\"Debate\\" sometimes occurs with less than 10 members in the chamber.  This mean that \\"debate\\" was merely an objection stating \\"I don't consent to closing debate.\\"     The cost of a filibuster dramatically decreased.  I'm fully on board with restoring the speaking fillibuster, however, it would look different in the multi-track system.","title":"Kamala Harris tells WPR she supports eliminating the filibuster to restore abortion rights"},{"text":"I have no idea how 538 comes up with those rankings; they rank the NYT as #1 in the polls and they just released a poll I consider truly hot garbage I think just for the clicks.","title":"Kamala Harris holds small lead over Donald Trump in Michigan, exclusive poll finds"},{"text":"One of the weaknesses of I will restore reproductive rights has been, the how of it all.

It has more to do with their personal frustrations, an emotionally vulnerable person is very easily manipulated. Same reason you got educated, intelligent people falling into religious sects and spiritual bullshit.

This thread is full of examples of intelligent people who were destructive to those around them, and moral people who aren't conventionally intelligent.The person buying up a neighborhood to turn it into boba tea shops is probably quite intelligent. It's gotta be a complicated operation to manage all those spinning plates. They probably just aren't thinking all that deeply about the impact of those decisions on the current residents, and moreover they aren't really incentivized to do so. Managing a huge development project is enough work without kneecapping yourself by staying awake at night thinking about all the trickle down effects on people you've never met. Even if you're earnestly trying to codify an ethical policy around what you're doing, you can't possibly know what the situation is like for someone else, unless they have a voice and tell you.That's why it's crucial that those people be able to represent themselves. They submit bids for their own interests against the interests of the intelligent person in question, those competing bids are weighed (in theory, equally; see: democracy) and then the hopefully intelligent people in government establish laws balancing the protection of the weak and the freedom of the strong. Sure, it's great if Mr. Boba Tea is SO virtuous that he puts restrictions on himself to protect the interests of the weak or unintelligent around him.

That's not \\"dealing with gerrymandering\\", that's *encouraging* gerrymandering to create a specific outcome based on partisanship. You're looking to form districts to produce a specific partisan result.Why is that \\"representative\\"?Let's say a state has a 60/40 D/R split in the popular vote. If we were to make **each district** representative, where *each* had a 60/40 split, then Democrats would win **every** district. Is that a \\"wrong\\" outcome, even though such is representative within each district?Your conclusion seems to focus on the state wide partisan control as utilizing the \\"winners\\" as representatives of the parties, rather than the districts themselves being representative of the people within such. That with a 60/40 split, you want to simply manufacture 60% of the districts to claim Democrat wins. But WHO is represented by that? You've reduced **individual** representatives to simply interchanbake figures of the party, where you assume one is represented by some other candidate outside their district to which simply share a party with. You're view is partisan biased. It doesn't seek actually representation, but what you ASSUME representation is through only a partisan lens that only cares about party control, not individual district representation. Based on the distribution of votes in the last elections (which is publicly known), the proposed electoral maps would be compared to determine which map most closely represents the popular vote, adding the difference between the proportions of districts won by each party in the last elections and the proportion of the popular vote. The smaller the cumulative difference, the better the electoral map will be considered.This seems similar to the \\"efficiency gap\\" which has so many issues with it. It perceives \\"wasted votes\\", because it only seeks state wide partisan control. It doesn't  consider the fact that a distinct with a 80/20 actually is greatly representative, as 80% with support the candidate and only 20% disapprove. But it while instead seek to **reduce** that representation to make MORE people within a district disapprove of a candidate, seeking to move those \\"wasted votes\\" of a clear majority are moved elsewhere.The \\"efficiency\\" is a **partisan** device seeking party control, not actually seeking representation. It's a perspective of evaluating gerrymandering that only furthers cracking/packing to acheive a specific outcome. One that I would argue is not actually \\"as representative as possible\\".","title":"CMV: The best approach to dealing with gerrymandering is not to avoid it, but to demand that it be as representative as possible."},{"text":"Im not usually a conspiracy person but I like to believe the media is intentionally misleading people about the polls because a close race will likely generate more views on their website, and also so that voters dont get complacent and actually vote in November.","title":"The endorsements keep coming for Kamala Harris  from Republicans"},{"text":"China lifted 800 million people out of absolute poverty.","title":"CMV: One way to reverse political polarization and improve politics is by restricting the free speech and voting rights of STUPID people."},{"text":"Well that backfired Mr. Trump.","title":"Haitian group files criminal affidavit demanding arrests of Trump and JD Vance for making false alarms with harmful lies about immigrants eating the cats"},{"text":"God bless.

They *should* be helping Ukraine, everything they've done should be part of the expected minimum, the question is how decisive they've been in doing it, and I'd say not very. At every stage, the west, and unfortunately that includes the US as its strongest member, has dragged its feet, delayed key decisions by months, failed to take the initiative on things like providing new types of weapons until the best opportunities were lost. And now it's happening again, with what seems to be the UK wanting to get long range weapons to Ukraine but the US blocking them from doing so. It's disappointingly slow.That doesn't mean he's done nothing right, I think the administration's had some wins, like the bold decision to release intelligence publicly showing Russia would invade.

Melissa Moderate voters are split for their second choice, whereas Trump and AoC voters generally preffer Melissa Moderate as their second choice.    \\n          \\nUnder IRV / RCV, Melissa is eliminated at this stage.  This is true despite the fact that she would crush either Trump or AOC in a head to head election.  We would end up somebody who \\"wins\\" despite the fact that a majority of people prefer another candidate to them.          \\n      \\nIf melissa voter's second choices were split exactly between Trump and AOC, then in this hypothetical, Trump wins the election.  This means AOC ended up serving as a spoiler, because she changed the winner of the election without winning it herself.  If AOC had dropped out of the election shortly before voting started, Melissa would have crushed Trump.  It also means AOC voters were punished for voting for their favorite candidate, because it led to their LEAST favorite candidate winning.            \\n         \\nThis even happened in a congressional election recently, in Alaska.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Alaska%27s_at-large_congressional_district_special_election .  53% of voters actually ranked the third place finisher ABOVE the \\"winner\\".     \\n          \\nThe problem stems from the fact that supporters of the 2nd place candidate don't get the same opportunity that supporters of every other non-winning candidate get... they don't get to express an alternate preference if their candidate does not win... because the instant their candidate is eliminated, the election is over.  I support just using a different system entirely, like STAR.  But as a patch for IRV, it might help a little if, after running the results the first time, they reran the results, except this time eliminating the original second place finisher (who we already know cannot defeat the original victor head to head) at the start, and giving their second or third choice preferences a chance to be expressed.","title":"CMV: The best approach to dealing with gerrymandering is not to avoid it, but to demand that it be as representative as possible."},{"text":"Yes.

She's bleeding out, on a ventilator, there's no chance of saving the baby. But there's a procedure that can save *her*. Only the doctors can't legally perform it, because the politicians in your state instituted a ban on that procedure because their donors don't like it for some reason. Your wife dies. And the next election cycle comes around, and it's time to either reelect these guys or vote them out. The problem is you're a *children's book author*, and you haven't taken a math class since high school. You were pretty good at it then, but it's been years and it's not something you use very often. You miss a question about order of operations and have to sit this election out.

My dad's political opinions are *insane*, and it's frustrating to think that his vote and mine will cancel each other out. But I think there are two main problems with your suggestion.1. Taking away representation from any group of people is not going to make a more just society. My dad may be insane, but maybe all the insane people in his retirement home are genuinely being abused by some system or policy. He deserves the right to express that in a political space.2. Even if we accept your premise that we'd get better outcomes if only Smart Enough?? people could weigh in, that would mean entrusting some entity with the job of deciding who meets the bar. There is nobody on this earth, including myself, who I would trust with that power. Even if you're trying your best to be a good guy, what an incredibly easy thing to fuck up. What an obvious bottleneck of power. What a prime target for corruption, lobbying, and coercion.It's so obvious that you imagine that you would be among the chosen elite, because you think you're smart enough for it. Imagine if you weren't. Imagine someone sees you trying to bring back the literacy test and just offhandedly says \\"oh this guy's a fucking moron\\" and now you've lost all your political agency until you can convince *them* that you're reasonable.","title":"CMV: One way to reverse political polarization and improve politics is by restricting the free speech and voting rights of STUPID people."},{"text":"Listening to Pod Save America and one of them talked about how people in these states with abortion ballot initiatives think they can protect abortion in their state by voting for the amendment and vote for Trump because he is better for the economy and they will have more money in their pocket.Somehow this also translates to them voting for Rueben for senate.This isnt how it works, but apparently this is want many Arizona residents believe.","title":"Trump Gets a Lift From Arizona Ticket-Splitters Backing a Democrat for Senate"},{"text":"The systems were often sent way too late.Ukraine asked for ATACMS missiles since the beginning, and they would have made a significant difference against the [Russian attack helicopters that were devastating Ukraine's armoured attack columns](https://www.ft.com/content/d8fe8941-3703-433d-ac7a-dab9ba500481) during the summer 2023 counteroffensive.

But by that point those helicopters had already destroyed large numbers of Ukrainian vehicles, and the counteroffensive by then had already failed.That mirrors the current discussion on allowing long-range strikes into Russia. At this point, the discussion has been going on for so long that the Russians have already made preparations for them, and dispersed and moved targets.

Trump doesn't need this job and he happens to still be richer than all previous Presidents. He gains nothing financially from it and people are still trying to assassinate him. It's people like LeBron James and Shannon Sharpe who think they know better for us who are the real assholes. How's those Diddy parties, LeBum BLaMes? I want Diddy to bring them all down. Shannon trashes people on X saying he's so much richer than them when Trump is still richer than them both but that's not how you measure a REAL MAN. If Shannon was shot at like July 13, he would be shitting bricks and exit the election. But these BLM libs want to always play victimhood to gain sympathy while Trump was nearly killed by centimeters and doesn't talk about it enough.Listen to Rick Harrison's speech on Trump during that Las Vegas rally. He describes Trump exactly how I thought he would be. Trump is trying to help and protect Americans like Reagan did. He's the greatest Republican we've had since Ronnie/Dutch. The greatest Democratic President remains FDR. Since 1945, we never had a Democrat really care for the American people.I've had Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in my lifetime, and they never seemed to give a shit about the American people. What really changed with Obama? They never had an ambition and grand plan for us like Reagan and Trump always had for us. Democrats are a bunch of grifters who say all the right words to gain financial benefits. I've seen the recent Reagan movie twice and you can see he cared about our safety from the Commies..I've been following Tulsi Gabbard closely and I think the reason she started to support Trump is because she too cares about the American people that Democrats do not. Democrats and their brainwashing MSM and censoring from Big Tech are the most corrupt political party of all-time and needs to be stopped. They're the scum of our society. We've only had 8 great Presidents in our history: Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, both Roosevelts, Eisenhower, Reagan, and Trump. Only one was a Democrat. Obama is the most overRATED President of the last 100 years. Never vote for Democrat after that rigged election that the MSM claims was legit and saying Trump had baseless claims for it. Then grill that same question to Trump along with January 6 while go easy on the hyena.

Trump draws in Low information voters that will believe anything he says, and he currently has the lead and narrative (somehow) on the economy. This doesn't translate to down-ballot votes though. My complaint about Harris is that she doesn't seem to be talking about the economy much, if at all. She barely touched on it during the debate. It's #1 for many voters. She has the abortion rights voters and she's on comfortable ground there. But she should be evicerating Trump's ridiculous tariff ideas; it would take all of 30 seconds to explain why it'll drive inflation through the roof.

Also, this article is right that Biden's legacy is threatened but not by relatively niche foreign policy but by Trump's win (which it correctly states there). Let's be honest no one cares about the Houthis that much and I doubt this is going to or is hurting Biden. Anyone who says otherwise I think is missing the forest for the tree. His legacy has both domestic and foreign parts, but the Houthis are like single digit percentage importance if any given the messy and long-driven situation there.On Ukraine, Biden is still an overall good but I will admit I don't like some of the feet dragging. However, I hopefully don't have to remind people that Republicans hold the house and a lot of them are numbskulls (to put it lightly) w.r.t. Ukraine. Biden could be more aggressive here I agree but I don't think it's completely wrong to be cautious when you don't really know if Russia will use nukes/have capabilities to use nukes. Because nuclear warfare is not something anyone should want at all. I/P conflict is mixed for me. Biden is definitely in ways getting the football pulled away from him but he's also dealing with two governments where neither are probably negotiating in good faith. The conflict is mired in complications and I think that's a wait and see. The article mentions of the \\"two-month\\" period where Biden hasn't done \\"anything\\" which I think is wrong but I also think is very wish casty and kinda stupid.One thing I'd say is that Biden can read the room and that the US doesn't really have much appetite for foreign intervention or playing a bigger role without some political backlash.

When voters can only cast one vote, there's no reason not to alienate, condemn, and demonize people who align with your political opponents. If you know they're not voting for you, then turning up support from your base at their expense is a win. There's zero advantage to finding common ground with people who have already decided they're voting for someone else, and plenty to be gained by turning your base against them.In a world with ranked choice voting, finding common ground is key. If you can go out and convince people who are aligned with another political candidate that you should be their second choice because you align with your candidate on X, Y, and Z, you're more likely to win than if you try to rile up your base by shouting about how those voters are deplorable because they disagree with you on A, B, and C.

I feel like, in this time in history, moving from being a Trump Republican to Democrat is a lot like deconstructing from religion. I did that about 20ish years ago and it was such a rough road. My entire identity had been wrapped up in my religious beliefs, which had been guided and reinforced by my family and social circle. When I left my religion, it dramatically shifted my relationships and I was suddenly left with few social connections. Therapy helped me process this, as did the eventual connections I made with new friends. They became my family (and still are, 20 years later!) I eventually re-established connections with my family, but they are pretty thin. I have very few interactions with my siblings due to their religious and political beliefs, and my relationship with my parents is pretty surface-level. I know that I cant change them, I can only make decisions for myself and for my own family. But its still sometimes emotional to think about what I couldve had, if I had stayed. Im glad I didnt, but that hurt still sometimes re-emerges. So to that end, I encourage you to find a therapist who can support you as you move through this phase in your life. And I really encourage you to find your people, whether that is through a sports club, gaming store (they sometimes host game nights which are fun!), a faith group that aligns with and supports your new outlook, or a hobby group. You might find them by volunteering with your local Democratic Committee, the animal shelter, food pantry, or library. Heck, you might even find those folks at work (like I did)! But theyre out there, waiting to support you. You just have to find them!","title":"I'm a former Trumptard turned Democrat because of Jan 6.

They are just afraid to open there mouths or they will get \\"forgotten\\" in the will. Which, to me, makes them just as culpable as the ones in my family pulling the strings. Using fear and excommunication from the family as a way to enforce control. They keep their mouths shut, or stick to their guns when around them. Even act as enforcers by whispering or guilt tripping others into shit because they are terrified that you'll rock the boat or sink the ship.I don't fear them. I speak my mind. I point out transgressions and moral ineptitude. I don't tolerate fear mongering and control through hate. Ever. And it has cost me my \\"family\\". I am advised not to go to family gatherings, holidays, and have been very constantly reminded I get nothing when my parents and grandparents are gone. All because I am an independent thinker. Who stands for rights and freedom. Not wealth and power. I don't care if I get shit from them. It would be blood money anyway. Anyway, the point is, that these peeps are vile, lying, backstabbing, bigots, bullshit artists and terrorists. And they try to crush people under the yoke of intolerance and religious and social oppression.You cannot negotiate with them. You cannot save those who do not want to be saved. The only thing you can do is beat them. Fair, square and in their fucking faces. Because the quieter we are, the more power they get.","title":"I'm a former Trumptard turned Democrat because of Jan 6.

You're not the only one that has been duped. Millions were with you.I can relate to how you feel. I got big into the liberty community in NH. The liberty community has some Democrats but most commonly functioned as a wing of the Republican party. I viewed it as we used the Republican party to change it away from conservatism and more towards our ideals. When MAGA grew, I expected all my liberty friends to oppose it. As we all had principles right? What I found is that for many, principles didn't outweigh the need to support Republicans and stick it to the Democrats. I've disassociated with a dozen or so FB groups I was active in and maybe 100 people in the community that I was social media friends with. I suspect this is where you are at. The good thing is, these people aren't real life friends and family. Focus on that. I suspect you are a person of ideals. And go in deep if you think it's the right thing to do. That's me at least.

Heres the obvious to everyone but Trump-lovers reasons why:1. Hannibal Lecter is a fictional character, yet Trump talks about him like the guy is not only real, but for some unknown reason, dead. That leads to the next point.\\n2. Lecter has most famously been played by Anthony Hopkins, a terrific actor admittedly, who is as far as I know as Im writing this, alive, well, and still acting. Brian Cox (who is the same age as Trump, I believe) once played him in an earlier movie adaptation of the book Red Dragon called Manhunter, and he is also still alive. If fact, I think every actor that has ever played the character is currently still alive, so I dont understand why Trump always calls him, the late, great, Hannibal Lecter. Its really fucking weird.\\n3. Lastly, no matter who played this fictional character, one thing is present without a doubt: hes a fucking cannibal!! Why does Trump like a guy that eats people so damn much? Maybe he just roots for the criminals, and thats a huge criminal act: murder and cannibalism. It still doesnt explain why he brings this FICTION CHARACTER (for the maga crowd, that means not real, as in a made up person.just so were on the same page here, I know he loves uneducated people) up in his wandering diatribes that last for-fucking-ever. Whats the point of it? Like I said. This is some weird shit. Now he wants Johnny Carson back from the dead? I had to look and see if this actually happened, cause it sounds like an Onion headline, but so did the Hannibal Lecter shit the first time. Trump needs medical attention in a secure environment (cause, again, hes also a criminal), not nuclear weapon launch codes or command of the most powerful military in the world.

Saddam was a pretty bad guy and I dont think anyone in Iraq, the region or globally shed a single tear over is ousting. But whats less clear in hindsight is all the misinformation and confusion that reigned in the year leading up to the war, much of it certainly manufactured by the cia. I genuinely think some people high up in the administration and possibly GWB himself were genuinely actually surprised after the fact to not have found wmds. If anything they hugely underestimated just how successful the first gulf war had been and the degree to which it had scared saddam straight. And honestly I think up to this point its just real politik playing out. Replacing saddam was a pretty neutral goal in the grand scheme of things, being wrong about whether a guy who had gassed the Kurds could actually have really turned over a new leaf is not that big a miscalculation.To me the really embarrassingly stupid and even evil aspect of the whole situation was the apparent complete failure to have any kind of plan for what was actually going to be done once they somewhat inevitably won the war and had control of Iraq.And I think there were two factors at play here. The first is just jingoism and incompetence. They really liked tanks and planes and soldiers and ships to the degree they forgot what a military was and that it should be used in pursuit of some larger strategic goal to be effective. They played soldiers for its own sake, not in pursuit of any real goal or purpose.It literally felt as if it had not once crossed anyones mind that they needed a plan and resources and allies for managing iraq after the fact. and once they actually got there is was simply impossible for anyone to define after the fact how that was supposed to look. this to me is absolutely the single most inexcusable aspect of the whole war. lie to everyone, reach your goals improve the world, this is just geo politics. but geez, you do actually need to have a plan beyond war machine go brrrrrr.Secondly and I think this also is somewhat obscured by the passage of time but I really do think the US was simply unprepared for just how absurdly over powered the us war machine had gotten relative to the rest of the world in the decade since the first war, especially in light of the various clinton era misadventures in the balkans and africa climaxing of course in the 9/11 attack itself. the us felt extremely weak and in some ways they were. but i think the factors that escaped the understanding of even the military people at the time was the degree to which despite a weaker decade the us military had still been investing in a variety of technological improvements. in particular the combination of networked warfare doctrine, backed by stealth aircraft delivering precision weapons combined with realtime video overwatch and close air support provided by drones proved to be an extremely effective combination. add in absurdly better ew and jamming technology up against by  then at least 10 year old russian tech that had recieved little if any support or upgrades and there simply was no contest.one only has to look at the comparative difficulty faced by the recently out of the cold war us military in dealing with iraq the first time around. it was almost an actually balanced fight that ended in a bit of a stalemate. some of that was certainly lack of political will but some of that was just coming out of the cold war the us simply was not yet the monster it went on to become over that decade. the us military of 1980s and 90s could be fought by regional powers and while certainly not beaten at least hurt in combat. the us military of the war on terror was altogether operating on a different level relative to anyone else and i really honestly think even tney were surprised by just how absurdly effective it was.all of which is to say i think some of the blame for the lack of a plan after the war can be traced to the us war machine simply outperforming even their own most optimistic estimations to a degree that meant it wasn't clear they thought they would ever actually have made it that far. maybe they thought it would have again played out the way the first one did with bit of a stalemate and a \\"oh shucks you mean these nuclear weapons\\" from the iraqis.more concretely i really think they thought that the post war management would have been able to coopt a much more functional iraqi government but instead within weeks there simply wasn't a government anymore.but yeah taking a step back from all this absolutely massive unforced error on the part of the us that continues to still play out today. isis, the exhaustion in Afghanistan and the chaotic withdrawal, putin in ukraine, knows the us public is wary of intervention and is thankfully for everyone fairly unsuccessfully trying to exploit this isolationist aftermath left over from it. i don't think its actually all done playing put yet unfortunately. historians will look back on it as a turning point for sure.","title":"What does r/neoliberal really think about the Iraq War?"},{"text":"But defining \\"art\\" and \\"artist\\" and how much death of the author should or shouldn't apply to your viewpoint (it's a scale in most cases, not an either/or) are all subjective. \\"Soy sauce\\" isn't subjective and neither is \\"stir fry\\" (I guess you could argue the pedantic of what foods are stir frys, but there's a general consensus).

Firstly that a machine produces these poems that are actually good in the first place. That it says something that represents feelings (that the machine has never felt) that the world feels like needed saying. That it gets published - by whom? Publishing a work typically requires a network of consensus between artist, publisher etc that the work is worthy. Then that it gets famous and popular enough that academics are critiquing it (how did it get popular? Who were its first fans, following the author since their small time days? What demographic did it speak to that caused the kind of cultural waves it takes to achieve popularity? What are these critics who critique it saying about it?)The problem with the kind of hypothetical youve created is that art is not just, pure aesthetic product.

What is the right of the people? To keep and bear arms.The predicate \\"shall not be infringed\\"- what does it refer to if not \\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms\\"? Let's see which subject makes sense:1. A well regulated Militia...shall not be infringed\\n2. A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State...shall not be infringed\\n3. the right of the people to keep and bear Arms...shall not be infringedSeeing as only #3 makes any kind of sense, and therefore is the only independent clause having a sensical subject and predicate, the other clause(s) are dependent, and thus the scope of the right is The People and not The Militia. The Militia can of course be referred to in a dependent clause as a reason for The People to keep and bear arms.You may also consider that dependent clause about the Militia to function in a limiting way, for example in US v Miller where for example sawed-off shotguns were banned because they were of limited use in the Militia.Edit: If you're really arguing that \\"a militia\\" is the subject, there is no way to understand the sentence at all. You're arguing on the basis of grammar, but if the result is nonsensical, you've gone wrong somewhere.

In fact, the only points in which Trump's economy was better was just after he got sworn in. This is very typical of a Republic Presidents because they're inheriting a strong economy from a democratic. The biggest issue that the economies facing right now is inflated prices due to corporate price gouging which is happening due to consolidation because of the increased amount of money corporations have because of the tax cuts under Trump. The best way to fix the situation is to have a democratic elected president as they will likely do corporate busting over Republican candidate which would likely continue to cut taxes for the rich.

That's just an amendment in that case, which you didn't get ratified. This is also sufficient to disqualify your theory by itself.* Most importantly of all: *even if* it did say \\"since\\", and *even if* you could ignore the last comma, your version would **still only be talking about militias**... so what was even your point in the first place? If the only justification or reason for arms is that a militia is necessary, then obviously you could pass restrictions on things so long as they didn't undermine the sole justification anyway. ...so... you could still have rules about assault rifles etc...So the argument is unsound x2 and invalid x1 Seeing as the militia arises from The People, it makes perfect sense for The People to remain armed.But they would ONLY have to to the extent needed for a militia, again even if we grant you all the necessary concessions to get there (which we shouldn't). You otherwise have to come up with an awkward explanation for why it doesn't say the right of the \\"militia\\" to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. It does. I don't need an explanation for why it \\"doesn't do\\" something that it does do.Non essential clauses like this modify and refer to the subject. It IS already inherently telling you more information about the well-regulated militia. Non essential asides and parenthetical clauses always do that. You have not explained why the right is granted to The People, and not just the militia.It ISN'T granted to the people outside of the militia. Again, you cannot read non essential clauses in a vacuum, that is gibberish, that's not how English works. They ALWAYS refer and expand upon the subject.
