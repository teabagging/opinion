In general it is fallacy for every land acquisition justification but lets apply it on example of Ukraine talks about peace.  \\n  \\nRussia threatens to use nuclear weapons if west supply Ukraine with military equipment. Now that alone would not be enough since it is [Appeal to fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_fear).

If we look at broader history then Russia already warred in Chechnya and took territory, Georgia and took territory, Transsinistria and \\"took\\" territory and now is taking on Ukraine. because of this we can logically assume that it will not stop here.

Trump has done nothing but bleed support for 4 years, likely around 20%. He got 74 million votes in 2020, so that would drop his vote totals to 60M. KH starts where Biden left off in 2020 at 81 million votes.  Let's say he lost a few million votes due to old people dying, boredom and natural attrition.  78M. During his huge boost in the run up to 2020, he got almost 15 million more votes than Hillary in 2016.  The drive to get rid of trump was HUGE.  With KH taking over from Biden and seeing the tremendous increase in expected turnout, I think she'll take Biden's 81M and increase to 90M.  And that's being conservative, compared to the increase in turnout from 2016 to 2020.  Anyway, now we're looking at a general election result of 90M to 60M.  Massive win.  Take the 30M vote differential and spread it across the states according to population and we will see red states turning blue.  Some swing states had differences of 15,000. Some states were won with 20-30K vote differences.  The increase in turnout that is strictly blue will swamp states that were close in 2020.  That equates to a decisive electoral victory for President elect Harris.    \\nOf course if the media broke it down like this, they would be accused of the most egregious violations of election interference, media bias and whatever else they are always accused of, so it's in their best interest  not to think too much about it.

So, not only will throwing away your vote not help achieve the ends you want to achieve, but it will also increase the likelihood that you are deported to Gaza by Bibi's preferred candidate to die with the Palestinians already there. Trump's SIL, Kushner, has talked about turning Gaza into a waterfront resort. Trump has said Bibi should just \\"finish the problem.\\" Being a single-issue voter is a bad strategy, but even if you choose it, it's clear that voting for Harris is better for Palestinians than any other option, and certainly better than any other *viable* option, since either Harris or Trump is going to win.And if you're going to be a single-issue voter, then why shouldn't others be single-issue voters on other issues? Why shouldn't other people be single-issue voters on Ukraine and say that Harris and Democrats will be 10000% better than Trump/GOP, and be willing to sacrifice your people like you're apparently willing to sacrifice theirs? Why shouldn't LGBT people, who will fare much worse here in the US under Trump, be single-issue voters and be willing to throw Palestinians under the bus to save them and theirs, as you're apparently willing to do to them? Why shouldn't people who care about gun violence be single-issue voters? We could repeat this exercise for literally every issue you can think of, because it's always possible to be a single-issue voter and to hang everyone else out to dry.The problem with your logic is, if everyone does the same thing and votes along a single-issue, you'll be worse off, because there are orders of magnitude more people whose single issue would be something from \\"not Palestine\\" than there are whose single issue *is* Palestine. If you want to play that game, you will lose. So your best move is to not play. And this is true of practically any issue, which is why I said being a single-issue voter is a bad move in the first place.I dont see any practical difference between the Republicans and the Democrats.Well, Bibi does. He has a strong preference for Trump, so maybe take that into account.However, what I do see is that Muslim-Americans are now populous enough to tip elections in several key states. I think the best approach is for Muslim-Americans to make it clear that their vote is a transaction that requires pro-Palestinian policy.Ok, walk us through this. You and others throw away your votes, Trump wins, he tells Bibi he doesn't need to hold back at all, cuts off all US aid to Palestinians, enacts another Muslim ban, engages in mass deportations, including of people like you. Once you're deported to Palestine and left to die (assuming you survive the concentration camps, etc), what is your leverage then? How do plan to demand a pro-Palestinian policy at that point?Harris can choose whether or not to court the Muslim-American population. In this election, Im sure that taking a pro-Palestinian stance will alienate many other voters, and maybe there are more Israeli single-issue voters than Muslim single issue-voters. But, in the long run, forcing Democrats to make concessions for the Muslim-Vote will give Muslim-Americans a boost in political power that will lead to more pro-Palestinian policy.Can you count? \\"In the long run,\\" a group that is numerically small will never have the leverage you're pretending you would have. It would take generations for you to become a large enough bloc that you can demand concessions like this through just reproduction, and, in the meantime, you'll be facing mass deportation, citizenship stripping, concentration camps, etc. European Jews still haven't recovered from the Holocaust, and it's not been the better part of a century. You will not fare better, and will almost certainly fare worse.Your only potentially winning strategy is to win hearts and minds, to get more people to side with you politically, and you're not going to do that by being a single-issue voter and sacrificing everyone else's rights and lives, alienating all those other groups in the process. LGBT people will see that you hung them out to dry, and will feel no need to risk their own safety for you benefit. The same will be true of every other marginalized group. TLDR: Voting D this election wont change the situation in Gaza AND will make the situation worse for Palestine in the long run, while voting third party wont change the situation in Gaza but will make the situation better in the long run.Wrong on all counts. The situation there is bad, and nobody here can solve it. Pretending they can, and then using their lack of doing so as a justification to hang tons of other marginalized groups out to dry will not make anything better for Palestinians, but will make things significantly worse for tens of millions of Americans, and Ukrainians, and Taiwanese, and Poles, And Lithuanians, and Estonians, etc. Everyone will be worse off in the long run, except Trump and other fascists, here and abroad.","title":"CMV: As a Palestinian-American single issue voter, not voting or voting third party is the best way to achieve my political goals."},{"text":"God forbid we start punishing people for thinking logically.Well be as bad as the left is eventually.","title":"Alleged Kamala Harris rally - spot the AI evidence"},{"text":"Set it up as a debate, with Kamala and an empty chair with a COWARD sign sitting on it.

Ive voted in every presidential and midterm election and most primary and local election in between. Maybe my upbringing wasnt as fun or comfortable as other kids so I had no choice but to care about these things, from the beginning I had an understanding of how all these events affected my life.","title":"Disappointing observations from a Kamala volunteer..."},{"text":"Heres to you, Mr. Robinson, your staffers hate you more than you will know, wo wo wo","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 22, 2024 - 44 days until election day!"},{"text":"They lost them which is why they protested.

This is consistent with their nuclear doctrine. We can  still use your argument in a hypothetical scenario of a hostage situation instead of nuclear war. In this scenario an attacker has a hostage at gunpoint and is surrounded by cops. He tells the cops if they move then he will shoot the hostage. By your logic it would make sense for them to immediately rush in and try to save the hostage because it will result in a 50/50 coin flip outcome - either the hostage being freed, or the hostage getting shot. The alternative is negotiating with the attacker to see if they can find a way to convince them to free the hostage. In this scenario the hostage may still end up dead, but the odds of them negotiating are more likely.

Now I have to establish that I still do no consider it justifiable, but in the same sense I did not presented question like that. I asked for changing view about nuclear threats as bargaining chip (i.e. it being fallacy in debate about land acquisition).   \\n  \\nGeneral rules of debate are that without consent of both sides you cant change rules. That means if China (expanding your example) would consistently threaten of nuclear response for standing in way of somehow claimed territory (lets consider it permanent claim in pure EU4 sense) before potential war and those claims would be unchanged (consistent) and would not be breached. Then some level of adequacy of their claim is there. Especially if their annexation of Taiwan would be peaceful (diplomatic). then USA would probably be agresor in that sense (which is justification but not that important for our debate). Now, limited number of permanent claims constitute some degree of stable focal points which can be considered as definite. So I see situation where nuclear threats would be sound. There are three reasons why I was torn about this. First I related this to RF UA conflict where this situation is different. Conflict is already ongoing and red lines were quite blur at best.  \\n  \\nSecond. We probably can consider some similarities between Taiwan and Crimea but results are also same it is threat to concede territory and even in span of hundreds of years I do not see why this trend would not continue (in this example because of artificial islands in South China sea). I.e. there is no guarantee they won't do it again.Third. Madman is basically logical fallacy where if he does what we consider false behaviour then implication could be anything. Since then we lack fundamental basis for debate since we are unable to presume what he will do next. I will give madman part of Poland and then he bombs Mali... Why did he do that? That does not make sense. Well because he is mad and my behavior would hardly change anything (Stalin type of madman). However in sense of madman in place of power there is another posibility that he is basically puppet of strong men (Eduard V. type of madman) and that means there is basically no madman in place of power. In both ways I can hardly imagine to concede anything.","title":"CMV: Using threats of nuclear strike to achieve land acquisition is fallacy (in regards of UA vs. RF war)"},{"text":"People are volunteering for Kamala Harris.

And why that means that our politicians, all of our politicians, are beholden to the 1% and not the 99% and have been for almost 40 years now? Putting that another way: people chose Harris.They did not. Biden was the incumbent and he decided to keep his VP for his second term. No one voted for Biden in the primary BECAUSE Harris was on the ticket. And you know it.And who would you exactly have chosen yourself, after every media-hyped possibility deferred?Irrelevant. There were at least three candidates who were more popular than Harris and who intended to run for POTUS in 2028. But now they will not get that chance until 2032...because the billionaire donor class choose Biden and then Harris (for 8 years, not just four, folks). But we didn't get the chance to hear from any of them, did we? every media-hyped possibility deferred? They did as they were told. They saw what the DNC and billionaires did to the front place Sanders in 2020 and how they put the last place primary candidate Joe Biden in the White House instead. So, they were told to play nice and they would get their chance in 2032...by the very people who have now proven, twice, that they chose the next Democratic president, not we the people.

It is against the rules of war to deliberately kill noncombatants. You aren't even allowed to kill medical personnel who have accompanied an invading force!

You will discover that the migrants are from Third World countries migrating to First World countries. They are migrating from poverty to opportunity.Granted, this sounds like further reason to be firmer about stopping border crossing.But the next question to ask is why are Third World countries underdeveloped while First World countries are so prosperous? First, colonialism. The First World physically colonized the Third World and removed resources to enrich themselves. Second, Neocolonialism. The First World economically colonized the Third World while installing local governments that support First World business interests. A prime example of this is the United Fruit Company.So why should we leave migration as a low level crime instead of a capital offense, as if migration were an invasion? Because neocolonialist practices historically and contemporarily keep Third World economies artificially depressed and local governments unstable, or ineffectual against rebels or criminal organizations, or worse, complicit in keeping the economy depressed in order to enrich themselves from foreign business deals.Global political and economic maneuvering created an economic system in which migration is how Third World people gain opportunities for leaving poverty behind. What should be done about this global geopolitical problem? That's a tough question without simple answers. But that's not your problem. Your problem is wanting a reason to not kill the waves of unwanted migrants instead of dealing with them through asylum and prison systems.

Illegal immigration is, well, illegal.\\n \\n But your view seems to be that violators of this law should be punished by death, which is something else entirely.\\n \\n Imagine someone told you, \\"I think people who jaywalk should be killed on the spot.\\" You might say, \\"Chill out man, they're human beings. Should they be shot just for crossing the street a little thoughtlessly?\\"\\n \\n Similarly, here, the vast majority of illegal migrants are just trying to make a better life for their families. They haven't hurt anyone directly, and don't plan to; the main issue is that there are so many of them, and they need services and supports to integrate successfully, which can overwhelm the cities and towns they move into. Our society generally doesn't kill people for something like that.\\n \\n Equally importantly: we don't need to kill people to reduce illegal immigration. In the US, for example, the Biden administration recently brought illegal border crossings down by a factor of 3, to early 2021 levels (link to data), not by killing migrants but by changing key policies regarding how migrants are processed. If Congress passes the so-cRight. I am not saying capital punishment for jaywalking. Hell, I would even accept banning capital punishment. But I have always thought of borders as military. Shooting somebody when at war isn't capital punishment. So you could say that the border of a country that is not at war does is not equivalent. But I am thinking that it is, that is why I used the word \\"invader\\". Now even in war, you don't kill everybody on the other side and so it should be with a border. People can give up, etc. But I am saying all of this because this is the crux of what I am trying to work out. I think of order within a country, e.g., laws and police, as being different than borders between countries, which I think of as a military concept.","title":"CMV: Countries should use deadly force against illegal migrants much more frequently"},{"text":"Robinson's campaign should call in Hershey Walker to salvage his campaign /s","title":"North Carolina Democrat on his opponent: Robinson exists because Donald Trump has lifted him up"},{"text":"Depends will endorse trump and Lazboy will endorse Vance","title":"Ahead of the presidential election, Ben &amp; Jerrys endorses Kamala Harris with new ice cream flavor"},{"text":"1.

I've always liked her, and I'm a Californian.She had to win elections to be in the positions she held long before she ran for president, so obviously she was liked otherwise she wouldn't have won those elections.She ran in an extremely crowded primary with Warren, Sanders, Joe Biden himself and a couple centrist \\"pick-me\\" candidates (Tulsi) and as a relatively low key name at the time she didn't have the recognition so it reflect in the poll results. It's not a direct reflection of what her candidate potential is. Plenty of candidates have been landslided in primaries prior to returning later to win the presidency e.g. Ronald Reagan, Joe Biden, Andrew Jackson. A lot of this is timing.We the people did not get to choose. We did not get a debate between potentials. We did not get a brokered convention.Take it up with your favorite alternatives because *they* were the ones who chose not to run against her. Kamala invited them to do so. It's a free country, nobody is forced to run for president. If Gretchen, Sanders, Beshear, whoever, decide not to throw their hat in, that's their choice. They got behind Kamala, so maybe go whine at them.In 2020, it took about a week for the billionaires to work the DNC and networks to move Biden from last place in the primary to the nominee apparent over Sanders.This time, they did it in a day.Like all of you, I will be voting for Harris because she is better than Trump...and because I was given no choice.Every day I engage with politics it is depressing to realize that I share the same vote with low IQ takes like this.

These laws are coming for you or people you care about one way or another. Now many bright young people do figure this out on their own, but others do need some guidance and maybe it's just not there.I also think social media has intensified this performative \\"cool contempt\\" young people tend to have for anything status quo. That stage is so common among us all. And again, it's a very human feeling -- but then growing maturity should lead to self-examination, and I think we have fewer older adults than ever trying to foster that.And let's never forget that scarier than any young person's apathy is the fact too many old people -- the cohort most likely to vote -- are also very likely to vote against the well-being of their own younger relations. This is actually disgusting but it is rarely addressed. And consciously or unconsciously, we can't be surprised if that attitude seeps through to young people and intensifies apathy. There has to be a sense of community among us -- ie, this particular law happens not to affect me, but it will be very important for the well-being of so many other people, and therefore I must support it.

When it comes to refugees, there are international agreements regarding how they should be treated by the country of destination. If the refugee is fleeing persecution, war or similar, then the international community has a obligation (moral and partial legal) to grant them access into their territory. That being said: bad economic environment in the country of origin is not a reason to claim asylum as a refugee. Countries also have a right to refuse refugees if they are \\"asylum shopping\\", they are supposed to remain in the first country which ensures their protection from said persecution. They are not refugees, even if they claim that initially.If your country is near a war zone or dictatorship, there may be reason not to shoot incoming people as they may legitimately flee persecution and have a valid motive for coming over, a valid reason you would want to be recognised by others if you ever find yourself in fleeing from persecution or war as well.One example which would be the polar opposite of your thinking would be South Korea: people fleeing from North Korea and wanting to escape their dictatorship are forcefully entering South Korea, without any paperwork. That being said, South Korea never shoots them down, they are welcoming them. I would have to say that my example is also helped by the fact that the South Korean government considers anyone from the North a citizen as well, which makes the process easier.","title":"CMV: Countries should use deadly force against illegal migrants much more frequently"},{"text":"Youll may never see me again He never made it out of Springfield.

While \\"I will use nuclear weapons unless you move the border back one mile\\" is not, because then what stops you saying it again and again.But there are other stable points that can exist.  One example is describing a red line long in advance.  Imagine China stated today that it will fully annex Taiwan in 2124.  It explained today the red lines according to which it would use nukes related to that annexation.  A hundred years is a long time!

If you havent already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.Recently I was made aware that AI of me falsely endorsing Donald Trumps presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. Im voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a womans right to her own body for decades.Ive done my research, and Ive made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find its much easier to vote early.

They created the [Growth and Opportunity Project](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/rnc-completes-autopsy-2012-loss-calls-inclusion-policy/story?id=18755809), and concluded that the party needs to court gay, black and Asian voters. Of course, Donald Trump himself is evidence that a party doesnt need to moderate in order to win elections. The Republicans were wrong, and Donald Trump won by embracing far-right rhetoric. The biggest example is the Republicans wanting comprehensive immigration reform, whereas Donald Trump ran on a policy of closing the border. Do you think far-right republicans would have accomplished nearly as much today if they had increased their turnout for Mitt Romney? No, not in a million years. The Evangelicals overturned Roe v Wade by dropping their support for Romney.Ultimately, the lesson to be learned here is that falling and line and voting for 1 of the 2 parties guarantees I lose on my most important issue. Voting third party gives me however small of a chance, even if 10%, 5% or 1%. The situation in Gaza will not affect America in any way no matter who wins.No, probably not for the vast majority of people. But Donald Trump getting elected will, and if my vote is necessary for Harris to win, the Ds better fucking try to get my vote. Thats the point of this post that you have yet to answer. American geopolitics or internal politics really dont mean anything to me - ending the occupation of the West Bank does. And yes, America absolutely is the world police. Thats why we stayed in Afghanistan after the death of Bin Laden, thats why we invaded Iraq, thats why we support Ukraine. We choose to enable Israel in the West Bank. More importantly, American foreign policy is a reflection of who gets elected. Im not saying that Palestine is the most important issue to the US. Obviously semiconductors matter more to the US than the West Bank does. All Im saying is that Palestine matters to me.  Beyond that, I dont care enough about who wins this election anymore.

This is what you're challenging people to change your view to - that both are true, right?Third, the distinction you draw between \\"Art\\" and \\"Content\\", while viscerally satisfying, doesn't justify itself. Why does what you decry as content (whether human-made, or AI-generated) not qualify as Art?All \\"content\\" made by humans has some level of artistic merit, though your mileage may vary according to subjective opinions, but that's not really relevant here. Anything made by AI is necessarily just content and not Art because it is made outside of any artistic discourse, which is essential to the process. By this I am referring to a wide variety of things which include things like childhood inspiration and understanding how art is perceived at different ages and through different experiences, the process of learning art as a human with its physical components and emotional frustrations and academic challenges, the process of discussion and competition with other artists, reflection upon one's work in regards to thing like self-identity or social purpose, and one's own emotional reaction to the process of creating it. There's way more than that, but those are some pretty essential things to art which cannot be included in any AI creation process.If you want to ask me \\"why are those essential?\\" then I'll have to tap out and refer you to someone with greater patience to explain since it would be clear you don't really know much about art history or art appreciation or creative communities.Keep in mind I am not just talking about the art product itself, but the function it serves in society, which includes discussion about all those things  by fans and admirers of the art (the artist's story, identity, where their work fits into society, etc.). AI art cannot be discussed in any context outside of technicality, and you should be aware that that is not how art is primarily discussed and appreciated.But these are the answers as to why AI art is not art and doesn't fulfill the same purpose as actual human made art - even if it fulfills the purpose of content.Anyways, to get back to what I think your main question was, I don't even see why that explanation is necessary. You asked how death of an author could be compatible with AI art not being Art. The answer to your initial question is the same I provided above: because content makes more money than high art and AI can create content.","title":"CMV: \\"AI Art isn't Art\\" and \\"Death of the Author\\" are mutually exclusive positions."},{"text":"Party of Law and Order for ya","title":"Kamala Harris Has Biggest Favorability Jump Since George W.

With multiple election losses by Trump, and losing the pop vote of the election he did win, plus all the MAGA losses in other elections throughout the country, MAGA will be a losing ticket going forward post-2024. However, the Republicans don't have much of anybody that could take Trump's mantle as an immediate replacement. There are candidates like Haley or DeSantis, sure, but none of them have the pull and appeal that Trump does. It could be another cycle or 2 after 2024 before Republicans have a viable candidate in a post-Trump climate. That should theoretically give Democrats a good chunk of time to continue cleaning up the mess from Trump, and re-establishing norms, rights, protections, and governmental guardrails, to prevent something like this from happening again.*Will it* happen? Idk. But I do personally have a feeling that what we've dealt with the last 10ish years is the dying last gasps of desperation from a party and ideology that if they don't get their vision done now, it's not gonna happen. That doesn't mean I believe the ideology behind MAGA and P2025 will just magically disappear and cease to exist. It will always linger in some capacity.

No matter what outcome you want, voting third party wont bring you closer to it. Theres just no clearer that I can explain that than many others already have. It is a critical and well-known flaw of our current system. It really doesnt matter what the issue is. Palestine could just as easily be literally any other issue, and voting third party wont accomplish anything in regards to that issue in any direction. Vote third party for gun rights? Nothing happens. Vote third party for abortion? Nothing happens. Vote third party for environment? Nothing happens. Do you see where Im going with this?Voting third party is like pissing in the ocean. You might warm your immediate area for a few seconds, and then it will be like nothing ever happened. As far as pressuring Israel? Its not that its controversial, its just improbable. Israel is a sovereign nation, and while it lines a few pockets to send them some rockets every now and again, actually pressuring them to do anything is far outside the scope of what America is interested in or perhaps even capable of. I know everyone likes to think of America as the world police, but we have our own very serious and rapidly growing concerns in the East. The situation in Gaza will not affect America in any way no matter who wins. Plus or minus a few hundred million for rockets is a drop in the bucket. But if China annexes Taiwan and suddenly half our chip manufacturing is gone? Thats a much more serious and immediate concern. We are not the world police. We cannot be everywhere at once. We have to pick and choose our battles, and Palestine has chosen its own battle as well. We have no reason to interfere except to occasionally send aid to our declared ally. You think if we stop sending them rockets theyll stop blowing up pagers or settling the West Bank? Absolutely not. Netanyahu is set on a full genocide, regardless of if its justified or not. Gaza 100% is not at rock bottom. Gaza will be at rock bottom when Netanyahu accomplishes his goal and there is no Palestinians left at all. Voting third party being a waste of a vote isnt an opinion. Its a well-established fact. Theres really not a huge amount of argument to be had there. Thats why were all trying to convince that there are other issues that can and should matter to you. So you can make an informed choice to actually vote for one of the two candidates who have any chance of winning.If you want to see what it looks like to make effective change within our government, look at AOC or Omar or Tlaib. If you just want to shout from the rooftops that you voted third party and feel proud of yourself that you accomplished something? Feel free to waste your vote and your voice.","title":"CMV: As a Palestinian-American single issue voter, not voting or voting third party is the best way to achieve my political goals."},{"text":"I dont get why people post shit like this?\\nBecause people consume headlines as facts, so it is easy to push out bullshit narratives to lazy scrollers.?\\nEdit: strollers","title":"Watch: Joe Biden snaps at aides over press conference confusion"},{"text":"He promised to.go away if he.loat the last one.","title":"Donald Trump says he wont run for president in 2028 if he loses election.

President Donald Trump had left the deal, and resurrecting it as one piece of a comprehensive approach to the regional and security issues Iran posed was meant to be a crowning achievement of President Bidens foreign-policy agenda.  Instead, Malley at times left his Western allies confused and was at odds with some of his key deputies. Within 16 months of starting, the talks were dead, and Malley ultimately found himself caught in a spiraling FBI investigation into whether he had improperly handled secret information, potentially moving classified materials to a personal email account. The man who was supposed to lead efforts to contain Tehrans regional and nuclear ambitions has been sidelined, his top-secret security clearance suspended, and placed on unpaid leave from government. The State Department continues to face questions over Malley, including from its inspector general, which in a report released this month said he might have been allowed access to sensitive materials even after his clearance was suspended.","title":"Bidens Iran Envoy Wanted a Nuclear Deal.

I bet you were expecting me to answer with a positive opinion and be flustered, weren't you? Now, tell me, as an advocate for Palestinians, do you support the US having a hard line stance for the the dissolution of Hamas? If not, why?\\nWhy dont you explain to me why Israel has strategically placed settlements on top of water resources, fertile land and valuable land??Because they are a colonialist power who violate international law. Tell me why Hamas advocated for the murder of 1300 Israeli civilians? Why are pro Palestinian protesters not advocating for the dissolution of Hamas?Why dont you explain to me why members of Fatah like Marwan Barghouti who have explicitly said they support a peaceful 2SS are in Israeli prisons?Fatah is a feckless organization that couldn't do shit. They had plenty of chances of working with Israel on a two state solution, but they could not control the corruption in the Palestinian state, and they folded like a wet noodle when Hamas came to power in Gaza. Barghouti is a militant who supported the first and second intifadas. He isn't the martyr you think he is, and Fatah has no power to help bring about a sovereign Palestinian state.Why dont you explain to me why far-right parties like Otzma Yehudit are allowed to be part of any Israeli governing coalition??Because Israel is filled with hard line Zionists? I love how you assume I am pro Israel simply because I called you out. LolWhy dont you explain to me why Israel is allowed to imprison Palestinians indefinitely without charge on administrative detention?Do you advocate for the release of Israeli hostages with as much zeal as you do for Palestinian prisoners?I dont know who told you that Algeria was a separate nationstate from France when the Algerian war of independence started.?Algeria was a kingdom prior to French taking it over. France conquered it, Algerians fought back, and a peace agreement was eventually signed. You know, like pretty much every modern nationa state on the planet. Palestine has never been a nation lead by Palestinians, and it's in Israel's backyard. Not a valid comparison.Do you think the same about Ireland and Britain? Ditto with Korea and India/Pakistan.Ireland was a sovereign country at the time of the troubles, and in case you need reminding, IRA terrorism didn't free Northern Ireland from the UK. Korea and India were civil wars which lead to separate nation states. Again, not the same thing.?Why do you think Palestine isnt an independent nation state today?Because Palestinians continue to be smothered with extremist rhetoric and raised to hate Israel. Israelis are much the same. If both groups really wanted two states, they could do it.Nelson Mandela was a convicted terrorist.??https://time.com/5338569/nelson-mandela-terror-list/Right, and the US and the rest of the world didn't give African liberation organizations the time of day until Mandela became a central figure in earning respect for the cause internationally, by not engaging in violence. Funny how that works, right??Regardless, Im not going to give up my issues for the benefit of others who dont care about my issues.?Even the slightest chance of improving the situation in Palestine matters more to me than any future I might have in this country.?So I assume you are planning to move to Palestine then? Because if you plan on living in America, that is fucking stupid.?Im going to be a doctor, soon. If Im not voting for social issues that matter to me, why shouldnt I vote based on tax breaks?You can vote on social issues, but basing who you vote on a single issue that has very little impact on American lives, and a hateful conflict that has been going on for a hundred years, doesn't make any sense to me.Edit: I know enough about you to know that you are a privileged, probably middle class American speaking on a topic you know nothing about.

Production errors exist and are usually not factored into interpretive analysis of art, though, the exploration of production accidents like that as intentional artist expression are definitely worth exploring. A quick search of what youre talking about yielded nobody praising the cinematography of Kiss Me, Deadlys ending and Wikipedia doesnt even mention it as an aside. However, I can imagine what you described as being the impetus for cinematography that treats the camera as if it is present, adding lens flairs to animated light sources or letting cgi water hit the camera. So, without knowing exactly what these French critics were saying, I cant say if their criticism was legitimate. If they were praising the films cinematography for breaking the fourth wall and the film makers were like oh no, thats a complete accident and we didnt even notice that until you brought it up then the only response should be oh, well, you should have done it on purpose then. And then the film maker gets ridiculed for pulling a homer and doing something great on accident or despite incompetency. But again, in relationship to AI art. This would be a case where nature created something that humans could derive meaning from, something humans have done since humans existed. Watching a flower bloom might be beautiful but it isnt art. Seeing the effects of a fire damage to film might look cool but without some kind of intentionality, it isnt art. Does the fire get cinematography credits? In regards to your final question: \\nIm not entirely sure what youre asking. The film is the film. We can go there are two separate versions of that film one with a damaged ending and one without, but if they are mostly identical minus the ending bits, the analysis is mostly the same, right? The rest of cinematography, directing, writing, acting, costumes, prop design, etc etc are the same. We can definitely discuss the differences and what the damaged ending might add to the overall experience vs the non-damaged one but I dont think anyone would consider them two distinct pieces of art for less than a minute of what amounts to a special effect.","title":"CMV: \\"AI Art isn't Art\\" and \\"Death of the Author\\" are mutually exclusive positions."},{"text":"No, it's the MSM's fault.

Now, I recognize it is still mid sept, and this could be that outlier poll as well. However, my point is that polls showing D leads in Texas for senate would make this a race that is much more D favorable than 2018 or 2022 governor. Its not like Beto was getting +1 polling and then lost. The biggest thing about all the 2024 TX senate polling IMO is that a solid 10% seem to be undecided across polls. How those people break will define this election given how many there are. Are they hardcore Trump voters that arent sold on Cruz but will vote straight ticket if they show up? Are they soft Trump voters that will stay home bc theyre unenthusiastic about both? Are they Cruz haters that just dont know enough about Allred and are persuadable? Given how known of an entity Cruz is, this high level of undecideds must have some reservations on him. Right now my slightly unscientific average of the last 3 538 polls indicates a 44D-46R race.

The problem is how easily people can use abortion time after time after time. Its irresponsible and isnt meant to be something people take advantage of like that. Ending a pregnancy is a major life changing decision for both the mother and child in question. I understand that everyone makes a bad choice in life they regret and deserve a second chance but even someone just having one abortion in life is too many times. It should never be taken lightly or be something any woman feels entitled to do whenever she wants to because she was too lazy to use proper birth control and keeps repeating the same mistake. Some women use it as a tool to hurt a man, some men use abortion as a tool to hurt a woman. Its broken. Most pro-choice people are not actually pro-choice. Theyre pro-abortion. They dont actually want women to voice their choice when it comes to deciding to keep the babies and care for them the best they can. They actually want people to abort. It is sick. Any man who tries to force a woman to get an abortion is one that need not be in the childs life.

Even in your film example, the effect may have been a technical glitch, but somebody chose to leave that glitch in. I briefly considered including in the OP an extra caveat about intentionality in the capture, and presentation of pre-existing phenomena, for instance, a photograph taken by a human photographer would generally be regarded as art, but a photograph taken automatically by CCTV triggered by a motion sensor would not. My counter was going to be that plenty of such accidentally created images have been hung in museums and reinterpreted as art, but I guess your argument would be that the decision of a human to isolate it, and hang it up imbues it with an intentionality which would not otherwise exist. A better example of what I was getting at would be the 1955 film noir Kiss Me Deadly. It ends (spoilers) with a nuclear fire destroying the house the main characters are in, and them barely escaping with their lives, before the film cuts to black. For the longest time, the only surviving copy of the film was a damaged one, in which the last minute is cut off, and the whiteness from the radiation seeps out, making the edges of the film stock visible. This was a complete accident, with the original filmmakers, and its distributers having no idea their film was damaged in this way. Several French film critics cited the film's fourth-wall breaking apocalyptic ending as a masterpiece of filmmaking, and wrote essays analysing its possible meaning. Unlike with TLToC, there was no intentionality here. The film ending this way was a complete accident, which only made it to the copies in question by an oversight.

Should we allow that gamble to continue? Its tough for sure. And believe me when I say that I empathize with those kids so hard, being someone who grew up in that exact situation. One of the hardest things to accept about the world is that you simply cant help everyone, you genuinely just dont have the resources nor bandwidth to do something like that, even though I can tell it hurts you a lot knowing kids grow up in homes like that. It hurts me too. I very much wish I could snap my fingers and all children growing up under archaic extremist religions could be whisked away to a loving home. Unfortunately even if I did agree with your view of banning minors from religious activities, it wouldnt really change much Im afraid. Jonestown, Waco, FLDS sexual abuse, Scientology all these horrible events were exacerbated by governments both local and federal pushing these religious organizations to be even more insular and running away to rural areas to practice in secret, even farther away from those that could help them. Animals backed into cages always fight, and such a ban could lead to them becoming even more extremist but now in secret. Thats far far more concerning to me. Definitely dont take my disagreement with your view on a ban as disagreement with your view that religious extremism causes immense trauma in young children. I couldnt agree more on that, but we know from history that trying to force people to change their views never yields the results we want and can often end in violence  we simply have to try to reach these people in other ways. Things like housing and job training/resources for those that escape religious abuse and are disowned by their support system for doing so, etc. Id also like tighter regulations and standards on things like homeschooling, as one of the biggest tells of religious fanaticism and abuse is keeping children from having a broad and diverse social circle. Its one thing to take your child to a youth group at church to make friends, its a whole other ballgame when you force them to ONLY be friends with people from said youth group. Many children who end up stuck in the cycle were never given access to circles of people different from them. Once children get a taste of that these tend to be the ones that leave and never go back.","title":"CMV: It should be illegal for children to attend (and join) religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues etc."},{"text":"Time to block The Telegraph.

There are qualities of a thing that could make it more art-like and qualities that could make it less art-like. On one end of the spectrum you have the Mona Lisa that everyone thinks of as art, near the other end you have a banana taped to a wall that intentionally gets people to argue about what exactly art is.Something not being created by a person has always been a quality that made something less art-like. A rainbow created by natural phenomena is not considered art, but if rainbows did not naturally occur and a human created the conditions to make one it would be considered to be art. This is an arbitrary distinction but it exists. AI creations don't involve a human artist so are less art-like. The fact that art criticism has evolved over time to focus less on artist intentions and more on the work itself could push the definition of art to suggest more things that do not involve artistic intention, but the spectrum of what is and isn't considered art has not changed drastically because of that.","title":"CMV: \\"AI Art isn't Art\\" and \\"Death of the Author\\" are mutually exclusive positions."},{"text":"Eh.

Fair enough, but it is literally impossible for them to be mutually exclusive if there are people who hold both of them. This post seems to technically suggest literal impossibility (I have a penchant for pedantism) and the only thing I need to do is provide a valid counterpoint.\\n2. I wouldn't consider the example you gave of The Last Temptation of Christ a \\"valid\\" interpretation (the nature of these things makes it impossible to argue in absolutes, so it can't be literally invalid). However, I would say many \\"fan theories\\" about various things are \\"valid\\" interpretations, regardless of whether or not the author has explicitly denied them. I think AI art isn't art, partially because something that makes art is an artist and I don't believe AI to be an artist. If art is only what is perceived, then it would follow that clouds in a recognizable shape are a style of art. I don't agree with this at all.In my opinion, art requires intent to make. It also requires intent to interpret. The artwork and in some senses the art itself are indeed solely the author's intent, but the interpretations of the art add onto it. If one culture and another culture interpret the same artwork in wildly different ways, they effectively have different \\"arts\\". The literal art and the perceived meaning of the art are both aspects of the art that people tend to consider separately before making a conclusion in their mind as to what the art is.I think many religious pieces of art can fall under this. I have no religious beliefs, however I can appreciate religious artworks outside of the meaning other people have. I can also understand and appreciate what the artist believes of god(s) given the art they've made, as well as assign meaning that has nothing to do with the artists intention. These are both aspects of the art to me, the sum of these parts being the whole.","title":"CMV: \\"AI Art isn't Art\\" and \\"Death of the Author\\" are mutually exclusive positions."},{"text":"Shes whatever her rich donors want her to beA faux progressive to appease the far left and a centrist to appease RINOs like Cheney and bush types","title":"Kamala Harris Is Not the Catholic Candidate | National Review"},{"text":"Yeah but will it translate into a win in the electoral college?

Its that since the author isnt around to tell you what they mean as you are consuming a piece of media, any interpretation of a work is just as valid as the authors. Part of literary discussion is arguing about interpretations and the author going well this is what I meant isnt a sufficiently good argument. One of the best examples is when talking about The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, a story written with the intention of showcasing what kind of working conditions lower class food producers have to endure and ended up highlighting about what no government regulations on food safety actually looks like. Art wasnt created accidentally, its just that once art is released into the wild, the artist cannot control what people take away from it. Even if your film example, the effect may have been a technical glitch but someone chose to leave that glitch in. They chose not to refilm the scene or edit around it so the glitch wasnt there. They left that in there. It could have been a stupid oversight they didnt catch until release or it could have been a happy accident that fit exactly into what the story they were trying to tell. The point is, its inclusion requires a deliberate choice made for an expressive reason, ranging from nobody will notice to its too expensive to redo to leave it in.\\nSo by that virtue, it isnt the fact that humans can draw meaning from what they see and hear even when intentionality wasnt there that makes AI not art. Its that AI art has no intentionality at all. It cannot have intentionality. The viewer can never derive meaning from the work that is contrary to the artist because the artist is incapable of assigning it meaning in the first place. To compare human inspiration to generative AI requires a severe amount of anthropomorphizing AI. Its equivalent to calling a printer an author because it put digitized text to page when printing someone elses story.

Funded by President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, these awards will support 25 new projects across the country to help ensure buildings meet the latest standards for energy efficiencylowering energy bills for American families and businesses while reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions and advancing environmental justice. Analysis from several DOE National Labs shows that building energy codes make the electric grid more resilient and help save lives during extreme weather events and extended power outages. Along with the $240 million in new funding recently selected through the Inflation Reduction Act to support the implementation of modern building codes, todays announcement underscores the Biden-Harris Administrations whole-of-government approach to lowering energy costs and ensuring communities are more resilient to extreme weather events fueled by climate change.  \\n...  \\nHomes built to todays energy codes are 40% more efficient than homes built 15 years ago, making energy costs a smaller fraction of household expenses and insulating hard-working families and underserved communities from volatile fossil fuel prices. DOE estimates that from 2010 through 2040, energy codes are expected to save Americans $182 billion on utility bills and reduce 900 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissionsan amount roughly equivalent to the combined annual emissions of 187 million gasoline-powered cars.The funding announced today is part of the $225 million Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation (RECI) initiative established by President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and administered by DOE's Building Technologies Office. This second installment of 25 selected projects builds on initial RECI funding of 27 projects totaling $90 million announced in July 2023. It will also help advance the implementation of DOEs Decarbonizing the U.S. Economy by 2050: A National Blueprint for the Buildings Sector, which lays out a national strategy to significantly reduce building greenhouse gas emissions while providing affordable, equitable, and resilient solutions for communities across America. The new cohort of RECI projects expands the geographic area and assistance provided under the initiative, supporting workforce development and other code-implementation solutions in high-impact states with substantial construction activity. The projects will also expand stakeholder engagement opportunities through tailored rural and regional collaboratives and develop new resources, standardized policies, and research and data collection methods to support jurisdictions across the country.  \\n...  An example list of recipients and the scope of their projects is in the press release, a link to the full list is at the bottom of it. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:The Biden-Harris Administration continues to use all the tools at our disposal to lower energy costs to keep more money in the pockets of working families, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. Thanks to the President's Investing in America agenda, DOE is providing unprecedented assistance to states, cities, and Tribal Nations to implement modern building codesdelivering healthier, safer, and more resilient communities while slashing energy bills for families and businesses across the country.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $90 Million to Accelerate Building Code Adoption and Save Americans Money"},{"text":"Im actually a couch salesman.

Legislation now just oppresses the small or middle businesses, leaving only the super powerful organizations to rule on top.  They both value the exact same thing, so therefore, neither of them can solve the systemic root of the issue.","title":"The establishment is trying to destroy nuclear family to enslave us"},{"text":"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/22/national-security-officials-endorse-harris) reduced by 87%.

When accounting for state mandated education, economic obligations, and major families living far apart from one another, you get a family system where in which children either get no time with their father or no time with either parent at all. The technocratic managerial regime (a concept described in Samuel Franciss book *Leviathan and Its enemies*) would prefer all of our children be raised by the state, and that the individual must worship the technocratic structure above all else. The nuclear family was a conceptual step into this direction, and it was far from the peak of American culture. Psychologically, it was the framework that created the generational developmental issues that began to erode society. Children need to spend time with their parents in order to develop into healthy adults. The saying, it takes a village fundamentally undermines how important some connections are over others. Children fundamentally need to spend a massive amount of time with their parents in order to develop healthily; however, with an educational system that takes 7+ hours out of a major chunk of the year. Children either develop no attachment with neither parent, if both of them work heavily, or only the mother (if she doesnt have a job). This is dysfunctional. When the parents arent able to be home, the child needs to be with their grandparents, aunts, uncles, or the rest of their family unit, and when theyre forced into a environment that forces them to sit down for hours on end, theyre going to either repress themselves or snap into psychotic adults. Our school systems punish children for talking to one another, playing with another, or anything that isnt productive. The education system is technocratic because it was designed by factory owners during the Industrial Revolution. This is why modern feminism has dropped the ball, and its because they have been indoctrinated to think that liberation is economic opportunity. It is not. People are not made happy by liberation. They need liberation and human connection, and individualism is just another trap for a spiritual oppression. The human brain was not designed to be satisfied by career goals. It needs love: filial (community), romantic, and friendship. The problem with the nuclear family wasnt that the wife wasnt allowed to work. It was that the husband wasnt allowed enough time with his kids and his wife. Most children do not spend enough time with their fathers, and Sigmund Freud was probably one of them.","title":"The establishment is trying to destroy nuclear family to enslave us"},{"text":"If he didn't lie 24/7 I would be excited about this statement.","title":"Donald Trump says he wont run for president in 2028 if he loses election.

Even if it didnt, it wouldnt actually have the intended effect, itd just cause a massive diaspora into countries that dont have this law. It wouldnt actually lessen religious influence, just shuffle it around at great cost of human sufferingAlso, pragmatically speaking, this system could only be maintained in a society where political forces are A) staunchly in favor of atheism, and B) wholly willing to impose atheism on their population. I dont think such a society could have such strict adherence to atheism and also maintain a desire to simply stop at children. For a real world example, theres China, where what youve asked for applies to Christianity, but also they dont allow foreign churches (the Catholic Church does not operate there; rather, the CCP founded its own Catholic Church under the CCPs control and surveillance), and they *are* committing a religious genocide against Uyghur Muslims in their countryLastly, Id like to exit the atheistic perspective and return to a veil of ignorance in regards to religion for a moment. Let me point out that the entirety of this argument rests on the axiom that one particular instance religious beliefs (or however youd like to categorize it)- atheism- is the correct one, and all others are false. Its calling for other peoples children to be raised in accordance with your beliefs (that there are no gods nor afterlife nor anything like that), rather than in accordance with the beliefs of their families.

The church we go to clearly believes homosexuality is a sin, but I have never been confronted or forced into a situation where my sexuality is brought to extreme scrutiny nor have I had someone accuse me of being possessed. The entire foundation of the teachings in christianity is the belief in personal liberty. Your love for god must be a choice that you truly believe in, otherwise you are projecting a formality which goes against the teachings of Jesus. Also, the entire history of the catholic church is rooted in science and philosophy. There has been for quite some time now a large section of the church that has both practiced and funded scientific institutions. Now the motive has been to understand the universe in the search for god, but the results of this have led to a massive amount of discovery, especially in the astronomy side of science. You meeting people that are skeptical or not fans of science is not something unique to religious folk. On a more practical note, what exactly does Jesus teach that is detrimental to children? Do you actually think the world would be worse if people treated others with respect, revered their parents, married and make love to someone you actually trust, do not murder, bare the responsibilities entrusted to you, etc. On a final note, you are treading very dangerous ground when you introduce government mandated laws into religion. There is not and has never been a realistic way of legislating a human beings beliefs. The Russian and Japanese governments attempted this in and somewhere in the ballpark between 12 and 20 million were killed in Russia alone.

However, I think we must be very careful not to overreach in what we mandate or prohibit in the education of children. Otherwise, it would be easy to replace an at least diverse variety of religious oppression of children with totalitarian state oppression of children. What parents aren't allowed to do in raising their children should be limited to clearly harmful assaults.2. The current system actually stifles religious freedom. The vast majority of people who are spiritual inherit the same religion that their parents have.Things being common doesn't mean people don't have freedom. Most people watched Game of Thrones, but I don't think that makes America unfree.Once upon a time, people often did the same trade as their parents. It's not because they weren't free to do a different trade. It's because it was an effective way to pass on knowledge.3. Religious institutions teach things that contradict a common understanding of science and thus are harmful to their education. Children being taught creationism, and a christian-centric view of the world muddies their developing mind which now finds itself split between the educators and their parents and community, I know fully grown adult people who look at you funny when you talk about space or history or something because they think that's all crazy talk, god created everything obviously, every child knows that.If your beliefs, such as evolution and Neil Armstrong landing on the moon, are rational, then you shouldn't feel threatened by any competing beliefs. It is the province of Christian fundamentalist to try to silence or shield children from conflicting beliefs.","title":"CMV: It should be illegal for children to attend (and join) religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues etc."},{"text":"I dont know I can understand where you are coming from as I was raised in a very strict and very oppressive Southern Baptist family and as luck would have it I am also gay  and my experience of growing up queer in that environment really led me to reject religion in every way for a very long time. Including making fun of anyone for being religious in any way (yes, I was one of those Reddit atheists) And during that time I definitely would have agreed with you, based on my own miserable upbringing under the church. However, a few years ago I realized that atheism really wasnt what I felt best fit me. I did some soul searching for many years and ended up converting to Judaism. It was the best decision for my life that I ever made solely because I joined a synagogue that is extremely pro-LGBTQ+ and very social justice oriented. I made the conscious decision to find an outlet for my faith that is inclusive and accepting of everyone and it really improved my life ten-fold because it was the right choice for *me*. 99% of my friends were and still are staunch atheists and it doesnt bother me because its their personal journey, and they dont mind me because Im still the same person as I was before I did it. Nothing changed and I definitely didnt start proselytizing to them, so we are accepting of each other. However, the Jewish community is beautiful and tight knit and I wanted to make sure if I had children that they would be brought up around this community that they are a part of by birth no matter what they choose to believe religion-wise. Its important to me that they know their Jewish identity and have a community that can support them through tough times. I couldnt give a shit what they choose to believe themselves, there are tons of Jewish Atheists out there. My religious journey was my own personal experience, and theirs should be too.  But I want them to be able to have a community they can lean on. So I *would* take them to synagogue, I would let them do a bar/bat mitzvah, I would let them be engaged in kids activities there because I know and trust my synagogues beliefs and values and that they wouldnt be cruel to any children Id have for questioning something or not believing something or being queer. So for me, a blanket ban on children being involved in any religious activity doesnt sit right with me, because it would deny my children access to a beautiful community that I know would uplift them in every way, despite knowing theyd be safe and loved for who they are. Obviously, not all parents have their best interests at heart. Some parents would send their children to conversion therapy, some would disown them for not believing, etc. But when you do blanket bans like this, you are also banning those who dont subscribe to such extremist beliefs from allowing their children to be surrounded by their own community and have friends and activities outside of school. I think the much more sane and realistic solution is banning things like conversion therapy that only harms people, never helps. Thankfully a lot of places are starting to do so. You simply can never weed out all bad parents, its just not realistic. Or even enforceable, especially in countries where religious freedom is sort of like one of the top ten rules of the state. This goes for even non-religious abuse. This sort of heavy handed solution would be akin to forcing ALL children everywhere born to be raised in sanitized group homes away from their parents because they *might* be abusive. No one wants children to be abused, but its not realistic to be in the personal business of every family in the world. The best we can do is offer educational outreach and resources for those who are brought up under such circumstances to help them get out of the cycle. I just think this is a pretty overbearing solution that harms the vast amount of people who go to church/mosque/synagogue etc who dont really take the religious part as seriously but enjoy having being a part of a community and identity. And its simply not realistic to do for every religious community in the world.","title":"CMV: It should be illegal for children to attend (and join) religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues etc."},{"text":"Can yall fucking quit saying this? Literally everyone here is voting. Lets actually discuss the polls and not just spam Vote vote vote vote vote every thread.

I agree with your core assertion that indoctrinating children into a religion, when they are too young to have any meaningful understanding of, or say in what they're joining is bad, and I would never attend the baptism, or bris of a child for that reason (if an adult is getting baptised, and asked me to come along, I would of course do so, out of respect for the person, if not the ritual). I am also opposed to religiously-motivated schools (public or private) for the same reason. That said, laws which attempt to enforce secularism on individuals, and families against their will, however well intentioned they may be initially, almost invariably end up being hijacked by the more bigoted elements of society, and then selectively enforced against minority religions, in a way which both reinforces the power of the hegemonic religion, which we were attempting to kneecap in the first place, and providing a legal framework for persecuting minority religious groups. Two obvious examples of this are the French La?cit laws, which enforce secularism in all public contexts. It was originally created to kneecap the authority of the Catholic Church, which even all these years after the revolution continues to have outsize influence in France, which needs to be held back, but in practice, the laws are largely selectively enforced against Muslims, as a thin pretext for persecuting France's ethnic Algerian population. This isn't an exclusively Western problem either, Turkey has its own La?cit laws, directly modelled after the French ones, and intended to kneecap the power of the hegemonic Sunni Islam, but has since been corrupted, into being selectively enforced against Christians, as a means of persecuting ethnic Armenians. Various other good-faith attempts at secularizing societies where religion has too much power have been corrupted in similar ways: China passing laws attempting to kneecap hegemonic Buddhism, and Confucianism, then the next generation using them as an excuse to persecute Uighurs, and Tibetans, Albania passing enforced secularism laws, which ultimately just ended up pitting the Christian and Muslim halves of the country against each other, because Christians were generally dealt with a lighter hand, the absolute clusterfuck that was Yugoslavia, etc. I am a vehement supporter of religious freedom laws, even as it pertains to children, not because I think that's a good idea in-and-of-itself, but because laws advocating against religious freedom invariably end up being much more harmful to minority groups than to the powerful groups which they are actually intended to oppose. So no, it should absolutely not be illegal for children to attent Churches, Synagogues, and Mosques, because if such a law ever were passed, whichever one of those religions has the most power in your country would find ways around it, and the others would find themselves dealing with a crisis of the government taking their kids away, and putting them with 'normal' families.","title":"CMV: It should be illegal for children to attend (and join) religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues etc."},{"text":"Cue the deranged buffoons ice cream meltdown.","title":"Ahead of the presidential election, Ben &amp; Jerrys endorses Kamala Harris with new ice cream flavor"},{"text":"I was really nervous when Biden dropped.....

I am an atheist who doesn't need to be sold on the harms of religious indoctrination. But there is also real harm in authoritarian overreach.I note your stated view is, \\"It should be *illegal*...\\" - not \\"it is wrong\\" or \\"it is dangerous\\". If you had stated either of the latter, your view would correspond fairly closely with my own.Making things illegal should be done very conservatively. I will cite the prohibition of many recreational drugs as an example. The danger of habitual drug use is very real - yet, the harms that prohibition and the \\"War on Drugs\\" has wreaked on individuals, families, and communities has been so great as to negate any benefit (deterrence from drug use being the only benefit I can see).The unintended consequences of a prohibition of public worship for minors need to be seriously considered. Radicalizing children and their families is surely one. Adherents to religion will, quite reasonably, see themselves as an oppressed minority, with axes to grind. I imagine you'd agree that religious fanaticism is a threat to peace and liberty; your suggestion would further it.I think the most modern approaches we see in much of the so-called West is fairly close to optimal: guarantee freedom of - and freedom *from* - religion, and enshrine a secular form of government. (I realize that some countries claim to do all this, but fail - resulting in a \\"shadow theocracy\\".

That said, the first and best way to win over a constituency is to make them feel special. The left in the United States does this with almost every group, however you want to group them, except young men. Especially young Christian straight white men. While women, BIPOC, LGBTQA+ receive an institutional message from the left they are special and powerful just the way they are, young Christian straight white men get the message they are tolerated at best, as long as they contribute, be it their time, ideas, power, support, or money. The left simply is not doing enough, if anything, to reach these men with a message communicating they are welcome at the table. They are not told they are special. They are not told they are an inherent force for good. At most, they get the message they are a threat.The truth of the matter aside, the left does not effectively communicate they want a country which includes these men's voices. This creates a vacuum gleefully filled by hate ready to tell these people that not only are they special, they are the only special.people and everyone else is trying to take advantage of them or worse.If the left wants to include these people, and I think it does, it should focus a bit more on their uniqueness and their unique issues.

The objective reality of the world right now is that many, many communities and places on Earth still rely on organized religion as their primary form of social cohesion technology. Is it ideal? No. Should better technologies and quality of life come to these areas? Yes of course. Is it going to happen overnight or even within a decade after implementing your proposed ban on organized religion? **Obviously not.** It's wishful thinking to believe otherwise because there is no evidence to suggest you can update everyone's social cohesion technology overnight. Remember, your view isn't wrong per se but it's not pragmatic and fairly irrational in terms of \\"views that will help me promote policies that improve the world.\\"","title":"CMV: It should be illegal for children to attend (and join) religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues etc."},{"text":"I don't even care.

Having children attend religious events is an *extremely* important part of their lives, even if we think it's bad.\\nAnd if you look at surveys of the US, about 75% of Americans are religious in some way, and the overwhelming majority of elected politicians are (at least outwardly) *very* religious.

This one is self-explanatory and should be obvious to nearly everyone marginalized who had a run-in with the church. If you are gay and had it slip to your parents, enjoy the entire church trying to expel demons from you, or everyone telling you that you are going to hell for something you can't control, not to mention getting sent to a conversion camp or all the other horrible things that are known to happen. Or being a little girl under islam spending your youth getting conditioned for a life of strict gender roles from which you shouldn't deviate from, facing social and sometimes legal repercussions if you do. This is immensely traumatizing as a child. Imagine constantly threatening a child with horrific eternal torture in any other context, it would be considered blatant child abuse.The obvious counter argument is that there exist similar bigotries and negative effects within secular organisations as well. So, per your logic, we would need to ban all youth working organizations, after school clubs, sport organisations, and basically any place at any point where a child can exists that is not home or school.The current system actually stifles religious freedom. The vast majority of people who are spiritual inherit the same religion that their parents have. The pressure of their parents and the broader community of a church means that instead of feeling free to explore their own spirituality, children are dragged into their parents' faith, once again, under threats and accusations of sin and eternal punishment. Even beyond these more abstract threats, there's also alienation, parents disowning their children and similar things that can occur from a child choosing to deviate religiously from their parents.Many of these effects would remain present, because well; if you ban religious parents from taking their children to church, they're just going to take the church home.Religious institutions teach things that contradict a common understanding of science and thus are harmful to their education. Children being taught creationism, and a christian-centric view of the world muddies their developing mind which now finds itself split between the educators and their parents and community, I know fully grown adult people who look at you funny when you talk about space or history or something because they think that's all crazy talk, god created everything obviously, every child knows that.\\nThis instills into people a doubt of science and the education system. Either you believe your teachers, or you believe your God.Same point as the first, secular nonsense proclaiming organisations also exist, so we'd need much larger bans.","title":"CMV: It should be illegal for children to attend (and join) religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues etc."},{"text":"I love these guys. ??  \\nThey say, Bloom where youre planted.

Saying their \\"voluntary\\" reminded me of when the news kept saying that Vance was \\"weird.\\" I absolutely loathe HOA's. Hence is why I'm on this sub. You have the freedom to be a part of an HOA if that's what you choose. But I've known people who bought their house and have lived in their house for years before HOA became a part of the community. Now, they can either comply and conform. (Worst option, in my opinion). Not comply and be harassed by HOA members. Or move. The only option for me is owning land. This hurts my children socially and sucks for transit. But I'd much rather deal with that year-round than live a single day under HOA. Code enforcement is also scum in my opinion. They are a part of the reason why I moved away from the suburbs. Until you start paying on my property TAXES (should not be plural). You do not have a single right to tell me how I should conduct myself on my property. People will say that you can't let someone do whatever they want, even if it is on their property. What's the nuance of the situation? By just using common sense, you can deduce most people's reasoning for their actions. I am not naive. I understand that we need certain rules and regulations in place because people can't just be cool and not fuck it up for others. But certain rules are absolutely horrendous. I am former military and strong advocate for the Second Amendment. Rules say that if you're a felon, then you're not allowed to own a gun to protect your family. I have more trust in certain people who are felons than who can pass a background check. Background checks don't cover common sense. HOA's are great for some people. It let's em feel like they belong to a community. I don't need that affirmation. And the military taught me that I don't like taking orders from morons who are in charge only because of seniority.

Pseudo young person and passionate volunteer and voter here. I see this rhetoric a lot that young voters are apathetic and I do agree with this sentiment but instead of putting the blame 100% on younger eligible voters, I also place a lot of the blame on the society that puts emphasis on the importance of voting but does almost nothing in our educational institutions to teach what political positions actually do.I am the vice chair of my voting precinct and we found that voters are more likely to show up to the polls if they are given the information necessary to understand what the position they are voting for can ACTUALLY influence. We have so many politicians these days running ads or trying to draw voters by placing highlights on issues they really have no control over. Sure its important to know that a Democratic candidate is pro-life or pro-choice but it seems more likely that someone isnt going to fill in the bubble for county commissioners if they do not understand why that position is important and what they do. So we run our canvassing to help people answer the questions they might have about the down ballot offices to see if there is an issue they consider important that that person could influence.In short, I would encourage folks to shy away from exclusively beating the drum of young people do not care as I find that is only a percentage of the issue.
