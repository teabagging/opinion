You can't have respect for good science if you treat every subject, that may not or hasn't been thoroughly studied, as settled into one category or another. People will feel betrayed when scientific information or advice changes. In that respect, the scientists aren't to blame - it's the education system, lack of critical thinking skills being taught at early ages, and the nature of modern contrarian societies rife with the backfire effect / belief perseverance pushing people to double-down on their opinions and what they want to believe regardless of evidence.Add to that the anti-science propaganda of people who are actively trying to sway people's ideals and emotions for political or monetary reasons (the tobacco, alcohol and such industries for example), and the rampant anti-enlightenment anti-government people who truly believe that their ignorance is just as respectable as an expert's hard-earned expertise.

Its just business.You would need either every single woman going through with that 2-3 times, or a small minority of them, maybe one out of five going through with it a dozen times each.In either case, the price tag doesn't work. For the former it is too much for society to afford (and you would need this much to incentivize such an invasive burden), and for the latter it is not enough, you would need a lifelong stipend to justify the ruinous health effects of 12 pregnancies and the loss of other career advancement opportunities, (and it would still be too much to afford).After the child is born, the woman can choose to raise the child or give it to the state. If she doesnt want the child, the state will not send the child to an orphanage. We do not want, for many reasons, to create an entire generation of orphans. Instead, the child will be given to be raised by a couple who agrees to participate in the program.This hypothetical couple would be fully funded by the state. They would receive funds to buy a suitable house and also an amount of money proportional to the number of children they take in. Enough for the family to enjoy a middle-class standard of living, without luxuries. In other words, this couples profession would be to raise children like their own.One condition: each couple must take in as many children as the State determines, up to a known limit (perhaps 20 children).?A government-funded group home for 20 children, ran professional caretakers, is an orphanage.You are talking about replacing the family structure with a government-ran crche system, here. Such professionals couldn't feasibly be expected to be \\"couples.\\". What if they got divorced? Do they get to split the 20 kids and the professional-level government funding? Or what if one or both just want to quit?I'm not against the idea of the state that wants to have a populous next generation needing to organise their upbringing instead of putting it's faith in the traditional family model, but let's be honest what this would look like: Children being raised by small teams of live-in professional nurses and educators who show up in exchange for a government salary.","title":"CMV: The solution to reversing low birth rates is to pay people to have children"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|femjhhnCcfJFdNu9qn|downsized)","title":"Elon Musk aka DorkMAGA's mom with mannerisms weirder than her demonspawn"},{"text":"Ol' sleepyhead there, in shotgun.","title":"A tale of isolation.

Think of the early controversies over masking in the US and how the recommendations changedThose recommendations changed because of science. That's what science DOES. It's the POINT of science. We learn. But they and the people arguing for them, didn't add that \\"the science can change rapidly and so can the conclusions\\" because they knew that wouldn't help their arguments. The same way people were shouted down when they wanted to leave their fucking houses because we needed to \\"stop the spread\\". But then when George Floyd happened you had hundreds of scientists signing petitions saying that they acknowledge the risks of spread when it comes to public protests but the cause of racial justice supersede it!\\"Again, who are you quoting? Can you link to these scientists saying these things? Protests were pretty universally outside, and thus, as everyone at the time said, the risk was lowered -- and many protesters wore masks regardless. But I didn't see that quote about the cause of racial justice. Can you show us that?Beyond that, there was the \\"black babies are dying because of the racism of white doctors\\" paper that came out in 20/21. Another log to the collective fire of racial tension and another strike against american culture that their needed to be a \\"reckoning\\" over....until just a month ago when another paper came out saying that it was mostly wrong and the result of misweighing the data. Whoops! Ignore that though and trust the science!Again, can you show us the papers from which you're taking these quotes?Science is ever changing, i get that. But people's memories when they feel they've been lied to isn't.If you get science is ever changing, then you know no one is lying. This goes back to people not being educated and that's hardly the fault of researchers.I mean just recently there was a paper on the front page of?[r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/)?promoting the decrease of weed usage among teens and children since states began to legalize and regulate it.

Trump was going to win that year regardless.  HRC and her campaign and her chosen narratives, being investigated, etc.  It didn't really matter.   Years of demonizing her had baked things into the cake, and Trump won despite being obviously unqualified, openly racist, and plainly incompetent compared to his opponent.  He literally had a tape dropped of him talking about how he's a non-consensual pussy grabber.Given that the man is literally a convicted felon at this point, I'm going to guess that an out-of-the-blue investigation being announced by a James Comey-esque figure into Harris won't have any effect on the outcome, either.  The anti-Trump vote will remain unphased.  We will interpret it as trickery.  Most of us have actually already probably casted our ballot, anyway.Unlike 2016, Trump no longer has the benefit of the doubt.  This election is a repeat of 2020, at worst.Remember, we didn't cast our votes in 2020 knowing he'd try to overturn the election and install himself as a fucking dictator.  A lot of us guessed it very accurately, but we all went to the polls before he really took his mask off.In 2024, Trump has J6 and his actions that led to it to contend with.  He took his mask off, and everyone saw him for what he was.  Yes, a lot of us are still in denial about what we saw, but at least some of us are no longer under his spell as a result of all of that.  Nothing he's done since J6 as helped his case, either.He has real-world, very blatant effects of his authoritarianism dragging down his turnout and boosting his opponent's.  A lot of us, even a portion of people on the right, do not want to live under a dictatorship and we recognize the signs, regardless of our political affiliation.At best, and what I'm banking on, is an historically embarrassing electoral defeat.  I see Trump's support dropping, possibly below his 2016 count, and I see Harris potentially exceeding Biden's 2020 count.We'll all debate about the reasons for the landslide late into the night on the 5th (the results will be overwhelming enough for us to all go to sleep by 8pm), but personally I think the effect of J6 on turnout is very underestimated by both polling and the media.  Attempting a coup on the way out of office and trying to throw away all of the votes against you is the type of fuck up every patriotic American can reasonably turn out against, even some of those who voted for you.  Abortion?  Yeah, that could definitely boost Harris' numbers, too.  It probably won't peel off any Trump support, though.  J6?  That *did* open at least a few eyes.  The question is how many.  I expect a drop from J6 and a big boost from RvW.  I could be underestimating RvW, though.The only question in my mind is how much of his support actually dropped because of it.  Everyone whose vote he tried to throw away?  We'll all show back up again this year.  Count on it.  We had record turnout in 2020 because Trump turned out the electorate.  Not Biden.  And Trump is still on the ballot.  And the problem he ran into in 2020 will remain - he turns out more votes against him than he does for him.  Voting against Trump *was* the motivation of most Biden voters in 2020 (just google \\"biden voter motivation\\" to see all of the polls indicating this).  We have only been given more and more convincing reasons to turn out against him again in the intervening time.  Very convincing and very alarming reasons, actually.  In 2020 we were largely voting against him because we didn't know anyone who wouldn't do a better job, and we just wanted the stupidity to end.  In 2024, we're voting against him so he doesn't try to be dictator in chief, and we definitely want the stupidity to just die already.??","title":"CMV: Elon Musk's remark is an October surprise potentially greater than Comey (2016) if Democrats use it"},{"text":"Spot on","title":"CMV: The US Middle-East Policy, especially under Biden and Obama, while good intentioned, is terrible and is driving the region into chaos and strengthening America's enemies and radical forces."},{"text":"So oppose it all.","title":"Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib declines to endorse Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I know a lot of people reg'd R who are just tired of the maga crazytrain and are pulling the lever for Harris because they're hoping it forces the GOP to course correct.

She dodges the issues, which all politicians do, but she doesn't do as well rounding the gap to make a solid argument after dodging. I've watched many of Harris' interviews (and her debate) and I've seen her do both. You sure we're watching the same things?Which is simply not a good strategy when trying to get male votersCan we stop pretending that male voters who are going to vote for Trump or are even undecided at this point care about policy?Smug one liners about Trump or the republican party don't work when you have been in charge of the last four years.Good thing Harris has talked about policies too. And she has done so in a way that I've seen very few politicians have by focusing on the ROI from investing in Americans and their communities.- Sure, well I mean, you just look at it in terms of what we are talking about, for example, around children and the Child Tax Credit and extending the EITCV (Earned Income Tax Credit). That is at $6,000, for the first year of a child's life, the return on that investment, in terms of what that will do and what it will pay for, will be tremendous. We've seen it when we did it in the first year of our administration, reduced child poverty by over 50%.- So that's a lot of the work. And then what we're doing in terms of the tax credits, we know that there's a great return on investment. When we increase home ownership in America, what that means in terms of increasing the tax base, not to mention your property tax base, and what that does to fund schools. Again, return on investment.- I think it's a mistake for any person who talks about public policy to not critically evaluate how you measure the return on investment when you were strengthening neighborhoods, strengthening communities, and in particular the economy of those communities and investing in a broad-based economy, everybody benefits and it pays for itself in that way.https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/08/19/kamala_harris_return_on_investment_will_pay_for_child_tax_credit_first-time_home-buyer_benefit_pays_for_itself.htmlSo when you say she has presented no solid argument, I genuinely cannot take you seriously.In contrast with Trump, he is fun for his supporters to watch.Yet Harris supporters consistently seem to have far more fun at her rallies.

A Trump America or a Kamala America. I do think there are people that are impacted by Kamala but less of them will be impacted under her and since there are only 2 viable options, I support the one that causes the least harm. Kamala has not persecuted Palestinians so you shouldnt hold her, or your fellow Americans accountable to the anecdotal actions of others. Kamala is also not the FBI. Vice presidents notoriously have little power. Even if Kamala and Trump has the same stance on Muslims and Arabs shes still better for The LGBTQ+ community, women, children, old people, people in need, migrants, people of color, etc. But even thats not the case. Trump is worse there too. He promised to reinstate and expand his Muslim ban (that Biden ended on day 1), he promised to deports those that protest Israel (You and your friends it sounds like), and he is encouraging Bibi to finish the job. Hamas also credits Trump with being the catalyst behind the 10/7 attack against Israel for moving the embassy. Kamala on the other hand supports Palestininans right to self determination and supports a 2 state solution for a decades long conflict between two right wing nations that hate each other.  Sure, the US is an ally of one and is actively supporting their ally in their defense (way over retaliating and heinous) against a terrorist attack - the largest against Jews since the holocaust. Both sides are wrong. But thats besides the point. Palestinians would be better off under Kamala but its up to them and Israel to end the war, release the hostages, and respect each other. We should not want that more than them.Yes, the US should stop supporting Bibi but I dont agree we should let Trump win which will cause way more suffering to more people than Kamala if we dont. That creates more problems to solve and hurts innocent people. We can prevent that and be in a better position to put pressure on our government to help end that war.

Other ways to shore up the needs of an aging population are possible including changes to social programs, requiring wealthier persons to contribute more to the tax system, etc. Fewer workers means both higher wages and more efficiency which are both good for the overall economy.  Again, you assume the only way to solve these challenges is by promoting more births. Maybe more births is one way, but not the only way.  And if it isnt the only way, why should taxpayers bear the burden of what market forces will adjust for in the long run?  Also, lets think of the future. There are few jobs in the world that cant be done better with robots.  They arent being done by robots because its cheaper to employ people - for now but this is quickly changing.  Very soon we will likely reach situation where human labor is far less relevant than it is now.

The birth rate would likely rise more naturally if the government gives more incentives to and lightens the burdens of couples who want kids but cant afford to have them, rather than financially coercing single people into creating babies neither of them want to be fostered for the sake of it.Overall and generally, people naturally want to have and raise children (as evidenced by the fact that people have always had children throughout all of human history), and they would do so more if the government and economy facilitated it more readily.

She dodges the issues, which all politicians do, but she doesn't do as well rounding the gap to make a solid argument after dodging. She falls back into her \\"smug Californian\\" tone when trying to push back on questions. Which is simply not a good strategy when trying to get male voters, especially in the Midwest. Smug one liners about Trump or the republican party don't work when you have been in charge of the last four years. It may excite the base, but it isn't going to endear her with new voters. Now, critics may respond, \\"It's a double standard because she's a black woman.\\" Which is probably correct to an extent. But that doesn't change the fact of how a lot of voters see her. I hope that she can run up the numbers with women voters, because a second Trump term will be a disaster for our institutions. In contrast with Trump, he is fun for his supporters to watch. In the top of reddit there is a clip of him joking about the microphone at his rally. It is an actual situation of him being funny, making harmless jokes about how it looks like he's giving a blow job because he has to lean over the mic for it to pick up his voice. He doesn't take himself too seriously, and it plays well with men, especially. Again I have donated to the Harris campaign this time around, but I will say that she was my least favorite candidate in 2019. If she was the candidate in 2020 I wouldn't have voted for her. Honestly, if it wasn't for Trump being such a threat, I might have voted third party this year. But he is a serious threat to our institutions and democracy. So please anyone reading this, despite my criticism of Harris, VOTE FOR HER. in four years, we can revisit, but Trump can not be allowed in the white house again.","title":"Why Are Democrats Having Such a Hard Time Beating Trump?"},{"text":"Yeah, and at what time does that question get added?

Basically nothing would change for those 6 1-seat states, and for the 7 2-seat ones, you could simply do 2-member STV with a 33% threshold. That leaves 37 states with 3-5 member STV. It would still be an incredible improvement over the current system. Doubt it; I think states would strongly resist that and claim it's unconstitutional.Congress has already modified the make-up of the House in the past. [It's unambiguously constitutional](https://newrepublic.com/article/165557/proportional-representation-fix-the-house) as long as you don't change the number of seats per state: Critically, none of this would require a constitutional amendment. Article I grants Congress broad latitude to determine how congressional elections are conducted. An existing proportional representation bill, the Fair Representation Act, would simply combine our current single-member districts into new multimember districts, with representatives chosen by ranked-choice votinganother reform allowing voters to rank candidates on ballots. The only technical hitch is that Congress would also have to repeal a 1967 law mandating single-member districts for all states with at least two allotted seatsa measure that was passed in part because some states had used multimember districts to dilute Black votes. I agree with you otherwise that this is very unlikely but in the past, Americans haven't seen reform coming. Sometimes conditions are right and surprising things become possible. So even though it looks unlikely I think we should keep pushing for it.","title":"When politics is about hating the other side, democracy suffers"},{"text":"It's not that voters are shifting left, Harris has shifted right along with Trump","title":"Harriss Hope: Getting Right-Leaning Voters to Shift to the Left"},{"text":"To be fair, some people dont want to bother with early voting for *obvious* reasons.","title":"The force is strong with Kamala Harris! ??"},{"text":"In depositions, the deposed have a chance to review the transcript for errors.

None of these people are bringing in fresh ideas but working from a long history of what the party agenda is. Roe v. Wade being overturned was a culmination of 50 years of judge placements, buying state courts, appointing people that would serve their agenda etc. Trump/Bush just merely enact what they need to do in order to get the blessing of their party. They do it in such a way thats resonate with their individual needs while compromising with the parties needs. Kavanaugh was said to be right of center, not extremely right wing as some christians wanted at the time. That was Trumps decision to make out of the list of names given to him. Makes sense because Trump was a democrat not until too long ago. Worse impact is subjective as Trumps presidency is too fresh to see the outcome. The republican party is in a transitional phase and with a lot of transitions.its messy and so we dont know really what is going to come from all of this.

Heres why Im voting for Kamala Harris."},{"text":" yeah, but multiwinner proportional systems are very new to the scene.What? First of all, the country that invented proportional representation was *America*, it's right there in the *freaking Constitution*. The problem of how to translate state populations into numbers of seats in Congress is exactly the same problem as translating numbers of votes into seats. All of the European PR methods with fancy European names C D'Hondt, Sainte-Lagu? C were actually invented much earlier in the US (by Jefferson and Webster, respectively). And even in Europe the idea of PR is from the mid-19th century. People in the US don't support PR because *they don't care*, or because they do but know it is out of reach. 3-5 member STV could be passed for the House with a simple bill, no amendment needed1 - Doubt it; I think states would strongly resist that and claim it's unconstitutional. The Constitution says what the Supreme Court says it does, and I expect they would not allow Congress to do this.2 - People elected thanks to gerrymandered single-winner districts have no interest in making even the very modest change that's STV; it changes little for the country but poses a big risk to their jobs.3 - It would help in big states, but there are lots of small states with 3 reps or fewer. [Caveat: when I lived in America I was in one such state, so I might be overestimating the issue.] STV would help more if districts were bigger, and if you could group states to form larger districts. You could still have reps assigned to specific states even with that (but not in America, you can't do anything that's too complex in this area).4 - We don't know whether America would be Ireland-STV or Malta-STV; Ireland has two reasonably dominant parties, but there have often been coalitions, even between the two, and Sinn Fin has recently given them a run for their money. Malta, on the other hand, is 100% two-party dominated. I expect not only path dependency but other aspects of the US institutions (e.g. the Presidency) to lock in two-party domination even with STV. Electoral reform is very, very slow. It happens about every two generations in the US (1840s, 1900s, 1960s). We're due for something. Looks like it'll just be single-winner RCV this time around, but I don't think anything can be done in time.Like I said, this is out of reach *in America*. I'm from Brazil and we've changed our elections a couple times already since redemocratization in 1985. New Zealand changed to PR in the 90s. Italy changes their electoral system quite frequently! Japan also adopted a parallel PR system, or PR-ish if you want. The UK has PR in the devolved assemblies. South Africa is a new democracy and has already changed their system to allow for independent candidates. Germany has changed twice in the last 15 years.I would say that most of these changes were a lot less pressing than reforming the extremely broken US system. The reason electoral reform in the US is very, very slow is because of poor, unresponsive institutions. We'll keep pushing and hopefully future generations will have something much betterI would bet good money the US won't have nationwide PR by the middle of the *next* century.","title":"When politics is about hating the other side, democracy suffers"},{"text":"if i was forced to vote i would vote for Trump, but not because I think he is great....","title":"I'm sincerely curious about this.

The only thing that remained was the local school, which employed a boat loads of people and really brought a ton of money to the town.  But you couldn't tell.  The locals resented the school so much.  There were so many anti-student ordinances passed and the local paper was basically \\"students causes trouble..\\"I think in the end it comes down to the fact that change is inevitable.  Industries will come and go, just as surely day changes to night.  And if you resent change, well, that will just result in the inevitable decay.  Luckily for the town the school wasn't going away and enough new people moved in / old timers passed away that the hostility stopped eventually stopped.

Changing human nature is much harder than institutional change. As incredibly hard as electoral reform is, I think it's more practical than wishing that society would depolarize.And even if we do depolarize, now we know that our current system is vulnerable to polarization. There's nothing keeping it from happening again. It's important to design systems that handle stress well instead of breaking (as they almost did in January 2021 and as they might do next January) - multiparty proportional parliamentary systems are much better in this regard than two-party presidential ones.I'm not saying that the character of the electorate has nothing to do with the problem, but bad institutitional design makes the system much more fragile, and that's a problem we can identify and actually work on.","title":"When politics is about hating the other side, democracy suffers"},{"text":"How was the sexual assault thing retracted?

The same Joe Lieberman who single-handedly killed the public option for Obamacare. Lieberman was far from a reliable vote meaning they never really had a super majority, not even for a minute.

He also signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which exempted credit-default swaps from regulation. In 1995 Clinton loosened housing rules by rewriting the Community Reinvestment Act, which put added pressure on banks to lend in low-income neighborhoods.

He was that bad, no sugarcoating it. But the two are completely incomparable. Bush give us 8 years of terrible foreign and economic policy, but he always, at bare minimum, has loved his country. The American project is one of the most unique political undertakings in human history. No society has ever been so successful at guaranteeing more freedoms and rights, to more people. Ever. And the freedoms denied to people based on race, religion or gender, have been remedied without war or extensive civil conflict, via the existing legislative system. In the grand scheme of things, this is *revolutionary*. It is far from perfect, and some places may do it better, but no one does it on our scale.Let this sink in: there have been lots of good presidents, and lots of terrible presidents. Donald Trump is the first president ever to fundamentally not understand the above concept. All the others - racists, warmongers, crooks, whoever - they all understood Americas place in the grand sweep of history, and shared a belief in the fundamental post-enlightenment precepts that have allowed the country to grow and prosper as it has. Donald Trump is entirely ignorant of all this. This is genuinely unprecedented.Heres why this is important: if you dont understand  what America even is, and why it is what it is, then you cant understand why its worth preserving - how destructive it would be to hundreds of millions of lives if it were to erode.. When Trump talks up dictators and daydreams about being one, its not just because he thinks theyre tough: its because *he doesnt get why our society is incompatible with dictatorship*. He just does not know, because he doesnt know enough about his country to care. This is immediately disqualifying for a presidential candidate, full stop. If George W Bush was running against Donald Trump, it would be your duty as a citizen to do everything in your power to help Bush win. Not because he wouldnt be terrible (he would), but because at bare minimum, he believes in democracy. Trump has no belief in democracy - he just happens to be running in a democratic country where he has to follow certain sets of rules.","title":"CMV: George W Bush had worse impact as President than Trump did"},{"text":" Trump never caused the death of a quarter of a million people.[actuallyhis terrible COVID response was found to have caused 66% more deaths, meaning 40% of all COVID deaths could have been prevented](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/02/11/lancet-commission-donald-trump-covid-19-health-medicare-for-all/4453762001/)That was in 2021 and at the time, only half a million people had died so thats technically just 200,000 deaths he caused but I doubt the effects of his policies simply stopped then, so he probably did break the quarter of a million mark.","title":"CMV: George W Bush had worse impact as President than Trump did"},{"text":"My family knows him personally- he is a good dude :).

All-knowing indicates God knows the future.   If God believes in good and evil, an all-good God would not have created a universe where there was evil.  A common argument against the last sentence is that God gave us free will, so that our choices between good and evil are our own choices, presumably making our good acts more good.  Very well. If God gave us free will, then you have to accept that God is not all-knowing. If God already knows the choices we will make, as in God knowing the future, then we obviously don't have free will.   Take away \\"all-good,\\" or \\"all-powerful,\\" or \\"all-knowing\\" and you'll have a more logically sound argument for a God creating our universe the way it is.

It seems that you are taking for granted a Harris win.  I think its probably at least 80% likely that Trump wins if Harris doesnt take advantage of the musk remarks.

But the major one is she has tried to distance herself from Biden on fiscal issues and made a brief move hard left instead of defending and reframing him.  Her messaging on fiscal issues has not been good, and Americans care more about fiscal issues than any other issue, especially undecided voters, and especially in 2024.  If theres a crash on her watch it will hurt her politically whether she makes a point about musk or not.  But she has to get elected in 2024 first and that seems like it would take a miracle.

With Genocide Joe we notice a clear attempt to return to that playbook, but it no longer quite works as well as it once did, because Trump broke it.Trump didn't start a war, but he destabilized the system in ways Dubya never did. Trump didn't mind presenting himself as a corrupt liar to the \\"left\\" media, while letting himself be presented as a paragon of truth and justice only by the \\"right\\" media, which was speaking to his base. This created a wide rift between consumers of the the \\"left\\" and the \\"right\\" media, and very different perception of his presidency - and the way the US was heading - based on which media someone consumed.What Trump did shattered any semblance of a unified image US media was previously projecting to the world, thus hampering America's future  diplomatic ability to start exploitative wars of aggression \\"for peace and justice\\". But the domestic effects are far more important that that. The split along \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" he's played a key role in creating, then widening, is fundamentally reshaping US society into one where social trust between Americans becomes deeply dependent on whether a particular American consumes the the \\"left\\" or the \\"right\\" media.Trump's unique approach to communication with the American public is fundamentally restructuring the glue that holds the country together, with results that are hard to predict, but many of the predictions that are out there make a strong case that he might break - or already have broken - the country as people know it.In summary, Trump in changing the very way America works. Meanwhile Dubya was just trading a bit of the US's near infinite diplomatic capital to steal some oil and get some money to his friends and associates, torturing and killing a couple foreigners in the process, who just happened to live in the wrong country at the wrong time.

That said, a 2020 [Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-10-01-research-finds-inadequate-us-pandemic-response-cost-more-american-lives-world-war-i)  study estimated that, due to Trump's botched pandemic response and his denigration of masking and isolation, mortality from the virus was 28% higher in the US than in Europe. A [more recent](https://www.salon.com/2024/11/01/trumps-botched-response-has-been-largely-forgotten-but-its-crucial-we-remember/) examination puts that figure at 40%.[From 2021](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-white-house-made-deliberate-efforts-undermine-covid-response-report-n1286211):WASHINGTON  The Trump administration engaged in deliberate efforts to undermine the?[U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/it-s-trump-s-coronavirus-response-now-his-political-profit-n1171171)?for political purposes, a congressional report released Friday concludes.It's unclear how many Americans died of Covid, many covid deaths were not reported as such and many people died because they couldn't get care at hospitals clogged with covid patients. There are estimates that the number is as high as a million deaths, and climbing. The reason these later deaths still count 4 years after Trump left office and after vaccines have been available is that Trump voters and red counties continue to suffer covid fatalities at a rate 15% higher than democrats. This is not just because they're idiots. It's because the idiot they follow so blindly began the pandemic calling it a democrat hoax and spent his entire presidency downplaying it, down playing the risks, down playing masking and other sensible measures to prevent transmission. So let's say 400,000 needless American deaths. And, as bad as Bush was, as bad as Nixon was, neither of them called a free and fair election into question and summoned a braying mob of deluded fascists to attack the capitol. Neither of them engaged in two other conspiracies to overturn the results of the election. Neither of them created a movement which both rejects vaccines and works passionately to destroy American democracy.Also, neither of them stole thousands of classified documents and stored them in a way to make them completely accessible to foreign intelligence agents. But still, while it is absolutely clear that Trump has had the most disastrous impact on America, its people, its interests and its allies it should always be borne in mind that Trump is simply the logical product of the Republican project.

His *response* to COVID caused more deaths than there could have been. And Trumps actions harmed the economy. Trump also undermined trust in basic health institutions. https://time.com/6180309/covid-19-us-canada-differences/This article and multiple others lay out that in July of 2020, Canada had 60% the deaths per Capita the US had . By October that dipped down to 40%. **Its estimated that 600,000 more people died than would have if we had followed policies like Canada.*Trump's governance not only made the peak worse, it prolonged the disaster which harmed the economy. Even if we argue Canada has uncomparable factors like culture or population density. Its fair to say we can blame his administration for *at least 300,000* of those. First fault of Trump, tearing up the playbook on Viruses originating from Asia. Second, pitted states against each other for federal aid. Held grudges against Blue state governors who contradicted his policies. Har governors communicating contradictory policies instead of sharing best practices. Third, undermined fundamental trust in basic institutions. Tried to deplatform health officials in the administration. Even the rumors of attempting to fire leaders in those areas could have caused harm. He almost withdrew us from WHO. Sewed distrust about basic health practices and platformed terrible health alternatives. e spread illness during his campaign rallies. He showed no leadership in bullying or shutting down Republicans spreading lies about vaccines. \\nLastly, he pressured the Fed chair to dip interests rates below zero. Even if the Fed wasn't influenced by his words. The *appearance* of Trump's influence did briefly affect the confidence of markets. Trump not having coherent lock down policies made both shutting down and opening back up the economy difficult. Trump may have delayed stimulus checks to get his name printed on it for the election. All of this led to a crash of the economy comparable to the Great depression. In summary, *Trumps active actions* during COVID caused more than the 250,000 deaths attributed to Bush. His ripping up of the playbook response and undermining WHO has permanently damaged trust in health institutions. Trump's *active actions* involving the economy during 2020, *contributed to one of the worst recessions in modern history. His Administration influenced the uncoordinated national lockdown response. And he pit states against each other, which caused strain on major state's tax base.","title":"CMV: George W Bush had worse impact as President than Trump did"},{"text":"No tax on tips.

If she wins, she's still eligible for another term. And a lot of this is just gut feeling, I don't have many hard statistics, as there's not really a good way to get hard statistics for these things. The simple answer is this: Harris knows that going after this is playing with fire, in a MAJOR way. If she attacks Trump on this, and promises that voting for Democrats will prevent this crash, and then the crash happens anyway, she will NOT be having a second term. And Democrats would probably get destroyed in the midterms. But to elaborate on that a little bit:Whether or not people will say it, I think the overwhelming majority of Americans feel like we're on the brink of SOMETHING. Maybe a major war. Maybe a major economic crash, maybe another pandemic. Who knows. While the news, and the White House, has been pushing numbers talking about how the economy is doing well, inflation is slowing down, etc... It still feels unstable.   \\n  \\nI, personally, have been feeling like a major economic crash is inevitable, and the timing of it really just depends on who's elected. And I can't be the only one. It feels like the economy never truly recovered after COVID. There's still shortages of certain types of medications. We know that some of the critical supply chain links in Eastern TN/Western NC were hit hard by Helene. We're still seeing random backorders of items, or other things that indicate that overall, the world economy isn't doing well. And on top of all of that, Israel and Iran are now going at it. Also, the concept of naming an entire government department after a meme cryptocurrency just adds to the difficulty of messaging. Because think about it: If Harris goes after this \\"plan\\", Trump and Musk could just say \\"you really fell for it, you're an idiot, it was literally a meme\\". Then, the messaging has to be \\"vote for me so this sort of crash won't happen\\" - which carries with it the risk of the crash happening anyway, which the Republicans can then point to \\"well, you said you'd prevent it, and it happened anyway, now what's your plan to get out? At least Trump had a plan to get out of an economic crash like this\\". So, from a messaging standpoint, are you going to take that risk?","title":"CMV: Elon Musk's remark is an October surprise potentially greater than Comey (2016) if Democrats use it"},{"text":"Sorry, u/InspiredNameHere C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1: **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.

Because we won this state, and flipping the state is a great testament to the country,\\" Trump said. \\"I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes.

Great social progress was made by blacks and women back in the 1960s and 70s. Suddenly black people could go anywhere white people went, even your kids schools. You couldn't discriminate against them (openly) anymore. Women could get their own credit cards, control their own fertility with the pill, and have careers. A lot of people did not like these changes. In fact, the modern Republican party, since Nixon or Reagan, depending how you figure, has simply been one big backlash against those changes. It was around this time that Republicans turned against the government they felt had betrayed them. They have since that time been against every policy that might materially benefit average Americans because now it included *them*. (This incidentally is why we don't have nice things like universal healthcare, paid family leave, and free child care. In case you've wondered.) It was around this same time that the evangelicals suddenly developed strong feelings about abortion. Prior to this it was just a Catholic issue and didn't really rise to the level of a national political issue. But the desire to control women is very strong. If it can't find a socially acceptable outlet, it will find an underground one. Thus, the pro-life movement was born. It was around this same time that the NRA went from being a gun safety outfit to a hair-on-fire gun rights lobbying group. Republicans have resisted every bit of social progress over the last few decades. But the rest of us carried on with it. Eventually we elected a black man president. Then a woman seemed sure to be president next. Plus gays can get married now and you're supposed to treat them like straight couples!Along comes Trump. Aside from being vulgar and stupid, the only thing he really had to offer that other candidates did not was his open racism and misogyny. And people loved it. Finally! Someone has come to defend and preserve white supremacy and patriarchy. That is what MAGA means, after all. But the problem is, these ideas aren't popular enough to win national office. (Unless you have the help of Putin and Comey, without which he never would have won in 2016.) What these folks really want is to seize power and establish minority rule, if they can't have their way democratically.

Our only chance to impact this election was to unite in a single swing state behind a single candidate, and offer the Harris campaign an ultimatum: well encourage everyone to vote for you if you call for an immediate ceasefire. If you dont, youre on your own. \\nWe did not do that, which is why Harris is campaigning with Liz Cheney instead of Rashida Tlaib. She knows she can entirely ignore usI understand and fully support those who choose not to vote for either major candidate. Its a democratic choice, even if it may be a futile tactic in a two-party system, especially for achieving significant political goals. In fact, it often puts those goals further out of reach, and heres why.In the U.S., theres an intense focus on the presidency, despite the fact that real legislative and policy changes come through Congress. Building a critical mass in Congress provides leverage over committee assignments and legislative priorities. The far right recognized this with the Tea Party movement, reshaping politics by organizing at the congressional level. In contrast, some on the far left often ignore this approach, focusing instead on third-party candidates, a strategy that usually lacks impact.Another challenge is that the far left can underestimate the importance of organized politics, even though organizing has historically been a strength of leftist movements. They may also overestimate the popularity of their ideas in the broader political landscape, especially in presidential elections. Politics is about balancing competing ideas and interests, where compromise becomes essential. If compromise isnt an option, the larger voting bloc will ultimately win. Politicians prioritize holding power because without it, even popular causes lose relevance. With widespread support, the need for compromise diminishes, as influence follows popularity.The far right generally understands the big picture and values being on the inside. They know that gaining even a small foothold can eventually lead to greater influence. They may voice strong opinions, but they ultimately work within the system. On the other hand, some on the far left seem content with symbolic resistance, even if it shuts down opportunities for influence. For instance, pro-Palestinian representatives recently struggled to gain representation at the Democratic National Convention, missing a chance to bring their message to a broader audience. There was likely a way to present their stop killing kids in Gaza message tactfully without alienating the more powerful pro-Israel faction within the Democratic Party. Compromise, in this context, doesnt mean sacrificing principlesit means adapting tactics to maximize impact.","title":"I'm Unconvinced by the Leftist Arguments to Withhold Votes from Kamala Harris."},{"text":"A lot of the narrative in favour of withholding votes or directing the votes away from Harris is dominated by Russian influence operations designed to get Trump back in power.When you look at what Trump plans for the country, it aligns perfectly with what Putin and Xi, et al., would want for the West.","title":"I'm Unconvinced by the Leftist Arguments to Withhold Votes from Kamala Harris."},{"text":"Wisconsin, Georgia, and Pennsylvania are all looking good for Kamala.

It is not some thing that got out of hand or stopped serving its original purpose. It checks the power of the people, as intended--much like many other institutions within the American government. To get more specific, the slave states with smaller populations pushed very hard for the electoral college to be established, because they wanted more voting power.

Your ballot would not have the presidents name on it. Instead, you voted for a representative who shared your positions and who you trusted to help elect a president with similar beliefs. The idea was that the people might not be informed enough to make decisions. Then, these representatives or electors would gather and make a collective decision on who should be president.This system may have made more sense in the 1700s, especially in a large distributed country.  And it was also in place to help prevent misinformed people from being misled. This all assumes that the electors themselves were well informed and not acting in their own interests instead of those of the people, which I think is a big assumption. The emergence of political parties also caused fault with this system. And before long, presidential candidates were running directly with their names appearing directly in ballots.

I suspect much of the western covid response and maybe the entire worldwide thing could have been initiated JUST to force that farsical fraud ridden nonsense on US voters to allow for stolen elections by globalists.. And what did we get... old joe didn't win the bell wethers or any other metric established over the last 100 years of more secure elections that determine the winner. Chat gpt when asked about it as if it were not the presidential election and just a normal random thing being voted on will respond that it ss mathematically impossible that fraud wasn't use. I have seen the posts...Mail in voting cannot be secured. All the have to do is find the people that don't vote but are registered, they have this data, harvest those ballots (with connections and all the power easy peasy) fill out, drop, rinse, repeat. Since these are legitimate ballots just filled out in a fraud way not by the people they belong to, they are just passed right through as long as the fraudsters don't make mistakes and get sloppy. Without contacting and confirming votes with identity of every mail in voter no proof of fraud will ever be found. That is why there wasn't proof last time around. Course then they prevent you from having any kind of transparent audit and delete data if you are gonna get one. Its a system that stinks to high heaven.I think many of us would be happy just to see the 2020 changes rolled back. I had faith in our elections before then.

Nowhere is politics so shaped by sophisticated data about how voters behave. There is nothing wrong with this. But nor is it any protection against dysfunction. To some extent it seems the reverse. Too much of the effort goes into what the Russians call political technology: the hackery of winning elections by exploiting voters deep-rooted and universal instinct to stand together in the face of a threat. As the energy put into negative campaigning has swollen, so governing in America has atrophied. As governing has atrophied, so Americans have come to see Washington as a one-dimensional, zero-sum place where partisans fight over the spoils, but do nothing to make the whole country more prosperous. Casting normal politicians as extreme has exhausted the language of castigation, leaving no fresh words to use when real extremists bid for power. The chart below shows how trust in government has collapsed over the past 60 years. The first thing to note is that it has fallen so low it is a wonder that anything can get done at all. The second is to note the pattern of the fall. In the 1960s and 1970s Republicans and Democrats were remarkably similar in their response to the unwinnable Vietnam war and the Watergate conspiracy under presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. Under Ronald Reagan Republicans gained some faith; under Bill Clinton Democrats did; the 9/11 attacks under Mr Bush reminded Americans of all stripes that government matters. But only briefly. Today voters attitudes are upended the moment a president from the other party enters the White House, for no obvious reason other than they detest him and all his works. As Lilliana Mason, a political scientist, notes, being a Democrat or a Republican has become a mega-identity that defines much else about how people choose to lead their lives. The consistency of that split is mysterious, but one reason may be that when voters are motivated by fear and mistrust they are unnerved by any single party gaining a consistent lead. Every election becomes a change election. The vote on November 5th is a chance to begin to put this right. So far the signs are not good. Mr Trump has embraced an even more negative platform than before. He has condemned Ms Harris as a shit vice-president and said that shes a Marxist, shes a fascist in the same breath. He has talked of retribution against those he sees as having persecuted him, and given warning of vermin and the enemy within. And has declared in apocalyptic terms that this world is going down, to cheers from his supporters. He left truth-telling behind long ago; claims of a life-and-death political struggle between good and evil which started off as hyperbole have created the political space for bogeymen to become flesh. Joe Biden campaigned on the idea that Mr Trump was a tyrant in the makingand that voting for him was therefore morally bankrupt. For much of her campaign Ms Harris has tried to strike a more optimistic note. When she was catapulted into the nomination after Mr Biden withdrew in July, she sought to present herself as the candidate of change. Part of that was to look to the future, declaring in her convention speech that the election was a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans. However, as she has failed to pull ahead in the polls, her rhetoric has become more negative. On October 23rd she seized on accusations by Mr Trumps former chief of staff to label her opponent a fascist. If Mr Trump wins the election will America plunge still further into the dark anti-politics of animosity? Or, in contrast to Israel, will the external threat from China and its partners in Russia, Iran and North Korea help bring the country together? If Ms Harris wins andin contrast to 2020Mr Trump fails to persuade his party that the vote was stolen, will consultants take it as a sign that catastrophism has become a losing tactic? Could the next generation of leaders conclude that the country needs more of Ms Harriss optimism? If so, a number of measures could help restore politics to health by showing that efficient government can benefit everybody, whatever party they belong to. Giving reasoned justifications for policies seems to work, presumably because voters can more easily understand how the government can serve the common good. Because perceptions of unfairness, and especially vote-buying, are linked to marked animosity against your own side and even more against the others, Americas obsession with cheating in elections is especially harmful. Lawrence Lessig of Harvard University argues that citizens assemblies are a way to jump-start a constructive phase of political engagement. An example is Ireland, which voted overwhelmingly to legalise same-sex marriage and abortion after 18-month assemblies overcame a seemingly unmovable legislative logjam. Across the worlds democracies, the task is to restore faith in politics. If voters believe that politics can be fair and for the common good, they will be less angry. If they think about policies instead of heroes and villains, they are more likely to treat both parties as legitimate. People need to believe that politics is not just about deciding who gets what, but making life better or worse for everyone, and that the outcome depends on their own choices. It surely counts for something that, whatever the merchants of grievance pretend, voters choices do in fact make a difference. Politics is often denigrated as cynical and dirty, but as Mr Obama argued in Chicago, it doesnt have to be like that. Bernard Crick, a political theorist, celebrated politics as a sublime human achievement. It enables complex societies to settle their differences and allocate scarce resources for the common good without resorting to violence. Compromise in politics creates the stability for people to be uncompromising in chasing their dreams. The idea that the vote in America on November 5th could determine the path of history is the sort of grandiose claim you would expect from partisans trying to stir up their base. This time it might just be true.Further readings:[https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/01/electoral-violence-political-united-states/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/01/electoral-violence-political-united-states/)[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384352475_So_different_yet_so_alike_Political_collective_narcissism_predicts_blatant_dehumanization_of_political_outgroups_among_conservatives_and_liberals](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384352475_So_different_yet_so_alike_Political_collective_narcissism_predicts_blatant_dehumanization_of_political_outgroups_among_conservatives_and_liberals)[https://www.icip.cat/perlapau/en/article/polarization-harms-democracy-and-society/](https://www.icip.cat/perlapau/en/article/polarization-harms-democracy-and-society/)[https://www.upf.edu/en/web/area-tallers/noticies/-/asset_publisher/pTPPbQZ8vkcm/content/la-polaritzacio-politica-destrueix-la-cohesio-i-la-confianca-social-segons-un-estudi/10193](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/area-tallers/noticies/-/asset_publisher/pTPPbQZ8vkcm/content/la-polaritzacio-politica-destrueix-la-cohesio-i-la-confianca-social-segons-un-estudi/10193)!ping Democracy&amp;Extremism","title":"When politics is about hating the other side, democracy suffers"},{"text":"She needs to be kicked out of the caucus","title":"Rashida Tlaib refuses to endorse Kamala Harris as Gaza war takes toll on Dem voter base"},{"text":"Wow.

The low chance of millions is not worth even $1 to them. Voting has an opportunity cost significantly more than a dollar. In-person voting, in a country that has no paid time off for elections, for people of lesser incomes, is a true sacrifice for the greater good. Numerate people might conclude that a 1*10^-8 payoff is not worth the risk involved in crossing the street to a polling station. Innumerate people might think theres zero chance, ignoring the fact that, well, someone wins and the odds _do_ fluctuate  with participation. tl;dr: High risk of non-participation.2) Candidate incentive becomes seem to be the most likely winner, not a variation of have the most appealing policies. Celebrities such as Oprah, a native-born Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc. would be attractive candidates. Not only would celebrity  be more powerful than policy as a predictor, campaign themes would shift solely towards Vote for the winner to increase the odds of winning. tl;dr: Pile-on effect would likely overwhelm policy appeal. 3) Election wins gives no policy signal. With proportional voting, your vote _always_sends a signal to politicians as to the relative poopularity of the positions, style, and character of the candidates. With proportional voting, a candidate who wins in a landslide may be justified in claiming a mandate from the people, and fairly expect their policies to hold sway. In a close election, it may mean that the electorate is highly polarized but it could also mean that the electorate feels that their policys and character are more or less equal. Lottery voting provides very little information, especially because its such an infrequent sample. The winner may have received 95% of the vote or they may have received a single vote. The former is more likely, but motivated reasoning will tend to make interpretations be well, thats not _really_ a popular position, disqualifying behavior, etc. The majority really wanted my candidate. tl;dr: Lottery voting destroys the value of % results.Others have already mentioned a loss of legitimacy in the results, which I think is very significant, as appreciation for the Central Limit Theorem is not, and probably will never be, taught in 8th grade Civics classes.","title":"CMV: Random ballot is a actually an excellent voting system"},{"text":"I am not Palestinian.

In random ballet, there would be a 1 in 25 chance that a candidates with only 20% of the vote would win twice.  It would take 3 wins in a row to warrant considerable suspicion but even with 3 wins in a row.Another issue is non-reversible policies.

In Poland the idea that Mr Tusk connived in the Smolensk air crash did not have to be true for it to plant the suspicion that he was not a true patriot. With Brexit, the Leavers claim that EU membership would lead to huge numbers of Turks moving to Britain was nonsense, and they knew it. But it helped them by turning the spotlight onto immigration. **You might have thought that liars would be punished for stretching the truth. But when politics is consumed by hatred and contempt, lying is part of the thrill.** Social media are a vehicle for all this lying, but they did not create it. An early, and particularly consequential, example came in the presidential campaign of 2004, when John Kerry ran against George W. Bush. Mr Kerry made a lot of his status as a war hero. His three Purple Hearts could quiet those who labelled him a flip-flopper, wrote Mitch Reyes, of Lewis &amp; Clark College in Oregon, in an analysis published a couple of years later. His Silver Star could quell criticism of his national-security record. The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth had other ideas. They were a group of around 200 who had been in Vietnam, a few of whom said they had fought alongside Mr Kerry. Shortly after the Democratic convention (at which Mr Kerry had saluted the crowds, saying that he was reporting for duty), they claimed that he had not won his medals fairly, disputed his version of the past and accused him of being dishonourable and untrustworthy. The Swiftvets followed with an advert and a book, pouring scorn on Mr Kerrys stolen valour. Within weeks, his lead over Mr Bush had evaporated. He went on to lose the election. The Swiftvets claims were untrue. Many of them had not fought alongside Mr Kerry. His campaign produced convincing evidence that some of the vets had praised his character before he was the Democratic nominee, and of soldiers who backed his version of what had happened in Vietnam. A naval investigator confirmed in early September, two months before the election, that his medals had been awarded correctly. None of that repaired the damage. What an anonymous Bush adviser witheringly called the reality-based community did not have an adequate rebuttal to the allegations. In its absence, the officials claim to the New York Times that We create our own reality was borne out. The created reality was that Mr Kerrys experience in Vietnam did not qualify him to be Americas commander-in-chief. One of the architects of the Swiftvets messages was Chris LaCivita, who is now joint manager of Mr Trumps campaign. Does this anti-ratchet doom democracy? Not necessarily. Our data show that in some places anti-politics has ebbed. It fell away in South Korea from 2004 to the election in 2016 (we have no data beyond that); in Chile from the late 1990s to around 2020; in the Czech Republic from 1996 to 2013 and in Switzerland from the early 2000s to the election in 2015. In other places, including Taiwan, Iceland, Japan, Norway and West Germany, partisan animosity has been consistently low. Britain has been lucky in that the hard camps which formed around Brexit did not translate into fixed party loyalties. Indeed, British voters have become increasingly willing to switch their allegiance between parties in recent years. In doing so they demonstrated a key weakness in anti-politics: at some level, competence matters. The disastrous mini-budget Liz Trusss administration brought forth in the autumn of 2022 caused a run on the pound and ended her premiership. No matter how strenuously she argued that she was sabotaged by the deep state, British voters realised that she had made them all poorerin other words, that politics is not in fact a zero-sum contest. A policys parlous results are not the only way that reality impinges on politicians ability to conjure up animosity out of thin air. A team of American political scientists found that the sharp partisan divide over how to deal with covid-19 was attenuated in people whose lives had been directly affected by the virus. For as long as refusing to mask up seemed like a badge of political allegiance, partisans would not wear them. If they discovered first-hand that this posed a danger to them or their family, they changed their ways. [...] But reversing negative partisanship is not easy. Naturally, pis has turned the accusation of abusing power back on Mr Tusk. Norms and institutions fall victim to partisan manoeuvring with distressing speed but, as Poland is likely to show, the work involved in restoring them is long and arduous. The story in Israel is even more sobering. The country is a parable of how anti-politics can proliferate when the circumstances favour it. And its experience suggests that the process displays a lot of hysteresis. The baleful results persist even when the conditions which created them have shattered. Before the murderous attacks launched by Hamas on October 7th 2023, Israel had been fertile ground for anti-politics. The sense of external threat had never been lower as Israel had made peace with one Arab country after another. Policy split the countrys citizens into groups. Many Israelis resented how the ultra-Orthodox did not have to serve in the armed forces. Despite being formally equal, Arab-Israelis were in effect second-class citizens. And the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, was standing trial for corruption. Vehemently denying wrongdoing, he had spread conspiracy theories about how elements in the police and the prosecution joined forces with the leftist media to manufacture baseless cases against him. Divisions reached a critical stage in the summer of 2023. The most right-wing government in Israels history had set about changing the institutions in its own favour, by curbing the power of the Supreme Court. Its opponents were staging the countrys biggest-ever demonstrations. Reservists threatened not to turn up for duty with the Israeli army. Marking the 75th anniversary of his countrys independence, in a column in The Economist, Yair Lapid, an opposition leader and former prime minister, had fretted over whether Israel could remain a vibrant democracy. The attacks on October 7th ought to have changed all that. The costs of division have been brutally cast in a new light. A sense of threat has been awakened, not only because 1,200 people were murdered that morning, but also because the country is now fighting Hamas in Gaza, Hizbullah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and has mounted air strikes on Iran. Despite this, though, Israel was united in grief and shock for only a few weeks. Quantitative data are still unavailable, but to Omer Yair of Reichman University in Israel, who studies polarisation, the country looks as split as it ever was. The right blames the left for weakening its defences before the attack; some of the left blames the right. Mr Netanyahu remains divisive despite Israels recent killing of the leaders of Hamas and Hizbullah. Israel shows that when anti-politics gets a firm enough grip, it can be hard to reverse.","title":"When politics is about hating the other side, democracy suffers"},{"text":"Dude...I once sat in a classroom in college trying to explain to others how homosexual sex is not natural.I was 18 and didn't get embarrassed by it until years later, when I started learning about life and sex (I am straight, but at 18 I was definitely a stupid, conservative virgin).Over the years, you grow and mature and you can regret...but the important thing is that you DID grow and mature...and NOW you are doing the right thing for the right reasons.Just remember, though...keep your mind open...in 20 years, things may shift again...but for now, I think the Democratic Party is the party fighting for the good of most of America and not just the top 10%.Welcome aboard.

As our data show, that is because the country more closely resembles a one-dimensional, zero-sum place that rewards negative partisanship as an electoral tactic. To see this destructive feedback-loop in action, consider three examples. In Britain politicians inflamed by the bitterness and contempt which characterised the Brexit referendum campaign were unable to agree on a policy for leaving the EU. In Poland hatred between the two main parties created a pretext for the government to capture the institutions that sustain the impartial rule of law. In America the presidential campaign of 2004 saw a ruthless initiative to invert the facts about a candidates war record rewarded at the ballot box, setting a dire precedent. The Brexit referendum in June 2016 was marked by contempt on both sidesone lot sneered at the cosmopolitan elite, the other looked down at nationalist bigots. However, Brexit was unusual because it produced an outcome that required activists to stop their negative campaigning and come up with practical policies. In this it was like the American Supreme Courts judgment overturning the right to abortion established by Roe v Wade. Euroscepticism and pro-life politics were great motivators. But when the dogs caught the cars, people who knew with searing conviction what they were against suddenly had to say what they were for. And they were flummoxed. Leavers were wholly unprepared for a highly technical debate on how to negotiate Britains departure. Should Brexit be hard or soft? Should Britain aim to become like Norway or Switzerland, which are close to the EU in some ways, but not others? Or should it quit the EU without any deal at all? Chaos ensued. Because leavers could not agree on what they wanted, Britain had no coherent position in talks with the EU. Parliament was deadlocked as Conservative MPs, giddy with resistance, rebelled against their own government. In a healthy polity, British politicians would have come together to work out which Brexit would best meet the many interests in play. For some Brexiteers, though, the hardness of the deal became a purity test instead of a question of practical politics. Remainers, including The Economist, filled the vacuum with passionate calls for a confirmatory referendum, fuelling a betrayal narrative according to which true Brexit was being sabotaged by deep-state Remainers. Brexit and its aftermath did grave damage to Britons faith in their politicians competence. Brexit stretched and twisted Britains poorly codified constitution. Traditions, norms and institutions are normally accepted as good ways to rein in the passions. However, if politicians can convince their supporters that the character of their opponents imperils the nation, they can frame the breaking of norms and stretching of rules not as constitutional vandalism, but as courage and strong leadership. The most dramatic recent example of this was Mr Trumps attempt to thwart the peaceful transfer of power after the election of 2020. A more gradual erosion took place in Warsaw where, over the course of the past two decades, a pair of gifted post-communist politicians firmly put the Pole into polarisation. Donald Tusk, who dominates Civic Platform, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who dominates Law and Justice (pis), started their political lives fighting side by side against communism. In 2005 the two parties almost went into coalition government together. Ever since, each has demonised the other, particularly after Mr Kaczynskis twin brother, Lech, was killed when an aeroplane carrying him crashed on April 10th 2010. That disaster gave rise to conspiracy theories about Mr Tusk collaborating with the Russian government to suppress the details of what really happened on that foggy morning outside Smolensk. Most political scientists think that polarisation in Poland began as a way for two similar post-communist parties to differentiate themselves. To appeal to voters outside the big cities, who felt that they did badly after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, PiS said that Civic Platform was godless, globalist and selling Poland out to cosmopolitan elites. For its part, Civic Platform looked down on PiS voters as reactionary and unsophisticated. The tactics hardened into competing identities, and those identities fuelled a bitter struggle for power that began to wreck Polands vulnerable young institutions. One former minister describes the business model this way: you need fear to motivate your basegive Tusk horns; make him out to be the devil or Satan or a Nazi. That wins you an election. But it is not in itself a firm base for long-term power. Unlike policies that can be built on, fear is a wasting asset that needs to be replenished, which is hard work. The best guarantee for staying in power is to use any time you get in office to capture the countrys institutions. Under Mr Kacynski, PiS increasingly ran state-owned companies and the media as if they were extensions of the party. It also entered into a drawn-out conflict with the EU about the replacement of senior Polish judges. PiS insisted that, because the judges appointed their own successors, the judiciary had never been properly purged of its communist past. Its opponents accused PiS of another partisan takeover. They say that if, having won elections in 2015 and 2019, the party had won a third term in 2023, it would have established such a grip on Polands institutions that it would have been hard to eject from officemuch like Fidesz, Viktor Orbans party, in Hungary.","title":"When politics is about hating the other side, democracy suffers"},{"text":"People have hacked and exploited lottery machines before which has been a vetted system for years.

I was going to try to avoid specific examples as to be unbiased, but from what you have said I am going to assume you are not a trump supporter. Trump can be extremely conservative, such as denying LGBTQIA+ rights, stances on immigration, etc, and still have a chance of winning. That's because he only needs 51%, so as extreme as he is, there are some people that support him. But under random ballot, a strategy that caters to 51% of people is extremely poor strategy. You are making your election a coin flip. Surely candidates would strive for 55%, 60%, 70%, etc representation. this might require compromise. This might require being moderate. But you do what you can do be elected.You're looking at the wrong side of the incentive.Look at what the incentive is for the voter, not the politician. I have the choice between 2 candidates that appeal to me. Candidate A is going for 80% of the electorate, so while they say something I like, they also say a lot of stuff I don't like, but that the other side of the electorate likes. Candidate B has decided to target my demographic specifically. They do everything I want, but are unlikely to get more than 5% of the vote.Now, in a conventional system I would vote for A, because voting for B is basically a waste. But in your system, wasted votes do not exist. Your ballot is either randomly selected, in which case it determines everything, regardless of who you voted for, or it isn't. So, as a voter, you can not waste your vote by voting on a niche candidate. It is always in your best interest to vote on the candidate who laser focuses you specifically. So, candidates who aim for everyone but please no one? They're not getting any votes.

Here's some tidbits,  \\n But even if a younger and undeniably more sprightly figure is now bearing the party's message, political observers and voters may feel that message is oddly familiar, reviving an old conception that's been stored in the political attic for the last eight years.\\n \\n \\"By looking only at income or lifestyle, we see the results of class, but not the origins of class,\\" writes economist Michael Zweig in his 2011 book \\"The Working Class Majority.\\" \\"We see how we are different in our possessions, but not how we are related and connected, and made different, in the process of making what we possess.\\" In other words, the power to create wealth and impose poverty determines class, not those values themselves. By that definition, Zweig says, more than 63% of Americans can be considered working class while only 35% are middle class.\\n \\n Middle-class status is associated with material stability, an especially appealing prospect when medical bills, groceries, gas and other necessities are not affordable for many working-class Americans. It can clearly be gratifying for a successful earner to achieve economic security, knowing or believing that it was the result of their ambition and work ethic. In modern capitalist societies, an occupation associated with high income and the symbols that money can buy, like a suburban single-family home or an annual summer vacation, creates an aura of respectability and even virtue. In the slightly outdated parlance of our country, that's the American Dream.\\n \\n Indeed, the middle class as a concept has become deeply ingrained into what it means to be American. The revolution of 1776 emerged in part from a rejection of the feudal class divisions that existed in Europe, and European thinkers like Alexis de Tocqueville, seeing a place where such divisions had vanished, wrote that people in America were \\"seen to be more equal in fortune and intelligence  more equally strong, in other words  than they were in any other country, or were at any other time in recorded history.\\"\\n \\n Class consciousness has largely remained dormant in America, in large part because most people consider themselves to belong to the same amorphous socioeconomic class. The powerful desire of most Americans to claim membership in the \\"respectable\\" class  and the corresponding desire among the rich Americans to underestimate their wealth and privilege  has meant that the boundaries of middle-class-ness have been stretched ever further in both directions. In recent decades, experts have sought to define the \\"lower-middle\\" and \\"upper-middle\\" class, underscoring the reality of socioeconomic divisions while maintaining the illusion that the American middle class can somehow be considered a coherent group.\\n \\n In a 2013 Atlantic article, communications expert Anat Shenker-Osorio explains \\"middle class\\" as a sort of universal negative category: \\"Not finding popular depictions of wealth and poverty similar to our own lived experiences, we determine we must be whatevers left over.\\"\\n \\n This lack of precision or definition makes for a great muddle of a category, but also an opportunity for politicians to appeal to a group of voters that may include somewhere between one-half to three-quarters of all Americans. Rhetoric and policies supposedly targeting the middle class tends to crowd out discussions about poverty, wealth redistribution, racism or the exploitation of workers  issues that risk exposing schisms or fractures within the middle class itself and are often dismissed as risky and divisive. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns were so notable  and so threatening to the Democratic Party establishment  precisely because he spoke directly to those issues. (To be fair to both Biden and Obama, they have also done so, although less consistently.) \\n \\n When Gallup first asked Americans to identify their social class in a 2000 survey, 63 percent identified as upper-middle or middle class (\\"lower-middle\\" was not included). Then came the economic crisis of the late 2000s and its aftermath, when experts raised alarms about worsening inequality and the disappearance of the middle class. Home ownership, the traditional emblem of middle-class prosperity, collapsed on a grand scale, and some Americans began to realize that maybe they weren't middle class after all. In a 2024 Gallup poll, just over half of respondents identified themselves as such.\\n \\n Out of this angry ferment came two very different expressions of anti-establishment politics.

So it was all the more striking that, at the Democrats jamboree in Chicago in August, Barack Obama chose to put party aside for a moment and address the whole country: Our politics have become so polarised these days, the former president said, that all of us across the political spectrum seem so quick to assume the worst in others unless they agree with us on every single issue. As delegates waved their banners, he launched an impassioned appeal for Americans from both sides to stop the rot. The vast majority of us do not want to live in a country thats bitter and divided, he said. We want something better. We want to be better. Negative partisanship is the dry academic term for the fraught, emotional and damaging phenomenon that Mr Obama describes afflicting American politics. It is the inclination of people to vote not for a party in which they believe, but against another one that they fear or despise. This way of doing politics has seen a marked rise in democracies around the world since the end of the cold war, a rise that has accelerated noticeably over the past decade. It is a bad thing. The politics of being anti is a tactic. It is not focused on a set of issues, nor does it draw on a political philosophy. It is available to the right and left alike: although the right may be more susceptible to it, it can frequently be used to the benefit of the left. Mainstream voters feel hostility to the extreme right more often than to the extreme left. [...] But a magic potion for elections [in this case negative partisanship] can be a poison for democracyand America is a good example of a place that is suffering its ill effects. Before this years election campaign, Americans were asked by the Pew Research Centre, a polling organisation, for a word that describes their countrys politics; 79% of them used terms like divided or corrupt. Only 2% had something good to say. Roughly 90% of them were exhausted and angry; less than half were hopeful. It is hard to see how the contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump has done anything to cheer them up. Speaking to Pew this month, four-fifths of respondents said it had not made them proud of America. Polities cannot sustain such cynicism without suffering grave harm. According to polling last year, almost two-thirds of Americans have little or no confidence in their political system. A bit less than a third have no confidence in either party. If politics is not working, then angry people are more likely to resort to violence, as they did against police officers after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and against elected politicians in the storming of the Capitol six months later. A survey by the University of Chicago in January found that 12% of Democrats, 15% of independents and 19% of Republicans agree that the use of force is justified to ensure members of Congress and other government officials do the right thing. [...] Most academic studies of negative partisanship look only at the United States. But, although America has caught a pernicious case of anti-politics, it is far from unique. Focusing on America alone conflates what is fundamental across democracies with what is particularfor instance, the effect of American states and counties sorting into monocultural Republican and Democratic strongholds. Besides, in the heat of the contest between Ms Harris and Mr Trump, it is hard to stand far enough back to get a dispassionate view of how campaign managers use anti-politics to manipulate voters emotionsbecause everyone is already so wrapped up in their own. To understand the deeper reasons for the worsening politics of antipathyand perhaps, thereby, to see ways to make things betterThe Economist has taken a broader view. We have put together what we believe is the biggest-ever dataset of voters feelings about the parties they support and oppose by tracking 274 elections in 50 democracies, ranging from West Germany in 1961 to the Netherlands in 2021. Collected with the help of Diego Garzia and Frederico Ferreira da Silva, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, the data come from surveys in which voters say how warmly they feel towards their own party and towards other parties on a scale of zero to ten. When there is more than one other party, we have taken the average. Our analysis ends in 2021 because some countries keep election-survey results under wraps for several years and we did not want the most recent data to be based on a different underlying sample. In any case, 60 years of data should be enough to uncover what is going on (our data and code can be found on GitHub). [https://github.com/TheEconomist/anti-politics](https://github.com/TheEconomist/anti-politics) [...] Our charts are weighted by population, so the growth of anti-politics in the United States accounts for a significant amount of this extra ill-feeling, especially recently. But the trend is broader than that. The increase in negative partisanship can be seen even if America, or for that matter the entire Anglosphere, is excluded from the analysis. It is seen in two-party, first-past-the-post systems and in those where representation is meted out proportionally across a plethora of parties. The chart shows how negative partisanship has worsened in countries of all sorts. You might say that democratic politics is infected not by animosity so much as by panimosity. We looked into these trends by collecting data on factors that academics and others have suggested might be causes of negative partisanship. We could show only correlations, not causation. But absent correlations can cast serious doubt on stories about causation, and a lot of correlations people might have expected did not turn up. You might, for example, expect people in countries where ideological differences are growing to become steadily angrier with the other side, but if anything the reverse was true. Influxes of refugees do not seem to spread animosity; a culture of respect for political opponents and their arguments does not appear to moderate it; booming economies were no less divided than stagnating ones. What of the correlations we did find? One is with the perceived threat of war. [...] Our measures of external threat included military spending, the frequency of deadly military clashes and armed stand-offs, and survey data on the fear of wars. In each case, voters feelings about other parties were less negative when they were more anxious about war. We also found that more military spending in a country was correlated with less partisan animosity. The exception is military spending by America, which since the turn of the century has spent a lot of time and money fighting abroad in the absence of any existential threat to those at home. The other broad correlation (see chart below) is with a set of beliefs about politics itself. When voters believe that politics creates economic and social gains in which everyone can share, regardless of their party, they feel more warmly towards the other side. By contrast, when they see politics as a fight over a limited set of resources, they are susceptible to campaigns that set them against each other. When people think their government is effective they tend to feel better about politicians. Likewise, if they expect to thrive in the coming years and if they feel good about their lives then they tend to look on political parties more sympathetically. In all these cases, the improvement in voters sentiment is greater towards rival parties than their own. Another indication of whether people see a future in a country is whether they stay there. Many factors affect migration, but the correlation with negative partisanship is nevertheless striking, whether you are comparing one country with another or looking at a single country over time. All this helps explain why negative partisanship often seems to begin with the rights ill feelings towards the left. By and large, the right is inherently more sceptical about the good works of government. It is also more likely to see society in terms of competing groups. If the right is quicker to attack this way, though, the left is inclined to respond by disqualifying its critics views as bigoted, immoral and fundamentally illegitimate. Thus tit begets tat. Our analysis may also explain those three steep declines in affection for other parties, after 1990, 2008 and 2016. The first coincides with the end of the cold war. If not quite the end of history, it was for many the collapse of a hostile ideological rival to capitalism and, in several countries, an end to the menace of a Soviet attack. Because our data end in 2021, we cannot tell whether Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw that effect reversed in neighbouring countries, with factions putting aside their differences to work together to protect the state they all depend on.","title":"When politics is about hating the other side, democracy suffers"},{"text":"Why is a candidate with 51% of the vote always legitimate.Because you then have to acknowledge the fact that they gave far reaching wide support, even if you voted for the other person.

The problems identified with monarchy was a question of what makes them worthy but there were also logistical issues to the monarch. If we have a good monarch that stability is only as good as the life span of the king and theres not enough in place to ensure a continuity of their policy from one king to the next, in a democratic process the elected official is in theory bound to the wants and needs of constituents who presumably desire continuity. The other issue is a king requires rebellion to oust from power and people die, kind of a bummer. Elections get around this by having the ruler gain consent to lead.

These are things which are hard to get clear numbers on. Not all US states require party registration (and some don't have it at all). Party identification is often separate from registration, with people saying they are a member of a specific party even if they have not changed their registration. This was [one of the main difficulties with the attempts to \\"unskew\\" the polls in 2012](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/unskewing-polls-party-id-bunk). This has other complications also, such as more people self-identifying as the party of a new President right after they are elected. (This may be connected to the fact that people consistently are more likely to say they voted for the winning Presidential candidate a few months after an election than one would expect simply from the actual voting totals. Some people like to just be associated with a perceived winner.)But, even if your numbers are correct (which I can't check) aside from people switching parties, new voters registering is a thing. Gen-Z voters have disproportionately registered as Democrats. See [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/age-generational-cohorts-and-party-identification/).  And some voters just died, and both due to general demographic and covid death rates (more Republicans died than Democrats there), there are things other than just party registration of existing voters which matter here.   An additional issue is that there's some change in who the coalitions that make up the Republican and Democratic regular voters. Historically, Republicans made up more high-turnout demographics, but there's some evidence that that is less he case now than that's been in the past. See [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/) and [here](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/dont-rock-the-vote). But even more seriously, being registered to a party does not mean one is going to necessarily vote for that party's Presidential nominee. And that should be even more clear this election where multiple very prominent Republicans have publicly endorsed Harris. These include Liz Cheney and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Heck, Trump's own prior VP Mike Pence is refusing to back Trump.All of that said, I'm also not sure why you think Harris is leading in the polls. Most polls seem to show Harris and Trump neck and neck, albeit there is [this election strong evidence of poll herding](https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state), which means relying on what the polls are saying either way is iffy at best.","title":"If 2/3 of all voters that switched parties between 2020 and 2024 switched from democrat to republican then how is harris leading in polls? make it make sense."},{"text":"Very few at all, I concur.

After several hundred elections this will be roughly proportional, but what about the 15 or so elections where people can vote?

The right is how people think it will be split and how students will tend to estimate a coin being tossed a hundred times with almost no runs of 3+ tails/heads in a row, the left is reality.Look at 25 to 49 in the real data on the left, a nearly unbroken run of Heads.

I guess this is a philosophical standpoint, but I don't think its about beliefs. Its about who each candidate supports. If you want me to bring in current politics, I will say that I very against trump. Yet, I don genuinely beleive that there is a segment of the population that would benefit from his leadership. Think about his tax cuts of businesses and attempts to restore industrial jobs. That's why people vote for him. Similarly, there is a segment of the population who would benefit from Harris's leadership. All candidates support some voters, but you can' help everyone. You mention you are gay. So you benefit from Harris's leadership. Great, the entire point of democracy is to find the leader under whom the most people would benefit. But not everyone benefits from the same incentives you do. The reason democracy's have historically thrived while totalitarian regimes have not, per Daron Acemoglu (MIT economist, won the nobel prize this year) is that democracy's have incentive for leader's to benefit their citizens, because it gets them elected. Yet, I argue, it only incentivizes the benefiting 51% of the population, not the most people possible. 2. This is why we have checks and balances. I obviously don't think a hitler 2.0 should be elected. But the hope would be that our system can make that impossible no matte who is elected. And I also disagree with the theory that plurality prevents this. After all, hitler 1.0 was elected democratically. Checks and balanced are necessary. Simply having faith that the electorate will elect \\"good\\" leaders is not enough.3. It's all about incentives. I was going to try to avoid specific examples as to be unbiased, but from what you have said I am going to assume you are not a trump supporter. Trump can be extremely conservative, such as denying LGBTQIA+ rights, stances on immigration, etc, and still have a chance of winning. That's because he only needs 51%, so as extreme as he is, there are some people that support him. But under random ballot, a strategy that caters to 51% of people is extremely poor strategy. You are making your election a coin flip. Surely candidates would strive for 55%, 60%, 70%, etc representation. this might require compromise. This might require being moderate. But you do what you can do be elected.","title":"CMV: Random ballot is a actually an excellent voting system"},{"text":"The tiny dancer didn't fall far from mommy dearest","title":"Elon Musk aka DorkMAGA's mom with mannerisms weirder than her demonspawn"},{"text":"101%","title":"Democrats have a plan if Trump prematurely declares election victory"},{"text":"Welcome to the Good side!!!","title":"Better late than never"},{"text":"That is not what I said.","title":"\\"It is so disastrous\\": MAGA men are freaking out that wives may be secretly voting for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"You'd think they'd prove the value by giving us an example from time-to-time.

It is easy to paint GOP policies as pro-cartel by explaining how limiting legal pathways increases illegal immigration and forces migrants to rely on the cartels to illegally cross the border. Similarly it is easy to explain and understand how lax gun restrictions in some of the border states is arming the cartels with American firearms. The Dem establishment also refuses to bring up statistics on how illegal migrants are less likely to commit crime, which is common sense seeing as attracting attention from law enforcement leads to a risk of deportation. Rep Greg Casar, whom I mentioned, is an example of how this messaging can be effective, the issue is that the Dems are unwilling to adopt this framing in their national platform.Not only is it incredibly stupid and harmful of the Dems to surrender to the right-wing framing on immigration from a policy standpoint, but they are simply lending the GOP credibility by doing it. They are essentially signalling that the GOP has been right all along by scaremongering about immigration, and makes voters wonder if the GOP has been \\"right\\" about other issues than just immigration policy.

I've been talking to undecided voters and people who sit just right of center. They're struggling with finding facts between Fox News and CNN, the WSJ and the NYT. They also tend to not tune into rallies and try to ignore a lot of the op-ed material that criticizes Trump as a fascist. The Harris campaign would have had a much better chance at making rational appeals to undecided and moderate voters if they'd addressed that two weeks ago. Acknowledging how complex the media environment FEELS to these voters is where the democratic party's agency lied in making an emotional appeal, I think. Repeatedly calling him a Nazi has been counterproductive, even if it's an accurate claim. The Harris campaign needed to establish trust with this voting segment earlier so they could follow up with rational appeals next about things like the budget. These voters truly do care about issues like economic policy and border control and those leaning towards Trump tend to have a previously established distrust of the Democrat party, associating it with corporatocracy. At least that's what I've observed. If they want to appeal to these voters by offering a better economic policy than what Musk is offering, and by informing them of what Musk's plans stand to do, they need to acknowledge their fear of corporate control, the sense overwhelming media noise, and highlight that Musk's plan is more likely to bring their fears to life than the democrat's plan.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk's remark is an October surprise potentially greater than Comey (2016) if Democrats use it"},{"text":"I think most people dont understand what she says at all because none of it makes sense Because what really makes sense, what really does make sense is having the common sense to understand our shared common sense.

I appreciate hearing your side and talking about this respectfully. I cant comment on a lot of what you wrote because I cant make my whole life about politics, and the issue is that most Americans are like me in that regard, but some of those who are like me will still be extremely antagonizing of those on the other side. I recognize theres a lot I dont know, so I find humility, and I accept and love my fellow Americans regardless of their political stance. I can only say, I dont trust much of anything on Wikipedia. Anybody can go on there and write whatever they want. Secondly, as Im sure youve heard, Trump urged protesters on January 6th to be peaceful. The Democrats dramatic response to Jan 6th; the harassment and threatening of thousands of people for simply attending the rally, while ignoring the thousands of democrats who TRULY riot all the time, setting fires in the streets, vandalizing businesses, looting, etc, tells me all I need to know. I dont believe that Jan 6th was as bad as people on the left want it to be, outside of an innocent woman, Ashley Babbitt, being killed by a dumb trigger happy cop. I dont think it was nearly as bad as again the MANY, MANY violent protests and riots put on by leftists over the past decade. Thirdly, the democrats have committed equally if not worse crimes than they allege Trump has committed, the only difference is they have the CIA &amp; FBI on their side to cover it all up. And Im only comparing to the left in this way because if youre going to accuse Trump of being an authoritarian, we do need to acknowledge how those accusations could be made to your partys leaders to. So they could be accused just the same.

If you vote for me, well fix everything in our 4 years that you wont have to worry about voting or not again. Its easy to take that message and warp it to support your point of view. But thats not what he meant. Trump is not trying to be a dictator. RFK JR, Tucker Carlson, and Tulsi Gabbard would not stand by and support that. These are all freedom loving people.

He really is just another Thomas Edison. He gets others to do the work, then he steals the credit.Tesla was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk funded it because he was into investing and venture capital.  Musk's \\"Falcon 1 Rocket\\" was designed by Tom Mueller, as was the Merlin and the Kestrel engines.  Elon Musk, didn't design it but he took the credit anyways. \\"Neuralink\\" which Musk has claimed the credit for (again), wasn't invented by him. In fact, he knows nothing about neuroscience and the vast majority of his claims have been refuted by actual experts in the field complete with papers disproving his ridiculous claims.  (At some point in the near future Musk is likely to have his own entire section to be found in Retraction Watch I suspect.)Zip2 was founded while Musk was an illegal immigrant in the USA.  He held a student VISA which prevented him from founding or running a US company legally.  He never actually attended the school for which he got the VISA to come to the US.  However, he, his brother Kimbal and a guy named Greg Kouri founded it in 1995. It was successful but it wasn't revolutionary. Musk and friends used the free NavTeq database along with the Palo Alto business database. The coding wasn't done by him though.  Had Navteq and Palo Alto's databases not existed. Zip2 would have had to be created from scratch.  It's interesting to note that the people who developed those two databases weren't credited nor paid for their contributions to his \\"empire\\" right?Shall I go on?Musk is a guy who was born in South Africa during Apartheid. His parents owned an Emerald Mine.  He has held 3 passports in his lifetime during a relatively peaceful era.  In fact, he broke the law to get his US passport. He failed to mention the part that he started a company in the US while on a student VISA while not actually attending any schools. Which was illegal in the 90's and is still illegal now.  He fraudulently got a student VISA, which he then proceeded to not to attend any schools on. He founded a company which was illegal then and is still illegal now. He lied on his naturalization forms which is illegal and grounds for denaturalization (not that he's ever likely to face that because he has money). Yet, somehow people think he's \\"great\\".  It will never cease to amaze me that people are pretending he's somehow a US Patriot.  He has no loyalty to any country, just to himself and somehow people are pretending he's a \\"genius\\" or that he's a \\"Patriot\\".  He's none of those things, he's an egomaniac and would absolutely change countries again if he thought that it would benefit him.Right now, it seems his only goal is to make America just like Apartheid South Africa.  I will never understand the reason that wealthy immigrants come to the US, and then decide that they'd like to remake the US into the country that they decided they didn't want to have a passport in.  I will also never understand why the Americans who are determined to scream that America should be for Americans are ignoring the part that they're getting their \\"marching orders\\" from immigrants who are hell bent on making America exactly like the place they left, except this time with themselves in charge.Edited: Words.Edited: clarity.Edited: wording and clarity (really need to quit hitting \\"send\\" before I've completely double checked things.)Edited: kiddo suggested I could word the final sentence better when he read it.","title":"Can democracy survive now the worlds richest man has it in his sights?"},{"text":"To put this idea into more perspective.

I don't see how they don't work with each other. Let's say that I am a mainstream Democrat. Let's say that RFK Jr. gets elected. I'm not going to feel represented in that election, or for the next four years. If you are a member of a mainstream political group, then you are much, much less likely to feel represented in this system than you would under the current system. For whatever reason, your OP seems to assume that everybody has weird fringe beliefs. They don't. The majority parties stake out their positions for a reason. Their positions are popular.2. So, you expect me, as a gay man, to be perfectly happy that the homophobe bloc got elected for 4 years and is going to throw me in jail for sodomy? You expect the Jews to be happy that the Nazi party got selected and is sending them to concentration camps? I mean, sure, it's only 4 years. But a lot of irreparable harm can happen in 4 years. The French Revolution only lasted for a *single* year, and it remains one of the bloodiest and most tragic periods in human history. Should we all be happy that Robespierre is going to be in charge, guillotining his opponents?3. How on earth does your policy make people less extreme? You're going to get people voting for *more* extreme candidates under this position, because they all have a chance of winning. Under the current system in the US, neither the Nazis or the Communists are likely to win.

That's a lot of people. One could argue that it is good that those 1.5 million people get some representation. Under plurality, those 1.5 million people who don't feel represented by either candidate are disenfranchised.

Yet, if we consider \\"famers,\\" \\"social conservatives,\\" \\"impoverished,\\" \\"intellectuals,\\" etc etc as voter blocks that have largely homogeneous needs (obviously with overlap) then there is time candidates wo have policies that aid different voter blocks. It may not be perfectly proportional, but each block should get at least some time represented, at close to their fraction of the population. Eg. a party with the support of 40% of the populace might win 25%-55% of the elections in one's lifetime but those are close enough to margin of error that it seems more acceptable than plurality? In plurality, a candidate with 40% of the populace wins 0% of the time.  3. I think you misunderstood my argument. I may have phrased it poorly, which is by bad.

Israel intentionally started military conflicts with multiple countries this year. They did it because it's an election year in the US and they know that no one can stand up to them in a decisive way without losing the election. You'll never get an understanding of the complexities of the geopolitics of that area by focusing on a select few of the attacks in the past year. You have to look at all attacks by all The countries involved and the order that they happened in. You have to untangle some very complex cause and effect chains. Once you do that, it becomes clear that Israel is the primary driver of military aggression in the region and their motives are pretty clear. Their current leader has nothing to lose because he is going straight to jail once he is out of office. He is in a similar position as Trump and is acting just as desperate. This fact combined with the US having their hands tied due to it being an election year have driven Israel down the road of aggression and hostility on an unprecedented level. They're picking unnecessary fights with multiple countries because the US can't stand up to them this year and no one else is positioned to do it. It's a common mistake for people to vastly overestimate the power of military aggression to change regional geopolitics. It's a tool that is easy to understand, like a hammer. You just hit things with it until they are the way you want them. But the real power in the world is influence. There's economic influence, social influence, political influence, and so many more. When we reach for the hammer of influence through fear of military action, all of our other softer influences vanish for about a generation. Countries aren't concerned about trade agreements with enemies that just threatened to destroy them. Why would they trust someone who is prepared to do irrecoverable harm to their country on a massive scale? So we lose all options for influence except that one option of fear which is a clumsy instrument at best. It's also bad for us because we get cut off from whatever resources that country offers. Yes we're big and rich but we don't have everything. Plus flexing our military muscle at someone alienates all of their allies as well. It makes every country in the world trust us less which reduces our influence with all of them. Trump oversaw the greatest loss in US power in the world and our entire history. We lost so much credibility by violating treaties, betraying our allies, an elevating hostile unstable regimes like Russia. The world no longer trusts the US to elect leaders that will honor the treaties they sign. That massively reduces our level of influence. It's one thing to say that if you cross the US your country will burn to the ground. That will get you a little bit of influence in certain situations but everyone knows that taking that kind of action is not a trivial decision so we are basically making threats that everyone knows we don't really mean if we do that. What would give us significantly more influence is if everyone who does business with us thrives and can absolutely trust that if we make an agreement that will keep it. There are very few regimes in the world that would not jump at the chance of guaranteed power and prosperity. Our influence in the world spiked dramatically under Obama and then plummeted under Trump. Now the world can't trust that we will elect competent leaders that keep in place our agreements made under the previous president so our influence is massively diminished. It's going to take a lot of years to get that credibility and power back. The fact that the election is so close only confirms everyone's worst fears even if the Democrats win.","title":"CMV: The US Middle-East Policy, especially under Biden and Obama, while good intentioned, is terrible and is driving the region into chaos and strengthening America's enemies and radical forces."},{"text":"Well that was unexpected!","title":"Ashamed"},{"text":"She had to create a campaign from scratch and run with 90 days.

You may mean in that they were able to launch attacks of the scale of 7 Oct in the first place, but present, each group has reportedly been significantly weakened.2. My understanding is that the Obama admins JCPOA with Iran was a first step in transforming them away from being an enemy at all. Who knows if it would have succeeded to any measure, but we wont get to find out because for some reason some people really like having hot and cold wars in that region. 3. You suggested that the Biden admin has failed in deploying credible deterrence to the region, emboldening regional enemies. However, I recall that while Iran and Israel have exchanged limited blows, it was usually American military forces in the region that repeatedly aided in talking Iran down from a more full-throated response to Israeli strikes.

The post Cold War era theory (i.e the end of history theory) was that with the end of Communism, liberal democracy had proven itself to be the ultimate system of governance. The lasting peace in Europe following WW2, as well as the accelerated development in Asia had shown that capitalism must be an essential building block to ensuring peace between former enemies. All Obama was trying to replicate was normalization of ties with China except with Iran.From the perspective of the Obama administration, it wouldnt have been inconceivable for a future post-nuclear Iran to have a similar relationship with Israel the way China has with Japan. The politicians might have spicy rhetoric for the other side, but the economic entanglement would make war far too undesirable.\\nObama was trying to kickstart this by easing sanctions in exchange for Iranian cooperation on oversight into their nuclear program. By all accounts it seemed Iran was fully cooperating when Trump (egged on by Netanyahu) killed the JCPOA. Neither Trump nor Netanyahu have an end-game in mind for Iran. They pretty much either want the U.S. to go to war on Israels behalf, or for the status quo to continue unchanged (which as Oct 7th has shown might eventually lead to war anyways). If you dont believe Iran can be reformed by building economic ties, then youre implicitly stating that the theory on neoliberal capitalism being the ideal endgame is flawed.Edit: typo","title":"CMV: The US Middle-East Policy, especially under Biden and Obama, while good intentioned, is terrible and is driving the region into chaos and strengthening America's enemies and radical forces."},{"text":"Takes a strong mind to escape conditioning.

Same phenomenon applies to unionized labor and zoning restrictions among many other examples. Great for special interest groups, bad for the public welfare.A lot of the difficulty in running a developed country where there are strong civic organizations (which is generally a good thing!) is insulating the powers that be from their attempts to take advantage of the system to their benefit and the detriment of everyone else.

He ordered a halt to building the border wall, suspended deportations and ended a Trump policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico. His 28 executive orders on the issue included rescinding a Trump policy making every migrant who crossed the border illegally subject to deportation, not just those who later committed a crime. And he sent a bill to Congress to legalize 11 million people without permanent legal status. It went nowhere.  Now, four years later, illegal immigration has helped power the political comeback of the man Biden defeated in 2020. Immigration is a top concern for voters, with only inflation a bigger worry, polls show. Immigration is also the issue where Trump holds the biggest advantage over Harrisa 16-point gap in the latest Wall Street Journal survey.  The story of the border over the past four years shows how the Biden team, eager to restore Americas reputation as a haven for migrants, underestimated the risks they ran in loosening controls at the border. Distracted by the pandemic, inflation and the war in Ukraine, they shifted too late to more rigorous enforcement, according to interviews with current and former officials.  By the time they enacted tougher restrictions this year, facing a difficult election battle, It was too little, too late, says John Feeley, a former U.S. diplomat to Latin America who is supporting Harris. Like many centrist Democrats, Feeley believes that the chaos at the border was an own goala political gift for Trump.# The numbers More than eight million unauthorized migrants, originating everywhere from Cuba to Colombia to China, have turned up at the southwest border with Mexico during the Biden administration, according to Customs and Border Protection data, compared with 2.1 million during the Trump administration.   Though the Biden administration has turned back millions who tried to enter, an estimated 4.6 million have been allowed in at the southern border alone, according to figures compiled by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. That compares to 947,000 who were allowed in at the southern border during the Trump administration.  A lot of this would have happened no matter who was in office, R or D, says Angela Kelley, the former senior immigration counselor for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Were all coming to terms with a world where smugglers move people across vast distances and overwhelm a system that isnt set up to provide fast, fair and final decisions on asylum or provide lawful pathways to work in places where we need the labor. # Why they're coming The pandemic also complicated things. It ravaged Latin America, with a huge death toll and an economic contraction of 7%. Many desperate residents headed north to find better opportunities. The single biggest determinant of whether you have immigration lower or not is whats happening in the U.S. economy because most people are coming for work, said Ricardo Z?iga, a former high-ranking State Department official in the Biden administration. The new migrants were more difficult to settle because they came from so many disparate places. Central Americans and Mexicans who had sneaked across the border in the past usually had family and friends in the U.S. who could take them in, making their presence barely noticeable.  The newer arrivals did not. They would gather at shelters or on the street. Deporting some of the newer migrants was also far more expensive, when they originated from places like China or Africa, or impossible, given that countries like Cuba and Venezuela would not take them back. !ping IMMIGRATION","title":"How the Democrats Bungled the Politics of Immigration"},{"text":"Dude all they did was rush a change to be more accurate to what he said.

Fascists give their supporters the moral justification they crave to hate those that are different than them. Morality really has always been the enemy of conservatives, considering it shines a pretty bad light on everything theyve been conserving. Most people on the right were raised within groups/culture that both cultivate and justify a hatred for specific groups, while others are sucked in through conspiracy. Christianity cultivates and justifies a hatred of gay people. Thr confederacy cultivates and justifies a hatred for black people. Holocaust denial and neo-nazis cultivate and justify a hatred for Jews. Theyre eating the cats and dogs cultivates and justifies a hatred for legal immigrants. The enemy within cultivates and justifies a hatred for the left. Given that Conservapedia trades accurate history for a comfortable one, it kind of shows that Conservatives dont really want to conserve the past. They want a new past they can feel comfortable about. The only things that they genuinely conserve is a perceived conception of normal, and hatred for those who are abnormal.The right is primarily for normalcy, and is willing to remove or repress everything and everyone they see as abnormal for purely aesthetic reasons. Morality plays no part in their primary desires - desires cultivated by groups within the right, and perpetuated by their insulated communities. While these groups attempt to justify the hatred they cultivate, they literally cant. Its not justifiable to hate someone just because theyre different. So, they highlight when people of marginalized groups do something morally wrong, and attribute it to the whole group. Fox News and Trump have further demonized marginalized groups by making outlandish claims, and their supporters have clung to these lies.The biggest reason I see for the cognitive dissonance is that people on the right have to believe that Trump is righteous and wholly good, because if he isnt then theyre bad for hating those that are different. And while their core desire is normalcy, they are capable of morality, otherwise they wouldnt cling to Trumps lies. The problem is that the right operates by cultivating hate within people, propagating that hate through their media, normalizing it within their communities, and justifying it through a leader. The end result is a group of people that believe that it is justifiable to remove and repress those who are different, because now those who are different - different skin, different sexual desires, different culture, different beliefs, different values - are the enemy within. They are tainting the purity of the nation, and now that theyre the enemy, the right are justified in getting rid of them by any means necessary.Sorry for the rant, just felt like typing this out. I think its important to recognize that fascism is a result of those who believe normal = correct and abnormal = incorrect seeking moral justification for hating those who are different. The idea of normalcy and hatred are cultivated within the right, and Trump is justifying their hatred and normalizing it. Trump and his loyal subordinates gain unlimited power, right-wing civilians will support acts of evil if Trump claims they justify their hatred, and everyone who isnt normal will suffer.Btw, the whole craving normalcy thing is why calling people on the right weird has such an effect on them. It implies they arent normal.","title":"Trump's Dangerous Words Demand Action"},{"text":"Disinhibition, classic symptom","title":"We'll never know because she would never - because her brain isn't the warm McFlurry brain of a demented rapist"},{"text":"Id feel sorry for his staff for having to deal with the stress of this nightmare on a daily basis, but then I remember they are contributing to the problem","title":"We'll never know because she would never - because her brain isn't the warm McFlurry brain of a demented rapist"},{"text":"Trump might go away, but systemic fascism will be will still be here.
