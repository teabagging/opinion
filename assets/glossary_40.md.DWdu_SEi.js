Biden constantly pandered to unions, and Kamala repeatedly emphasized the working and middle class. The phrase \\"middle class\\" appeared nine times in [Kamala's DNC speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-speech-transcript.html). The word \\"work\\" with respect to American workers  \\"working-class,\\" \\"workers,\\" \\"working parents,\\" \\"people who work hard\\"  appeared five times. She talked about how she herself grew up in a working-class neighborhood. The word \\"transgender\\" appeared zero times. And yet \\"she's for they/them\\" is considered one of Trump's most effective ads.The real issue here with reactionary white workers is just seething contempt for anyone who isn't them. Dems can spend all the time they want appealing to the working class, but a single word of support for minorities or LGBT is seen as coming at the expense of white workers. They don't want to feel supported, they want to feel as if they're the *only* ones being supported.Local Democrats dont necessarily disagree. American voters have a unique ability to smell bullshit, and they smell bullshit with the Democrats, said Dave Betras, a former Democratic party county chair who believes his partys brand has to be rebuilt from the ground up.How about all the bullshit that Trump constantly spews about how he's gonna magically fix everyone's problems? Or the bullshit that Trump the real estate billionaire knows and cares more about Rust Belt issues than Scranton Joe? Is everyone who doesn't behave like a bloviating idiot full of bullshit, because Rust Belt Trump voters are that way and they can't imagine anyone genuinely being otherwise?Few issues illustrate that better than a catastrophic 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, 15 miles south of Youngstown, that filled the air and local creeks with a toxic brew of burning chemicals that have severely compromised local residents health.President Biden did not visit for a year, whereas Trump showed up the same month and distributed Trump-branded water off a truck. His future vice presidential pick, Ohio senator JD Vance, wrote letters to the White House to demand a more vigorous response. That was enough to sway local residents like Jami Wallace, a lifelong Democrat who now campaigns full-time to publicise the impact of the disaster.The American people are so good at sniffing out bullshit that they've determined Trump would be more willing to prevent environmental disasters than the Dems, because he gave out water bottles with his name on them.Not that that wasn't missed PR opportunity for Biden. Dems have to do gratuitous pandering precisely *because* voters are inattentive morons. \\nSome Trump supporters are actually alarmed by parts of his platform C one cigarette shop patron said he was worried the future -administration might make his kidney dialysis unaffordable C but their anger at the Democrats outweighs those concerns.Lmao here go the double standards again. \\"The adult party did not magically fix everything, so I'll vote for the chaos party who will actively make my life worse.\\"\\nSeeing Afghan refugees move into government-subsidised housing when she had to finance her move to Kentucky infuriated her. Reading about Bidens plans to forgive student debt when she paid off her daughters student loans in full struck her as deeply unfair.She was unwilling to give the Biden administration much credit for spurring clean-energy businesses like her current employer, and she was too angry at GM to place much, if any, blame on Trump for allowing the old plant to close.Again, contempt for the other is the key. Biden's actions might have helped and Trump's might have hurt her, but the deciding factor is to vote against the party that helped those dirty foreigners.The retired blue-collar workers offered hints of the misogyny OHara mentioned C they said they didnt like Harriss Hollywood girlboss energy C and clearly responded to the Trump campaigns aggressive but unsubstantiated charge that the Democrats were more interested in subsidising gender reassignment surgery than in helping working people.Their worries were about the cost of living and taking care of friends theyve loved for decades and what it means to be working class in an era that has either outsourced or mechanised the work they used to do.\\nThey can't be that fucking worried if they're so willing to vote for the candidate that they acknowledge may actively make those things worse, in order to spite social progress.They are waiting for us older white guys to just die and get out of the way, Paul the retired aluminium worker said.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who also addressed the press conference, said on Thursday she had asked for a meeting with Trump, but did not expect it to happen before his inauguration. Greenland, home to 57,000 people, was a Danish colony until 1953 but is now a self-governing Danish territory. In 2009, it secured the right to claim independence through a vote. Egede emphasised Greenlands aspirations, saying: We have a desire for independence, a desire to be the master of our own house ... This is something everyone should respect. But that doesnt mean we are cutting all ties, all cooperation and all relations with Denmark, he said.

Its so deeply ingrained into everything, but its simplistic framework becomes problematic for more nuanced world issues.Unfortunately, propaganda is king - and it currently has a stranglehold on people who claim to be moral relativists. Thats why its become so easy for grandstanding governments to control the narrative. They get to be the arbiter of justice, which is essentially just altruism with ulterior motives, and the people get to clap for the good guys.In reality, the US doesnt support Israel and Ukraine out of the kindness of their hearts. They dont provide them with money and weapons because theyre good, or because theyre our allies, or to defend democracy.Its literally nothing more than a strategic political move. But its a delicate balance - the risks vs. rewards of intervening. Its why you dont hear anyone advocating to help the Uighurs in China, or the Tigrayans in Ethiopia.Thats why the US prioritizes Israel and Ukraine over its own people. Its better for business. Theyve also determined that the political and economical benefits outweigh the risks of you doing something about it.And lets face it - you wont. Or, rather, we as a collective society wont. Wed rather continue consuming their propaganda until weve fully dehumanized entire groups of people. I guess thats the price of supporting the good side?In conclusion, stop supporting war criminals, colonial states, and divisive governments that perpetuate violence.Do more research. Ask more questions. Lean on humanity.

Situations in which voters do not expect a politician to keep his word, and in many instances fervently hope and pray he will not, are rarer. Donald Trump, the US president-elect, fits this latter category. When Trump threatens to subjugate Canada, a Nato ally, by force, unilaterally annex Greenland, the autonomous territory of a friendly EU state, and override Panamas sovereignty for bogus security reasons, most people assume he is not serious and his remarks carry little real significance. This response, while comforting, is a mistake.Its entirely possible that Trump, pumped with hype, hot air and testosterone in the lead-up to his 20 January inauguration, is being gratuitously disruptive. He likes to shake things up. It amuses his Make America Great Again (Maga) hyper-nationalist fanclub. It may be that this former property developer and convicted felon, who counts himself a shrewd negotiator, is deliberately raising the stakes before more reasoned discussions about security and trade. But it is also possible Trump means what he says.If so, Trump will be following a well-trodden, discredited path. These days it It is somehow considered impolite, especially if you are British, to remind Americans that their republic was also once an unapologetically imperial power. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, US administrations aggressively pursued their own version of the colonial empires of contemporary Britain, Germany and France. In 1893, the sovereign state of Hawaii (whose royal family enjoyed close ties to Queen Victoria) fell victim to an American-assisted coup. In 1898, the US annexed Hawaii. Guam, Samoa and Puerto Rico followed. Americas loosely interpreted manifest destiny demanded ever more. The Philippines, Cuba and even China were all on the receiving end of US political-military, commercial and territorial ambitions.Far from being abandoned, neocolonialist American thinking persisted well into the latter half of the 20th century, operating under various guises. Newly-independent countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, liberated from collapsing European empires, were invited to join the free world, as defined and dominated by Washington. America promised protection and prosperity within the US-policed, post-1945 cold war order in return for fealty (plus military bases, trade concessions and access to resources). States that declined the invitation, such as Iran, Vietnam and Nicaragua, paid a high price.Viewed from this perspective, Trumps territorial ambitions are not so much an aberration as a throwback or regression to periods of unabashed American expansionism. And his motives are not dissimilar. As in the past, its all about security, cash and control. Greenland has valuable mineral wealth. It also has growing strategic importance, vis-a-vis China and Russia, as the Arctic sea ice melts and new trade routes open up. The US already maintains a military base there. Trump sees a lucrative opportunity C and by absorbing Greenlands vast territory, a chance to make America even greater, again. Trump claims the protectionist, high-tariff America First policies he espouses were the reason why the US, at the height of the Gilded Age in the 1890s, was, in his words, probably the wealthiest it ever was because it was a system of tariffs. Like Denmark and Panama (where Trump would like to get his hands on the canal), Canada has robustly rejected his turgid annexation fantasies. But mercantilist ideas dating from that period plainly influence his thinking, such as it is. Justin Trudeau, Canadas prime minister, says Trumps menacing talk is a tactic designed to distract attention from the damaging inflationary impact of his threatened 25% increase in taxes on Canadian imports such as oil, electricity, timber and steel. Everything American consumers buy from Canada [is] suddenly going to get a lot more expensive if he moves forward on these tariffs, Trudeau warned.The broader, significant point is that Trumps half-baked neo-imperialist tendencies are but one aspect of an overall, deliberately disruptive modus operandi designed to suborn, co-opt and disadvantage friend and foe alike. His intervention helped spur pre-existing turbulence in Canadian politics, resulting in Trudeaus resignation. He has stirred up the longstanding independence debate in Greenland, where most people would probably prefer to be free of both Copenhagen and Washington. In Mexico, another target of his geopolitical wrecking ball, Trumps antics grimly recall decades of Yanqui bullying and meddling in Latin America.The crass activities of Trumps sycophantic office boy, businessman Elon Musk, are all of a piece with this strategy of anti-democratic disruption and destabilisation. By backing far-right parties in Germany and France, imposing his ignorant opinions on British politics and picking gratuitous fights with the EU, all the while hiding behind the fuzzy screen of unaccountable, fact-free social media, Musk advances a Trump agenda that is fundamentally about control. Control of politicians and political discourse, control of open debate and communication, control of territory, trade and wealth, to be achieved through transactional deal-making, crude barter, intimidation, humiliation, subversion and, ultimately, through threats of force.This is how Trump operates. For him, this is strongman leadership. For others, it resembles mafioso-style extortion. It is this imperious, domineering, unscrupulous, manipulative and unprincipled, self-serving behaviour that the worlds leaders must face up to once again over the coming four years. Britain and like-minded countries that cherish democratic values and free societies should not duck the challenge. Better to take a stand and draw a line now, as Greenlands leaders have bravely done, than risk being steamrollered into subservience and satrapy.","title":"Donald Trumps Imperial Bullying Must Be Nipped In The Bud: Countries that cherish democratic values need to take a stand against the president-elects throwback to unabashed American expansionism"},{"text":"there isnt enough stooges. they do not have the 2/3 of the senate which is required to remove judges","title":"DOJ says judge was 'plainly' wrong to block Trump election interference report"},{"text":"A twice impeached, convicted felon will have his finger on the button.Why should our government care..

Doing so is a quick ticket to being socially ostracized. So, they come to accept prosperity gospel and its attending lessons as faith, because the alternative is being alone.

The people who wrote the 2018 Farm Bill weren't well versed on the subject, as they only established limits on delta-9 (D9).  THC-a is a precursor to D9 and not psychoactive in that form, once heat is applied it however, *then it* converts to D9 and becomes the dangerous drug we've been using for 10,000 years. So you'll likely never test a strain of marijuana with anything much more than .3% D9. And yet it is an identical product to states that have legalized. I live in North Carolina, there are stores everywhere selling real marijuana while labeling it 'THC-a hemp flower' in a state that has been historically against any movements towards legalization. As long as it is 0.3% or less of D9 when it's tested, it's technically legal.    \\nAnd shockingly, society has not collapsed despite warnings from our esteemed law makers. Why did anyone think they could outlaw nature in the first place?  \\nDon't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the loophole. It just seems silly to be discussing scheduled status when it can be legally purchased anywhere in the U.S now.   \\nOh, and I just buy it because it smells nice.

Politics is exhausting, and when there are people on the other side of the political spectrum who can be friendly outside of  political topics make the job a bit less emotionally draining, especially when dealing with the others on the side of the aisle who are never friendly. My family friend worked with Jason Carter (Jimmy Carters grandson) on different sides of the aisle, and despite disagreeing on most issues, they were friends to the point where Jason Carter jokingly offered to endorse my family friends political opponent to ensure said political opponent would lose. In addition, Ive heard the reports from multiple former presidents say that the job of president can be so insanely isolating and draining given that there are so few people who have ever had it and understand what its like that when they do meet up with former presidents, no matter what side of the aisle theyre on, its an immense relief to be able to finally speak with someone who understands. Im not saying I dont sort of understand people not liking the optics of seeing Obama and Trump chatting amiably with each other at Jimmy Carters funeral, but Id rather see it as a sign of hope that no matter how much we disagree, in the end, we can still see each other as people and approach each other on levels we understand instead of always fighting at every opportunity, that there is hope for unity beyond this constant tension we see in the news. I for one would much rather have the confidence that if an unprecedented situation arose, the current president would have enough of a relationship with all the living former presidents to consult perhaps the only people who would understand the pressures of the position he holds before doing something world shaking. But thats just the way I see it from my experience. I can see why people would see it differently, but Id rather we choose the hopeful signs rather than the gloomy ones.","title":"CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about"},{"text":"Weird, he must be involved in trying to set up his own deep state or something and is trying to gaslight everyone on the outside of his inner circle.","title":"Trump Ally Peter Thiels Op-Ed Turns Heads for Being Beyond Nuts"},{"text":"\\\\+1","title":"Trump has vowed to save TikTok.

Per [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism), \\"Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \\"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall\\".\\"Personally, I think Trump doesn't meet all definitions of a fascist. The Wikipedia page above lists many definitions of fascism; some really don't feel like they apply to Trump (\\"prioritizing the nation over the individual\\"). Others apply only in part. For example, Umberto Eco has a 14-point list of properties of fascism; I'd say Trump meets maybe nine of those - things like machismo, contempt for the weak, enemies are \\"too strong and too weak\\", \\"obsession with a plot\\" (stop the steal), fear of difference. But he doesn't meet others (cult of tradition, anti-pacifism, etc.).But given all this, I don't think it's irresponsible to point out the many ways his ideas are similar to fascism.The problem with a Hitler comparison is, Hitler's worst deeds (e.g., Holocaust) are just so much worse than anything I think Trump might do. But Trump *does* do things that are generally connected to fascist ideology (e.g., \\"they're eating the cats\\" - blatant lies about outgroup members meant to stoke fear and hatred).","title":"CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about"},{"text":"Going to pack ?","title":"DOJ says judge was 'plainly' wrong to block Trump election interference report"},{"text":"Trump chose Greenland the same reason Hitler chose the Soviet Union.

The problem is there will always be some interpretation of the Constitution, even by well-intended people, that expands it beyond what we may interpret its limits to be.Take the Commerce Clause as an example. It was originally thought to be the means by which the central government insured the free flow of commerce from one state to another. But it has become the means by which the central government regulates almost every aspect of the economy. SCOTUS has put some limits on that but Congress continues to use the clause to justify nearly all of its economic interventions.You and I may interpret the Commerce Clause one way but others interpret it more expansively. Who is to say which interpretation is right or wrong other than the voters? And based on the outcome of elections for the last century, the voters accept the more expansive interpretation.Ultimately, the voters are supposed to have the final say in enforcing any constitution. The flaw in that is that voters can basically be bought. There really has to be a conflict between political entities which prevents either from expanding its power beyond the limits of a constitution. I suggest the federal arrangement of sovereign states and a central government was the Founders solution to create this political conflict and limit power.The problem is the states have also been bought, just like the voters. This is where the amendments in the link I posted come into play. They take multiple steps to restore the balance between the state and central governments in order to limit the latter.For example, deficit spending is extremely difficult. This makes buying voters and states more difficult.The Senate is restored to being a council of the states rather than a a body of older and richer people than the House.The central government is prohibited from bribing the states.The states have the limited ability to fully nullify federal laws.Together, these amendments create that political conflict necessary to bind government to within its constitutional limits.","title":"When the government has their boot on your neck, does it matter if its the right or left boot."},{"text":"Because it just now dawned on them that they removed the majority of the guardrails that kept Donnie and his MAGA idiots from driving this country off the cliff last time.

Let's face reality rather than searching through the crumbs for any new BS. The mass media is owned 95% by right wing Oligarchs.

The only so-called liberal media is MSNBC and that's only seen by a very small percentage of people. Next you've had right wing foundations that have spent the last 50 plus years slowly weakening the education system so that the average American has an IQ of under 100 and a reading level of 5 to 6th grade. You've eliminated the Fairness Doctrine so that so-called news channels don't have to present real facts from fake ones. There's a myriad of other factors involved but you can go through what happened from Biden not dropping out early enough to Harris being Black, Asian and female to a thousand other things but the reality is Republicans have ginned the system so that they only have to do a little bit right and Democrats have to have an Obama and do everything right to have a prayer of a chance. You could go down the list of so-called hot Democrats and I don't know if any of them had a year or two extra would have won as well. So stop this BS about how Harris blew it because the reality is with the current system if this were a football game, you've allowed the Republicans to deflate the ball, take away the Democrats cleats, move the goal posts, water down the field and then claim that the Democrats are cheating.

The bonds of human civility, stretched beyond breaking, to the apparent surprise of everyone - break. So we have healthcare CEOs shot, and arson in LA, and people immolated on subways. These are the symptoms of a societal contract that has been broken. And it has been broken by the robber-barons who pretend to be 'elite'. They take the lion's share of income and wealth - the top 1% own almost four out of every ten dollars in the economy - and in return, were to deliver a society where we could walk the streets in relative safety, have faith that the water from our taps was clean, and that tragedies like fire would be responded to swiftly and competently. That was not an impossible task. I've lived in Toronto most of my life, and until the pandemic it was largely true. Sure, there were parts of Toronto I wouldn't venture to late at night, but that's true of any big North American city. But the pandemic fractured trust at many levels, and we have never recovered. But when governments stopped enforcing shoplifting laws, that was the final straw for many. Gob-smacked patrons at Ontario's gov't liquor monopoly watched as large ethnic men casually filled bags with high end booze and sauntered out the front door, undeterred by staff or citizens alike. Californians have watched Wal-Greens and CVS and others shutter dozens of stores after losses from theft. This is a complete abdication of the robber-barons' prime responsibility.So why should any plebians feel any fealty to a social contract so obviously abrogated by the arrogant rich? They inflate away the value of our meagre savings, putting paid to their promise of \\"price stability\\". They provide no protection. It's quite clear the time of the robber-baron is coming to an end. Biden, Trudeau, the revolving door at #10, etc - the bumboys who do their bidding are being banished. Zuck's trying to suck hard, but I doubt Donny's having any of it. All of Epstein's guests now quaking probably wish they'd been Quakers. And I expect an orgy of this over the next ten days. This is the wild beast in its death throes. I am not suggesting that Trump will make this better; I think the beast is going to do its best to hand him the worst possible situation - heated up war, tanking stock market, huge jobs losses - and hope that civil war is the result. Remember the bankers' credo: \\"The time to buy is when there is blood on the streets.\\" And if the streets are clean of blood, by God, let's create some. The old social contract is gone.

Panama's foreign minister has insisted that the sovereignty of its vital canal, which the U.S. handed over a quarter-century ago, is \\"not negotiable.\\" The prime minister of Denmark, a NATO member that oversees the autonomous territory of Greenland, has insisted that \\"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\\" And, Canada's outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has quipped that there isn't \\"a snowball's chance in hell\\" of a merger with the United States....Former President Richard Nixon frequently gets the credit for a strategy aimed at making adversaries believe in a leader's capacity for madness as a way to instill fear and gain the upper hand in international relations.Roseanne McManus, an associate professor of political science at Penn State University, says the modern version of the so-called \\"Madman Theory\\" or \\"Madman Strategy\\" was outlined in the late 1950s, although there are allusions to it centuries before. In 1517, for example, Niccolo Machiavelli said that \\"at times it is a very wise thing to simulate madness.\\"Nixon tried to use the Madman Theory to confuse the Soviet leadership and bring North Vietnam to the bargaining table to end the war there. Among other things, Nixon's strategy included \\"veiled nuclear threats intended to intimidate Hanoi and its patrons in Moscow\\" and \\"approving a secret alert of U.S. nuclear forces around the world to project the idea that [Nixon] was 'crazy' and force adversaries to back down,\\" according to the National Security Archive.McManus says there is reason to believe that \\"Trump is deliberately employing the Madman Theory and trying to make people think he's a little bit crazy to get a bargaining advantage.\\"Although Trump appearing erratic is nothing new for world leaders who dealt with him during his first term as president, traditionally, \\"for a lot of NATO countries, they're used to a very predictable U.S. commitment. And so this unpredictability ... will make them a lot less comfortable,\\" she says.The president-elect wants to disorient U.S. allies, hoping that \\"if both partners want good relations with the United States, they'll have to ante up,\\" Hamilton says....If Trump's strategy does amount to a \\"madman\\" approach, it's likely to reach a point of diminishing returns, Penn State's McManus says. \\"If you act irrational all the time, then no one will trust you and no one will want to make agreements with you,\\" she says. \\"It's harder for them to make credible promises or credible commitments or credible assurances.\\"Lute, the former ambassador to NATO, calls it the \\"cry wolf\\" scenario. Not only does it destroy credibility, he says, but there is \\"an opportunity cost.\\"\\"Eventually you lose credibility and people spend time worrying about something that's not going to happen,\\" he says. \\"It consumes time and energy ... that would be better spent in other ways, such as helping Ukraine.\\"There's a massive difference here between Nixon using it to confuse adversaries, and the incoming president using it to destabilize allies. Treating allies like adversaries might very well reduce the amount of soft power that the nation is able to project, which might also raise the likelihood of the deployment of hard power to achieve national goals instead.","title":"Is Trump's rhetoric on Greenland, Canada and Panama Canal a 'Madman Strategy'?"},{"text":"That would be unseemly and go against norms though!","title":"DOJ says judge was 'plainly' wrong to block Trump election interference report"},{"text":"Not going to matter.

If you don't toe Trump's line, you will be punished.[Absurdly Weird](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdGOP/?f=flair_name%3A%22Absurdly%20Weird%22)# Trump is showing he intends to lead through intimidation and fear. Your political convictions will have no bearing on the matter.He and his band of thugs are considering allowing California's citizens burn to death in their homes if their elected governor and state officials refuse to acquiesce to their political demands.Even as the conflagration rages and citizens die gruesome deaths, threats are replacing compassion and ultimatums replacing empathy.Is this the government we voted for or were we deceived by tyrants?Not my word, Trump's. It's all written here:Los Angeles is still ablaze and being ravaged by a raft of unprecedented wildfires. And some Republicans see opportunities to settle scores and punish liberals by withholding crucial aid.At a September news conference, Trump floated the possibility of denying wildfire aid to California as president unless the states governor, Gavin Newsom, acquiesced to his policy demands. He said if Newsom doesnt come to heel, we wont give him money to put out all his fires. . And if we dont give him the money to put out his fires, hes got problems, Trump added. It was an explicit threat.Now, with fires raging, Trump and his allies  including Elon Musk  have waged a dubious misinformation war against Newsom, peddling fact-free propaganda blaming the governor, and liberals more broadly, for the ongoing tragedy. And in the midst of this conspiratorial blame game, Republicans are embracing the prospect of withholding vital aid. That includes far-right activist Charlie Kirk. As Media Matters noted, Kirk said Tuesday that Trump should withhold aid unless Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley  who, as the citys first openly gay fire chief, has garnered hatred from bigots looking to blame the fires on diversity measures  is fired.And when California, in a couple of weeks, comes crawling back for federal assistance, Trump should say, Listen, Im not gonna give you a dime unless you fire the lesbian Kristins, Kirk said.In a Fox Business interview Friday, Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio said disaster relief should be contingent on policy changes in California. If they want the money, then there should be consequences where they have to change their policies, he said, baselessly claiming that state officials have embraced policies that are making the problem bad or worse.Theres no evidence the fires were caused or exacerbated by Californias policies. In fact, Id argue its a climate-ignorant party that bows to Big Oil  such as Davidsons Republican Party  that bears some responsibility for what were seeing play out in California, given the GOPs refusal to adequately reckon with the reality of climate-related disasters. But this baseless notion that local or statewide mismanagement is to blame is quickly becoming a pretense for Republicans to ponder denying aid to California.On Thursday, Rep. Andy Harris told Newsmax that money for wildfire aid isnt a priority for Republicans because we just put more money into FEMA before we left for the Christmas holidays, and the Maryland Republican claimed that Los Angeles mishandled the fire department so egregiously that they ought to bear some of the burden for that rebuilding.In a time of crisis, Republicans are giving Americans  Los Angelenos in particular  a taste of the vengeful and overtly political behavior we can expect from the party in the years ahead.[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-sound-eager-to-deny-fire-aid-to-los-angeles/ar-BB1rflUO](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-sound-eager-to-deny-fire-aid-to-los-angeles/ar-BB1rflUO)?","title":"I got banned from..."},{"text":"For all of the pearl-clutching leftists reading this, this is what he meant by being a \\"dictator on day one\\".

When I see posts such as yours about finding the libertarian movement after being disillusioned by the left and right, it makes me glad to see you. But it also makes me want to make a few suggestions and observations.First, libertarian is not the part of a Venn diagram where the circle of the left and the circle of the right overlap. Instead, it ought to be considered as a completely altered way of thinking about the relationship between individuals and their relationship to government and the state.I would suggest that the basis of that thinking can loosely be defined as the non aggression principle, or NAP. But the NAP is not an absolute nor is it a perfect defining principle. But it ought to at the very least be considered a guide to how we all should think when considering those relationships described in the previous paragraph.For this reason, the libertarian movement is not a solid block of political principles. It contains a broad spectrum of thought that includes anarchists, voluntaryists, minarchists, monarchists, conservatarians and even some socialist-leaning libertarians, and probably more.Also, there is an economic aspect to the libertarian movement that often embraces the idea of free markets with little to no intervention in the market by the state. I would suggest that two schools of economic thought are the most common ones that are embraced by libertarians. These schools of economics are the Austrian and Chicago schools of economics but by no means are libertarian limited to these two schools of economics. The Chicago School is epitomized by economists such as Friedman, Stigler, maybe Sowell, et al. The Austrian School is epitomized by economists such as Hayek, Mises, and many more.Welcome to the libertarian movement and I would urge a deep dive into its history and guiding economic and philosophical principles.","title":"When the government has their boot on your neck, does it matter if its the right or left boot."},{"text":"Laughing word salad Evil Kamala will never hold office again ?.","title":"AI enhanced accurate lip reading of Trump &amp; Obama"},{"text":"what the fuck is a molicool","title":"Vichy Democrats Take Note: The GOP Is Coming for Everything"},{"text":"Honestly.

This is nonsense. Name one law that would make us an unconvicted felon.Sure. I don't know much about your life, but here are a few pretty common ways people violate federal law:* Have you ever, as a resident of a state with sales tax, bought something in a neighboring state without sales tax and used the Interstate to transport it back home, and forgot about it when you filed state taxes? Then congratulations, you're a federal criminal. This actually used to be pretty common before Amazon started adding state sales taxes directly to the purchase price on your behalf.* If you've ever traveled abroad and brought back some delicious food, have you made doubly sure you're not breaking any Customs rules? (For example, it's illegal to bring rice or beans from abroad, though cooked food should be generally fine.)* Weed, though it's legal in many States, remains a Schedule 1 drug. The Federal government can technically arrest anyone for growing it.You will notice that none of these laws are typically actually enforced \\"standalone\\" -- instead, they're tacked on to the list of offenses and used to artificially increase the sentences for **other** crimes. They're a tool in the prosecutor's pocket to increase the chances of a criminal accepting a plea bargain. What, you used the interstate to escape the scene of a robbery? You've now committed a Federal crime, buddy! Note, I'm not saying we should go soft on criminals -- if they deserve punishment, then increase it in the statute. What I'm against is finding \\"loopholes\\" to magically transform an obviously local criminal into a Federal one.But the arbitrary enforcement of these laws is morally unjust and, when done in such high-profile cases as those of Hunter Biden or Donald Trump, has the effect of lowering the common man's respect for the moral authority of the law. Both their convictions were on obviously petty charges, and the best solution isn't to ignore the law entirely for powerful people, it is to reform the law such that the most moral action is not to ignore the law in anyone's case.","title":"Trump sentencing live updates: Judge sentences Trump to unconditional discharge in hush money case"},{"text":"You nailed it.

Not only does this mean more potential danger, but more smoke spreading across the county/state/country. The Palisades Fire was already climbing towards the I-405 to the east and Encino to the north, so evacs in those areas. Its very likely these are done as a massive precaution due to how the infrastructure of that area can only handle so much in a sudden evac situation, but the fact the flames and glow can be seen from the Valley is troublesome. It seems to be quickly making its way toward the Calabasas area as well. UCLA is on high alert. No news about either Getty building. As for the Eaton fire, the fuel is still plentiful and the canyons make it hard to strike easily. A lot of folks are worried about Mount Wilson Observatory, its possible it might not be there anymore. Over 7000 structures damaged with Eaton alone. Eaton is at over 14k, Pailsades at over 21k.Now, some good news: containment. WEVE REACHED DOUBLE DIGITS. Eaton is at 15% and Palisades is at 11%. Progress is being made. Multiple copters and other aircraft are basically crushing it with their attacks and preventative measures, especially over night. Westward progression seems to have slowed down as well. As for Eaton, numerous evac orders downgraded or lifted to the west and south (though outages and dont drink orders still in affect). The line has been held around communities well.As for other fires, great news around. Archer Fire 100% containment at 18 acres (no structures damaged if Im not mistaken). Lidia Fire 100% contained at 395 acres. Creek Fire 80% contained at 3 acres. Hurst Fire 76% contained at 799 acres.

Fine, Chrtien said in an exclusive broadcast interview with CTV Question Period, airing Sunday. If he wants us to cut off electricity, he would have to walk up the Trump Tower with candles to go to his office, because the state of New York relies a lot on electricity coming from Canada.So its not realistic, Chrtien also said to host Vassy Kapelos.[]You know, (Trump) loves to be in the news, and the news gives him a lot of space, he said. But the reality is, in my view, Im not losing sleep over that, because they will probably suffer much more than we will do if we have that type of war.CTV News confirmed this week that Canadian officials are narrowing a list of American products to target in the event the federal government imposes retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump.Namely, U.S. steel products and ceramics, including toilets and sinks, as well as Florida orange juice, according to sources.Chrtien told Kapelos that Canada is in a better position because of the nature of many of its exports to the United States.We can get orange juice and a lot of products from other nations, but the electricity is not coming by truck or pipeline, he said. And the type of oil they buy from Alberta, if they dont buy it from Alberta, they will have to buy it from Venezuela, because its a special type of oil they buy mostly from us, and they cannot replace it by something else.# Chrtien doesnt take 51st state comments seriouslyThe incoming commander-in-chief, meanwhile, has ramped up the rhetoric even further in recent weeks, doubling down on his so-called joke to annex Canada and make it the 51st U.S. state and threatening to use what he called economic force to make it happen.In an interview on CNN this week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Trump of using the point to distract from the conversation around tariffs and their potential impact on both countries economies.Chrtien, for his part, is not worried.\\nI dont take that seriously, because I dont think it will happen, Chrtien said. Its not in the interest of America not to have a good neighbour like Canada, north.And for Mr. Trump, he does not realize that if Canada had been part of the U.S. a few weeks ago, he would have never become president, because the Canadians would not have voted for him, he added.\\nThe former prime minister said: Canadians love our values, pointing to being a generous, tolerant society.When asked how he believes Canadian officials are faring in navigating the threats levied by Trump, Chrtien said so far so good, citing several American television network appearances by Trudeau and Ford as examples.Chrtien in his interview also discussed Trudeaus decision this week to resign, and weighed in on the potential contenders in the race to replace the embattled prime minister and Liberal leader.Chrtien also said the Liberals need to move back to the radical centre to help their electoral fortunes.Further readings: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canada-will-be-ready-for-trade-war-even-as-it-pleads-for-peace-foreign/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-how-trump-could-declare-a-national-emergency-to-hit-canada-with-25-per/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-jean-chretien-canadian-leaders-donald-trump-plan/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-premiers-or-foreign-ministers/Other news:https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-foreign-affairs-minister-melanie-joly-bows-out-of-leadership-race/!ping Can","title":"'It's not realistic': Former PM Chretien thinks Trump will back off trade war"},{"text":"Day 66 of me saying we shall fight on.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 11, 2025"},{"text":"And hes going to gloat about this every. single. day. ?","title":"Trump Dealt Major Blow as Judge Cannons Ruling Struck Down"},{"text":"I'm all for spite against Leftist lawfare crap.

Some asshole blared his horn in front of our house around 5:30A.M. five days a week for over a month. We suspect this same asshole smokes Winston cigarettes, as we'd find our front yard littered with empty Winston packs.The dem political party is the area is trash. Worthless trash. They've ignored our requests for signs in 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024. My wife still tries to get signs, and I believe they actually gave her a handful of signs this year, but that would have been in late October.I don't bother with the local party any longer. I order my signs online. My wife picked up our 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, and a few 2024 signs from another district. For 2024, my wife spent over $1,400 to get Harris signs made. She and a few of her friends passed these out in a local park. Every day they did this, assholes would slow down and roll down their windows while driving by to scream, \\"Fuck you,\\" and, \\"Fuck Harris,\\" and would even sometimes scream out the N-word. Mind you, they were screaming at a 50 year old woman, and a few older women with chronic health issues.A handful of brave men even pulled into the lot and screamed at these women. One of the women with chronic health issues had to retreat into her vehicle and lock her doors because some guy was threatening her. She called my wife while I was in the office. When I spoke with law enforcement about this an hour later, they told me that they couldn't do anything because this was a 1st amendment rights issue. In 2020 we put a baby Trump in our front yard. Someone pulled into our driveway and told my 9 year old daughter that he was going to return with a knife.One day a friend of mine was screamed at while putting out some Harris signs.

These include plans for the largest deportation in history C a promise also made by Trump C and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.A key part of Project 2025s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of whats necessary to take control of these bureaucracies, Vought said, And we are working doggedly on that, whether its destroying their agencys notion of independence  theyre independent from the President  whether its bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment  the ability to not spend money  whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former bosss disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position were at, he said. The relationships will be there.

One must remember that Putin came up in the Soviet system; it is what he knows and nothing else.  When the SU fell, he was one of the survivors....and he has played his hand well, working quietly through the last 30+ years, measuring the world situation carefully....until he got Biden in office and he knew the time time was ripe.Our current leadership, Biden-era leadership, cannot recognize this.  Liberals don't even recognize history, much less learn its lessons, and they've never once done the math on this. So I want to see leadership in place that calls out Putin for who and what he is, and calls him out for his actions.  To use a pop culture metaphor, we need a Highlander to go meet this Kurgan.  I know people have a hard time understanding why we need to support the Ukrainians when we have so many problems here at home, but believe me when I say---beating the Russians in the Ukraine now, means we DON'T have to fight them later.Or possibly anymore.  The Russian military is tottering; this current infusion of North Korean troops and supplies will carry them for the short term, but after that, it's done.

They made policies that benefited the privileged classes at the expense of the poorer. Which is why wall street supported their administration and Kamala.

Ive already come to the realization, mainly through education, that the law isnt designed to punish people like him. It is designed to punish poor people like me.The one thing I disagree with the prosecutor on is Trump isnt responsible for a bad public opinion of the justice system. Its been bad for a long time.His sentence says to the public: Some people are above the law, and money  or even worse, political influence  can buy your way out of anything. Its no wonder why the world views us as having one of the most corrupt political systems.Trump has gotten away with so much already, charged or alleged, that he has no regard for the law or its enforcement. Nor any regard for women, people who are downtrodden, or anyone who is not in his tax bracket. He received what many people should have gotten, but instead, they were sent to prison or heavily burdened by fines or probation.R. Aaron Flaherty is incarcerated at the Wainwright Unit in Lovelady, Texas.I do not believe Trump was treated fairly, at both ends of the fairness spectrum. If Trump had elected not to seek the presidency again, I do not believe he would have been prosecuted. On the other hand, having been in prison for 28 years, I have never seen anyone found guilty of 34 felonies only to have the judge say the convictions are punishment enough, and let unconditional discharge be the final imposition of a multimillion-dollar prosecution.This implies that prosecution can indeed be vindictive, but if a person has enough influence, they can still avoid any accountability for their offense.The rhetoric Trump has established during his campaign gives no hope for reformation of the criminal justice system under his presidency. His narrative of rising crime rates and a need for heightened policing and increased punishment is based on fake news.","title":"Was This Fair?

Now you can probably find hundreds or thousands of similarly warped minded people who believe the same insane things.

Still, when he enters the White House in a few weeks, he will be the first sitting president with a felony conviction on his criminal record.Trump invoked the unfairness of the criminal legal system at every turn of his legal case. He sought and received numerous delays, claimed the case was politically motivated, received immunity for his actions while president (effectively wiping several other criminal cases off the table), and asked for a last-minute intervention from the Supreme Court. But for many watching the trial  especially people behind bars  Trumps treatment, and his rare and lenient sentence, underscores the notion that the American legal system has two tiers: One for the rich and powerful, and another for everyone else.The Marshall Project reached out to people who have been in Trumps shoes at several critical junctures during his legal proceedings. A range of people with felony convictions told us that they werent afforded the same treatment Trump received during his arraignment. When a jury convicted him of 34 felonies for falsifying business records in connection to a hush money payment made to an adult film actress, some told us they hoped he would spend time behind bars to understand the plight of millions of Americans in prisons and jails.We asked people who have been convicted of felonies for their reactions to his sentence. Many tried to square their personal experiences with the system with the way Trumps case was handled. Their responses have been condensed and edited for clarity.Janel Suthers is incarcerated at Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville in Goodyear, Arizona.Donald Trump got off scot-free due to his public identity. This would never be the outcome for the average defendant. Trump is, by far, not the average defendant.I understand that a president is afforded immunity, but that exemption should only be applied to official actions that are directly in relation to his duties as president, not his personal life.With that being said, the American people elected Trump to be their commander-in-chief, and the judge has made his decision with that in mind. The message the public receives is that the rich and powerful are, in fact, above the law. That they can break the law without consequence has been a long-standing belief, but now we all know that its the truth.Was this fair? I think Donald Trump and the people who voted for him think it was fair. I feel that maybe he should have received a suspended sentence to send a message to all future candidates that they should follow the law.","title":"Was This Fair?

However, doesnt square with the history. Democrats have won national elections 3 times since Trump first stepped off the Golden Elevator. First, they won the House in 2018, when they promised bold action to hold a crackpot accountable. Second, they won the Presidency, House, and Senate in 2020, when they promised to: (i) employ incredible government action to end a once in a century pandemicwhich they beat, but didnt quite manage the economic fallout; (ii) attack student loan debtwhich Biden did an alright job despite the illiberal unelected 6 Justices blocking his attempts at every turn; (iii) employ broad government action to hold a man and party accountable for trying to overturn an electionwhich they miserably failed at; and (iv) a steady hand transition president who would for the first time in our lives cede power to a younger generationin hindsight, quite revolutionarybut he fell back on that promise until too late. Third, they kept midterm incumbent losses to a minimum in the House and held the Senate in 2022upon the promise to employ big government to address inflation and to protect individual freedoms, such as abortion. 21st Century Democrats succeed when they go big. Harriswho I quite admirecould not escape the establishment criticism from within the Party to draw together the Biden 2020 Coalition. Unfortunately, she was Biden-lite.

Brad Tabke won reelection by 14 votes, and local elections officials have admitted to throwing away 20 mail-in ballots from a heavily-DFL precinct.

What Europe would do in the face of a belligerent America is the exact thing Ukraine did in the face of a belligerent Russia.  They will trade land for time.  And Greenland is that land.  They will create a huge international stink over it, while hoping that the American political situation works itself out.  Seriously, taking Greenland by force would stir up a huge political backlash in America.  Europe shouldn't go the nuclear route until they know that political backlash won't be successful.  They will move to strengthen E.U. institutions (France and Germany won't let this crisis go to waste), create a combined E.U. military, and begin to build and train so that they can fight America conventionally in the future.","title":"Greenland leader says his people don't want to be Americans amid Trump interest: \\"We want to be Greenlandic\\""},{"text":"this made me laugh, thanks","title":"Appeals court allows special counsel's report about Trump's election interference case to be released to the public"},{"text":"Be fair, I guarantee you spite will be a part of what Trump does as well.\\nLogic and reason might be the main reasons but spite will be on the list...","title":"Trump Plans 100 Executive Orders Starting Day 1 on Border, Deportation and More"},{"text":"There are disqualifiers, but if the people with the power to enforce them don't...it doesn't really matter what the rules are","title":"Trump is a convicted felon, but he got off scot-free.

I dont think violence will be the answer because they have control over the military and the police now, but something has to happen or they will take your country away from you just as Putin and the oligarchs did in Russia.","title":"A Tale of Two Justice Systems: Only Trump Gets Convicted of 34 Felonies and Receives No Punishment | Public defenders and legal professionals said they never see the leniency offered to Trump given to other defendants."},{"text":"A US/EU based company is subject to US/EU laws and penalties.

So much needs done.Let's start with the military.  The military of this country is not a social experiment, and it never was.  I think it was Rush Limbaugh who was once quoted as saying \\"The military's job is to kill people and break things.\\"  That's where we need to point the compass.  DEI needs to die in the California fires.  Put a real leader back in charge.  I'm afraid the best leaders we could have had are dead---there are no more Eisenhowers, no more Marshalls, no more MacArthurs or even Pattons.  We're gonna have to settle for Hegseth.  Trump should hit his knees and plead with Mattis to come back.  He's not Chesty Puller, but he's damn close.  Once we get the top leadership sorted, the rest will come around.And that's just the start.The Department of Transportation stands out as a badly needed repair.  For the last four years, NOBODY has been at the wheel; I gravely doubt that Buttigieg ever even went to his office.  He spent the entire 4 years on paternity leave.  We have the means to get this country back on its feet, but those means are all trapped on cargo ships sitting at anchor off of all of our major ports.  Get those ships in and get them unloaded.  Figure out how to address the plight of the dockworkers, get them what they need to be able to do their jobs safely, and take care of their families in the process.  Within a year of this we ought to start seeing the effects; with the increased supply of goods, the prices will start to come down.  It won't happen fast---merchants are gonna want to maximize their profit margin---but it will happen.There's just the high points, for me.  Others will have their point of view and I think--at least, when it comes to posting here on this sub---those points will be reasonable.The great tragedy that I see is:  Trump's not going to be able to oversee the totality of the recovery.  He's only got four years.  He can get us started, but it'll fall to (hopefully) President Vance and his team to keep it moving.  The damage to the USG is frighteningly huge.  And that's not even the worst part..the worst part is that our enemies have had ample time to prepare.  Russia is coming apart at the seams, but China is ascendant, and the Middle East has never stopped being a problem.  If anything, Biden's utterly fucked-up withdrawal from Afghanistan poured gas on the fire, and Trump may find himself backed up and having to employ our biggest and deadliest weapons in order to reinforce America's position.  The idea of nuking Afghanistan should be on the table; we can't go back in, but the place is still a hotbed of problems and China took over Bagram AB within days of the pullout.  We don't have a lot of other choices there.I've digressed.  The fact is that Team Trump is going to have to work some serious triage and concentrate on the most damaged parts first.","title":"What measures/accomplishments by 7/20/2025 should we judge the success of the Trump administration?"},{"text":" How is a foreign government installing malware on your phone to bypass its security and spy on you using your camera and microphone to potentially use it as a zombie device for cyberattacks or a backdoor to get access to classified government and corporate secrets different from  a foreign-owned but US-based company installing malware on your phone to bypass its security and spy on you using your camera and microphone to potentially use it as a zombie device for cyberattacks or a backdoor to get access to classified government and corporate secrets.","title":"Trump has vowed to save TikTok.

Nothing could be truer. Sadly. Ive voted for 6 presidents since 1984 when I cast my first POTUS ballet at 20-years-young for Mondale &amp; Ferraro. Ive been a political wonk since and done all youve described. At 60, Im just done now. I cried for 2 weeks solid after DJT won this past November. Tears of sadness and grief and deep realization that my whole life of collective efforts of being a good, responsible American citizen have been in vain. I cried realizing what Ive sometimes instinctively known but refused to accept  there have always been darker, more evil forces behind the scenes continuing to snuff out the light, the goodness, the just. But this past November, and since, showed me that the darkness is done hiding now. Its front and center not only in the US but world wide. I dont know what to do anymore, with this paralysis I feel, except create a false illusion of going back in time, maybe to 1980s, when I was very naive and young yet happy. So saying goodbye to all social media, doing IRL things now like shopping local, underconsuming, cooking and gardening and reading my vast library, walking and hiking, finishing up 5-7 more years of work I truly enjoy, and just unplugging from the political scene.

Honestly, Fox News is tame compared to the podcasts shell listen to.Anyway, occasionally Id catch Fox left on the television after shed leave the kitchen or just in passing. Ive always been frustrated how far detached she and people like her are removed from reality, but honestly? Id never really paid attention to it when it was on when I was there before, but I did this time and I get it more now.Fox, which again is tame nowadays compared to the newer right-wing media, is *relentless* in their narratives. They constantly slip in random shit from years ago to remind you that its bad and its all the Democrats faults. They had a Democratic congressman on talking about certifying the election and he said it would be peaceful this time and the host made sure to remind the audience that there are election deniers on both sides.There was this spiteful little shit on that show The Five (who I dont believe is a regular member on it) who started off a discussion about Bidens Medals of Freedom by saying (paraphrasing) I think its great that Hillary Clinton received one because even though she has never accomplished anything in her life, she developed a great fictional story with the Steele Dossier. They still bring up Hunter Bidens fucking laptop and vaccine efficacy and every other random bullshit thing they can slip into a random sentence.They will never let their audience forget. Think about it from our side. Have you heard anything in the media about the Matt Gaetz ethics report recently? Nah. It came and went very quickly. He doesnt give a shit; hes talking about running for governor. And that came out recently. If a report came out that AOC nicked a candy bar when she was 7, Fox would be reminding their audience about it until she retires from Congress. All the other networks have moved on to Trump and wildfires exclusively. My mom actually watched Carters funeral, despite not liking him when he was President (or of course afterwards since she was told not to). She said it was very beautiful and she learned a lot about him and he seemed like a wonderful and honorable human being (which yknow, surprised me). But you know what her main takeaway from his funeral was, that I heard her tell my father? Do they have a second Joe Biden? This one spoke so clearly and eloquently! Like I can actually imagine that Fox or those other media networks have never shown a right-wing audience Biden not fumbling over his words or sounding competent and confident one time *in four years*. Like no fucking wonder they believe everything that Trump vomits out. They only see the coherent parts of Trumps rallies. Not the parts where hes talking about Arnold Palmers dick or dancing awkwardly for an hour on stage like an insane person. Nor do they ever see Biden or whoever speaking coherently about good policies. They just get him stammering or a heavily edited statement from a Democrat about trans people or whatever and then theyre told why its bad.

For reference, the million-gallon tanks are much smaller than LADWPs reservoirs, which can hold hundreds of millions, or even billions, of gallons of water (and are miles away from the Pacific Palisades).Officials said that normally, emergency teams would rely more on air support like firefighting helicopters, which would lessen the strain on water tanks by using more water from other sources like above-ground reservoirs. However, high winds and a lack of air visibility have meant those firefighting operations have been grounded, Pestrella said.\\n[Completely Dry: How Los Angeles Firefighters Ran Out of Water](https://archive.ph/2025.01.10-154714/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-fire-water-hydrant-failure.html)\\nMunicipal water systems are designed for firefighters to tap into multiple hydrants at once, allowing them to maintain a steady flow of water for crews who may be trying to protect a large structure or a handful of homes. But these systems can buckle when wildfires, such as those fueled by the dry brush that surrounds Los Angeless hillside communities, rage through entire neighborhoods.\\nGetting water to the upper reaches of hillside communities like Pacific Palisades can be a challenge. There, water is collected in a reservoir that pumps into three high-elevation storage tanks, each with a capacity of about one million gallons. Water then flows by gravity into homes and fire hydrants.\\nBut the pump-and-storage system was designed for a fire that might consume several homes, not one that would consume hundreds, said Mr. Adams, the former leader of the citys water department.\\nIf this is going to be a norm, there is going to have to be some new thinking about how systems are designed, he said.","title":"MAGA Leaders Use L.A.

Or he'd tell his henchmen, \\"Expel them from the realm, take all their stuff and give me 50%.\\"  So a family like the Rothschilds set up branches in 5 countries.  So if they fell afoul of one king, they'd still have operations in other countries.  They became transnational.Any President who stood up to the bankers felt their wrath.  Andrew Jackson did.  An attempt was made on Jackson's life. Which failed.  So instead he was trashed in the press.  He felt that his wife died prematurely because of all the vitriol, they had cast aspersion on her virtue.  Lincoln issued his own currency, circumventing the banks and paying interest.  Bankers in Britain wrote letters to each other, saying \\"This cannot be allowed to happen.\\"  In other words, they did not want there to be ANY TRANSACTIONS, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, THAT THEY DID NOT PROFIT FROM.  Lincoln was assassinated.  Anyway, into modern times, the people at the top have a liaison, errand boy, whatever you want to call him.  To interface with various governments and agencies.  Someone like Henry Kissinger was one such person.  Do you find it curious that he went to China at 100 years old ?  Just a few months from death's door ?   If the world worked the way most people think, Xi would say, \\"I\\"m not meeting that capitalist scumbag.\\"  But Xi did meet with Henry.  Don't want to piss off the people at the top.  They will wreck you.","title":"Who is really in POWER OF THE USA?"},{"text":"Why did the Obamas buy a beautiful coastal property on Martha's Vineyard if they believe in global warming/climate change?[https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/president-obama-new-house-marthas-vineyard](https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/president-obama-new-house-marthas-vineyard)","title":"Why would Trump be after Greenland if he doesn't believe in Global warming?"},{"text":"Its made me come to one conclusion after all these years:Stop appealing to moderate Republicans","title":"Trumps legacy"},{"text":"exactly.
