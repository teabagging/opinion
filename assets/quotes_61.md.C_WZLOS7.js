Its not about what you, I, or the public think.Its about the individuals actions, their choices, and whether theyre willing to confront the consequences of what theyve done. Some people might not want redemption, while others might fight like hell for it. Either way, its their journey, not ours.Redemption is messy, personal, and often painful.It comes from a moment where someones actions clash so deeply with their own valuesor the values of their communitythat theyre forced to confront. Thats where change happens.But heres the thing: nobody else gets to decide whether that change is good enough. Its not up to outsiders to say, Yeah, youve earned it, or, No, you never can. Thats not how this works.Take an extreme example.Say someone assassinates a health insurance CEO, believing profits were prioritized over lives.Some people might say the act was justified and that person doesnt even need redemption. Others would call it cold-blooded murder and say the person is beyond saving.You see the problem? People project their beliefs onto situations theyre not even involved in, acting as if their opinions define right or wrong.Thats exactly whats happening with Jamie Lee Komoroski (and most other 'people of interest' who go viral online).Strangers on the Internet, who had nothing to do with the situation, are sitting here debating whether shes redeemablewhether shes a good or bad person.Its all noise.The truth is, its up to her.

Now, I will lay out what I mean. I'm talking about defunding the police. I'm talking about raising taxes on wealthy corporations and businesses, and finally, immigration.  I'm going to cite these three specific examples because they're the most egregious. Defunding the police overwhelmingly negatively impacts your PoC voters. You say to defund them because of the killing of some black men while completely ignoring the circumstances of those instances.  I get the reaction when it is dealing with unarmed individuals, and that is justified. However, there's much room for case by case basis here. That being said,  by defunding the police, you reduce the amount of money going to them that could be used for better training, restructuring community support and outreach, at a time when those things are exactly whats needed, and you limit the ability to effectively engage in communities that most need police. Gang violence is at all-time highs. Violence, in general, is at all-time highs. Police are the first line of defense.  Can they do better? Obviously,  but not of you take away funding.   Rather than that, why not push for better oversight, including independent oversight and more accountability of officers who engage in poor behavior. Defunding the police was a stupid, poorly thought-out idea, and that it gained so much traction was equally stupid. Logical thinking people were never going to support this. All the support was from irrational, emotional people.  In the end, what you got was even more crime, more victims, and people fleeing your cause because it was negatively impacting them on personal levels. To my second point. The government is 36 trillion dollars in debt. This despite taking in more money than they've ever taken in previously. We also watched in real time what happened in Lahaina as well as North Carolina, Tennessee, and other hurricane impacted communities.  Simultaneously, as our own people struggled (and continue to struggle), hundreds of billions of dollars flowed out to proxy wars that we have no business funding. Hell, the fall of Assad in Syria was quite literally the pentagon fighting the CIA, considering we were funding both sides of that conflict. Just as we continue to do in Israel. Raising the taxes on corporations and wealthy elites because the government says doing so will enable it to do all these things like Healthcare and whatever else was literally the stupidest thing I'd ever heard. But people bought it. Taxing people to give that money to a government whose most effective policy is wasting it makes zero sense. But to top that off,  Raising those taxes to give that money to what is at best a dysfunctional government and at worst, an antagonistic government bordering on tyrannical means thousands of people get laid off, companies leave taking what taxes they do pay with them,  and you end up further in the hole with nothing to show for it.Finally, unchecked immigration. The biggest problem here is you're giving people streaming across the border free housing, free access to debit cards preloaded with thousands of dollars, and free Healthcare while at the same time, you're ignoring your constituents whom have been begging for the same sort of help. Put yourselves in the shoes of PoC from crime-ridden inner cities where they see no economic opportunities and no investment in those same communities. Now, imagine being them, watching as these people fresh into the country are handed the same things you've been promised for 50+ years. And it's handed to them day 1.  Would you vote for the people doing that? Yeah, me neither.Democrats biggest problem is an inability to think long-term and control their emotional knee-jerk reactions. The secondary biggest problem is the perception that they simply don't care about Americans. You can say they do all you want and point to whatever policy you want, but the reality is people are not feeling that. We watched billions get poured into a plan to connect rural households to high-speed internet. Then we watched as none of that money went out because DEI policies put up so much red tape that no companies could get funds from it. We watched as billions was set aside to build ev charging stations, and then the government built 8 of them. This circles back to the levels of wasteful spending happening daily and why you will never get people who think to sign onto increasing taxes on anyone. They see it as nothing more than a waste of money because government will just spend it recklessly.But you are right. Unless dems figure that out, they're done in elections. Worse, if Trumps 4 years end up being successful, and people come out better off, it's going to be even harder to ignore this time. And you've only got your party to blame. Best advice: stop with knee jersey reactions. Stop with emotional tirades. You just look foolish and petty.  Do better with your messaging. The Harris campaign trotting up celebrity after celebrity doesn't speak anything to rural or underprivileged voters. If anything, it shows them that conservatives are right, democrats ARE the party of wealthy elites.  You can learn from your mistakes and fund your way back to some form of more moderate common ground, or, you can continue on this oath and be cooked for the foreseeable future.  Choice is yours.I'll be fine either way ","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Well thought out and said my friendso many questions","title":"Odd how no one* is talking about the -Nancy Pelosi&lt;- connection to UHC hit / Luigi.

The reason flu spikes in winter is because social behaviors change in a way that encourages its spread. The result is what should be expected from any exponential process.

This is also why I think some people get frustrated with the covid response. A response to an exponential process can only appear two way: a massive overeaction or a massive underreaction. Think what would happen if we treated something like fire as some people suggest covid should have been treated. You want to stop the fire, ideally, before it starts, and if you can't you have to stop it while it is still very small because otherwise it will be impossible to put it out without massive damage.

I don't know what people are expecting, but there wasn't time to do studies or be sure about things, so experts used their best guess to create a recommendation and then that had to be communicated clearly. What is important is you need some distance recommendation. Having one is way better than not having one. Swift action and sticking to it is critical in emergency situations. Yes, some people treated that number as gospel, but those people didn't understand correctly, but they meant well. What I think people got frustrated about with covid was the communication. And this was due to a fundamental tension in communicating public health information. This information is critical. Lives were saved or lost based on solely that. The problem is that you want the messaging to be clear and easy to understand. The downside of this is that leaves little space for nuance or portraying doubts. If they had said 6ft and then followed with pages of nuance, a lot of people would have taken that as \\"well, I guess I don't need to have some distance separation\\" or organizations would have to come up with their own policy and people will blame them for it being wrong. The government communicating it allowed an unambiguous way for people to operate and know they were following best practices. The importance of all of this can not be overstated. It likely saved many lives. However, the lack of nuance in broad communication led many people to think they were lying or malicious.

They should absolutely seize this opportunity to feign a new platform confirming that Democrats are against popular vote elections for president and want to stick to the electoral college. Trump would fall for it and command his party to eliminate the EC. However, Todays Democratic Party is spineless and consumed by fear. Most of Biden and his partys actions are reactions made out of fear such as considering preemptive pardons, which would do nothing more than confirm the false allegations of corruption that Republicans have been making for years and give them decades of platform messaging that will resonate with voters of all stripes. But Think about the idiocy of it. If the justice system becomes so fucked that courts are allowing prosecutions of J6 commission members, then why would those same courts honor any pardons from Joe Biden? At that point, SCOTUS could just deem Bidens entire presidency illegitimate and reverse everything he did.The only way to reverse the DNCs path to ruin is to start thinking like the GOP, which understood a long time ago that American voters are largely ignorant and lazy and need to be told how to think. Democrats need to cut through the noise by doing strategically unique things that send certain messages.For example: Biden could issue preemptive pardons for bribery, malfeasance or treason for SCOTUS justices Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito. Democrats would initially be like, Why let them off the hook? Because there is no hook and never will be! Imbeciles need to accept that there is and never will be legal accountability for these people unless they aggressively change their modus operandi. For now, American politics is only and 100% about strategic messaging (theater) and actions make no difference unless they are paired with effective messaging. Issuing a pardon for bribery and treason sends the message that someone committed bribery and treason.It would automatically put them on the defensive and the press would be clamoring for their responses. The two justices would say they refuse the pardons because they did nothing wrong, opening up the situation to a court challenge to force them to accept and recognize the pardons, only theyd be pressured to recuse themselves once the case makes it to the SCOTUS  All the while establishing a court record of all the unethical and corrupt shit theyve done.","title":"On the Electoral Colleges future, maybe Democrats should call Trumps bluff"},{"text":"So if you get super drunk you shouldn't have to live with the consequences of choosing to get super drunk?","title":"CMV: Drunk Drivers Arent Irredeemable, and Jamie Lee Komoroski's Case Shows That Mistakes Dont Define Someones Entire Character"},{"text":"If there's anything I don't need in my life, it's another website for social media.","title":"Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz joins Bluesky"},{"text":"Theyre right that he tried for it, but yeah, the relief really didnt happen for most people.

Triumphing against oppression is a form where - say for example, Harris talking about her background - is a type of identity politics. She used an inclusive framework, sort of a, \\"if i can make it, so can you.\\" Still, it's part and parcel.\\n   * The idea that the Dems, as a big coalition, should protect all vulnerable people is another form of \\"identity politics\\" that is setting policy based on group memberships.\\n   * Thinking of \\"Hispanic\\" as a singular voting bloc is a form of identity politics - it's trying to use the white/black race relations and coalition building as the blue print for all.* Why did Dems Lose? All the focus on \\"why do dems lose\\" focus around narratives involving how do they communicate policy issues and what policy issues did they prioritize? That is 100% wrong. \\n   * Voters aren't mobilized on policy issues. They're mobilized on valence issues - broad themes like \\"are you fighting for people like me\\" or \\"good vs. evil.\\" This is why Dems continue to lose broadly because they think they need to calibrate policy issues when voters are moved by valence issues.\\n   * Dems lose because they've nationalized and urbanized their party. That goes along with their party leaders. It's why as Axelrod said, Dems talking to \\"working class people\\" sounds like a missionary talking to contactless tribes. \\n   * They lose because they spend too much money on \\"positive ads\\" instead of negative partisanship. When you look at who won down ballot, especially in 2022, the Dems that do better are the ones that run \\"GOP are fucking crazy\\" campaigns. Not \\"uplift us all\\" \\n   * The idea of a switch voter - someone who goes from one campaign to another, also implies there's persuadable voters. What if the electorate isn't static and a county going for Obama and them Trump then Biden isn't people changing their minds, but it's *mobilization*. Running campaigns based on persuasion will lose if your winning is about mobilization. GOP runs campaigns about mobilization and they win.\\n   * What people don't report on enough - is that while Obama did well above the ticket, during his presidency, the Dems lost over 1000 seats along legislatures, governorships, the congress; why? The subnational gains the GOP have are durable and essential to their winning valence issues. This puts way too much pressure up ballot by having little to no down ballot base of support. \\n   * They didn't connect Trump to many of the Trump era failures.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"Reminds me of \\"Old McDonald had a farm\\".

I mean you can see that they had massive gains among minority groups. However, I think you're sort of on the right track.Republicans won by making it seem like Dems were doing a lot of identity politics stuff when they really weren't. For example, there was that campaign about how \\"Kamala is for they/them while Trump is for you.\\" Another example was the Haitian eating pets thing, where Republicans were able to spin the narrative so that it seemed like Dems were highly concerned about Haitians, rather than the average American. Quite a few of my friends, and a bunch of things I saw on Reddit, indicated that Dems were the ones pushing DEI in everything.This was a bizarre tactic that managed to work really well. People kind of came to this assumption that Dems are largely focused on issues that only affect certain minority groups, rather than more major, general issues that affect a lot of people. So for example, I know plenty of people that just assumed Kamala had put forth no economic plans, had no idea how to handle foreign policy, had no tax proposals, etc. Typically, what candidates do, is point to their opponents policies, and point out the faults in them. The problem with that tactic is that it will introduce listeners to the opponents' policies. Trump just avoided doing that. Rather than saying, \\"Kamala's economic plans won't work,\\" he just said she had no economic policies and was pushing DEI. So people thought Dems were going all in on identity politics, when they weren't doing that. Now, I know what you're thinking: \\"That's just Republican pushing identity politics though.\\" No, it's not. If Republicans essentially (even if not so blatantly) said things like, \\"Straight people should vote for me,\\" that'd be identity politics.

As it currently stands, over a third of eligible voters can't even be bothered registering. And even out of those who do register, plenty can't even be bothered getting out there to vote. Do you honestly believe that when people aren't even willing to do such a simple task, they'd be willing to take far more time out of their life to go and sit an exam? Not a chance. It would be a bridge too far plenty of competent, registered voters, too. The most recent election provided a pretty clear indication of just how disillusioned millions of people are. Forcing them to jump through hoops to participate in a system they already feel doesnt engage with them will deter millions. Conbine that with millions more disenfranchised, and the result is the largest act of voter suppression in history. The US would be the subject of global condemnation and be criticised in every corner of the world, and rightly so. It would be a terrible look, and the geopolitical ramifications could be disastrous,\\"The only reason that I would favor compulsory voting is that it would do a lot of work to eliminate the chicanery over access to polls. I don't believe everyone should vote because I don't believe every voice is worth hearing. Some people just don't have a good answer to political questions, like believing that the President can pass an executive order lowering taxes, even though that's not how the system works.\\"Access and ease of voting is a huge benefit. But one that's often overlooked is the fact it forces candidates to be better. They actually to actually campaign properly all around the country and engage with the electorate, as opposed to just holding concerts and rallies. They face scrutiny in the community and from the media, and it gives people a sense of ownership and duty. Despite being compulsory, nobody is actually forced to vote. I will always vote in the senate, but often when it comes to the house of reps, and by extension the Prime Minister and the party who will take office - I could not care less. On these occasions, I've simply lodged an informal vote. Last time, I even drew a dick on the ballot paper to voice my disapproval with the mediocre candidates on offer.Lack of knowledge is one valid criticism of compulsory voting, but the system is still vastly superior to the US - where the whole campaign period is not about winning over the public, it's about who can best energise their existing base to get out and vote for them. Candidates only genuinely try to earn the votes of a few hundred thousand people across a handful of states. It's farcical. And it's why so many people don't even bother engaging with a system that completely ignores them. Party registration doesn't help matters either, and leads to candidates taking their presumed supporters vote for granted, counting their ballot before it's even cast.Giving the concept of voting rights being restricted to those deemed competent a bit more thought, I also take huge issue with the possibility of some of societies biggest contributors being denied that right. If we were to limit who can or can't vote, I would be slightly less opposed if the system was merit based in relation to one's contribution to society. Farmers, construction workers, logistics and utilities workers,, emergency responders and medical professionals, teachers etc are FAR more deserving of a say than some corporate office drone, tenured professor, stockbroker or banker, etc. These are the people who build and feed the country and may be too busy doing just that to find the time for an exam. Why are they denied a vote when people who contribute nothing to the community at best and in many csses actively take from it are not? That's not right. And it would not go down well with those who are excluded, despite everything they do. It. I have a feeling shit would hit the fan real quick The fact will always remain - denying people the vote is completely wrong on every level. And I say this as someone who strongly held this exact view many years ago until I realised I was blaming and lashing out at the wrong people. You say the voters need to be educated? How about educating the voters.. You want people to earn the right to vote? I say those who want power need to earn ours.The real solution is to fix the damn system and make sure to start at the top.","title":"CMV: The USA would function better if it limited voting to those who could pass a citizenship exam"},{"text":"Interesting stuff.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 10, 2024"},{"text":"Think my response is too long, so I'm going to try a 2 parter...\\"So, is it too easy or will it eliminate dumb people? Which argument are we advancing here?\\"Both. The fact that it's so easy for the average person detracts from the idea this would force people to \\"earn\\" their right to vote, or ensure only competent people participated, , thus having a smarter electorate who ideally make smarter decisions. But it doesn't ensure that. Plenty of the people you seek to exclude would bw able to swing 60%. All while only unfairly blocking those who might have learning difficulties or just not be that educated on when it comes to history or other topics that have zero bearing on one's motivation or rationale for voting any given way.\\"I already gave out a delta for this argument -- that the inclusion of the US Citizenship Exam doesn't necessarily effectively test governmental civics. Please advise me if I am also supposed to also give you a delta for presenting the same argument\\"Honestly, I have no idea, lol. And I'm not too fussed either way. Someone  gave me one the other day, but their comment wasn't long enough, apparently. I didn't lose much sleep over it, but you can if you like lol.\\"I was responding to your argument about how if a broken/failed system introduces a law then such law is invalidated because it came from a broken/failed system. My response is that, if we are assuming something is an improvement, it's coming out of something failed/broken does not invalidate it otherwise every positive change would be invalid.\\"What I'm saying more relates to how can they be trusted to implement something positive. In your scenario  the decision is essentially out of their hands - it's happening. But in reality that wouldn't be the case - the sitting government would make these decisions, and if I was one who believed the system had failed, I'd have serious concerns about a government I feel was wrongly elected making such enormous decisions. It's why I asked if you'd be fine with Trump implementing something like this. You said yeah, provided it was specifically what your CMV is based around. I was stepping outside for a second though. Really, the question should have been: Would you be fine with him implementing something along these lines, but of his choosing?\\"No they wouldn't. Dictators who permit voting usually do not try to winnow the voting population through laws; they generally either (1) prevent or severely weaken the opposition candidates from running effectively, (2) ban opposition candidates on the ballot, (3) add stuffed ballots or forged votes, or (4) use intimidation tactics to prevent communities with strong opposition from voting. The appearance of everyone voting for the one correct candidate is helpful in avoiding having the subject population realize that their votes didn't really matter.\\"To be honest, this stared as a throw-away line poking fun at the dictators in modern Africa and whatnot who make grand announcements about how free and fair their elections, when the whole world knows they're rigged. Ie they'd tell the world citizens passed a test and smartly elected the best government, but really, there were no tests, or it was totally rigged or whatever. Either way, it was more of a joke than a genuine argument.\\"I could imagine a fraud scheme where a moderately competent person takes and retakes the exam pretending to be less competent people so that those people who otherwise could not vote would now be able to do so (like how wealthy people may pay someone to take a standardized test for them illegally). I can't imagine this at scale though AND when that other person goes to vote, it's still their vote, so they can vote however their conscience dictates.\\"In my view, scale is irrelevant because any level of fraud is unacceptable. There's little stopping a coordinated effort to bring together a couple of hundred people with a list of identities to register and subsequently vote using these identities. Have a few of these going across multiple counties, and it could impact a result. It's highly unlikely it would, sure, but even a 0.1% risk is too high for my liking. As for your scenario where someone pays for test to be taken and votes themselves. Voting however their conscience doesn't absolve them from what they've done. Firstly, if we're talking about restricting people from voting, I'd suggest that those who willingly commit fraud should be on that list. Secondly, by circumventing the process, doesn't that defeat the whole purpose? They didn't pass the test. Therefore, they didn't earn their right to vote, and should not be allowed.Part 2 will be posted as a reply to this","title":"CMV: The USA would function better if it limited voting to those who could pass a citizenship exam"},{"text":"The reason we are \\"over the top\\" with our condemnation of drunk drivers is that drunk driving is a choice.

The Trump campaign made the election about identity politics and people voted against the democrats.I don't disagree with your view as you posted it but I disagree with your rationale. I think you are just rephrasing the same thing you are rejecting. If Trump won based on identity politics, why is it not also the case that the Democrats lost because of identity politics? I think both can be true.EDIT: My point here relies on the idea that Trump retained his voters and Harris lost millions of voters compared to Biden. The 40% of people who didn't vote are people who didn't vote for Harris or TrumpA large segment of the country just votes for a party and the democratic party in the past 10 years is the party of  identity politics. I personally see value in some of that stuff but it seems very clear to me that it is a substitute for a more substantive platform to use the government to help people who are struggling and solve problems in our society. If it comes down to identity politics, it's entirely possible that the side that vets white voters is going to win in a country where 60% of the country is white and a larger percent has white family members.One other thing to point out is that while Kamala Harris' campaign didn't emphasize identity politics, it was a continuation of campaigns and a political agenda does. There is an obvious subtext and it's insulting to people's intelligence on both sides politically when people deny this. Kamala Harris made it clear that she wants to do everything the same as Biden. The Biden, Obama, Clinton wing of the Democratic party very much engages in identity politics.Also, there are still very obvious ways that Harris did engage in identity politics that hurt her campaign. Her stance on Gaza hurt her campaign and any stance on Gaza/Israel is inherently identity politics which is why it is so intensely decisive. The campaign also went out of it's way to prop up neo cons like Liz Cheney over Bernie Sanders, who the Democratic party has consistently screwed over and demonized and who's supporter base is largely white males and latinos. Two groups that Kamala Harris failed to appeal to.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"All talk from the guy who actually tried to get Trump impeached.

The democratic messaging on the economy was very weak - instead of pointing the blame at corporations and making the Democratic Party heavily based around making corporations pay for inflation (is it true that they are to blame for inflation? Pretty much irrelevant) they gave these hard to understand economic messaging that went over the heads of many people. The issue was that the republicans had a very strong and simple economic messaging Biden caused inflation and Im going to fix it. Nothing more needed to be said, inflation happened during Bidens presidency and no matter how much dems pointed out the economy is doing well it was impossible to overcome the fact that three years ago I could leave the grocery store and pay less and today I pay more. It doesnt even matter if I got raises - Im still upset my costs went up significantly. So if you think it was identity politics that won the election I disagree.

Dunno enough about Maine politics to know who could run there, but it will probably be Cooper in NC and that will be a big boost even in a neutral environment.

If Cornyn is the nominee, realistically I don't think it's a target short of a blue tsunami. If he either retires or gets primaried, it's a target gettable in a wave. How gettable would depend on both our candidate and theirs.As usual, it's too far out to know for sure, anyone (including me) making predictions is to be taken with a grain of salt until way closer to the midterms, etc etc. But 2026 is likely to be a blue wave from a combination of midterms generally going the opposite direction of the president's party and Trump's policies being unpopular once people actually see the impacts. So, at a minimum, I don't think we net lose seats, even factoring in Ossoff being our most vulnerable incumbent.I think the most likely scenario if things don't change drastically is we hold our current seats, pick up ME and NC, then maybe get an upset in one of the other seats that ties the chamber. That would make Vance the tie breaker and still keep the Senate red, but it would drastically limit what the Senate Rs can do, too. Even without the potential upset, that's a 51-49 R Senate ripe for the flipping in 2028 that also drastically limits what they can do. Outright flipping the chamber is unlikely.

By now, I hope we all agree it's a major problem.  So in our final two episodes, it's time to talk solutions.Recently, there's been a big push surrounding the [Equal Rights Amendment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment)  The short version is: The ERA is a Constitutional amendment that would require equal rights for men and women.  There is a lot of controversy as to whether it's met the requirements for ratification - it passed Congress in the 1970s, and the required 38 states have ratified it, but some revoked their ratifications, but it's not clear if states *can* revoke ratifications...anyway, long story short, the current push is for Joe Biden to declare the ERA as part of the Constitution and just add it.I'm not enough of a legal scholar to have an informed opinion on whether this would work or not.  But I can offer two important points:1. One way or another, the ERA should be in the Constitution.  Gender equality should be a given under the law.2. The ERA, or any other law or amendment, would not be a solution to the issue of sexism.I don't think point #1 is controversial, but point #2 absolutely is.  Lots of folks think that if you have a law, equality just happens.  But that's untrue, and even worse, it prevents the actual conditions you need to end sexism.**It turns out people are sneaky, and kind of suck**We've tried to solve bigotry through laws before.  Every one of these laws has been a positive, and we should keep improving our laws.  But none of them solved the root issue.Let's start with our most shameful form of discrimination: Slavery.  Treating Black people as property and taking their freedom was perfectly legal for ages.  Then in 1865, the 13th Amendment was ratified, which said it outright:Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. So that was the end of slavery and racism!  OK, no, you're smarter than that.  Racist lawmakers grabbed that \\"except as punishment for a crime...\\" part and started coming up with every excuse they could to imprison Black Americans and make them slaves again.  And when legal reforms required prisoners to be paid for their labor, they also allowed those prisoners to be paid far below minimum wage, which continues today.  Even when Black Americans weren't thrown in prison, the legal framework of segregation emerged.  While 'separate but equal' was the official line, conditions were almost never equal.  Not for housing, employment, education, or anything else that would've led to an equal society.But why talk about segregation?  Didn't we fix that?  Legally, sure - the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended legal segregation by race.  But they didn't fix racial bias.  If you don't believe me, [check out the history and numbers from much smarter analysts than me.](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/systematic-inequality/)  Or just look at your average conservative social media page.This whole saga shows that **legal reforms aren't enough to change widespread, ingrained biases.** Every one of those legal reforms was good, and helped things.  But the fundamental problem is unchanged, which is widespread racism in people.  And people are very good at finding new, creative ways to be racist when laws change what they're allowed to do.**A similar story**This series is focused more on gender rather than racial bias, but the story I just told can be repeated for women's rights as well.* Women earned the right to fair, non-abusive treatment in their marriages.  But abuse is still widespread because their partners learned to hide their abuse more carefully, and in ways that make it very hard to prove in court.* Women earned the right to work outside the home.  But they still frequently get paid less than men for the same work, and face a ton of additional bias in the workplace (basically every form of sexism I pointed out in Episodes 1-8), plus the unspoken assumption that they should do the bulk of childcare and homemaking.* Women earned the right to run for office, but they get subjected to absurd expectations and unfair stereotypes that makes it hard for them to be taken seriously.* Women earned legal protections from sexual violence, but not freedom from the assumption that they must be lying, or that it's acceptable when it happens.  It also remains extremely difficult to charge and convict perpetrators, for both legal and relational reasons.To be clear, every reform that advanced women's rights was necessary.  So is the Equal Rights Amendment.  But the problem is that every time you pass a law to address inequality, people don't decide to treat others fairly.  They find new, more creative ways to maintain the pecking order.And frankly, sometimes you can't solve inequality through laws.  How are you supposed to have a law against thinking women are too emotional and not competent, for example?  That's a vicious lie that holds women back, particularly in politics, but you can't legislate lies out of existence.  It takes another solution.**So what do we do about that?**You can't legally force people to stop being sexist.  But you can teach them not to be sexist.I've made this point before, but it needs to be made again: People can reflect on the things they say and do that perpetuate bias against women, and stop doing them.  It takes honesty and careful thought, but I know people who've really changed their attitudes this way.   I certainly have.But there's one additional key: **It requires a teacher.**Sexism isn't just catcalling and violence; it's reinforced constantly by what people say, show, and value.  This makes it hard to notice until someone points it out to you.  And that's where the role of 'teacher' comes in.  And for people who are especially resistant to this stuff, they won't care about even the best-written, most personal account from someone they don't know.  Personal relationships are what makes them more likely to listen.Oh, and there's one more thing.  [Take a look at this article and see if you can guess what it is.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a35457093/why-ive-given-up-on-talking-to-men-about-sexism/)Women have been saying this stuff for a *long* time.  I suspect a lot of them are getting tired - not just of being argued with and ignored, but facing violence for trying to speak out.Yep, that's right, boys.  It's our turn.  We've got to help share this message.  The kind of guys who need to understand this stuff often take mens' words more seriously, so it's time to use that to our advantage.  Might as well make the patriarchy do some good for once.  It doesn't mean you have to jump up on the table and scream at the other guys about their privilege.  (Actually, don't do that).  But you can disagree when a guy is going on about how men have it harder and sexism isn't real.  You can point out that it's messed up when guys are denigrating women in private.  You can even start by pointing out that Andrew Tate is full of shit, if you're unfortunate enough to know a guy who's into him.Start by thinking through what sexism in and around you looks like.  Show, even in small ways, that you're not OK with this.  And see if it leads to a conversation.  Because women are already doing lots of hard work on this.  If we join them, we'll do a lot to help their efforts.  It won't always work, but sometimes it will.  Maybe we won't pass the Equal Rights Amendment together, but we can take a few steps to create a truly equal world.  Multiply that by a few million, and maybe we come to an agreement on equal rights together.**Questions to consider**1. Have you ever tried pointing out sexism in others around you?  How did it go?  Any ideas as to why it helped, or didn't help?2. What are some specific ways we can notice and challenge sexist attitudes?3. Any other thoughts?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 10, 2024"},{"text":"Question: You admit she's young and beautiful and had a lot going for her.

It's a pretty short story, 15 pages in English.2. In English literature in High School, we had that phase where we were focused on American Transcendentalism. Your Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau. The *Hjki* is basically Walden but six centuries older, but Chmei was more committed to the isolation than Thoreau.3. Chmei describes the chaos of the end of the Heian period, the transitioning of the capitol at Kyoto to another place, fire tornadoes hitting the city, droughts, floods, typhoons, etc. lots of people dying and starving and this was leading up to the Gempei War.He proceeds to be overwhelmed by the social turmoil and decides to focus on himself and his study of the sutras. Just like the Walden Pond cabin, he creates a personal space, focused on self-care and meditation, reflecting on change and impermanence, or [*muj*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence).I can't help but think of our talks on our approach to processing how the next four years will be here. So I figured I share my direct encounter with a work where the very person who wrote this was expressing the same thing, with varying degrees of trauma. It does come in waves, just like American Transcendentalism. But since we know of these patterns, we can work out how to deal with it healthily, since it presents a temporary phase of our lives.[I'll attach the English translation here.](https://www.washburn.edu/reference/bridge24/Hojoki.html)","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 10, 2024"},{"text":"Seriously.

There just seems to be something different about it.In any case, I'm just not seeing how any of that connects to anything I said in the comment you were initially replying to.

The NHS from the UK is often complained about too, but at least everyone is covered which is the most important thing.

That doesn't necessarily need to be resolved through UBI / minimum wage, it's just the simplest solution. Ultimately the issue lies with many people not being able to earn a living wage, so you can also adjust the cost of living (through different programs like rent controls) to help alleviate this issue. The US is the country with the 25th highest wealth inequality (2nd to Sweden if only counting Western nations). Whereas China, to run with the same example, is near the bottom of the list.

Which argument are we advancing here?\\\\ In addition, the majority of the questions had very little to do wiht anything that would indicate whether or not someone is \\"fit\\" to vote. Why should someone be excluded to vote for incorrectly guessing a state that bordered Canada, or not knowing which wars America was involved in during the 1800's?I already gave out a delta for this argument -- that the inclusion of the US Citizenship Exam doesn't necessarily effectively test governmental civics. Please advise me if I am also supposed to also give you a delta for presenting the same argument.\\\\ Operating on the presumption this would be an improvement and remidiates flaws.I was responding to your argument about how if a broken/failed system introduces a law then such law is invalidated because it came from a broken/failed system. My response is that, if we are assuming something is an improvement, it's coming out of something failed/broken does not invalidate it otherwise every positive change would be invalid.\\\\ that any sitting government who wasn't in favour could abolish it and replace it with something of their choosing. It's fsr from infallible and even if implemented with the best of intentions, could easily be corruptible.Sure. This is possible but unlikely. Unless the US has filibuster reform, practically nothing will ever pass the Senate.\\\\ Plenty of dictators in history boast to the world about their free and fair elections, despite them quite obviously being rigged. They'd be all over this..No they wouldn't. Dictators who permit voting usually do not try to winnow the voting population through laws; they generally either (1) prevent or severely weaken the opposition candidates from running effectively, (2) ban opposition candidates on the ballot, (3) add stuffed ballots or forged votes, or (4) use intimidation tactics to prevent communities with strong opposition from voting. The appearance of everyone voting for the one correct candidate is helpful in avoiding having the subject population realize that their votes didn't really matter.\\\\ In relation to this test would ID be a requirement to sit the exam?However a person is registered to vote would be the way that they would register for the exam.\\\\ the accusations of voter fraud might actually be legitimate im this case. Students pull these kinds of scams with fsr greater stakes and degree of difficulty. It wouldn't be hard for bad agents to pull this off.I could imagine a fraud scheme where a moderately competent person takes and retakes the exam pretending to be less competent people so that those people who otherwise could not vote would now be able to do so (like how wealthy people may pay someone to take a standardized test for them illegally). I can't imagine this at scale though AND when that other person goes to vote, it's still their vote, so they can vote however their conscience dictates.\\\\ More importantly, though, do you not think having to go through the process of sitting this exam would also deter many people, and therefore also be a method of limiting access and suppressing voters?It may, but since access to the test would be high, I suspect such attrition among people competent enough to take the test would be minimal.\\\\ I go entirely in the other direction on this and would propose compulsory voting.The only reason that I would favor compulsory voting is that it would do a lot of work to eliminate the chicanery over access to polls. I don't believe everyone should vote because I don't believe every voice is worth hearing.

Obama did not put the people against a scapegoat in the way populists do. Obama had a bit of populist stuff on billionaires but overwhelming ran a campaign on hope and unity, ideas that are throughly antipopulist. Populism is all about \\"The people\\" vs \\"the enemy\\" often meaning \\"the elite\\" but also often meaning groups like minorities or foreigners. It is, contrary to the name, designed to be divisive, scapegoat and create victimhood. Obama didn't do that very much again outside of attacking some billionaires.To steal the definition from Wikipedia:A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the ideational approach: this defines populism as an ideology that presents \\"the people\\" as a morally good force and contrasts them against \\"the elite\\", who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how \\"the people\\" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present \\"the elite\\" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groupssuch as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrantsabove the interests of \\"the people\\"  \\nObama was almost certainly the least populist president of my lifetime. For example if you want to compare to a left populist: Bernie constantly was constantly making out billionaires and corporations to be the cause of all the United States problems. Accusing the government of working on behalf of the oligarchy instead of the people.Trump of course blames elites, immigrants and Trans people for our problems.Obama? Obama blamed government dysfunction on partisanship. On not having enough empathy for others.Like take one of his most famous campaign speech's from 2008\\"I know these are difficult times. I know folks are worried. But I also know this - we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. Because we are the United States of America. We are the country that has faced down war and depression; great challenges and great threats. And at each and every moment, we have risen to meet these challenges - not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans. We still have the most talented, most productive workers of any country on Earth. We're still home to innovation and technology, colleges and universities that are the envy of the world. Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities. It won't be easy, but there's no reason we can't make this century another American century.\\"This is not a populist message. He is not attacking anyone. He is not seeking to divide anyone. Not Scape goating anyone. Simply saying people businesses, academia, need to work hard together to make a better America. It's also not doing the other populist tactics of creating victimhood and instead giving Americans a challenge to live up to. Populist rhetoric doesn't demand things from \\"the people\\" it just makes promises.With populists, like Sanders or Trump a speech is always going to focus on attacking a group, and will make \\"the people\\" the victim. It will make promises but not demands of \\"the people\\", only their enemies.I dunno.

It would be facilitated by them as they have a demonstrated capacity to perform this test.\\"Ok this test is far too easy, especially when 6 out of 10 is a pass  I'm not American and have never looked at this test before and just scored 20/20 on my practice test. Twice. In addition, the majority of the questions had very little to do wiht anything that would indicate whether or not someone is \\"fit\\" to vote. Why should someone be excluded to vote for incorrectly guessing a state that bordered Canada, or not knowing which wars America was involved in during the 1800's? Unless your intention is to just eliminate people considered \\"dumb\\", and that doesnt sit well with me at all..\\"Any improvement in the government is, by definition, introduced by a government that is less good than the version post-improvement. The point of these changes is to remediate flaws.\\" Operating on the presumption this would be an improvement and remidiates flaws. No evidence that it would, and plenty of indications that it wouldn't. But also missing a key point, that any sitting government who wasn't in favour could abolish it and replace it with something of their choosing. It's fsr from infallible and even if implemented with the best of intentions, could easily be corruptible.\\"Most dictators do not seek an educated electorate; they seek no electorate.\\"Hence why I specifically said \\"under the guise of\\". Plenty of dictators in history boast to the world about their free and fair elections, despite them quite obviously being rigged. They'd be all over this..\\"If he implemented it as I have described it here -- using the USCIS Citizenship Exam in an accessible way with accommodations -- yes. I would have no issue with it.\\"That's all well and good, but you're placing a lot of faith in someone. I'm not sure many of his detractors would share your optimism. Perhaps the argument is would it ever be implemented the way it's intended. Probably not imo, and any sitting government would try to find a way to rig the game in their favour, like they do with basically everything else they can.\\"I am not opposed to Voter ID requirements provided that the US provides, free of charge, to all citizens a Voter ID that can be used in any state. Otherwise, they are using access to Voter ID as a method of limiting access. The point of providing accommodations in my proposal is to avoid this pitfall such that anyone who wants to vote can access the test.\\" Well, that's refreshing to hear. I actually agree with the fact it should be free completely - albeit initially as a reluctant compromise. In my country, it's required and has to be paid for, yet we consistently have over 90% turnout. Really don't see what the big deal is. In relation to this test would ID be a requirement to sit the exam? In its current existence, i.e., not free? If not, imagine the accusations of voter fraud. They might actually be legitimate im this case. Students pull these kinds of scams with fsr greater stakes and degree of difficulty. It wouldn't be hard for bad agents to pull this off.More importantly, though, do you not think having to go through the process of sitting this exam would also deter many people, and therefore also be a method of limiting access and suppressing voters? The US already has low registration and poor turnout by international standards. This would cause both of those already weak figures to plummet. It would be a huge scale, highly effective method of limiting access - something I don't believe you would be in favour of, right?\\"I agree that other changes may also be important; that does not obviate the validity of this one\\"I go entirely in the other direction on this and would propose compulsory voting. I'm not going to get into it now. Perhaps that's an idea for a CMV of my own. But as an Australian, I strongly vouch for our system regardless of my disdain for most who are involved.

Or what about limiting it only to those who have served in the military, there's no way that can lead to any of the many varieties of tyranny or authoritarianism, right?As messy as it is, making citizenship status (and proving it with a voter ID) is really the best solution because allowing any group to decide who gets to vote is just going to create an oligarchy of those with political power who are invariably going to abuse that power. It sucks, but it is also (intentionally or not) a way to ensure Americans never become too dependent on their government.

Obviously if I'm taking an hour or 2 out of my day to go to the post office and take a test I'm going to care about the outcome of it.For example, only 36% of surveyed participants could actually pass a multiple choice test consisting of items taken from the U.S. Citizenship Test, which has a passing score of 60, according to a national survey released in October 2018 by the Institute for Citizens &amp; Scholars.Well yeah but that's with A) no studying or prep time B) no stakes and C) one attempt.  So it's not an accurate reflection of test scores that you would get compared to how people would do if they had prep time, stakes, and retries. Or do you think that people's scores wouldn't substantially increase after this same group of people tried again after spending 30 minutes looking at the question bank?So, I reject the argument that the pass rate would be so close to 100% that it's just a bureaucratic obstacle.But here's the thing though, the pass rate dosen't have to be that high for it to be a significant bureaucratic obstacle . Like let's use your 36% pass rate. And say that 90% of current voters can make it to the test.

Now you are 75 with a decline health and mental state. Should elderly not qualify because if they retook the test and they might not pass it. However, government and politicians are pushing for laws that could be for or against the elderly such as Medicare and retirement laws. You might not pass the exam now, but you understand local and overall policies that you can vote for and against.I would argue that, similar to a Driver's License, it should be a one-and-done and I would argue that old age has a much worse impact on driving than it does on mental capability.\\\\ Social class differences - this would also tip the scale on wealthier people to have the chance to vote more than poor or the working class. Wealthier people have the means to study, create space to take the exam, and most probably pass. However, when you grow up in a poor or even dysfunctional family, you might not have the means to have the space or means to take study and pass it. Working class people might have the means, but their focus is their family and could be living paycheck to paycheck, or maybe even working multiple jobs to raise their family. I am not saying thats true for everyone, but it creates an inequity and imbalance who can vote based on their wealth and time available.I agree that poor people may be less likely to pass the exam but I don't believe that the difference between wealthy and poor here would be significant enough to be a serious issue. Many immigrants to the US who take the exam are poor and they pass. It's not asking something high-level, like how the FCC is bounded by the First Amendment, but low-level questions like \\"How many Representatives are there in the House of Representatives?\\" -- It's the USCIS Citizenship Exam.\\\\ Mental state and medical care - If test is only suppose to be taken once. What happens when your mental or health changes? Would you make someone retake the test because their comprehension might change? A concussion or heart attack can change cognitive memory. Short or long term memory can be affected. Lets pretend that (A) they do have to retake the test and most likely fail. Then they are not able to vote on politicians or policies to can currently affect their medical care. (B) they do not need to retake the test, then the argument about understanding civic competence becomes null.One and done.\\\\ Our current voting system allows for everyone to vote so society as a whole can be heard. Policies can affect everyone no matter what mental state, class, and age you are in. Taking an exam to prove a cognitive level of understanding will tip the scale on a few group of people deciding what happens to the rest of us.If a person doesn't understand the fundamentals of how their government works, their voice is just noise. If they demand, for example, that the President set a new federal budget, they are asking for governmental policy in violation of the Constitution and which is, therefore, impossible.","title":"CMV: The USA would function better if it limited voting to those who could pass a citizenship exam"},{"text":"That's why I don't understand why any of this loan forgiveness even matters.

This may sound cold, but in a purely libertarian society they would starve, and I personally have no problem with the concept of an able-bodied person suffering the consequences of the poor decisions they made throughout life. In practice, your criticism is a valid one and I believe it was one of America's own Founding Fathers (likely Jefferson but I can't remember for sure) who said that the weakness of democracy is when the people learn that they can vote themselves more money.3. I was not making a values argument, just attempting to objectively point out the reason for the state of things. In most countries (including the U.S.) user fees, primarily in the form of fuel taxes, do not completely pay for road maintenance which is effectively a subsidy for road transport.4. In economics we refer to these different timeframes as the \\"short run\\" and the \\"long run\\". In the \\"short run\\" a lot more things are fixed, such as living in a car-dependent community. You are correct that in the example of a significant run-up in oil prices people can't cut out essential car trips and are forced to absorb the price increase. This is only true in the short run, however. In the \\"long run\\", people change their behavior much more extensively. For example, when oil prices started going up in the early 2000s and remained elevated, people started moving back into cities where public transport was better. In 2010 Philadelphia registered its first population gain since 1950, Chicago's population has stabilized (it had been steadily declining since 1950) and other cities have seen reductions in their rates of population decline.5. I hold the belief that there are certain legitimate public functions which can only be provided by a government, and a defensive military is one of those things. A military is a collective benefit, and unless you want to go down the road of conscription (which at the very least is decidedly anti-libertarian) collective taxation is the only way for everyone to share in the cost. With an all-volunteer military, however, I see no reason why the military shouldn't be considered the same as any other employer: If they want workers they need to pay a wage that attracts them, which needs to be high enough to allow them to save for their retirement since there is no social insurance in my version of society. I do believe in the principle that employers (including the military) should be responsible for the costs of on-the-job injuries suffered by employees, but just because you served in the military you shouldn't be entitled to free taxpayer-funded healthcare for the rest of your life.","title":"Interested in Libertarianism but have some questions."},{"text":"Hell kill it","title":"Trump will inherit a solid economy, thanks to Biden"},{"text":"The left exposed their hypocrisy years ago.

We need something more like a 28-12-10 strategy where the Dems compete to win the necessary swing states and make more effort there, then in the next 12 or so states accept that the normal democratic (even just normal liberal let alone progressive) message isn't going to win, so commit to just running folks like Manchin, potentially as independents, and then in the most conservative states, just give up altogether, and perhaps support moderate republicans in primaries or independent conservatives who are pro democracy in elections, rather than dumping any resources, time, and effort into winningElections are won in swing states and districts and Dems need to orient their message more around those areas (rather than playing to blue states) but shouldn't expect a 50 state strategy to workCreate an authentic Democratic brand that offers a clear alternative and inclusive vision for how we will make life better for the 90% who are struggling in this economyThis is populist lies. Most people are doing fine. Something like 70% are satisfied with their personal economic circumstances. We can do more to help the 30% who are struggling. But if we start from the assumption that 90% are struggling, we won't be engaging with reality at all, and we need to be rooted in reality if we want to have good policy, we can't just swallow progressive populist shibboleths that aren't accuratetake on the biggest corporations and wealthiest individuals who have rigged the system,System isn't rigged, and while we can support pragmatic increases in taxation on the wealthy in order to fund programs to help people in need, waging a crusade against corporations and the wealthy is just bad policy and has no place in serious politicsUndertake an immediate assessment of the effectiveness of Democratic political consulting practices and businesses, and terminate those who have been ineffective and detrimental to the success of our candidates and party. Expand the diversity of DNC consulting partners, focusing on bringing in more consultants to have a demonstrated understanding of populist policies that benefit poor and working class people of every race and geography.This is giving \\"get rid of establishment consultants and replace them with even more out of touch lefty consultants who are totally better because they are populist\\" (we should clean house with current consultants but not replace them with progressive populist stuffUndertake a deep analysis of the communications ecosystem to understand where voters\\nget their information, and build an up-to-date operation that targets voters in new ways\\nthat will reach, persuade and move them.This is suggestive of the \\"actually we just need to change the messaging and build up better propaganda operations, we don't need to genuinely pivot to the center on anything\\" idea that has become popular in left wing circlesBring in new leaders and encourage more voices to join party leadership by dedicating\\nseats for leaders of major allied organizations and other key partners.Giving (often out of touch) allied groups and organizations even more direct say in democratic politics by reserving them seats sounds like a really bad ideaPrioritize a ten-year plan to invest in reaching and turning out young people, including on college campuses with appropriate tactics, strategy and communications infrastructure.Waste of time and money. Young people don't vote. Dems should be focusing instead on appealing more to old people. In 2008, 65+ was 16% of the voters and voted for McCain by 8 points. In 2024, 65+ was 28% of voters and voted for Trump by just 1 point. There's a shift going on there and Dems should focus efforts there rather than on the young people who so many politicians have attempted to appeal to with little success. The positions needed to appeal to young people could harm the past with older folks anyway Invest in showing our commitment to real populism versus Trumps faux populismOnce again, real populism is bad tooPresent a clear strategy to help win upcoming statewide elections in New Jersey, Ohio,\\nand Virginia, as well as local elections across the country.Jesus, Dems aren't going to win Ohio, they need to focus on NJ and VASo there's a lot of bad shit here","title":"Progressives want major DNC reforms"},{"text":"And dont go to McDonalds","title":"New Jersey mayors pen letter demanding action on mysterious drone sightings"},{"text":"Thats what republicans do, lie to get a job","title":"Florida lawmaker abruptly switches to GOP shortly after winning election as Democrat"},{"text":"It's almost amusing, but mostly pretty damn sad, that some people think that Trump will improve the economy in any way at all and that Biden was bad for the economy.

This view was once so pervasive that the Republican Partys 2012 post-election autopsy concluded that the party needed to move left on immigration to win over more nonwhite voters. [https://theatln.tc/c2fLtdkH](https://theatln.tc/c2fLtdkH)?If that analysis were true, then the nomination of the most virulently anti-immigration presidential candidate in modern history for three straight elections should have devastated the GOPs Latino support. Instead, the opposite happened. Latinos, who make up about a quarter of the electorate, still lean Democratic, but they appear to have shifted toward Republicans by up to 20 points since 2012  Polling suggests that Trumps restrictionist views on immigration may have actually helped him win some Latino voters, who, like the electorate overall, gave the Biden administration low marks for its handling of the issue.?For more than a decade, Democrats have struck an implicit electoral bargain: Even if liberal immigration stances alienated some working-class white voters, those policies were essential to holding together the partys multiracial coalition. That bargain now appears to have been based on a false understanding of the motivations of Latino voters. How did that misreading become so entrenched in the first place?Part of the story is the rise of progressive immigration-advocacy nonprofits within the Democratic coalition. These groups convinced party leaders that shifting to the left on immigration would win Latino support. Their influence can be seen in the focus of Hillary Clintons campaign on immigration and diversity in 2016, the partys near-universal embrace of border decriminalization in 2020, and the Biden administrations hesitance to crack down on the border until late in his presidency.The Democratic Partys embrace of these groups was based on a mistake that in hindsight appears simple: conflating the views of the highly educated, progressive Latinos who run and staff these organizations, and who care passionately about immigration-policy reform, with the views of Latino voters, who overwhelmingly do not. Avoiding that mistake might very well have made the difference in 2016 and 2024. It could therefore rank among the costliest blunders the Democratic Party has ever made.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/c2fLtdkH](https://theatln.tc/c2fLtdkH)?","title":"Why Democrats Got the Politics of Immigration So Wrong for So Long"},{"text":"I've felt like I've entered bizzaro world in a way.

Especially since elections are administered by the state, it gives a lot of power to states that have historically been very hostile to minorities to set the rules by which they're allowed to vote.Quite simply you require an Act of Congress or an Amendment to change the exam. States would still set the time and manner of voting.\\\\ Richer and older people already vote at a higher rate than other groups simply because they have the time to go vote or the ability to take time off to do so. We vote on a random weekday which is a non-trivial burden for working class people in terms of being free and having transportation to go vote. I completely agree that this is a problem and I support making voting more accessible from a time or poll-access perspective. This is different from making voting accessible from a perspective of understanding what voting is doing.\\\\ Now you want to add a test that citizens will have to find the time to go take before being able to vote. Any additional barrier to voting will decrease turnout, and almost certainly won't affect every group the same. By making it harder to vote, even if the test is unbiased, you're changing the electorate.Correct. I believe it would be injurious to many different groups, not just one, but we would have an electorate more capable of holding politicians to account because they would understand what those politicians can and cannot do at a fundamental level.","title":"CMV: The USA would function better if it limited voting to those who could pass a citizenship exam"},{"text":"Michigan rejected a progressive (at least socially) in the general.It's like y'all refuse to accept defeat and learn","title":"Michigan Democrats look toward a future that some hope includes Pete Buttigieg"},{"text":"So just not use it at all then, because the republicans could take it away?","title":"Will Democrats Let the GOP Gut Trans Health Care? | When Trump takes over, Republicans may try to eliminate trans health care in America.

Functionality it's primarily focused on History and not civics. For example here's a sample citizenship test.1)Name one thing Benjamin Franklin is famous for2)Name one war fought by the United States in the 1800s.3)How many justices are on the Supreme Court?4)If the President can no longer serve, who becomes President?5)Who lived in America before the Europeans arrived?6)What is the name of the President of the United States now?7)When do we celebrate Independence Day?8)When is the last day you can send in federal income tax forms?9)What stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful?10)What happened at the Constitutional Convention?Now, only questions 4 and 9 require any knowledge of how the government works. The rest are either History questions (1, 2, 5, 10), questions describing the government without explaining it's function (3, 6) or general knowledge questions (7, 8). But the thing is: a passing score is only 6 questions, so you can get every questions about how the government functions wrong and still pass the test. Especially when you remember that you get 2 attempts.So the citizenship test doesn't do a good job of achieving goal B. Now typically at this point I get a response saying that the citizenship test is still better than nothing, so I feel like it's important to remind you that administering the citizenship test isn't free. It's a one on one interview that takes about 30 minutes, so even if the interviewer is being paid federal minimum wage you're looking at a $460 million dollar investment just to get all 150 million voters tested. Furthermore giving that the test is designed to have an extremely high pass rate (98%) it's much more likely that a person who was barred from voting was barred from voting because an extenuating circumstance prevented them from taking the test rather than because they failed the test.So in conclusion the Amount of knowledge that the average voter will have about the US government will not change much, but that small change in the amount of knowledge that the average voter has comes at the expanse of millions of tax payer dollars and the disenfranchiment of many voters.","title":"CMV: The USA would function better if it limited voting to those who could pass a citizenship exam"},{"text":"Older democrats have been propagandized away from left wing economics pretty badly.","title":"'The end of seniority': Younger Democrats are challenging elders for powerful positions"},{"text":"Are we the baddies?","title":"Biden pledges to send aid to the new regime to rebuild Syria"},{"text":"Its already all slop.

The 16 governors and three governors-elect who gathered for their annual conference in Los Angeles this past weekend welcomed areas of compromise they can find with a Trump White House, but they're already planning which fights to pick and are considering how they'll proceed. Many of the governors at the conference were elected during the blue wave in 2018 and have experience working with a Trump White House, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. \\"We were able to find ways,\\" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who was one of these governors and serves as the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. \\"We really took a positive approach to it, and this time around, I think we'll end up doing the same thing, because really, we have no idea what's coming down.

Thats evangelicals. American Evangelical Christians are the most pro Israel force on the entire planet. They openly talk about how they want all of Gaza and the West Bank to be destroyed and occupied by the state of Israel, referring to the areas as Judea and Sumeria. These ends, they claim, are because of their Bible. Because of their biblical understandings, that narrative is pumped all throughout the country and  many people are sickened to see religion used to justify such atrocities. Many people also understand their aims, which are to bring about what they think is the rapture and the end of the world. Mike Huckabee is about to be the ambassador of Israel and has publicly said he wants the end times to come and is excited about the end times coming.This truly adds a bit of psychotic drama to the whole affair for people as well. As someone mentioned earlier, state on state violence for power is par for the course for people. State on Stateless violence is another matter.

Biden and Trump were both historically unpopular nominees, so much so that a man changed his legal name to \\"Literally Anybody Else\\" and ran a joke campaign.?Biden AND Harris came into office at the peak of the pandemic with insanely high unemployment, staggering debt, and a broken global supply chain. Not to mention significant social unrest. In the years that followed, they had to drag a terrible economy back to \\"normal\\". That included dealing with inflation and increased cost of living. While real wages have been rising for quite some time, it also dropped significantly when they took office (due to no fault of their own).People vote largely based on their view of the current and future economy. Most people are not reading financial reports, studying macro trends, or analyzing policy. They look at what they make, what they can afford, and that's their judgement. Their experience trumps statistics.No presidential administration has a \\"lay up\\" when the economy is in ruins. None.Furthermore, rural voters are never going to vote for Democrats again. Local media, commonly cited as an antidote to polarization, has shriveled up, to be replaced by right-wing talk radio. Now, if Democrats could lose those areas by 30 points instead of 50 points, that would go a long way in the swing states. However, they don't just need swing states to remain viable as a national party (more on that later). Additionally, the 2024 election saw urban centers, people of color, and many other demographics that traditionally vote for Democrats swing violently rightward. As a 24-year-old man myself, I'm shocked but not surprised that Trump outright won men under 30. And I don't think they're coming back, because the Democrats won't embrace alternative media - there will never be a left-wing Joe Rogan. If the Democrats can't make up ground in rural areas, but also lose core parts of their base, they are doomed.Then they need to change their policies. A few small steps they could take to \\"win\\" these voters:\\\\- Message border security and the safety of Americans as a top priority\\\\- Give up assault weapon bans, mandatory buy backs, or federal gun control legislation\\\\- Communicate that they acknowledge hardships people are going through and actually seem relatable. Trump is not relatable. But he gets people to think he is.  \\nFurthermore, if Trump does go through with:\\\\- Increasing tariffs on major trading partners\\\\- Mass deportations\\\\- Deploying the military on US soil\\\\- Sending national guard into cities and blue states he doesn't like  \\nThere will be **significant** economic and social consequences. Costs of living will skyrocket. Unemployment will rise. There will be domestic violence at a significantly higher rate than we see now. Then, in 2028, Republicans will be running with that baggage. Republicans have largely been lucky in presidential elections. They've never come into office when there's serious problems or economic downturn. They've come into office after a Dem president lead the economic recovery and the GOP rides on those coattails.

The difference is in how they achieve it and how that growth is distributed. The left's expectations are pretty varied. The progressives indeed have a lot of lofty (but not necessarily unattainable goals). They mostly aspire to implement programs and social structures that are already present in many European countries. I don't think it's accurate to say they want to go back to the 50's... certainly they do not advocate for the 50's social structure. It's more like a rejection of Reaganomics and an appeal to the moderates who fear high corporate tax rates. But the left also consists of moderates and others. Some people just want some stability and civil rights protections and are reasonably afraid that the right is becoming too extreme. This seems to be who Harris was appealing to but unfortunately she just lost to people who want some kind of change rather than the status quo...even if they don't fully understand what that change could mean. At the end of the day though, I think people who are saying the left is doomed or hopeless are a little shortsighted. The democrats did extremely well in the past several elections and despite a lot of optimism for 2024 were actually fighting up hill in a lot of respects. They were forced to deal with consumer prices and a new, last minute campaign.

You have to take to account society as a whole and understand that there are different level of understandings at different ages, access to education, access and time to study, as well as the different classes within our society.Aging people - What if you took the test when you were 18 and passed it. Now you are 75 with a decline health and mental state. Should elderly not qualify because if they retook the test and they might not pass it. However, government and politicians are pushing for laws that could be for or against the elderly such as Medicare and retirement laws. You might not pass the exam now, but you understand local and overall policies that you can vote for and against. Social class differences - this would also tip the scale on wealthier people to have the chance to vote more than poor or the working class. Wealthier people have the means to study, create space to take the exam, and most probably pass. However, when you grow up in a poor or even dysfunctional family, you might not have the means to have the space or means to take study and pass it. Working class people might have the means, but their focus is their family and could be living paycheck to paycheck, or maybe even working multiple jobs to raise their family. I am not saying thats true for everyone, but it creates an inequity and imbalance who can vote based on their wealth and time available. \\nMental state and medical care - If test is only suppose to be taken once. What happens when your mental or health changes? Would you make someone retake the test because their comprehension might change? A concussion or heart attack can change cognitive memory. Short or long term memory can be affected. Lets pretend that (A) they do have to retake the test and most likely fail. Then they are not able to vote on politicians or policies to can currently affect their medical care. (B) they do not need to retake the test, then the argument about understanding civic competence becomes null. With that said, now combine both medical and class. If you are wealthier, you may have the means to treat your issues with no problem. If you are poorer, then you may end up living with the medical issue a lot longer. Our current voting system allows for everyone to vote so society as a whole can be heard. Policies can affect everyone no matter what mental state, class, and age you are in. Taking an exam to prove a cognitive level of understanding will tip the scale on a few group of people deciding what happens to the rest of us.

However, that does hold true for Israel. American politicians believe, and openly state that they believe, that the Israeli state has unique rights that other states don't have (arguably states do not have rights anyway). Criticism of Saudi bombing of Yemen gets some of the same justifications from the US state (ie \\"the bad guys are terrorists so doing terrorism on them is good actually\\") that Criticism of Israeli actions get, but Israel's actions are consistently framed as not only virtuous but as constant self-defense. Personally I think this stems from a view of the Holocaust as a kind of \\"hyper event\\" that was always happening, is still happening, and will continue to happen. \\"How can anyone be mad at the IDF for sniping children when there's a Holocaust going on?!\\" By framing all issues faced by both the Israeli state and Jewish people in general (two groups that are not entirely overlapping) as all part of the same \\"antisemitic attack,\\" there is effectively no action that could possibly be taken by Israel that wouldn't be \\"self-defense\\" or implicating a \\"right to exist.\\" The latter is a particularly galling canard that is constantly used in the US media and makes no sense. Where does such a right come from? Who else has it, and more importantly who doesn't? Taiwan, Kurdistan, Palestine, somehow these places don't have a right to exist. Just Israel, according to US policy.None of this comes up when talking about say, Turkiye and their attacks on Kurds.

But I dont think it tackles a why. That why is due to a fundamental lack of understanding of what Latino voters means or wants. In a border state like Texas, Republican rhetoric about the dangers of the border and of undocumented workers can be called racist by those on the left and (and by Latinos) you can win votes. Every restaurant in Houston has at least one undocumented worker and regardless of political position, I found business owners all too eager to turn a blind eye to social security numbers that didnt quite verify. But in the rest of the country, Latino doesnt refer to Mexicans, Guatemalans, and Hondurans. Now that I live in Florida, Latino refers to Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Venezuelans, and Cubans. And there isnt nearly the same amount of undocumented people arriving from those groups. The anti Hispanic rhetoric used to justify harsher border controls means nothing to them. So they default to issues that do and unfortunately thats the culture war. Latinos (like all other immigrant groups) are very conservative and tend to be religious. Get them talking about trans rights, socialism, and green energy and you lose them. Thats the problem with Democrats in their approach to Latinos but its the same problem Dems have appealing to blue collar voters right now. Theyve lost the core economic argument against the GOP so now the GOP can batter them with stupid culture war bullshit.

Currently right now we're in the nativist part of the cycle.  The problem comes from the fact that nativists truly do control the narrative around immigration.  Almost every study on immigration has shown that it's either a positive thing for economies or at worst is a wash, but all of our political conversations deal with this idea that we need to account for this nebulous negative effect of immigration on the country, that can take the form of things like \\"culture change\\" \\"wage stagnation\\" or \\"job loss\\".  I could be wrong but I believe the largest driver of job loss in sectors like manufacturing and agriculture come from automation, but we still have to pretend immigration is driving it.  Republicans get a pass for saying \\"I don't hate immigrants I hate illegal immigrants\\" then proceed to make it more difficult to legally immigrate here.  I'm kind of annoyed that in the wake of democratic losses nationally the message has become \\"we should drop these points from our platform\\" rather than tackling why people feel as though we're out of touch.

No, I actually disagree. To me, Libertarianism puts the entire burden of individual liberty on the individual. In that sense, I see literally zero rush to compromise for political expediency. I think you have to stick with Hayek on that as a Libertarian. I dont think Libertarianism is amenable to that sort of compromise, intentionally so. And yes, this is of course theoretical. Theoretical Physics and Applied Physics are distinct fields, so too is Political Philosophy and Policy Making. 2. I dont fully follow here, but Im inclined to agree. I think Libertarianism rests on fragile tenets these days. But in favor of Libertarianism here, the goal really isnt competent policy making or political strategy. Its a crude simplified hard stance on individual liberty and free markets. And in a very pure sense, the utmost limitation of governance and regulation and the maximization of free market capitalism does lead to greater individual autonomy. The distribution of that liberty and capital is problematic, but, is the idea of total equality or fairness any less fanciful than total individual liberty? Any political theory rests on their ideal, and all are constructs. What works best for policy makers is whichever ideology has the most convincing fictional narrative. The rest of the work is usually above our pay grade. 3. I disagree with this entire premise here. Its flat out wrong. Plenty of ways to make educated measurements, even if you went so far as to include theoretical physics, for whatever reason, in the monitoring of financial efficiency of government agencies. Im not against these agencies, but you cant simply say they should exist because we cant imagine society without them. That is ludicrous.

I want to stress that your questions can be satisfactorily answered within the framework of libertarian philosophy. The idea that libertarianism (including classical liberalism) is incapable of addressing these questions and therefore requires \\"fixes\\" from external political philosophies (such as high liberalism or socialism) is, in my experience, based on one of two false assumptions made by its critics:1. Critics often assume the fundamental nature of certain ethical principles that libertarians do not accept. The most common of these is substantive equality. Libertarians prioritize formal equality over substantive equality, rejecting policies like affirmative action and progressive income taxes. Consequently, libertarianism's perceived inability to achieve the goals of socialism or high liberalism is not a shortcoming but rather a reflection of its rejection of those goals as fundamental or even legitimate.\\n2. Critics often overestimate the capacity of alternative political philosophies to address the issues they claim libertarianism fails to solve. This overconfidence frequently stems from a lack of understanding of history or economics, particularly among scholars. As someone who works in a university, I want to emphasize this point: left-wing scholars often know much less than they believe they do.Regarding your question on monopolies, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdLBzfFGFQU&amp;t=21s) is Milton Friedman's answer, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYc0YnmakI0) is Ayn Rand's.","title":"Interested in Libertarianism but have some questions."},{"text":" You guys literally prove me right constantly.Impossible.

Israel has a large Druze community, which is a Syrian minority, largely from the annexed Golan Heights. They often serve in the Israeli army and were previously offered citizenship. Many Druze had sought to escape Syria under Islamist rule because they often face prejudice and as many as 10 years ago Israel saved many Syrian Druze by threatening the Islamist militias that had taken hold with military response if they harmed the Syrian Druze communities they were surrounding. After the Hezbollah situation in the north, taking the buffer zone and carrying out raids to ensure the elimination of chemical weapons and the safety of the Druze is literally the least Israel should do. I dont see anyone here flipping out about the immediate need for the US to leave its base in Syria that it established as a buffer zone between its forces in Iraq. Two countries about 5000 miles away from the US itself. Everyone in Israel is hoping these forces in charge of Syria create a free and liberal partner.

The destabilization serves multiple purposes, most notably advancing the \\"Greater Israel\\" project, which aims to expand Israel's borders and influence across the region.One goal of this destabilization is to create conditions favorable for expanding Israel's territorial control, pushing Syrian and Palestinian populations into smaller, more manageable areas of Syria. This would allow Israel to extend its reach while neutralizing the influence of these populations. The destabilization also distracts from this broader geopolitical agenda by creating regional chaos, which reduces international focus on Israel's actions.Further, the use of Western-backed financial institutions like BlackRock in the rebuilding of post-conflict regions is a key component of this strategy. By investing in infrastructure and resources in war-torn areas, these institutions not only gain economic control but also create dependencies that ensure long-term influence. Additionally, the financial support of various actors in the regionsometimes hidden behind the guise of humanitarian aidworks to reinforce the interests of the West and Israel.The withdrawal of players like Turkey could further exacerbate this instability, leaving behind factions that may not fully understand the strategic game being played but could still wreak havoc as they fight for control, potentially with the backing of Mossad and the CIA. This would further destabilize the region while advancing the ultimate goals of Israel and its allies.In summary, the destabilization of the Middle East is not just about controlling territory but also about managing global power dynamics, using the cover of conflict to further the strategic interests of powerful financial and political elites.","title":"Destabilized Middle East, Again, But Why?"},{"text":"i'm fascinated by how different cultures express the same concept in different waystake *good morning* for example, in English and similar Germanic languages, it's a pretty literal wishing someone has / observing it's a good morningthe French however say *bonjour* which just means \\"good day\\" and doubles as the default greeting, ~~probably because those lazy baguettes sleep all morning and so have no use for a separate phrase~~ similar to English, the Chinese uses  Ϻ, literally \\"morning good\\"the Taiwanese however say 簲, which means \\"be safe/well this morning\\"and then there's Japanese Ϥ褦, which is a contraction of  礤ŤǤޤ, meaning \\"you were here to be dressed for work early\\"","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Calling it: the 2028 left-wing litmus test will be did you hide an undocumented immigrant during the Great ICE Raids because if Trump keeps to his promises there would be ICE raids in just about every community in America.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Hes the pinnacle of why I hate cycling advocacy.

Products need to be priced competitively (regardless of tariffs) or consumers wont buy themIn general, if we are talking about a good that people want, the price of the good at a minimum must cover the expenses of the producer that supplied that product (a product that was produced was never produced for \\"free\\"). That's the baseline expense that must be covered by the consumer for the producer to keep supplying that good or service. If the price/unit does not cover the cost of production per unit, the product will not be produced or likely there will be a shortage. There also has to be a profit motive of course and that's where competition helps. A business that has a monopoly on a product would not know how to price it so they will charge whatever profit margin they want to have and obviously this creates problems. This is also one of the reasons why government can never be efficient. They don't have to consider pricing efficiency as they don't have any competition. Any good or service provided by the government therefore is inefficient by definition of monopoly. Competition is always good for the society at large so we are in agreement there.Historically What ends up happening is the companies build manufacturing plants inside the country to avoid the tariffs.Was that pre-NAFTA? There is a reason why foreign companies would want to build plants in the US even if the cost of labor is higher and have to deal with more regulations here. They wanted US dollars. Historically, however, we also used to be biggest exporters in the world after WW2 and our currency was backed by gold. It's no longer the case. We are still one of the biggest exporters in the world but we don't produce consumer goods. Many of the most successful countries in the world have a 100% tariffs on foreign companies (such as China)China maybe a successful country but I don't think the Chinese have the same standard of living as we do.

Or is it government regulation that enables these monopolies initially?The libertarian position is that the market naturally equalizes unless people can use government to keep competitors out.In the UK, you pay national insurance which results in the ability to claim a state pension at 67 years old. How would pensions exist within a libertarian framework? If the government didnt regulate it.You can do that through a private company. Or just save or invest your own money.Public transport. Public transport, such as rail and buses, have an incredibly high entry cost, so would their complete privatisation really be beneficial for society? Especially if they corner the market? Trains are horrifically expensive in the uk.I think there is some difficulty with building private roads, although they do exist and are funded by tolls. Some libertarians believe there are a few basic functions that government can do, like police, military and courts, they may approve of government buildings roads. Others may want government out of that too, they can explain their own position I'm sure. Beyond the building of the actual road itself, the private sector created services where you pay someone to take you somewhere, like with rickshaws or Uber. And Uber apparently is cheaper than taxis.How would economic turbulences from uncontrollable factors such as foreign nations be handled? Such as the OPEC price raising in the 70s.Private oil companies would crush them by just charging less.How would, with limited taxation, military pensions and post-service care for veterans be looked after?Private insurance. Security companies or a group-funded defense company for an area would naturally provide that as an incentive for people to work for them.In regards to how those security companies would actually work instead of them just becoming warlords and taking over, I highly recommend a video called [\\"Law Without Government: Conflict Resolution in a Free Society\\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kPyrq6SEL0) on Youtube.","title":"Interested in Libertarianism but have some questions."},{"text":"Oh wow Reddit deleted a comment justifying/calling for CEO shootings.?Surprised","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Its literal Nazi shit.","title":"New Jersey Governor Signs Freedom to Read Act Barring Book Bans | \\nThe law, said the Democrat, \\"cements New Jersey's role on the forefront of preventing book bans and protecting the intellectual freedom of our educators and students.\\""},{"text":"You dont know anything about New Jersey","title":"New Jersey Governor Signs Freedom to Read Act Barring Book Bans | \\nThe law, said the Democrat, \\"cements New Jersey's role on the forefront of preventing book bans and protecting the intellectual freedom of our educators and students.\\""},{"text":"This would end TIME Magazine once and for all.

So when we lose our money or property we feel worthless.But the more you understand the conspiracy the more you understand it's not entirely your fault.Once you understand that the federal reserve loans us our money as an interest bearing loan you'll start to see the big picture. They control the interest rates and everything trickles down from there.If the fed sets an interest rate of 5% then your bank will probably loan you money at 8%. This is because the bank gets their money from the fed at a 5% interest rate. The bank borrows the money at the feds set rate (5% in this case) and then takes that money and divides it up among their clients in the form of personal loans, mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, etc. But the bank has to pay back the fed 5% of what they borrowed to loan to you. So if the bank charges you 5% interest they'll just be breaking even. The difference between the interest rate the bank gives you and the interest rate the fed gives the bank is the bank's profit. If you're paying 8% on your mortgage to the bank the bank is going to take 5% of that and pay it back to the fed. The remaining 3% is the bank's profit.The fed controls the market by adjusting their interest rate. If they want prosperity they lower the interest rate and the cost of living goes down. If they want suffering they will raise the interest rates and thus the cost of living. This is what we're experiencing now.This whole inflation problem is completely manufactured by the fed. When the fed raises interest rates the cost of living goes up and that's what we call inflation. Literally all they have to do is drop the interest rate and all the problems go away. They've been keeping the interest rates high to further their agenda: you will own nothing and be happy.","title":"Making us lose everything was part of the conspiracy.

The companys proposed manufacturing facility was earlier this year prioritised by a Scottish public-private programme matching the supply chain with developers. However, the proposed deal has triggered criticism from some politicians concerned about handing a critical aspect of the offshore industry to an entity from a hostile state. Denmarks Vestas, another turbine manufacturer, is already pushing ahead with plans for a wind turbine facility in Leith, Edinburgh, although it has not yet made a final investment decision.  I think there is room [for Mingyang and Vestas], Forbes said in an interview with the Financial Times. I think if you look at the ambitions right now for the transition, the transformation required in our supply chain needs to be enormous, she added. Mingyang is closing in on a preferred supplier agreement for up to 6GW of floating wind capacity to decarbonise the oil and gas sector in the North Sea from UK developer Cerulean Winds, a potential anchor deal. Cerulean Winds, which is exploring options with potential global wind turbine manufacturers, said no formal agreements have been signed. Mingyang, Chinas largest floating offshore wind company, is privately owned, but critics of the potential deal remain concerned over perceived risk of interference in corporations decision-making. The EU Commission is investigating whether Chinese manufacturers are getting unfair subsidies from Beijing, in a push to protect European industry.   The UK government, set on generating economic growth, has faced questions around Mingyangs potential investment into the UK. Earlier this month, Conservative MP Nick Timothy, in the House of Commons, called on UK energy minister Michael Shanks to rule out allowing any turbines that might be controlled by hostile states. Mingyang benefits from huge subsidies in China but there are serious questions about energy security and national security, he added. Shanks responded that the UK was encouraging investment and had processes already under way regarding investors.\\nMingyang did not respond to a request for comment. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who met Chinas President Xi Jinping last week, pledged to build respectful relations with China. Rachel Reeves, chancellor, will visit China next year to deepen economic ties. While the Scottish government has oversight of investment promotion, any factory deal would need to align with UK security policy, which is reserved to Westminster.  Forbes said due diligence and an element of caution would be needed when weighing up its decision, but that Scotland would work carefully on a case-by-case basis with any inward investor. The Scottish National party government has come under criticism for failing to leverage the countrys offshore wind industry into a jobs and manufacturing boom. Holyrood is investing 500mn over five years into the manufacturing, port expansion and shipbuilding needed to service the 40 gigawatt pipeline of offshore wind projects. What I dont want to see is the fact that our wind or our natural resources are essentially creating a lot of jobs outside Scotland, Forbes said. But former SNP MP Stewart McDonald, a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on Chinas alumni council, an international network of legislators with a hawkish stance on Beijing, said a whole rethink was needed. We would pay for a cheap route to growth for years to come, he added: It is not sustainable and opens up a Pandoras box of risks.!ping ECO&amp;UK&amp;CHINA","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Number still exists.

Democrats are definitely racists, but theyre not wrong about the power of demographic shifts; and its not just illegals from south of the border, but illegal aliens coming here from other places in the third world. Ill tell you this much: if we had 10+ million people trying to raid the US border from Central and Eastern European countries, the Democrats would have built their own wall, compete with a moat and land mines. For the same reason Cubans and some of the Chinese diaspora have such a strong inclination towards the GOP, a lot of those Central and Eastern European countries do as well, due to their living under the yoke of communism. Democrats have been pumping the poorest of the poor from the third world into the US because they know demographics are destiny. Look sometime at the quotas for countries vis-a-vis legal immigration, and pay particular attention as to what these countries are. Also read about the 1965 immigration Act and how it shifted demographics and politics here forever.Sure, Trump was able to get a significant number of Hispanic voters (men, primarily), but on balance everyone knows that if Kamala won and they continued to flood the zone with illegals, there would be no more swing states. Elon was right: Thats a wrap. There are electoral maps you can pull up that show voting trends for all demographics and how hypothetical general elections would fair depending on the demo (sex, age, race). The results are no surprise. Democrat plans may be undermined by the rise of populism, and *certain* Hispanic communities may reject the Democrat jive talk, but unbridled immigration from the third world is a dangerous game and results in a net gain for Democrats.","title":"There you have it, folks.

This is because different strands of libertarianism ground their defence of individual liberties and rights on different ethical foundations. Some, like Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, are consequentialists (capitalism is good because of its positive effects on individuals and society); some, like James Buchanan and John Tomasi, are contractarians (capitalism is good because it is the product of voluntary agreements between free individuals). Finally, some see individual rights as natural rights. Among these are Murray Rothbard, Robert Nozick, and Ayn Rand (although she did not consider herself a libertarian). These latter thinkers saw individual liberties as moral absolutes inherent to human nature.\\nP.s. as far as I know, no classical liberal or libertarian defines themselves as \\"neoliberal\\".

Depends on what Libertarian camp you are in. Hayek would argue that any central planning is a slippery slope to total central control. Because once you start on that path, more and more of the decision making must be propped up by central planning. And that inherently limits individual liberty. From an economic standpoint, Libertarians believe in limiting the central government by fiscal conservatism and balanced budgets, and are highly skeptical of The Fed or central banks. Plenty of directions to take that. Lobbying isnt looked at as evil, but rather a protected freedom. Crony capitalism is in the eye of the beholder, and often the state enables this particular style of capitalism as part of the model. 2. No of course not. But whether or not people can be trusted with that extent of freedom is erroneously framing the argument. People are endowed with their liberty and the degree of which they can be trusted is irrelevant in the Libertarian framework. 3. Libertarians are also highly skeptical of 3 letter agencies. Exactly how does their oversight create efficiency or innovation rather than delivering the opposite?Libertarians tend to be isolationist in foreign policy, from the beginning. However, conflict ensues with modern globalization because multinational conglomerates are shopping legal protections, tax rates, and a variety of other things from other nations. Isolationism and economic Libertarianism come to a head when our federal government legally protects these corporations and their overseas endeavors, especially when sometimes having to engage with state led diplomacy, economic sanctions, tariffs, trade agreements, or military aggression on their behalf.

But I dont think its super obvious according to the Bible that one must be against capital punishment. At least its not so solid as the way that certain other GOP policies (we should be maximally cruel to immigrants!) are obviously wrong according to the Bible.I agree that Christs atonement ends Gods mandate of capital punishment for sin. Also there is the story of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11) whom Jesus did not condemn.But its not necessarily ended for crime.  Eg Romans 13 speaks about the authority of governments, including 13:4 which plausibly still approves capital punishment: For the one in authority is Gods servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are Gods servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.It is IMHO reasonable to conclude that this is about some other form of punishment, and that execution for crime is wrong given the rest of the NT. After all, Jesus himself was unjustly executed by the state. But if you want an NT proof text in favor of capital punishment there is one.Also a commandment in Genesis backed by an argument from creation is not necessarily replaced by the NT anyway, at least in some Christians view.  Its not one of those civil law of Israel commandments about mildew or whatever. The laws from Genesis predates the covenant with Israel and is often considered more important, and an argument from creation is considered evidence that a commandment is universal.  The Council of Jerusalem even held that the prohibition against eating blood (also from Genesis) still applies to Christians, though it is ignored by almost all Christians today.I was raised Christian, and I still try to follow in a lot of ways, but I have doubts about some of the important tenets of the faith so Im not sure what to call myself.One of my biggest struggles with the faith has been, if all of Scripture is inspired by God (eg 2 Tim 3:16-17), then the OT still is generally applicable to help understand morality. If God ordered something in the past (eg, genocide against the Amalekites or slaughtering all the residents of Jericho except Rahab and her family or capital punishment for whatever crime) then Im not sure whether its consistent to call such a thing heinous today. Sure, maybe its outmoded and not in line with the new Covenant, but not an atrocity that must be universally condemned.But since I am more certain that eg genocide is wrong than that the entire scripture is divinely inspired, I still think its universally condemnable.","title":"Trump Preps Bloodbath on Federal Death Row As Advocates Beg Biden for Mercy"},{"text":"Progressives don't always lose their primaries, but yes, I agree that there have been several high profile primary losses.

Do you feel like America cannot afford universal public healthcare, for example, which economists say would effectively lower average Americans healthcare expenses (the cost of the tax isn't as much as insurance premiums) while simultaneously improving access to healthcare. Do you think America is too poor or incompetent to guarantee free preschool services to parents who want that? Or 2 to 4 years of free college or college in exchange for public service (not necessity military). Do you think that minimum wage cannot keep up with inflation? If 1968 minimum wage buying power were the same as today's minimum wage buying power it would be $21.50 per hour. Do you think so poorly of America that we cannot do the things that other countries have been doing for decades? I mean what exactly do you think America is incapable of that the left is proposing? I happen to think that America is a great country and part of that is we the people can form a more perfect union by promoting the general welfare.

Also, because the conflict is between two different religious groups there are more people trying to spread information. In case of Saudi Arabian invasions in Syria, most normal people don't care because it is between muslims. Islam has a thought process that all muslims are part of a brotherhood and they have to help each other. Thats why Muslims are not loyal to their country and their religion is more important to them than their country. If muslims kill muslims, its an internal matter, but if someone else does, its call for Jihad.Anti Semitism is another factor. Both Muslims and christians hate Jews, thus, more spotlight on that conflict.You will notice generally in most conflicts muslims are involved and all the time they play the victim card, thats why you see more news about them.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"hey man be civil, right now he cant think of one","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Some of them live in an alternate reality where Malcolm X was the real hero of the 60s and MLK Jr died for nothing.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"based bing","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Why do you believe that individuals will be given access to the same quality of AI product as huge corporations?

Im also writing this on my phone on the train, so please excuse the terrible writing quality. I hope to maybe do more research into the sentiments Im touching on here, and maybe do an effort post on it or something. So any feedback/criticism is appreciated.**I believe in market capitalism and competition and their ability to propel society to new heights of greatness. But in cases where there are scarce and limited resources, the existence of winners will also necessitate the existence of losers. A Google software engineer netting a 200K salary, while nice for them, isnt really great for the nurse making 100k a year when theyre both bidding for the same house and the software engineer will be able to naturally outbid them.This, I believe (and am probably partially wrong about since no one knows for 100% certainty whats going on), is the fundamental problem thats rotting away at western society. Beyond just houses being more expensive, I think theres this broader sentiment of **I am falling behind someone else who is outcompeting and beating me, and my life is worse because of it.** And to some extent theyre *not wrong*. NIMBY zoning and other laws that create artificial scarcity do make it so that your neighbor doing better than you means your life becoming a little bit worse. Personally, as a youngish person, I also get some sense that this is especially heightened for Gen Z and millennials, where everyone else getting better grades and succeeding more means that if *you* want to make it, *you* have to do better and better or else youll be left behind like garbage. My peers going to college means that if I want to get a job and live a good life, I need to also go to college. And I need an internship, and better grades, etc etc. When you look at things this way, a lot of the modern populist wave makes complete sense. Before industrialization, wealth was seen as a fixed pie, because it kind of was; since most economies were agricultural, the main way to grow your wealth was to conquer other lands and enslave its people to grow more crops. Thats how we get mercantilism, because countries saw the world as a fixed pie, and so the way to maximize their slice is to minimize everyone elses slice. Id argue that were now seeing a reemergence of that sentiment, where despite continued economic growth, people increasingly see the world as a fixed pie. And you can point to many logical arguments for why the world isnt a fixed pie, but for many people it doesnt *feel* that way. And its not entirely irrational for them to *feel* that way, even if the overall conclusion is irrational. The obvious example is zoning laws, but more generally I just feel like theres this growing anxiety in people where they want their slice and think anyone getting some will hurt them. When you think of modern politics as being a sort of Mercantilism 2.0, electric boogaloo, then its not that surprising that people now support tariffs and lower immigration, since people are now operating off of a similar mindset to that of pre-industrial mercantilists.What I think brought us here is this loss of optimism of the future being better. I think theres a sense that society will be made of winners and losers, and the winners will be better off than they were yesterday and the losers will be worse off. Even if the aggregate is a net positive, people that perceive society as functioning this way will still view it as a fixed pie because of their anxiety of ending up in the losers column. What we need is to both create and convince people of a world where, yes, there will be winners and losers, but that even the losers can be better off tomorrow than they were yesterday. YIMBYism is a good start, as making housing less scarce, while hurting wealthy home owners in the short term, in the long term is a step towards making a society where your neighbor getting a 200K google salary is likely to mean you not being able to buy a house, or an immigrant isnt now competition for housing.But more broadly, we need to make it so that people dont feel like its me versus them, and if I lose, my life will be worse because thats about a good way as any to make me hate them. If you operate under the assumption that people are thinking this way, then it makes sense they can be so easily convinced to hate immigrants and the college educated and all the other evil demons that are supposedly stealing America from them. We need a world where me and them can compete, but the result isnt one of us losing and having our life be ruined, but rather the result is a world where *both* of us  winner and loser  are better off. I think once we can get people to think that way, then we can begin to rebuild empathy, liberalism, and optimism in this country. And I not only believe capitalism can do this, but I know capitalism has done this and is amazing at doing this. Its practically capitalisms speciality! Today, Chad, one of the worlds poorest nations, has a life expectancy of about 50 years, which is similar to the USs life expectancy in the early years of the 20th century. Capitalism and industrialization and markets have successfully created a world where, in large part, everyone is better off than they were a century ago. By combatting pro-scarcity laws and regulations, as well as rethinking how we can create inclusive institutions that promote progress and advancement for both winners **and** losers, I think we can begin working towards a better liberalism and a better America.TLDR: RETVRN to blue jeans, the 90s, optimism, and Bill Clinton in order to Make Capitalism Great Again (and make mercantilism cringe again).","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"its mehouse of lords  us senate","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Cant make new states through filibustering anymore.

The first is who youre likely to vibe with. I think this one is less of a ratio, and more like a flat 15 years or so. Exceptions abound, but you just have a lot less in common past that. The second is who its non-exploitative to date. I think this is also a flat number. At some point between 20-30 years old it just doesnt matter anymore. Youre a fully baked adult. The half your age + 7 rule ends up doing a great job of blending these, but I dont think they necessarily need to be blended. !ping DATING","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I bet the average person votes republican the second they see a homeless person even kind of sort of being creepy. those were everywhere in Washington when I went.This is a self defeating statement.
