Former SEC officials are concerned about how Trump could try to use the agency to go after the foes of his company, which accounts for more than half his fortune. They also worry that the agency isnt up for the job of taking on Trump Media should it run afoul of securities laws.Cases involving public companies with aggressive lawyers are difficult even if you dont have conflicts of interest and concerns about pissing someone important off, a current employee in the SECs enforcement division said. I dont think anyone would explicitly say, Dont do it, but theyd just be like, I could do another case.In Trump Medias short history, it has had a combative relationship with the SEC, though it has never been charged with wrongdoing by the agency.In 2022 as Trump Media was seeking to go public, which it did through a merger with an already traded company, it threatened to sue the SEC because of what it called inexcusable obstruction and obvious conflicts of interest among SEC officials and clear indications of political bias. CEO Devin Nunes posted on the platform, NO MORE BS! The company never sued.The following year, the company that took Trump Media public settled fraud charges with the SEC for $18 million after the agency found it made misrepresentations in its filings. The SEC also brought insider trading charges against several people who invested in the deal.Other, previously unreported issues have raised alarms inside the company that Trump Media could be violating securities laws by misleading investors, according to a person with knowledge of the company....Securities experts warned that if the SEC fails to aggressively regulate companies connected to the president or his allies, it could have disastrous consequences.If political power buys the power to defraud, thats a problem, not just for our politics but for our markets. American companies have an easier time getting capital because there is faith in the way the American capital markets are regulated, said Howard Fischer, an SEC trial lawyer during Trumps first term.Created after the stock market crash of 1929, the SEC is part of the executive branch but operates independently of the White House. Presidents appoint the agencys chair, who leads a five-member commission that includes members of both parties. The agencys nearly 5,000 employees report to that commission as they do the work of regulating the securities industry.How much impact is the president supposed to have on the SEC's day-to-day operations? The answer is none, said Allison Herren Lee, a former Democratic SEC commissioner appointed during the first Trump administration.The line between the SEC and the president on enforcement actions has been crossed before. President Richard Nixons aides pressured the SECs general counsel, G. Bradford Cook, to remove a reference to a financiers illegal contribution to the Nixon campaign from an SEC complaint against the executive. Nixon then installed Cook as the SECs chair. But after the meetings with Nixons aides were revealed, Cook resigned as chair, saying the effectiveness of the agency might be impaired because of the perception of undue influence....While the SEC investigates possible civil violations of securities law, it is up to the FBI and Department of Justice to pursue criminal cases. Trumps selections to lead both those agencies in his second term have ties to his social media company: Kash Patel, the FBI pick, is on the Trump Media board. Pam Bondi, selected to be attorney general, was identified in an April filing as owning a stake in the company worth more than $4 million at current prices. Its not clear if she still owns the shares. (Bondi did not respond to a request seeking comment.)If federal authorities shy away from scrutinizing Trump Media, securities experts said the void could be filled by state authorities, who Trump has no authority over.I wouldnt be surprised if we saw blue state securities regulators opening investigations, said Andrew Jennings, a law professor who teaches securities regulation at Emory University.The potential for corruption in the highest office of the land is significant. If independent regulatory bodies are unable or unwilling to enforce their mandates on companies involved with political leadership and their inner circle, then there is effectively no oversight on these companies.","title":"Donald Trump Controls a Publicly Traded Company.

They say that America is thriving, crime is down, employment is low, and Biden passed major legislation to combat inflation and enhance Americas ability to compete with China. Therefore, only a public that fell for right-wing misinformation or backs Trumps authoritarian dispositions could have elected him president. Among other things, this assessment overlooks that inflation, which surged during Bidens presidency, battered working-class voters who form the core of Trumps support, and that declining inflation does not mean that prices have returned to pre-inflation levels. It also underestimates the impact of lawless borders on middle-class and working-class voters. It avoids consideration of the consequences of mainstream-media gaslighting of Americans about Bidens declining cognitive capabilities.

You look at the inability to rein in crime in urban areas, the increased costs due to regulatory hurdles, the looming threat of job loss due to environmental goals, the ubiquity of homelessness.\\nNo strides were made in any of these areas. The over empathetic approach to these problems such as policing theft is a racist policy is silly.\\n \\n Overintellectualizing approaches is costing dems dearly.\\n I actually saw a post saying its AOCs time now.\\n Dems are literally learning nothing.","title":"Anyone else feel a sense of frustration that a lot of people seemingly did not know about the executive orders Biden did on healthcare, LGBTQ rights, environmental protections and other things until Trump got back into office and immediately revoked them?"},{"text":"Trump pardoned (fully), cop killers and cop assaulters.

This has real implications with the intent to erase trans people from public life entirely. On the I-9 form, any employer can simply say well you look F but the documents say M, therefore you cant be the same person and deny you a job. Effectively you cant get a job while trans.

There may be no cause for concern, but Poland will be well prepared for any situation.Tusks comments have drawn sharp criticism from the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, which accused him of being alarmist and jeopardising Polands relations with the US.Tusks remarks come amid heightened rhetoric from the Trump administration regarding immigration to the US. Even before taking office, Trump and his advisers signalled their plans to ramp up deportations of undocumented migrants, particularly those with criminal records.On Monday, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders, including declaring a state of emergency at the US-Mexico border and restricting the automatic granting of citizenship to children born on US soil to undocumented immigrants and short-term visitors.While Tusk acknowledged that details of the US administrations plans regarding deportations remain unclear, the Polish authorities are taking precautions to safeguard their citizens.We have not received any information on whether this operation could affect Polish citizens residing in the United States, said Tusk. Either way, we need to be prepared, which is why our outposts in the States will reach out as quickly as possible to citizens who are feeling concerned about this situation.I asked the foreign minister to prepare our consulates, posts and services in the United States for the possible consequences of these decisions concerning Poles working and living in the United States with different statuses and levels of legality, Tusk said.Tusk also pointed to improved living standards and a thriving job market as reasons for Poles abroad to consider returning. Anyone who wants to work and believes in their own future will find opportunities here, he said.He highlighted the significant economic progress Poland has achieved in recent decades, transforming into one of?Europes fastest-growing economies.The foreign minister, Rados?aw Sikorski, announced that increased consular support for Poles living in the US would include the introduction of additional duty stations outside the usual consulate buildings.Compatriots living abroad whose passports have expired are invited to obtain new documents, he wrote on X.Sikorski also highlighted that a valid document will soon be necessary for those wishing to participate in Polands upcoming presidential election this May.","title":"PM Tusk asks consulates in US to prepare to assist Polish citizens amid Trumps deportation plans"},{"text":"&lt;sigh You still don't get it.

That 3.4% was the *case* fatality rate, which is the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases. That doesn't mean that 1/30 of the population will die, since many people won't get it.For the first year of COVID in the U.S. (through March 3, 2021), there were  approximately 520,000 confirmed covid deaths and about 28.5 million confirmed cases.  That's a CFR of 1.8%, which is lower than the 3.4% in the article, but it's the right order of magnitude The CFR dropped after the vaccines were widely available, of course.Overall, the *population* fatality rate for COVID in the U.S. was about 0.35%. They also state that it's incomparable to influenza and they have no idea how it works, transmits, can be stopped, etc.So, is there something wrong with what they're saying? Two years of COVID in the U.S. (March 2020 to February 2022) killed as many people as 28 **years** of average flu deaths. And for flu deaths, I'm using the CDC's estimates, which are much larger than the number of confirmed flu deaths.If I were to compare confirmed COVID deaths to confirmed flu deaths, then two years of COVID was as much as **140 years** of flu deaths.So, yeah, covid was much, much, much deadlier than flu.","title":"President Trump officially withdraws the United States from the World Health Organization."},{"text":"Youre an obese Nazi, cope.","title":"Trump two-gender edict will upend X identity on passports"},{"text":"Only to be dismissed by the SCOTUS","title":"18 States Sue to Stop Trumps Birthright Citizenship Order"},{"text":"To name it Trumplandia.

As a consequence, ppl suffer. And as another consequence, someone like Luigi Mangione makes justice by himself, a citizen justice, a vigilant type of justice, since the belief is that the government is not doing what it should.And I think you might know that Luigi Mangione wasn't working for the justice system, so he wasn't working on a trial neither filling papers. He was a citizen and he decided to kill a person who under his beliefs was guilty and should die and also send a message. Can you understand this and therefore the whole process of justice didn't apply?*\\"Doesnt the 6th Amendment grant everyone the right to a fair trial?\\"*Yes, it does. As much as the government and health insurance have rules to follow and ppl who pay for health insurance have rights which they haven't been granted so Luigi Mangione did what he thought could help change things.If Luigi Mangione is a hero or not, it's context. For the justice system, he killed someone and period. For many ppl who had their rights denied even paying for health insurance, he might be a hero. For ppl tired of how big companies behave as the government and how the government behaves as a big company, he might be a hero.This is brainless.

I think our judges should be given some discretion on when to apply the full weight on the law. It's impossible to write a decision tree for every case into law, so we have imperfect humans operating within an imperfect system. IMO the root of the problem is how we are choosing judges and the nature of the people making the decisions, not that decisions have to be made per se. Our judges should be able to make decisions.

Under the current rules, they're absolutely citizens.Birthright citizenship is nuanced.  For example, if one of your parents is a resident citizen, you would be granted citizenship, regardless of where you would be born.  It's already that way in most countries in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Birthright citizenship only refers to the the idea that anyone born on the SOIL of a country is automatically a citizen, REGARDLESS of the status of their parents.  This is a throwback to colonial days, where people were citizens of  one country, but were colonizing another.  Birthright citizenship guaranteed the offspring were Brazilian, for example, even if their parents immigrated (and still had citizenship) from Germany or Japan.In today's world, it's probably not even needed.  Redefining it would prevent a whole lot of illegal immigration that result in creating \\"anchors\\" in the USA (which creates a TON of legal problems when dealing with two illegal parents, but a birthright child...hence why we're in a big mess).If neither parent is here legally, and they have a child, it would simply be like most European countries.  The child would be a citizen of whatever country the parents are from. THE FACTS: Donald and Ivana married in April 1977, and Donald Trump Jr. was born months later that year in December. Ivanka was born in 1981, followed by Eric in 1984. All three Trump children were born in New York, making them U.S. citizens.  They were born to a US citizen Father, too.  There's no question about them being American, even though their mother Ivana wasn't a citizen, she was also here LEGALLY.Barron Trump was born in NY.  Melania was well on her way to becoming a citizen, and became one just a few months after Barron was born.ALL of Trump's children were born in the USA to a citizen father.  Under this new \\"no birthright citizenship\\" ALL of them would be American, due to the father's status (citizen)","title":"ACLU sues over Trump order aimed at ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"Thank you so much.

We hope and wish that under the present leadership, the German people will successfully conclude their fourteen-year-long, persistent, and sacrificial struggle for freedom and the resurgence of the German nation.We do not deny that times of crisis require special measures, and we have therefore repeatedly supported enabling laws and emergency decrees. We understand that the current Reich government is seeking extensive powers to be able to work without disruptions. Nevertheless, we feel obligated to express our concerns, assuming that even the current government will not reject objective and loyal criticism of its measures.We find that the proposed law lacks explicit guarantees for the constitutional rights of the people and the fundamental principles of civil law. Above all, the independence of the judiciary, the rights of the civil service, the right to freely exercise a profession, equal civil rights, and the freedom of art and science, as well as their teaching, must remain inviolable. These values, ladies and gentlemen, are fundamental elements of any community life in an orderly constitutional state. They were safeguarded by the Weimar Constitution, drawing from both old German and old Prussian state traditions, and they must not be endangered today as they were fourteen years ago.In the interest of the people and the fatherland, and in the expectation of lawful development, we will set aside our serious concerns and approve the Enabling Act.","title":"NL Elects the 1930 Weimar Republic Elections"},{"text":"Theres a difference between controlling them and taking 50% profit from the company.

Trump is bidding on nobody challenging his inhumane policies that targets a small group of people. It looks like devastatingly effective. I am an immigrant and we know that if an immigrant community is in a quote niched category, which means if they can single us out without pissing off a large group of people, then they pretty much can do whatever they want to do. Like with the Muslim ban. He usually won't target a country that is large enough that their immigrants can turn against him effectively. For example the Indian immigrants - he is giving them hard time but he doesn't dare to declare a traval ban to a community of this much impact.\\nOne way that I think might help is to sow on the social media. Same sex marriage saw a decade-long period of cultural change. It waited until the poltiical change is ripe. So trans rights might be able to do the same thing and start with the culture.

So if the US were to be invaded and occupied, their children would not be granted citizenship.Immigrants, legal or not, are subject to the full jurisdiction of the US while on US soil and they do not fall under either of the previous 2 categories.

Kyle Rittenhouse only shot ex-convicts. They had been arrested, given a fair trial, and convicted, so you could argue that Kyle Rittenhouse was just carrying out the death penalty.?Oh, boy, you went off the rails hard. A guy that arms himself and visits what he considers to be a riot is not acting in good faith. Is he a murderer? How in the wrong was he? Those sorts of questions depend on your personal morality. But it's hard to pretend that a man who *specifically travels to where there will be trouble* and brings a gun is a neutral actor.Luigi Mangione killed a man who has never even been given a fair trial. Doesnt the 6th Amendment grant everyone the right to a fair trial?Importantly, the criminal past of the people Rittenhouse shot is totally irrelevant because HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN HE DID IT. You can't *retroactively* claim it was justice. You also can't use \\"fair trial\\" and \\"unilateral extralegal death penalty\\" in the same thought. This is not about the 6th amendment. On the other hand, Mangione can very directly point to the decisions Thompson made as intentional acts of violence and murder. It's undeniable that his company let people die. Again, you could disagree with the morality, but there is no doubt that that happened. You could also make the argument that Mangione did his crime for others while Rittenhouse did it for himself. Morality is nuanced.So do I think comparing Kyle Rittenhouse and Luigi Mangione is fair? Somewhatespecially how they viewed their actions *after the fact*. You just perfectly articulated that Rittenhouse feels justified in his killing. So does Mangione. In that respect, they are similar.","title":"CMV: Luigi Mangione isnt a hero."},{"text":"Why need medications when you have prayers","title":"Donald Trump's Medicare Executive Order Explained"},{"text":"What part of my statement is not true?Answer my question, is China at the forefront of creating the most renewable energy sources?","title":"Trump Signs Order to Exit Paris Accord Again"},{"text":"Too many people think SCOTUS has the final word on things, but don't realize like you said that SCOTUS has _zero_, I repeat, **zero** actual enforcement.

That includes situations where there's not enough evidence to support the report, or when police have decided the person isn't credible (decisions that can be problematic), or if a report has been made on behalf of a victim - and then the victim doesn't want to pursue it in the criminal justice system.When false allegations do occur, the motives are complex. And they don't usually come from a place of maliciousness, research shows, but from fear or a need for assistance.In a study of 22,000 women when the word rape wasn't used 90% had experienced unwanted sex or sex acts, sexual abuse of women is so normalized they don't even recognize it and 51% of women have been sexually assaulted by a partner while asleep.https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/half-of-women-have-suffered-sexual-assault-by-a-partner-while-asleep/#:~:text=They%20surveyed%20more%20than%2022%2C000,happened%20to%20them%20multiple%20times.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Even under the idea that \\"killing people is wrong\\", your justification for Rittenhouse is specious.

So if, and it's a big if, Rittenhouse was justified for an extra judicial killing, I don't see how that refutes the idea that Mangione can be justified. The person Mangione killed was responsible for thousands of times more deaths than anyone Rittenhouse killed.Instead if comparing him to two people who are used to whitewash our idea of what dissent can look like, you should try to contrast him with John Brown, which i think is a much more apt comparison. I think people who think Mangione is a hero would also think John Brown was a hero.

We have agreed as a society that is some commits certain actions, crimes, their right to bear arms is no longer applicable\\nSo the problem with rights as they concern and unborn entity are several-fold, and require some mental gymnastics, in my opinion?\\n1. The argument from some requires the bodily autonomy of the mother to be secondary to that of the unborn, that is, the unborn takes precedence over the bodily autonomy of the mother\\n2. Passing through the birth canal isn't a willful action, so under Lockean ideas of natural rights, that precedence of bodily autonomy **logically** is never lost?which brings up a some interesting questions, namely, does that right continue **after** the moment of birth? We agree that no, there is no instance where that is the case ie someone can't be required to give blood, or tissue, or an organ, **except**, some would argue, for those months they are in utero. That is literally the only example of (some people) wanting that right of bodily autonomy superceded by someone else.\\nAll of this, again, has zero to do with the 14th Amendment?\\nAnother interesting point is, we do in fact have some instances where an abortion is justified: rape, incest, and if the mothers life is in danger. Interestingly, all these say that a woman can only exert her right of bodily autonomy **if and only if** it is life or death, or **if someone has already violated her bodily autonomy**, none of which are great answers?\\nSome people frame abortion as murder.? I would contend it is an eviction. A congruent example might be a landlord evicting a family with a newborn into the cold (going to be -15F over night where I live). It's not the responsibility of the landlord to ensure that the family has a place to stay, and the landlord would not be charged in the event that eviction leads to the death of the newborn.I think most people want abortion to be **safe** (women dying or having irrevocable harm done to them is not an answer), **legal** (a woman shouldn't have to face legal consequences for her medical care, and doctors, as we have seen, would rather not practice than risk legal issues ie the Obstetric Deserts we currently have in the US where there are no ob/gyns for multiple counties), and **exceedingly rare** (sex ed is so important and comprehensive sex ed reduces teen birth rates by 3+%, which isn't a lot, but better than abstinence only, which has zero or increased rates, depending on the data)Again, not related to the 14th Amendment","title":"Was ending DEI a smoke screen to implement this little line?

I think most people do compare Luigi Mangione to the Unabomber which I think is pretty apt. I don't really see people comparing him to Rosa Parks or Kyle Rittenhouse or tbh Robin Hood, but ig I could see it. I think Luigi Mangione is probably seen more as an anti-hero where I think most people do somewhat agree with his motivations, but do not really agree with the actions he did. Also, its not like Kyle Rittenhouse knew they were ex convicts beforehand. Now I do think that Kyle Rittenhouse did technically act in self defense, however I also think he put himself in a hostile situation with a gun which I would overall not condone. However, if Brian Thompson was a convicted felon, does that mean it's okay to kill him now? I think what Brian Thompson did was morally worse than what most ex-convicts have done. Btw, I don't think Luigi should've killed anybody and I don't find it heroic to kill somebody unless you are saving somebody, but I think there is something to be said about why Luigi did this and it is a sentiment that millions of people feel. Also, ig for this Rosa Parks comparison, both did break the law for something that they believed was not morally correct. Obviously Rosa Parks did not kill anybody, but there are still comparisons that you can create between the two","title":"CMV: Luigi Mangione isnt a hero."},{"text":"Hell be luck to survive the next 4 years from what Ive seen of him.

They talked to the RMV who stated their ID would simply be invalidated and become void on February 21st, along with their amended birth certificate (Bottom surgery) They will need to request a new one, with their old name, and then a second copy with their new name (apparently because they changed their name and gender marker at the same time so have no copy of the birth certificate with their new name but with the \\"correct\\" gender marker). and bring both of them to the RMV to have the gender marker change reverted and THEN they can request a second appointment to actually renew the license. Right now their waiting list is almost 6 months. So as of the 21st of next month they will simply have no license and be unable to drive for an indeterminate amount of time.I Do have new information, for clarity having talked with them more. Their license expires in February already. They aren't revoking the license they just won't renew it and are requiring it to be treated as a \\"new license\\" because it has to change. Oklahoma says you can only change your gender marker on your ID if it matches an amended birth certificate which is the real issue  \\nThe RMV says their current amended birth certificate will not be valid after the 21st of February.   \\nThey don't live in the state their birth certificate is from. They were born in Texas  \\nIt's not a new \\"state\\" policy but OK RMV has full discretion on whether they accept information and they say they won't accept the current amended birth certificate because it won't be \\"federally accurate\\" thus doesn't work for the (2 forms of government ID and 1 proof of address) requirement.   \\nTexas will only give them their unmodified original birth certificate with their original name and won't just amend the F back to M for some reason. so they need to request an original copy, then use it to request A copy with their out of state name change documentation.

If I am correct, cant an American just drive to another state to get an abortion if they want one?That statement, while true, dramatically undersells the difficulty. It also ignores that some states are passing efforts to punish women who seek abortion care out of state as well. But, even to just the first part:I live in south Florida, nearish to Miami. Let's say a woman in my state is a couple weeks late for her period, takes a test, learns she's pregnant. Gestation age is counted from the start of your last menstrual period, so two weeks late is six weeks pregnant. Well, FL has a six week ban, so she's shit out of luck for in-state options. But hey, this is America, land of the automobile and the interstate highway. No problem. She can just drive up the interstate:380 miles and 5.5 hours later, she's in GA. Oh well, Georgia also has a six week ban. So, I guess we'd better keep driving.Alabama? Full ban.Mississippi? Full ban.Louisiana? Full ban.Texas? lolOklahoma? Full ban.Arkansas? Full ban.Missouri? *Technically* legal, but there are no abortion providers in the state. So, de facto ban.Maybe lets try north and east....Tennessee? Full ban.South Carolina? Six weeks. Keep driving.North Carolina? You might be in luck! North Carolina has a 12-week ban, but there is a 72-hour waiting period. So as long as she is able to spend at least three days in town (realistically more, since hospitals in states with bans may not treat you for post-abortion complications should they arise), she can drive 700 miles (roughly 1127km) and 10 hours each way to access care.  Of course, about three in five abortion patients have had at least one previous birth, so you'll need to figure out who is going to take care of your kids while you're out of state for several days. And, about two in five have family income below the federal poverty level (if you expand that to people outside of the poverty level but still considered low income, it's more like three in four), so having a reliable vehicle, time off of work, and the cash to afford close to a week out of state is a very big if. And aside from cases of rape, like, contraceptives exist?Roughly half of all elective abortions involve a pregnancy that happened despite the use of at least one form of contraception.","title":"Trumps hands-off abortion stance faces political reality"},{"text":"I would never compare Luigi to a crybaby wacko like Rittenhouse","title":"CMV: Luigi Mangione isnt a hero."},{"text":"1) fuck Trump and all conservatives forever and always 2) fuck you Nancy.

He will have escaped all justice, and he said I'll pardon himself and his whole family.The best case scenario is a return to back and forth more normal Dem and GOP governments, but with a more toxic political culture, normalization of corruption, and a court that erases much of the good the Dems try and accomplish on their turns. All while Russia will have won in Ukraine and strengthened it's position and the position of authoritarians everywhere.The worst case scenario in the \\"nothing ever happens\\" 60% chance outcome is that he's successfully able to pass the torch and the cult to a new populist.

The child is granted citizenship option (parents may decline). (this includes people with asylum, refugee status, GreenCard, H-1B visas, Student Visa.F) Either parent(s) are actively serving in the US Armed Forces.G) There's probably a few more situations I'm missing. AUTOMATIC NON-CITIZENSHIP:A) Neither parent is here legally. This includes people who arrived legally, but are no longer legal.B) Parent is here legally, but on a Tourist Visa, or Business Visa only (not resident).C) Parent(s) were here legally, but for one reason or another are awaiting deportation.The biggest one for me, is the illegal status.  If you've come to this country illegally, you are a citizen of another country, and you do NOT get automatic citizenship for a child.  Birthright citizenship is primarily an off-spring (no pun intended) of Colonization. Colonization needed a guarantee the posterity would be citizens of the new lands.  Now that THAT part of history is over, there's no need for it.  Virtually all of the countries in the Easter Hemisphere of the world do NOT allow birthright citizenship.That's my take.  You are welcome to believe otherwise, but I fully support ending birthright citizenship.  Not only will it discourage illegal immigration, it actually helps ensure that families stay together if a group is all here illegally.  Makes it a whole lot easier.  Plus, parents simply have to demonstrate citizenship when the child's birth certificate is issued (or be known).  They already take my social security number at the hospital, it's not that big of a deal.","title":"ACLU sues over Trump order aimed at ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"The article about Jorgensen seems to be saying that the operation began when she started taking hormones and changing shape.

(Indeed, as a classical music enthusiast, I have certainly heard of the opera Leonora!) But after the U.S. abolished de-jure gender roles, taking up an activity unusual for one's sex has never (that I know of) led anyone to change their gender, but rather to advocate for greater liberty in the gender they have.

Gender has never been about sex until recently. It has been intentionally conflated to create this nonsense legalistic debate for the purpose of pushing a \\"debate\\" that can never be won.And by \\"legalistic\\" I mean that literally.  It is something created, or at least popularized, in legal studies and english departments in the 1990's in the USA.  They knew what they were doing by calling it \\"gender studies\\" because  unlike \\"woman studies\\" it is divorces the study from biology and sex into purely social structures and language.So theoretically you can have a infinite amount of genders because genders are a language construct. For example English is widely considered a \\"genderless\\" language, but that is only true in a very general sense.  It is just that gender is less significant then something like Spanish.  In English there are 3 genders; Masculine, feminine, and Neutral. Were as Spanish is widely regarded as having only two genders masculine and feminine. But Spanish also has neutral words which it inherited from Latin. Latin is a 3 gender language. Were as Supyire, a African language, is a 5 gender language... their genders can be described as being: humans, small things, big things, collectives, and liquids. All of this means that the \\"Gender debate\\" is really only something that existed in the past 30 years or so and to participate in this \\"debate\\" requires accepting the modification to our language and definitions in a kinda stupid manner. In effect... most everybody is being played as a sucker. \\nAll of this originates in the idea that everything is socially deterministic. It is part of the Marxist-style conceptualization of the world... that everything in this world is determined by social forces and evolves through historic struggle.  It is a form of historicism. https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/HistoricismFrom that:  Historicism is a position that holds that all knowledge and cognition are historically conditioned. So by divorcing human sexuality and identity from biology they are trying to make the case that all of this is subject to social forces and historic conditioning.  And, as such, human sexuality and identity can be anything we literally want it to be. It is not constrained by biology, but by imagination and social forces.  So that to achieve true freedom (were even our biology can be a form of tyranny) we must create a society where anybody is free to be anything they can imagine.  Even if the limit has to do with the current state of technology and our ability to manipulate our own flesh... it is still something that must be overcome for true freedom. Taken to its extreme it is a form of transhumanism.  The world we are born into is nasty brutish and random. Our reality is something we a thrust into against our own will by being born and we need to be able to break free.  To experience total freedom and be whatever we want to be.  To be post-human is the only way to experience our \\"true self\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2Ahm2EpL0","title":"Trump promises US gov will only recognize 2 genders.

The opposite is something like dogs, where there is no visible or very little difference, other than genitalia, between the male sex and the female sex.\\"It doesn't take one buck and one doe to make a fawn?\\" Why yes indeed it dose take one of each sex to produce offspring, this is called sexual reproduction, and when the fawn is born and happily frolicking about, it's parents the ideal non divorced nuklear family that most deer are, unless one or both deer get shot by a hunter or run over by a car, will take take the little fawn out into the field to eat some of the farmers crops and the adult deer will teach the fawn places where it is best to much on the farmers crops. What the adult deer will not do however is tell the fawn that girls wear dresses and makeup and that boys don't wear dresses and certainly do not kiss other boys, because that is culture and deer don't have culture. Deer are uncultured animals that destroy crops and shit everywhere, I would call them swine, but that would be an insult to swine. But in their favor they don't make up rules that separate males and female \\"doos and don't\\". One might argue \\"but deer rut, where males do the head masturbation on trees and do weird things with doe piss!\\" And yes they do, but non of that is culture, it all serves a practical purpose, sent marking, displays of dominance. We humans however dress up in colour coded and styled male and female cloths, that fit what we have decided fits our role as part of the male or female gender, and that is culture.","title":"TRUMP: It will be the officially policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female."},{"text":"Leon the Nazi","title":"Elon Musk Cements His Power in Washington on Trumps First Day"},{"text":"That isnt my argument\\nThe idea of him succeeding doesnt even exist for yall\\nYeah, that literally is your argument.?He had four years in office and he failed at pretty much everything he attempted to do, there is no border wall, his pandemic response was catastrophic, he left office with the economy in the tank, he said he would drain the swamp, and now has three of the richest men in the world openly using their influence to?get close to him?affect policy in his favourHe attempted to launch a coup against the unites states government (which should disqualify him from ever running for any public office, and put him in prison) and guess what he failed again.Any, and I mean any person with two brain cells to rub together ?should expect chaos, catastrophe and failure just like the first time.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"Were in a dark time for America, a time Im not sure we will actually ever return from.

The issue usually is compelling of others to partake in one's own self identity.

While I fully support realistic self idealization I believe that one's freedoms ends where the freedoms of another persons begins. When you start compelling speech (You must refer to me as X). Or blurring lines of why we have seperate gender spaces in general, then I find it detrimental to society. If transwomen can compete in sports with biological women, then why even have seperate sports to begin with? Why not just eliminate the WNBA and roll them into the NBA proper? There's no longer women's boxing and men's boxing, just boxing. Restrooms and changing rooms are now gender neutral and men and women can just co-habitate those spaces.Where it is in the purview of government oversight is government run facilities. How do we house the infirm? Criminals? Do we seperate them or should they just be co-ed? Should a woman be cellmates with a man? Those scenarios are what I think aught to be clearly defined and practiced.

All he had to do was withhold a little intel from Obama in 2014 and Putin could have Ukraine.\\nAnd thats exactly what Flynn did.\\nOnly Ukraine fought back.And they stood up to kleptocracy and kremlin corruption for 10 years.\\nOf course some people would rather just let the bully take what he wants and live in imaginary peace, but the  ones who have been to Europe or the west and seen how nice life is when you dont have to deal with being shook down by a thug every day arent going back.

Trump just softened it up in advance.Leveraging the bureaucracy of the United States government against itself, the NIH and CDC grants that were originally extended in efforts of intentional solidarity against contagious disease outbreaks were reframed as conspiracy theories that the US was funding the Wuhan institute in some triple agent q-anon conspiracy.Its yet unknown if Covid was released intentionally or as a result of incompetence, but when viewed through the economic lens it was masterfully timed  for maximum destruction of the vulnerable self sabotaging US federal reserve.\\nTrump fixer Roger Stones idol, Richard Nixon (he literally has I am not a crook face tattooed on his back) put us there by handing the US economy on a platter to Saudi Arabia in the form of the petrodollar in ~74.\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret\\nThat took us off the gold standard and ensured 50 years of sending American kids to the Middle East to die for Saudis defense and corporate oil interests.\\nThere is another layer here of Russian/Israeli oligarchs pulling levers from their side using the same basic techniques, that in hindsight explain most of the US involvement in the middle east for the past century.\\nBut it all revolves around using the U.S. military and U.S. taxpayer as both the enforcer and unwitting funder.\\nRussia invaded Ukraine the second time  in February of 2022 out of necessity for the failed 2014 invasion\\nThere is a fundamental doctrine in Russian  military doctrine that you NEVER invade Russia in the winter.

It just wasnt obvious until now that we can see his Russian and Chinese connections. His kids made hundreds of millions doing PPE response to China using taxpayer funded government money and aircraft. Then Ken Griffin did the same play in reverse because why not?Russia invaded Ukraine because the CCP, Putin and MBS was trying to make BRICS the new reserve currency of the world by destroying the USD and used trump to do it)If you look at Xinjiang providence (where the Uighur population is centralized) on a map there is a tiny little section that touches Russia. Its critical because Xis ambition to have a new Silk Road to Europe would have to cross either there or about a weeks travel by rail out and around Mongolia. Xis plan is ok ambitious. He wants china to be the leader of the world and he has been pretty clear about it when you read his writings. Its just that hardly anyone outside of China speaks mandarin so nobody really listened in 2010 when he said he would control the internet.  It seemed audacious and frankly ridiculous before a handful of ISPs started centralizing.  Xi,  for his part had the CCP start weibo- the everything app in China. It works well for an authoritarian to be able to control free speech and centralize surveillance.  Its invaluable for keeping tabs on 1.4B people, especially when they compare you to Winnie the Pooh.  It was effective for a while, but it is insanely inefficient to pay someone to spend a 12 hour day monitoring 1 minute clips of social media. When people started calling him Winnie the Pooh he could censor them. But then they just switched to Cantonese.  So he had to hire a bunch of Cantonese speakers. Then they just started referring to him as mr. Shitface which was a less than flattering rendering of a story he loves to tell from his childhood when a bio-digester blew up in his face.   You see where this is going. Its REALLY hard to keep up with 1.4B peoples daily Twitter diarrhea.Xi needed A.I.","title":"'You'll figure it out': Donald Trump wrongly says Spain is a BRICS group member"},{"text":"I work with many families that spent years and thousands of dollars to come to the US legally.
