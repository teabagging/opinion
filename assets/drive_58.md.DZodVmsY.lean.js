The market hadn't seen those types of results since 1997, and we haven't had those types of results ever since.

Obviously, you are generally wise to sell them now at a lower tax rate, buy them back at a high basis point so that when you realize a gain in the future, your tax bill will be lower AND your potential to strategically sell them at a loss will be more likely?Now you, as a middle income household with tens or hundreds of thousands in your retirement accounts, what do you think will happen to the markets (and your retirement account balances) when there is huge amounts of selling at the end of this year (to lock in the lower rates)?  There will be a huge supply of for sale stocks and not a very strong demand from buyers.Not only that, but instead of tax loss harvesting this year, wise people will carry any losses into next year to apply against any gains next year.  If the market crashes by 25% and you are getting closer to retirement, that's problematic.If the market crashes by 25% -  you now need to see the market increase by 33% just to get back to where you were.The problem with some people (and Democrats are notorious for this), they refuse to see or comprehend the \\"unintended consequences\\" that so many people were warning about.All that said, it's not that I am opposed to adjusting our tax system and for the highest earners to pay a little bit more and also for all earners to pay at least something in Federal Income Taxes.

I'm not saying that everyone voting for Trump gets that much into it, but it is true that a VERY high percentage of Republicans are fairly religious nowadays. The point is that this religious idealogy is where the GOP gets their marching orders. It's not limited to crazy pastors and \\"prophets\\", almost all of their politicans, influencers and news media is into this as well.

United States politicians are humans, with goals, ideals, and flaws, just like the rest of us. But the United States's only goal, as a nation-state and as the dominant power in the world in the last 100 years, is to maintain that status. Any action from the US government in the international arena should be analyzed though that lens, and - mostly - through that lens alone. Speeches of \\"good\\" vs \\"bad\\", \\"communism\\" vs \\"democracy\\" , etc, are of little help for understanding how geopolitics actually plays out and are often contradicted by it. Examples are the US installing and sustaining non-democratic governments, of which Brazil's dictatorship is only one example.\\n2. Rather than guided by ideological principles, the actions of the United States should be understood as those that at any given time the US government believe will at worse maintain and at best increase its hegemony. Obviously it is not math and, a posteriori, one can evaluate that some of those actions have not advanced or even regressed the desired outcome.\\n3. Throughout history, geopolitics has often ended up playing as a zero-sum game. There are winners and there are losers. This is arguably even more true in a fully globalized, interconnected world. Wherever a country is losing influence, or power, there's another gaining it. US interference, regardless of ideology, is usually aimed to ensure that its spheres of influence are at least maintained, hopefully increased. As an example, arguably, the US is partly responsible for the war in Ukraine, an accelerant of which is the decades-long push to add Ukraine to NATO. The latter only makes sense as an effort by the US nation-state to expand its influence at the expense of Russia's.\\n4. Unfortunately, it is very likely that wherever the US loses influence, some other state like China or Russia will fill the vacuum. Wherever the US does not project its power, someone else will. If one accepts this as political realism, then one needs to ask the question: whose superpower umbrella aligns best with my principles or ideology? Despite its flaws, and there are many, the US preserves - at least up to the fall 2024 - relatively well-designed democratic institutions. Possible successors to the US in the role of global superpower do not. As an aside, communist experiments around the world have also failed to rely on strong institutions so, in my opinion, if \\"communism\\", whatever that means, is to replace capitalism as a superior system, it would do well to take lessons from advanced capitalistic societies.\\n5. Finally, in your post, I think you neglect the importance of US internal affairs to global politics. Many aspects of American policy are shaped by how they affect the US internal power struggle. For example, the most powerful lobby in the US is the Jewish lobby. Because this lobby has enough power to shift internal American elections, American international policy towards Israel and the Middle East is profoundly impacted by it. So you see, the possible undemocratic projection of international power, is linked to the ways in which democracy manifests internally in the US. What will the US policy be towards Israel? Well, what do American Jews want (and there's a lot of them) and how are their desires represented by their lobbies (arguably undemocratic institutions in themselves)? In a recent, very explicit case, AIPAC spent 100 million to unseat candidates that criticized Israel \\\\[1\\\\] Another example, brought up by yourself, is the Cuban embargo. The Cuban embargo persists because there's a large, politically very powerful Cuban diaspora, mostly based in Florida, that is largely in favor of the embargo. Because of this, any party that advocates for the elimination of the embargo basically has no chance of winning Florida. That price for \\"doing the right thing\\" is simply unacceptable for either Democrats or Republicans.\\\\[1\\\\] [https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/03/aipac-israel-spending-democratic-primaries-00144552](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/03/aipac-israel-spending-democratic-primaries-00144552)","title":"CMV: The US shouldnt interfere in other countries internal problems"},{"text":"What changed your mind?

Here are the key aspects of the gray rock mindset:? 1. **Neutral Responses**: Respond with short, unemotional, and factual answers. Avoid engaging in deep conversations or reacting emotionally, as this gives the difficult person less to work with.? 2. **Stay Non-confrontational**: Dont challenge their beliefs or argue directly, as this may provoke defensiveness or aggression. Instead, avoid controversial topics and deflect conversations that could lead to conflict.? 3. **Limit Personal Information**: Keep conversations superficial and avoid sharing personal details that could be used against you later or to draw you back into emotionally charged situations. ? 4. **Maintain Boundaries**: While staying neutral, it's crucial to set and enforce boundaries to protect your mental and emotional well-being. Limit contact where possible and avoid unnecessary interactions.? 5. **Consistency**: Gray rocking works best when it's applied consistently over time. By continuously being disengaged, the difficult family member may eventually lose interest in trying to provoke or manipulate you.?

Ive not had success talking anyone out of Trumpism.

They never back up their claims other than saying Trump said, or show you Fox News sound bites (Fox News has admitted they are entertainment, not news, btw). They can never name a real example or produce legit evidence for any of the more insane lies. Its more for myself than for the other person when I engage. I dont recommend doing anything if you are anxious or irritated, as they really dont care about facts or logic and it can be maddening.As far as I can tell, there are a few kinds of Trump people.

It's now worth $50,000.  That's a $30,000 capital gain.  You have two choices:1: you can sell it this year and be taxed 20% on it = $6,0002: you can sell it next year and be taxed 28% on it = $8,400 (forfeited $2,400 in extra taxes)If you sell it this year, you can buy it back at about the same price and sell it in the future, but now only paying on the gains vs. the current price (not the $20K you paid for it years ago).So, people that invest and pay taxes think about these things . . . So these high earners (who also own the most stocks vs. other lower income groups) decides to sell tons of shares between the election and the end of the year to lock in the lower tax rates.Now, you probably have heard of supply and demand, right?  Now there is a ton of supply of these shares of stock and no where close to enough demand - what happens to the price of those shares and the stock market in general?  It's gonna go down - possibly even significantly, right? You following along still?Tell me, as a middle income earner - what does that do to the balance in your 401K or IRA when the market drops a significant amount in value?  Are you ready for that?  Remember, the top 1% own over 50% of all stocks!

The real tactical value of these conspiracies in the first place was that they provided a legal pretense to override the normal electoral process and hand himself the election.  But as an incumbent, these claims will have only rhetorical value, and that rhetorical value comes with drawbacks.2) Trump is four years older and is now 78 years old.  In 2028, Trump will be 82 years old.  Trump might see this 2024 election as his last chance to get back into office, and if he loses, his last moments in the center of the political limelight.  If he is feeling his age, and if it seems very likely that he will lose, he might be inclined to try to rehabilitate his image rather than having his last moments be defined by his complaining over an unfair election.  This might be a longshot, but I think it's a possibility.","title":"CMV: America will not be less divided after the 2024 election"},{"text":"That'll never happen, they all buy into the groupthink.

Prior to the election, pundits regularly discussed the concept of the upcoming [red mirage.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/31/red-mirage-trump-election-scenario-victory) Since Democrats took Covid seriously and Republicans didn't, a massively disproportionate group of mail-in voters were Democratic. This resulted in a scenario where Trump took massive early leads that dwindled once the mail-in votes were cast. So he went out, declared victory, and then bitched about it once votes were properly tallied.This created enough bullshit that a large number of Republicans were able to fool themselves into believing they hadn't just voted for a fucking traitor. Initial beliefs tend to hold strong, and since their initial belief was fraud, it persisted.The thing is, there's no reason for something similar to happen this time. The person leading on election night probably will be the winner in the morning. There's not going to be a massive jump in Democratic votes. I'm not saying all Republicans will accept the results.

For many years, developing countries had believed that copying the West was the best way to achieve prosperity, but by 2010?China was becoming the new role model. Add to this the failure of the War on Terror and the Arab Spring to spread democracy to the Middle East and you can kind of understand why people became less optimistic about the prospects of democracy.?\\nHowever, even if Western people have become less confident about the inevitability of democratization, this does not mean they no longer support it. Although there are sometimes claims that major Western countries have regressed, I think in most cases this is untrue. Countries like Britain and the USA have always been imperfect democracies and I don't believe things are any worse now than during the War on Terror, for example, when there was widespread surveilance, limits on free speech, imprisonment without charge and even torture of terror suspects.?\\nA few democracies have regressed significantly in recent years, but far more countries are democratic now than when I was a child in the 80s.

Statement from Secretary Vilsack:Under the Biden-Harris Administration, we are supporting a more prosperous future for rural communities by speeding up the transition to clean energy while at the same time keeping monthly bills low and investing in the American workforce with new jobs and apprenticeships, said Secretary Vilsack. One in five rural Americans will benefit from these clean energy investments, thanks to partnerships with rural electric cooperatives like Dairyland. Put simply, this is rural power, for rural America.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $7.3 Billion in Clean Energy Investments from the Investing in America Agenda, Largest Investment in Rural Electrification Since the New Deal"},{"text":"Israel seems far more dedicated to erasing Palestine than the other way around.

First, it says only 12 US soldiers were killed when the number was actually 13. Then the senator says withdrawing 100,000 troops would never be without issues. But Biden was left with only 2,500 troops, so he's really not addressing the specifics of how difficult his task was. Also, the 100,000 number is suspicious to me  I thought Trump had 11,000 troops when he made the Taliban deal.I really wish someone would come up with a detailed outline of events. I know the Taliban didn't hold up their end of the bargain, but so much of the reporting on this is vague that I'm not sure which promises they failed to keep. Also, lots of details are left unexplained. For instance, some articles conflate the ISIS-K suicide bomber with the Taliban that the bomber was fighting against. Some say the Taliban released ISIS prisoners deliberately, some say they were somehow released in the fighting.I still don't know if Trump had any plans to recover equipment or, if he did, if that would've been cost-effective or would've prevented more conflict after our withdrawal. I don't know if Trump had a plan to evacuate civilians, or even what percentage of civilians Biden managed to evacuate.I know Trump's refusal to include the Afghanistan government or our international allies in his deal-making influenced their willingness to continue fighting. Our allies were withdrawing, leaving us to manage the conflict by ourselves.

Since the State Department defines \\"job\\" as \\"one position that is filled for 1 year,\\" that would equate to approximately 3,900 jobs over a two-year period. In short: Most of the estimated jobs were temporary.The State Department forecasted that no more than 50 jobs, some of which could be located in Canada, would be required to maintain the pipeline. Thirty-five of them would be permanent, while 15 would be temporary contractors.[2024 U.S. Energy &amp; Employment Jobs Report (USEER)](https://www.energy.gov/policy/us-energy-employment-jobs-report-useer)In 2023, jobs in clean energy grew at more than twice the rate of the strong overall U.S. labor market thanks in large part to the Biden-Harris Investing in America agenda driving record investments in clean energy supply chains. Clean energy jobs grew at double the rate (4.2%) of job growth in the rest of the economy (2.0%), adding 142,000 new jobs.For the first time ever, unionization rates in clean energy (12.4%) surpassed the energy sector average (11%). And unionized employers reported less difficulty hiring than non-union employers, with both employer groups reporting an easier time hiring workers than last year.The Biden-Harris Administration has spurred a manufacturing boom, especially in the clean energy sector with over 800 facilities announced since 2021 which is reflected in a rapid increase in construction jobs. Construction employment in energy grew 4.5%, almost double the economy-wide construction employment growth of 2.3%.Employment increased across all five USEER energy technology categories, which includes electric power generation; energy efficiency; fuels; motor vehicles; and transmission, distribution, and storage, from in 2023. Clean energy jobs increased in every state across the United States.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Invests $430 Million to Upgrade Americas Hydropower Infrastructure"},{"text":"\\"They intentionally edited cricket sounds into my rally footage.

We are probably closer than we think so I'd like to give you the other view of the things: we are probably living the most balanced justice-wise moment of Latin \\"third\\" world countries. We can not forget we are babies compared to civilizations like European and Asian. We were one of the last regions on Earth to be \\"discovered\\". Almost every spanish conolized South American country was brutaly violented, all it's culture robbed, It was a massacre (anyone can search about this). If you are from Brazil, Portugal was a bit nicer but still basically Brazil became a refugee country from fled Portuguese citizens, all our fortune and gold was robbed. Basically we had some years to get together this sense of nation (which we still are figuring out). We are a mix of different cultures, different refugee from wars. A loooot of Europeans came to South America to flee from World Wars so our country is divided by itself, lacking this whole nationship feeling until this day.I'm saying all of this to sumarize the information and say that we are free, like truly free, truly feeling globalized, and \\"escaping\\" from this whole third-world stigma recently only, probably only after the military dictatorships that occured in South American during the 70s and 80s. We are baby talking about democracy, parlament, civil rights and so on. We are around 40 or 50 years old only if we take our Constitution granted. The brazilian constitution is from 1988!!! There were ancient laws from before Christ if you think about it. The earliest and most important legislation, or body of leges, was the Twelve Tables, enacted in?**451C450 bce.** By year 280 bce Romans were fighting for plebeian rights. We can't even compare things.I think we are doing pretty great so far. Years of development, globalizing our countries, developing more \\"Nation\\" love, discovering our culture, creating our own laws and Constitutions while being considered good countries overall. Brazil has some of the best companies in the world, Argentina (Buenos Aires) was considered one of the culture capitals of the world last century, we have good elections principles overall, we have almost no conflicts, we have a good voting system that tries to apply the Democracy whenever possible, we vote for mayors, presidents, governors, senators (Federal and State senators) and so on. Of course we still lack a lot of stuff, we still suffer from the poverty that years of slavery and being neglected brought to us, but overall speaking we are not doing bad at all! We have great potencial, few to none dictatorship if you include the whole Latin America. Every country in the world suffers from people asking for military \\"revolutions\\" and so on. This isn't exclusivily something from us.Just trying to make you feel a little more proud and see the half full of the cup. A lot of questions that we ask ourselves here, other countries do it too. Left wing and right win movements comes and goes everywhere. For baby countries I think we are figuring around where we belong, sometimes we even can figure among the best if we include sports and such. All this is fruit from hardwork and a democracy that is still a baby too but is walking and not crawling anymore. We make alliances, we participate and integrate world debates and so on.","title":"CMV: i dont think Western countries populations value democracy and human rights so much as they believe"},{"text":"Man Im hearing both right now, Im hearing Kamunism is in the lead and Trump is in the lead, tf is happening?","title":"CNN Starts to Freak Out About Kamala Harris After Key Swing State Shifts Towards Trump"},{"text":"Can we like not","title":"I Don't Want to Say It's Over for Kamala Harris...

Administered by the Grid Deployment Office (GDO) and funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives program will enhance dam safety, improve grid resilience at 215 facilities, and protect 6,000 existing jobs at hydropower facilities as well as contractors and vendors.  \\n...  \\nHydropower currently accounts for nearly 27% of renewable electricity generation in the United States, as well as 93% of all utility-scale energy storage. However, the fleet is aging, with many facilities in need of repair and upgrades.  \\n...  \\nThe Investing in America agenda supports capital improvements directly related to three main areas of hydropower: improving grid resilience, improving dam safety, and enabling environmental and recreational improvements to hydropower facilities. Within DOEs portfolio and funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives are complemented by two additional hydroelectric incentives: the Hydroelectric Production Incentives, providing incentive payments to qualified hydroelectric facilities for electricity generated and sold and the Hydroelectric Efficiency Improvement Incentives, providing payments to increase power generation from the nations existing hydropower fleet.The goals of the hydroelectric improvement projects:**Strengthen grid resilience at hydropower dams by:**? * Replacing or upgrading turbines and generators?\\n* Upgrading control systems?\\n* Upgrading cables and transformers?\\n* Upgrading penstocks, which transport water to the turbines?? **Improve dam safety** by upgrading aging dam infrastructure and strengthening existing infrastructure against extreme weather events. The average number of years selected facilities have been in operation is 79 years. Specific examples of projects include:? * Upgrades to emergency spillways, which channel extra water during heavy rains?\\n* Concrete replacement to prevent water seepage through the dam?\\n* Water conveyance repairs to improve how the dam controls water movement?\\n* Upgrades to gates?\\n* Upgrades to prevent overtopping of dam walls?\\n* Erosion repair on the dam and surrounding areas **Facilitate environmental and recreational improvements to hydropower infrastructure that will improve water conditions and expand surrounding habitat and passage for fish and other species**, and upgrade recreational facilities near dams. For example:? * Fish passage projects will install fish ladders or other equipment to enable fish and other aquatic species to pass through the dam and/or the turbine. Some projects will also improve or expand the wildlife habitat surrounding the dam.?? \\n* Water quality projects will deploy special turbines that reduce the loss of oxygen in water as it runs through the turbine to generate electricity. Water quality projects might also improve aquatic habitats downstream of the dam, as well as benefit species of conservation concern or cultural significance to Indian Tribes.?? \\n* Recreation projects will establish or maintain recreational facilities and opportunities near the dam, which might include expanding water access for boating; improving access for other recreational activities, such as kayaking and white-water rafting; and enhancing walking trails.Full list of selections is located at the bottom of the press release. There will be a public webinar regarding the selections on Sept. 11 at 1-1:30pm ET. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M.

Firstly, they didn't perform a broad BLAST search of their target sites against other viral genomes, which is already a fatal flaw as those sequences have been reported in other Coronaviridae?as well as other +ssRNA viruses. When others did look, myself included, we found hits to multiple member of Coronaviridae, and also other Group IV viruses. Next up, the HIV hits they published were on extremely small fragments...smaller even than the primers we normally use in traditional PCR. The result of this were e values that were within the range where they could be explained by random chance.Even better, their sequences had gaps larger than the homologous regions but they neglected to apply the standard BLAST penalty to the e values when gaps are present.This meant that they were reporting \\\\~20bp hits when in fact they were only about a small fraction of this.Their best hit was 18bp (6aa)...which is completely in the realm of natural mutation, and there was also homology to other Coronaviridae over half that space.

A vicious evil that everyone had already seen the last time they came to power and executed tens of thousands in soccer stadiums. Because there's room and it's easier.During the evacuation, 13 unlucky rookies were given the usual hazing \\"shit detail\\". Apparently a longstanding tradition in the US military. They were assigned to a sewage culvert that ran along outside of the airport.Which thousands of frightened Afghan people began wading through desperate to get on a plane out rather that wait for the Taliban. One of the waders was a Taliban suicide bomber. Who killed the 13 US soldiers and by the way, 100 AFGHAN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN!The only reason more US soldiers weren't killed was because the 13 were left on their own. Possibly even abandoned. No surprise, no one's talking about who assigned them to the shit river. In spite of the conveniently missing details, in spite of the politically motivated criticisms, the remaining 13,000 US soldiers and over 120,000 non-US military and civilians were SAFELY evacuated. The equipment everyone is angry about, in the hands of the US military, was destroyed. The equipment that was in the hands of the Afghan army that Trump betrayed, wasn't.Now we're forced to watch Trump grinning on the desecrated graves of 13 American soldiers who died because of him and a systemic failure of the US military, during a fiasco he created.

And when I say \\"may not\\" I mean that.  I'm not 100% certain I'm right; but I am pretty sure that my view is reasonable and credible, although many on the left seem to dismiss it out of hand.Where I differ from most others is, to me supporting democracy doesn't mean you always do what the majority wants done; it doesn't even mean you always do what the majority wants done unless it contravenes obvious freedom or rights guarantees (that is, the Bill of Rights).  No.  To me, supporting democracy means you make compromises.  If there are people who feel very strongly about something, regardless of whether they're right or wrong, if what they want is neither catastrophic nor brutal then it strengthens democracy to give those people a seat at the table of power.  To let them have a say in how things go, on the particular issues they're concerned with.I'm going to say that again, just in case you missed the point:  it strengthens democracy to give minorities who feel very strongly about something real power over their preferred issue, as long as what they want is neither brutal nor catastrophic.If I'm right, and I'm sure many will think I am not, Trump strengthened democracy, here in the US, by giving the border voters a seat at the table of power.

These people dont see him as a threat to democracy or even standard bearer for an ideology, really.

The two things dont really require each other. You can have a republic under a dictator and a democracy thats entirely personal rule by whoever got elected.Democracy isnt the antithesis of authoritarianism. You can full well have a democracy which operates by investing someone with essentially dictatorial power. Theoretically, thats how the UKs government works: a party is elected, forms a government, and rules without any formal limits.

Trump was an attention whore and a celebrity wannabe and he courted media attention by being a loud mouthed and uncouth rich guy who flaunted his wealth shamelessly. He was the poster child for image over substance and he and the media had a symbiotic relationship. But even then it was clear that Trump lacked substance. He was always shown getting out of a private plane, a helicopter or a limo, dressed like a serious businessman, going to splashy events and seemingly rubbing elbows with celebrities. But he never had anything to say and there was nothing interesting about him. He was a joke from the very start and a caricature of a trust fund baby showing off his unearned wealth and thinking he was something special. He was more articulate then, but it was all self promotion and empty blather. Trump inherited enough money to be whatever he wanted to be and he decided to cosplay as a businessman and be a sleazy criminal. And you are correct that he is just saying words that have no relation to reality. Its just him blathering whatever suits his purpose at the moment. Its cotton candy speech. It dissipates quickly and leaves no lasting impression.","title":"Trump will not prepare for debating Kamala Harris.

Their coming to her where she's at as a contrast to Trump.\\nIn the end I think this will have a normalizing effect towards Harris' more progressive agenda if she wins and she's an effective leader.

That is not, and has never been, the goal of the US government.The US governments primary foreign policy goal is to keep as much money flowing into US industry as possible. The US government does not care about cultural and political diversity, it doesnt believe that its model of democracy is universally ideal, and it only desires to keep international peace insofar as that peace keeps markets stable. Look at the Middle East  the US is constantly stoking war and political instability when the region isnt aligned economically with it, and only tries to maintain peace and stability when it benefits the US economically.The Cuban embargo has been greatly effective; the goal was never to create a better life for the Cuban people, it is to punish an isolationist, Communist state for going against US hegemony and ideology. The Cuban people being worse off, and the West being able to blame it on Communism/Socialism, is a huge win for the US government.","title":"CMV: The US shouldnt interfere in other countries internal problems"},{"text":"Ukraine has a win if they manage to take back their land or force Russia into a poor negotiating position that gets them most of what they want.Which is something Ukraine *can* do, even if they have to fight defensively, simply because of the ridiculous material expenditure from Russia to make even modest gains.

The reason the US is sponsoring \\"peace\\" is because it allows its military to spend its assets, meaning it now has to buy more, and now the military industrial sector is happy it has a buyer, and the government is happy because now the military industrial sector is \\"lobbying\\", which is just a fancy term for getting bribes to pass specific laws. So essentially, all the coups and wars and 2. The reason the US is specifically so against communism, is not that the US is concerned with the well-being of people, otherwise there wouldn't be so many homeless people in their own country, let alone the people in other countries. The reason is security. If the people see a functioning communist state, and not a stalinist relic, they will be more inclined to revolution. This is also the reason Spain and UK are opposed to minor nations splitting and gaining independence from larger nations. Because if they do it, then Catalonia and Scotland will also jump on the train. For the US, communism is essentially the only thing that can bring it down.Basically, saying the US should not interfere in global politics is saying you believe Europe or China or whatever superpower should interfere instead, because the US will collapse or at best become a relic of its past if it stops now and then the others will have free reign to do whatever they want.We are currently in \\"Pax Americana\\", basically the only reason there's not many wars out there is because there is a dominant power. The moment this dominant power collapses, multiple powers will struggle for many years to fight their way to the top, and this usually includes more wars than when there is a single dominant power. This happened historically too, with Pax Romana and Pax Britannica.

The CCP will never tolerate even a hint internal splits, any sign of division is seen as a direct threat to its survival, the Party moves swiftly to eliminate any dissent, No ones going to push for democracy when the cost of stepping out of line is losing your livelihood.Secondly the CCP (along with all the Chinese people) is obsessed with stability. They view political change as a risk to the nations stability, which is something extremely valued by Chinese today if you look back at our history. You can see this again in how they handled Hong Kong, any chance of democracy was crushed. The Party isnt going to allow a scenario where people can freely choose between competing visions for the country because, they believe that would open the door to chaos.So yeah, it will take an economic collapse of the country to cause China to democratize, and even if that happens another civil war would break out with the possibility of the country fracturing into small nations, which is something that Chinese people can not accept.

This doesn't even speak of the real dangers of a Trump fascist dictatorship and that christian nationalists want to promote \\"the traditional family\\" at all costs, including eliminating feminists and LGBT people.Trans people still depend on support on society to live, and gender affirming healthcare saves lives.  Before insurance being required to cover gender affirming care in many states as well as the affordable care act, transwomen had to pay hundreds for hormones, thousands for things like hair removal, and surgeries costed tens of thousands.  Many trans people are too poor to afford these things.  We don't deserve to be thrown to the curb and left to die.What about the Ukrainians?  Without America's help, Ukraine will lose the war.

I'm a former attorney and current business systems software developer.  My communication skills are not poor, and I know how to tailor my message to my audience.  Sometimes it lands, but most of the time it ends poorly.I've come to conclude that a large percentage of the American public is just utterly unable to discern non-substantive versus substantive speech.  I'm convinced at this point that if the tools and corresponding neural pathways for critical thinking are not built out prior to a person leaving high-school, that they never fully \\"get\\" there.  Their bullshit detector might have a light that comes on every once in a while, but it's not calibrated to the right stuff.So, unfortunately, I don't know if calling Trump out on his word salad BS will land with the folks I'm talking about above.  They see no difference between his empty blather versus someone clearly and cogently articulating a point.  Moreover, because Trump's speech has more vibrancy (I don't like calling it that, but it seemed like the best word for the use case), they are immediately attracted more to what he's saying than whatever \\"boring\\" words are coming out of the other person's mouth.And that's the damn misery of it all.  Trump, by being morally bankrupt, pathologically self-assured, and without any shame, is unknowingly exploiting this in his followers.  And it's a forward feedback loop.  The more toxic and stupid his words, the more his message stirs the \\"no-bullshit-detector\\" crowd, which then further emboldens him to say even worse and dumber shit.I've come to conclude that for this (and for other moral reasons) there is no point in even trying to reclaim those lost to the cult.  Rather, I think effort is far more meaningfully spent ensuring as many people vote as possible by removing any obstacles thereto and actively trumpeting the messages of the democrats in hopes that it may sway non-voters to go to the polls.  Because for what it's worth, there are still WAY more people that actually see through his shit than are taken in by it.  And I'm wagering a good majority of the non-voters, gun to their head being forced to vote, would likely vote Harris.","title":"Trump will not prepare for debating Kamala Harris.

He said American democracy is not perfect, but it is an agreed upon system and if one doesnt trust the process and the experts that feed into it then only chaos will result. How is one to speak to someone like this, if one chooses to engage (as someone who voted for Trump but who thought his presidency was an ineffectual failure)? The answer is that liberals are the upper middle class and are out of touch with reality. They never had to deal with the reality of class warfare and neoliberal economics, their jobs outsourced, and their living standards destroyed to make the rich richer.What does this liberal friend expect to happen when white Middle America is destitute? Should they accept the endless studies of our so-called experts against their own lying eyes? Why have we shipped manufacturing abroad, printed Federal Reserve loldollars to infinity, and have unlimited illegal immigration? Regardless of if you agree with MMT or not, the point is clear - there has been a real working class crisis. If there is going to be an alternative to one of these futures, the Jewish community must wrestle with its unparalleled will-to-power and it being wildly overrepresented in over-financializing the West, opening its borders and serving at the forefront of all leftist movements, which is paradoxically against its long-term interest as they almost universally love living as minorities within white Christian countries which are all being destroyed now. But the only way this will happen is if the Jewish elites or counter-elites recognize these issues and become willing to honestly wrestle with them. Banning free speech, criminalizing anti-semitism, instituting mass censorship will ultimately only have the opposite effect of what is intended: as I told my friend at the start of the essay, the way the temperature of a conflict is lowered is by addressing the underlying legitimate complaints, not through censorship which will only make it worse.The US has made the same mistakes that the authoritarian empires of old. At least the writer is willing to critique the wealthy elites (many Jewish) that are causing harm.I see very little sign of this happening at this time; however, the Jewish shock at the overwhelmingly pro-Palestinian non-white reaction to 10/6 may be the very first sign of it. But as Milton Friedman explained and as Gilad Atzmon pointed out, time is running out as anti-semitism increases across the board from both the far-right and far-left.10 One thing is for sure: doubling down on the censorship tactics and ignoring these issues will only make them worse.The author doesn't address the genocide in Gaza to the extent it deserves, but as he or she notes, this will worsen anti-Semitic behavior.","title":"Red lines of the counter-elite | West vs. East Coast Straussians and the limits of anti-semitic discourse (This is a critique from the Jewish left, but a bit more \\"sane\\" than most criticisms, since a lot of it is aimed at neoliberalism)"},{"text":"On a more serious note though, my opinion is that voting third party will hinder whichever party you would have voted for if there was no third party available.If you, like /u/Caelian, truly believe both candidates are equally bad then yeah, your vote doesn't really make a difference to the actual race since it would've never gone to either of them anyways, you would've just stayed home.I think this sentiment is mostly aimed at people who say \\"I hate Trump with all my being but I also can't bring myself to vote for Harris because of [specific issue], although I agree with her on most everything else.\\" In this case, them choosing not to vote for their least hated choice is actively helping the opposition, which is further away from their actual political position on pretty much every issue, including [specific issue] which makes them not vote for Harris in the first place.","title":"A Question for People Voting for Harris Because \\"TRUMP!!!\\"..."},{"text":"Youre going to need to drop a source for that bud","title":"White House: Biden has not called family of American citizen killed in West Bank by Israeli troops"},{"text":"JD Vance is a Catholic convert who spends most of his time ginning up xenophobia against Catholic migrants, there should be a slur for this type of person","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":" and because yeah, harris is pretty bad. but as a nonbinary person myself with a lot of queer and trans friends? if trump wins, we are in *danger*.Do you really think emotional blackmail is going to convince anyone?","title":"A Question for People Voting for Harris Because \\"TRUMP!!!\\"..."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/29zy3cstuznd1.jpeg?width=959&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53377a1fb24a14b85d24663bd8586be1291eb663Vance continues to stoke the flames of hatred, would not be surprised if some Trumpian mob shows up to Springfield","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Russian bots","title":"Democrats said if Trump was re-elected in 2020 he'd unleash hell on earth, then Biden was elected and he unleashed hell on earth.

It isn't just that Israel buys weapons from the US, it's that we *give them the money to do so*. Some of that money is also used to purchase from Israel's own defense industry, and it's so important that it accounts for about 15% of Israeli annual defense spending (source: https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts).So, while Israel *could* find another supplier,  in order to match the aid they get from the US, whoever it goes to outside of that would also have to supply them the money to buy the weapons, as well as the weapons themselves. It would also have to be weapons that Israel would actually *want*, for example something equivalent to Iron Dome. Israel produces equipment for that on its own, but also relies on US co-production to meet demand. You also have to consider that, even if all those other things weren't issues, Israel in many cases would probably have to retrain its forces on new equipment that would be replacing the old US stuff.My point is that, while not impossible, it would be an absolute pain in the ass for Israel to find new military suppliers to replace US funding/production, and it has the potential to seriously degrade both their economy and their defense capabilities in the near future.EDIT: lol at being downvoted for stating objective facts backed by reliable sources.

He comes from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, where he had served until the end of the Trump Administration as a Deputy General Counsel (with responsibility for the immigration portfolio) and the Acting Chief Counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. While at DHS, George co-drafted regulations and Federal Register notices including ones making aliens ineligible for asylum where there are reasonable grounds for regarding them as dangers to the security of the United States (based on emergency public health concerns caused by communicable diseases); implementing Safe Third Country Agreements between the United States and foreign countries under which certain aliens are barred from applying for asylum in the U.S. but rather removed to those foreign countries to seek asylum; and expanding the geographic and temporal scope of expedited removal authority for inadmissible aliens. He also co-conceived the legal structure of the Migrant Protection Protocols (under which aliens apprehended crossing the border from Mexico may be required to wait in Mexico pending the initiation and completion of their removal proceedings in U.S. immigration court) and helped develop the legal rationale for the use of Title 42 authority to expel aliens apprehended at the border during the COVID-19 pandemic. While at DHS, Mr. Fishman was also detailed to the White House's Office of American Innovation to draft the legal immigration reform provisions of Jared Kushners proposed immigration reform legislation. Prior to the beginning of the Administration, George had served on the Immigration Policy team in the Trump Transition Office.CIS:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies\\nThe Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is an American anti-immigration think tank. It favors far lower immigration numbers and produces analyses to further those views. The CIS was founded by historian Otis L. Graham alongside eugenicist and white nationalist John Tanton in 1985 as a spin-off of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). It is one of a number of anti-immigration organizations founded by Tanton, along with FAIR and NumbersUSA.Reports published by CIS have been disputed by scholars on immigration, fact-checkers and news outlets, and immigration-research organizations. The organization had significant influence within the Trump administration,[3] which cited the group's work to defend its immigration policies.[4] The Southern Poverty Law Center designated CIS as a hate group with ties to the American nativist movement.[5] The CIS sued the SPLC over the designation, but the lawsuit was dismissed.[6][7][8] Project 2025CIS is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025,[44] a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election.[45]","title":"Sen.

It said that the shooting took place during a violent riot where Palestinians had thrown rocks at Israeli security forces.\\nBlinken said that the shooting was not acceptable.\\nNo one, no one should be shot and killed for attending a protest, he said. No one should have to put their life at risk just to purely express their views. The Israeli security forces need to make some fundamental changes in the way they operate in the West Bank, including changes in their rules of engagement.It has to change, and well be making that clear to the senior-most members of the Israeli government, he added.\\nEygi, who was raised in the Seattle area and was a recent graduate of the University of Washington, had been volunteering with the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist group. She was attending a protest against settlement expansion in the Palestinian village of Beita when she was killed.\\nOther activists on the scene said there had been a confrontation between Israeli forces and villagers after Friday prayers, where some young residents had thrown rocks. However, they contend that it was quickly dispersed as Israeli forces used live fire and tear gas, with Eygi and other activists retreating down the street.\\nEygi was shot in the head as she stood in an olive grove after clashes had subsided, several activists have said.\\nBlinken said that the Israeli investigation seems to show what eyewitnesses have said and made clear, that her killing was both unprovoked and unjustified.\\nMorris reported from Berlin.","title":"U.S. demands IDF change West Bank operations after Americans killing"},{"text":"5 hours old and no source.

When just one confederate was present, there was virtually no impact on participants' answers. The presence of two confederates had only a tiny effect. The level of conformity seen with three or more confederates was far more significant. **Asch also found that having one of the confederates give the correct answer while the rest of the confederates gave the incorrect answer dramatically lowered conformity.** In this situation, just 5% to 10% of the participants conformed to the rest of the group (depending on how often the ally answered correctly).

Being old enough to remember similar warnings about swine flu , Sars 1 and 2 , bird flu etc  I had my doubts  but wanted to believe tptb had people's best interests at heart and were genuinely trying to save lives. The thing that woke me up was at first here in NZ there was a shortage of the first lot of shots so the 'most at risk' were prioritized but with the warnings and push for the sick and  elderly to get vaxed from this 'deadly pandemic' there was a footnote that children did not need to get the shots as their immune system would be sufficient . \\n   \\nNow im no expert but im fairly sure past deadly pandemics killed old and young alike so how could they say our children were safe if it was this wave of sickness and death?  I'm late 50s and was apparently in the at risk group but couldn't see how my immunity was that much different than a child's ( I actually think an adults should be better as we've already dealt with germs and seasonal sickness building our immune systems up for years). I decided to hold off getting the (first) shot , and when people still caught the virus and the narrative became you needed a booster because the first shot  wore off I felt my gut feeling was right ,we didn't need those shots as they didn't work . I was in close contact with several people who tested positive as I wanted to catch and develop natural immunity. Didn't get anything worse than the same cold that most people get every winter . Wasn't anywhere near sick enough to feel I needed a doctor let alone a hospital , i did isolate during lockdowns and wore a mask in the grocery store but  didn't test myself as tests were reported to have a 30% error rate. I don't know if the shots are harming people but I personally know 2 seemingly fit and healthy friends get diagnosed with cancer since getting them, a younger family member who had been declared cancer free now has had a recurrence,  another family member lose their baby at full term and friends suffering other health problems ( irregular periods, recurring flu symptoms, migraines etc).My stepfather was diagnosed with Parkinsons around the time got vaxed and recently started having symptoms of dementia.Those are just the  people in my small circle .Add to this reports of abnormal amounts of young people dropping with myocarditis,  uptick in cancer rates across all ages and the large amount of people complaining of  persistant coughs /flu symptoms and getting sick way more often , I seriously think the experimental rushed shots have affected peoples natural immune systems and are causing harm . I hope I'm wrong and it's all coincidences but one thing I do know is if I get cancer or dementia or any other health problems it wasn't caused by those shots masquerading as vaccines.","title":"COVID vaccine and dementia link?"},{"text":"Read the divider The big guy got rolled in almost every negotiation.","title":"Democrat says Trump 'out- negotiated' by Taliban on Afghanistan"},{"text":"AI guy here, it all depends on how many images the model was trained on.

They weren't involved.The motivations of the Irgun and Lehi are harder to prove. Its plausible that they mistakenly thought Deir Yassin were harboring militia members.   I have no idea how I would go about proving that.  Like you said before, lots of people had strong incentives to mislead about this, so its hard to find good sources sometimes.  There are allegations that they wanted to pillage Deir Yassin, but I have no way of proving or disproving that either.  I feel like that allegation would be made, regardless of whether or not it was the truth, given the political dynamics at the time. arguing that Jews were just going around terrorizing civilians is problematicI can point to war crimes in many other conflicts and obviously you've mentioned war crimes committed by Muslims in that conflict.I'm not claiming that the predecessors to the IDF and the Lehi were uniquely bad. I'm merely claiming that they committed war crimes and that people had a reasonable fear of them (hence people fleeing from them toward Egypt to Gaza).

Like it was probably equal parts to history and civics/government. Then with testing reform in the 00s, things changed. We teach to the test and on basic skills of reading and writing and literary analysis. Which is all good but the consumer literacy aspect was really important. It was where we learned to ask \\"who funded this statement that's affecting me and why.\\" Now kids don't get that until they get to upper level science classes and learn to evaluate scientific studies. By then, it's kind of too late. We need to be taught cynicism and suspicion earlier. Like right away.Tl;Dr - boomers are a lost cause. But Gen Z I worry for.

Second, Similar to Gaza today, arab military infrastructures were always integrated with civilian infrastructures (basically villages were used as military bases). So arguing that Jews were just going around terrorizing civilians is problematic (just like saying today in Gaza that Israel is intentionally targetting civilians is dishonest at best). Third, I do agree that Lehi was a militia, but not Haganha. The Lehi was a group of extremists that participated in terror activity. The Haganah and Irgun were the predecessors to the IDF and were much more moderate. There was even an event in which Rabin had bombed and sank a ship bringing weapons to the Lehi to stop their war mongering activity. I do agree that it was a bad move after the 1948 to forgive the Lehi, and invite its leader Shamir to join the government (although I acknowledge that this was done to open a new page in jewish history that is more united). I do bring this up to state that Lehi activity did not represent the majority of jewish war activity, but was a small group of extremists (terrorists).
