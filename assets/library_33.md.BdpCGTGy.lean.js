I remember when we still did not have gay marriage, and the push was for LGB persons to be treated equally, the talk was that they were just the same as any straight couple and should be treated equally. The political climate at the time was about making sure there was equal opportunity for all people to access the institutions that the majority (i.e., straight white people) could rely on as well. This seemed fair, which is why the public eventially came around to support gay marriage after the Supreme Court ruled in its favor. I think if politics was handled the same as back then, trans issues wouldn't have become so toxic. Like, for example, the whole thing about pushing school policies in some school districts to not tell parents about their child questioning their gender identity. Basically, it keeps it secret from the student's own parents. Such policies assumed that all parents would be hostile to trans issues and that no parent had a right to know about their child's identity issues.The telling thing, is that if a straight cis student is having problems with bullying, or behavior problems, or is telling teachers and classmates that they're depressed and suicidal, the parents would be immediately informed and the expectation is that the parents would play a role in helping their own child.Progressive politics, for no good reason, decided to treat trans youth differently and, in the process, alienated a lot of parents while simultaneously not helping trans people. If anything, these kinds of policies were counterproductive and hurt trans rights overall.","title":"What drove Asian and Hispanic voters to the right in 2024"},{"text":"The sad part is how much money was spent on just putting this useless law into place.Way to tackle the real issues, you waste of oxygen.","title":"Mike Johnson institutes transgender bathroom ban for U.S. House"},{"text":"In the U.S.?there are currently no laws that prevent a male from using the women's bathrooms in a business establishment.","title":"Mike Johnson Announces Transgender Bathroom Ban In Capitol"},{"text":"They mostly don't have a 5th grade education.

Huge parts of Canada are uninhabitable but that doesnt make it acceptable for people to illegally immigrate to these places and settle there. Claiming none of the empires owned the land is essentially saying states cant own land unless they are indigenous which is absurd and unworkable. Also, it means essentially no one in Europe can own land if indigeneity is required. Certainly not most of Spain, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Eastern Europe, and the Nordics. The Turks also cant own any land. Indigeneity is a useless and confused standard for land ownership.What definition/understanding of indignity are you using here? And yes, slavery was bad but that doesnt mean we should ignore all legal conventions.Thats a straw-man. My argument is that we should not accept the consequences of bad laws. For example, before he was assassinated, Abraham Lincoln had planned on ceasing land owned by white farmers in the south to compensate freed slaves because of how the pro-slavery laws in the south impacted them and stopped them from owning property. In your squatters rights scenario, I would not expect to own it. It would be stupid to invest so much with no guarantee. It belongs to whoever owns it. Regardless, the land wasnt abandoned.

I don't see how you can put that on Harris.In fact, it's pretty telling that none of the other high profile Dems that get mentioned as alternatives to Harris attempted to challenge her after Biden's endorsement. I suspect those Dems saw the writing on the wall and knew this election was nearly impossible to win, and would rather see Harris be the sacrificial lamb than end their political career by losing to Donald Trump.","title":"Trumps cabinet picks are agents of his contempt, rage and vengeance."},{"text":"This isnt meant to be a generally applicable policy, its meant to punish Sarah McBride specifically for daring to be a trans person in public.?","title":"Speaker Mike Johnson bans trans people from all single-sex bathrooms at U.S. House"},{"text":" I struggle to see how his followers view him as a strong man\\nIt's because they're as immature as he is.","title":"Senate After Dark: Democrats foresee more late nights confirming Biden judges amid GOP delay tactics"},{"text":"When one is accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.","title":"Donald Trump has picked more white men called Doug than African Americans"},{"text":"These people are fucking sick.

[CHECK OUT THIS RECENT WARNING FROM CYBERSECURITY EXPERTS](https://substack.com/inbox/post/151721941)There are various event that occurred prior and during the 2024 election that are suspect and align with Spoonamores theory. I also find it suspicious with the rush to circumvent confirmation hearings for DOJ position who would likely oversee any investigation into possible hacking or covering up any evidence produced before warrants/indictments are filed. I also have a theory that may differ from Spoonamore. Instead of bullet ballots being casted to put Trump over the hand recount threshold, its possible that they were casted to keep Trump within that threshold so he could claim recounts. This would provide chaos, delay transition, and stoke his base that another election was stolen. Its odd that the ground works of election fraud was being laid before the election occurred by the Trump campaign and then all of that just disappeared and has been quiet since. Could this be the [MY AND MIKE JOHNSONS SECRET](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trump-secret-house-republicans-panic.html) plan that he alluded to? I also read somewhere, but cannot find the link atm, that its plausible that the House could put Trump in power while the Supreme Court rules on the contested election results. It just seems suspect and not normal.**I DO WANT TO HEED CAUTION TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS. Its possible this can be just a conspiracy theory. But I do think more scrutiny is needed if these numbers are true that Spoonamore provides. The only way to determine if fraud/hacking was involved is to do a recount in certain counties to see if timestamps match and ballots are present before being destroyed. And bringing this to attention will hopefully garner the actions needed to rule out this possibility.","title":"Republicans Were Ready to Torch Elon Musk for Blowing the Election.

In 2013, WWE inducted Mr Trump into its hall of fame.Ms McMahon herself made periodic cameos in the shows wild narratives and both her and Mr Trump have fallen victim to wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austens signature move: the stunner.On one occasion, she was smacked in the face by her daughter; in another segment, she was called a big-breasted beauty by a man who forcibly kissed her; and in one particularly graphic storyline, she pretended to be drugged in a wheelchair as her husband carried out an affair, before later kicking him in the crotch to roars of approval.Ive seen myself, on the very few times I was on TV with the WWE, she once told The New York Times. I knew I should stick to my day job.In 2009, she launched the first of two unsuccessful runs for the Senate, funded by $100 million of her own money.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/20/linda-mcmahon-trump-education-secretary-body-slammed-wwe/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/20/linda-mcmahon-trump-education-secretary-body-slammed-wwe/)","title":"Linda McMahon: Trump's education secretary was body-slammed by 7ft WWE wrestler"},{"text":"It's true but to be fair Stone Cold? did stun the whole McMahon familyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_7TZZhcg40","title":"Linda McMahon: Trump's education secretary was body-slammed by 7ft WWE wrestler"},{"text":"Republicans love their Sexual Abuse Scandals!","title":"Trumps Latest Cabinet Pick Is Also Mired in a Sexual Abuse Scandal"},{"text":"This will just further divide the country.","title":"Prominent Democrat John Fetterman endorses three of Trumps cabinet picks"},{"text":"Trump will blame china and his supporters will eat it up","title":"Walmart and Other Companies Say Trumps Tariffs Will Obviously Raise Prices"},{"text":"Not just acceptance, but enabling.","title":"The media and Trump: Not resistance, but not acceptance"},{"text":"Why are they implementing this new rule now?

The Turks also cant own any land. Indigeneity is a useless and confused standard for land ownership. And yes, slavery was bad but that doesnt mean we should ignore all legal conventions.

I reject this report in its entirety.Mr Fetterman also said Mr Trumps selection of Mr Rubio for Secretary of State was a strong choice.Unsurprisingly, the other teams pick will have political differences than my own, Mr Fetterman said.He added: That being said, my colleague @?SenMarcoRubio is a strong choice and I look forward to voting for his confirmation.Several Democrat Senators have approved of Mr Trumps appointment of Mr Rubio.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/20/democrat-john-fetterman-endorses-three-of-trumps-picks/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/20/democrat-john-fetterman-endorses-three-of-trumps-picks/)","title":"Prominent Democrat John Fetterman endorses three of Trumps cabinet picks"},{"text":"Here's to hoping those top generals have some very loyal followers who will side with them instead of Trump","title":"Absolutely Insane: Pentagon Officials on Trumps Military Deportation Plan"},{"text":"Sounds like a leopard's eating faces moment.

Not men.The two-page resolution, which covers bathrooms in the Capitol and House offices, would prohibit House members and staffers from using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.The move has been greeted with fervent support from Marjorie Taylor Greene, the outspoken Georgia congresswoman.Speaking to Steve Bannons War Room podcast, Ms Taylor Greene described transgender women being permitted in womens bathrooms as assault.Ms Mace has said she plans to introduce the amendment as part of the new Congress rules, which the house will vote on in January, or bring it to the floor as a standalone rule.I want to see which of my male colleagues dont support women up here.

Libel and slander don't directly harm you. They instead influence other people to cause that harm through their actions, and when that happens, we hold the slanderer responsible. We do this even when the damage is simply economic and only affects one person or legal entity, I guess would be the word for it. If somebody loses their job or a corporation loses money  because of some kind of slander or libel, you're held responsible. And libel and slander aren't cut-and-dry because what exactly is a lie? How do you tell the difference between parody that people end up believing and an outright lie? Or a joke, or a meme? If we really wanna get into the arbitrary, you can get into the world of child pornography. What is pornography exactly? Because you can take fully clothed pictures of children that could be considered porn and picture of naked children that aren't, such as when a mom takes a picture of her kid playing in the tub. \\"I know it when I see it\\" is a famous descriptor by a Supreme Court Justice describing what is and isn't hard-core pornography.**Counterpoint: Speech, even free speech, can cause great harm**Speech is powerful. I would say speech is the most powerful weapon known to mankind. People live, die, and kill over speech. Speech is the driver that influences governments, politicians, and militaries and civilians alike. We can use speech to direct weapons and the people who use them. There is a reason why it is the first amendment. It is because speech is so powerful that it must be regulated. You described a situation where someone set fire to a hotel of refugees simply because a politician's wife made a post about it. People have gone on killing sprees as a direct result of the words spewed from conservative demagogues. The lies told about Haitian immigrants resulted in bomb threats to schools. **Counterpoint: Where is the harm?**I mean that right now. Not hypothetically. There are already countries with hate speech laws that have had them for years, as you pointed out. Some of them don't even have first amendments.

You can talk about shops that are hobby for the non-working partner in an elite couple but they dynamics are completely different. They often only try to break even but they hang out with lawyers not other shop-owners and they think about the world very differently. The partner of a high-powered lawyer operating an ice-cream parlor is much less concerned about things that affect the parlor's profits than an ice cream parlor owner who depends on that for their livelihood. The smallholder class is often either rural white Americans or immigrants do not usually rub shoulders with the elite. Car-dealerships may be small-holders or owners depending on the size. A guy who owns a luxury car dealership that makes 300-400k a year is in the social elite. A guy making 100-150k in a used car dealership dealing with mostly working class clientele usually is not despite being wealthier than most white-collar workers.

The US is the 2nd largest agriculture exporter in the world, china being the #1 export market for the US agriculture industry. If tariffs are put on countries buying US products, that can impact pricing. For example, the tariffs Trump enacted that started a trade war w china in 2018 led to a huge loss for the pork industry causing the trump administration to pay out over $28 billion in farmer bailouts. Pork, soybean and corn industries were hit the hardest by these tariffs iirc. If this happens, we could potentially see a temporary dip in prices bc the agriculture industry is going to have to sell the existing products domestically where theres much less of a demand. But the problem is that the ag industry produces goods based on forecasting, and they will produce fewer products in the future causing the prices to go up domestically bc they will still need to hit their profit margins but now their export will be a much smaller percentage of their profits. It really will just depend on how and if the tariffs are implemented. And if they affect some export markets more than others. No way to say for sure until they officially announce the tariff details.

Trumps policies and rhetoric arent just authoritariantheyre a deliberate strategy to destabilize society in ways that make it easier for billionaires and corporations to tighten their grip on power and wealth. Heres how it works:**1. Distract with Division:**\\nCulture wars, fearmongering about marginalized groups, and relentless propaganda are all tools to keep us fighting each other instead of uniting against the real culprits: the oligarchs hoarding resources and rigging the system. While were busy debating bathrooms or immigration, theyre walking away with billions.\\n**2. Destroy Public Institutions:**\\nTrumps attacks on science, healthcare, and basic public services are designed to create distrust and dysfunction. When public institutions fail, people are forced to turn to private alternativescontrolled by the very billionaires who helped dismantle those systems. Its not just cruel; its profitable.\\n**3. Exploit Economic Instability:**\\nBy gutting regulations, cutting taxes for the wealthy, and allowing essential systems to crumble, the oligarchy creates an environment where only the richest can thrive. The rest of us are left scrambling for scraps, which makes it harder to organize, protest, or demand better. Billionaires thrive in chaos because they have the resources to weather itand profit from it.\\n**4. Silence Dissent:**\\nAuthoritarianism isnt just about controlling the governmentits about controlling the narrative. Trumps constant attacks on the media, coupled with his allies efforts to suppress voting and criminalize protest, are about consolidating power and ensuring the oligarchs face no accountability.\\n**5. Divide and Conquer:**\\nThe oligarchy doesnt need everyone to support themthey just need enough people to stay apathetic or divided. By using Trump as a figurehead to stoke rage and fear, they keep the public distracted while they tighten their grip on wealth and resources.In short, the oligarchs want this chaos because it protects their power.

At present their land force primarily consists of roughly a thousand Stryker pattern IFVs, which are modern and capable, and fit well with their logistical capabilities. There has been criticism of their tank fleet, but tanks arent really part of their doctrine, and what they do have for tanks were just a short term solution for the war in Afghanistan. \\n   \\nFor air power, they operate a fleet of 88 F18s. They are capable but old, but when real fights happen, those jets have historically punched way above their weight when it comes to bringing the pain. In Yugoslavia they dropped more bombs than anyone besides the US, and in Libya, they flew more than 900 attack missions. \\n   \\nThey are being replaced by 88 F35s, which will give Canada the fourth largest fifth generation fighter fleet in the world well into the mid 21st century. \\n    \\nNavy wise, they mostly rely on a fleet of 12 guided missile frigates. The ships themselves are old, but have all received modernizing refits. So they have highly modern NATO grade radar and fire control systems, and carry the RIM 162 surface to air missiles, as well as Harpoon Block II anti ship missiles, both of which have only been in service for about a decade. \\n    \\nA new fleet of fifteen River class guided missile destroyers are currently under construction to replace them. They are roughly twice the size of the ships they are replacing, and carry new goodies like Tomahawk and SM3 missiles, which can shoot down satellites. But perhaps the most interesting feature of these new ships is their radar. \\n   \\nIn order to target satellites and ballistic missiles, the US uses AN/SPY-7 ground based radar systems located in Hawaii and Alaska. Data from them is then transferred to weapons platforms (ships or aircraft) which fire the missiles. For the new River class, they are putting that ground based system on the ships, meaning that when they enter service, they will likely be the only weapons platform in the world capable of both targeting and shooting down satellites. \\n    \\nBasic summary - the Canadian military is fairly capable but with major shortcomings. However, when all the new gear they have ordered arrives, they will be quite impressive and highly capable.","title":"'Europe and Canada Must Forget Trump and Form a Coalition of the Willing to Defend Ukraine'"},{"text":"Lol.

Hes also taken digs at two more centrist GOP senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, and described the entire conference as part of the captured class.Theyre part of the uniparty. Not all of them, there are a few good ones, Hegseth told conservative radio host Mark Levin in April, describing Republican senators with a term used on the right to argue that both parties establishments are similar.They are far more happy dealing with Democrats and running up the national debt and playing inside-the-Beltway games than they are putting the country first and putting a stake in the ground for what they believe in, he added.Theres little chance Hegseth knew then that he would have to face the targets of his criticism in a confirmation hearing or on the Senate floor.

Absolutism is a lack of complexity that makes us unable to see the world for what it is. Whenever speech is restricted in any way, the first thing you hear from a free speech absolutist is a slippery slope argument. If you restrain Nazis from speaking in Charlottesville, how do we defend against a slippery slope into more and more and more government restrictions? But if you're worried about the slippery slope that comes from restricting Nazi speech, why aren't you worried about the slippery slope that comes from letting Nazis speak??There's an inherent tension between the 1st and 14th Amendment, giving citizens the right to participate fully in democracy. ?So if you consider freedom of speech, you can see how strengthening one person's speech rights can actually limit someone else's ability to participate fully in democracy, if someone's speech terrorizes someone else into silence. For instance in the 1970s, as more and more women started to enter the workplace, their male co-workers were often hostile or outright intimidating. This is the tension between the 1st and 14th Amendments, between the right to speech and the right to full public participation. Here, the right of the male co-workers to sexually harass the women in their workplace, which is speech after all, and the rights of those women to fully participate in the workplace. In 1986, the Supreme Court made a decisive turn away from a free speech absolutist position in the case of Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson. The court declared unanimously that creating a hostile work environment for women was not protected speech.??It's not just a workplace issue. If you're an African-American intending to vote and people are holding up signs outside your polling place saying, 'I know where you live.' Those signs are speech but they're speech that is designed to diminish your full participation in our democracy.","title":"CMV: \\"Hate speech\\" deserves the same legal protection as all forms of free speech"},{"text":"Well many wont be deported and may be pressed into labor.","title":"Absolutely Insane: Pentagon Officials on Trumps Military Deportation Plan"},{"text":"Youd be surprised.

I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. Theyve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.** They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they dont want: They dont want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They dont want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. Theyre not interested in that. That doesnt help them. Thats against their interests. Thats right. They dont want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly theyre getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They dont want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now theyre coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? Theyll get it. Theyll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you aint in it. You and I are not in the big club. And by the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. **The table is tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care.

They dont give a fuck about you. They dont give a fuck about you. They don't care about you at all -- at all -- at all. And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on; the fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes everyday.

Free speech matters precisely because it protects unpopular or distasteful ideas, not just the ones we agree with.Ok, but we already opened the door to suppression of certain types of lies and fraud.I'm more interested in the concept of harassment though as hate speech often falls under this category. Harassment is often restricted as well...usually for repeated, disruptive or threatening speech. You have the right to free speech, but you don't have the right to stop other people from exercising their free speech (note that this does not mean you are required to host speech). Speech can be easily weaponized to suppress or disrupt other people's speech...for example students protesting/harassing/interrupting guests at a debate, intimidation against a witness in court, playing really loud music at a veteran's funeral or outside of someone's house at night, etc. These are all technically types of speech, but they are intended to disrupt or suppress other people's speech. Hate speech (racial slurs etc) are often characterized as simply a difference of opinion, but that is dishonest. In many if not most cases, these are words meant to intimidate and belittle people, to drive them away from the public or to dissuade them from speaking freely. I don't think the answer is to necessarily ban words with criminal penalties, but I also think we need to recognize that hate speech is sometimes a form of harassment and intimidation. And often, the pushback from the \\"free-speech\\" advocates is actually even worse or more restrictive. Like attempts to ban certain books, attempts to ban racial sensitivity training for employees, attempts to ban business rules or policies on pronouns, etc.","title":"CMV: \\"Hate speech\\" deserves the same legal protection as all forms of free speech"},{"text":"Im surprised he resigned.

No shit. I dont like Trump one bit, hes horrible. I think Democrats ran a fine campaign but people are enchanted with populism and we need to figure out how to beat it. That is my overall point.My overall point is also fueled because this site is likely being manipulated by people who want to keep us divided.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has discouraged the release of a House Ethics Report investigation covering similar ground, raising questions about how much information senators will have access to as they weigh whether Gaetz should have the position.  The House Ethics Committee is expected to meet Wednesday to consider releasing the report.\\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) and the other Senate Democrats on the committee requested the evidentiary file on Gaetzs alleged sex trafficking in a letter to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray on Wednesday. That would include interviews with a woman who said she was paid to have sex with Gaetz when she was 17. Gaetz has strongly denied the accusations, and the Justice Department did not bring charges against him. The Justice Department generally does not hand over to Congress sensitive case information in ongoing or closed investigations. The sex trafficking investigation would be likely to come up in a background check of Gaetz that the FBI would conduct ahead of the Senate confirmation process. The FBI typically summarizes aspects of the investigations to the committee. The type and amount of information that the FBI would find relevant to provide could vary.","title":"Senate Democrats request Matt Gaetz case files from the FBI"},{"text":"Honestly it's almost impressive how badly they want to hate everything.","title":"Mike Johnson institutes transgender bathroom ban for U.S. House"},{"text":"Sad, because I don't know if this is a joke or not","title":"Breaking News: Trump nominates Paula Deen as Chairman of the NAACP."},{"text":"One of the most upsetting things for me about Harris not winning the election was knowing Trump would get away with everything and never pay for any of his crimes.I was so mad I was doing the Chihuahua shake with rage.More than likely our spineless justice system will dismiss the case.

These include plans for the largest deportation in history C a promise also made by Trump C and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.A key part of Project 2025s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of whats necessary to take control of these bureaucracies, Vought said, And we are working doggedly on that, whether its destroying their agencys notion of independence  theyre independent from the President  whether its bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment  the ability to not spend money  whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former bosss disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position were at, he said. The relationships will be there. The trust level will be there.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.","title":"Trumps Onetime Favorite Newspaper Tells Him to Ditch Gabbard and Gaetz"},{"text":"That spot is currently being contested by Chef Boyardee, the Swedish Chef, and some guy named Gordon somebody.","title":"Trump chooses TV doctor Mehmet Oz to lead Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services"},{"text":"It must be so amazing to be so scared","title":"Mike Johnson Announces Transgender Bathroom Ban In Capitol"},{"text":"If hes not the worst hes easily in the bottom 3.

This is performative, cowardly hatred.E: As multiple replies have pointed out, there have been trans staffers and other employees in the Capitol before this election, and they would be harmed by this rule as well. I should have been more specific that this ban *targets* one specific representative-elect, Sarah McBride. Nancy Mace, who proposed this ban, has said so explicitly.E2: In an effort to stem the flood of replies, Im going to add my response to the most common comments here. Make no mistake; this ban is the thin end of a wedge. Republicans underlying goal here is to punish and denigrate anyone who deviates from extremely rigid, traditional gender roles. This will not be limited to just trans people. Anyone who looks androgynous or who acts outside of their prescribed role (women who live and work independently or dont wear skirts, stay-at-home dads, gay/bi people, etc) is going to be the immediate next target of this type of ban. If you act in a way that conservatives think is inappropriate for the sex they assume you to be, theyll aim make your life worse until you cave and conform. If the fact that this is openly hateful towards a minority population who already have it incredibly rough (due to all the ways Republicans keep trying to kill them) somehow isnt enough, you should oppose this ban on the grounds that it is *also* a step towards overturning womens suffrage, gay rights, and all the progress weve made as a society in the past seventy years.E3: Should have also mentioned this sooner, but no, the answer isnt to accuse cis people of being trans to get them hurt by this ban as well. All youre doing by suggesting that is harming the trans people you claim to be defending. Nobodys gender identity is up for public debate. Saying that its fine to investigate someones gender just because you dont like them is playing into exactly the kind of rigid gender roles nonsense Republicans want, *and* it signals to trans people that your acceptance of their identity is conditional on your personal approval of their actions. **Knock it off.**","title":"Mike Johnson institutes transgender bathroom ban for U.S. House"},{"text":"A+ headline","title":"Rapist Supporters MTG and Nancy Mace Accuse Trans Colleague of Assault | \\nMarjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace have a bonkers definition of what constitutes assault."},{"text":"These are all very biden-esque policies and on top of that, the messaging from the democratic party HEAVILY leaned on \\"we're not trump.\\" In addition to that, those policies are very light/moderate.

The key is that they have no intention of working or defining their economic role as a barista in the long-term and understand how to navigate the social conventions of elite society. The social class of someone in their early 20s doesn't have much to do with their economic class. They maybe making less than a more experienced barista who is set on being a barista for life but they do not belong to the same social class. If your actual career is to be a barista you are part of the servant class. The servant class is expected to understand elite conventions enough to be pleasant and inoffensive to interact with. However it's not the same as being social equals. An adjunct professor making 40k could easily meet his old college friends making 500k on Wall Street and be completely accepted. The elite would not be mad if their kid was working as a professor either, or even a modestly successful artistic. A barista is not a job the elite would ever want to see their kids doing at 30.

Economists loved her plan, thats great, but when she tells us all that were really doing better than we think we are, that undercuts everything that comes after it. Oh economists agree that were all doing fine? Guess theyre all out of touch too. Thats the big takeaway for a lot of folks.The economy was the most important issue. Im not saying that your hypothetical wouldnt have made things a little different, but gender and LGBTQ+ issues simply arent big enough to overcome the fact that people are having a hard time paying their bills.

He and his administration did a lot of good things, but the Democratic establishment adjusted and took a lot of leadership positions that stunted real change.There is a lot to be said about how Republicans blocked everything just for the sake of blocking things and blaming things on Democrats. It should take a lot of blame, however the Obama administration should have went harder after Wall Street after the Great Recession. Occupy Wall Street was a movement of anger and angst of the populace about how there is no accountability for the people that are playing with real people's lives with no repercussions. Only the progressives like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, AOC and others not only understood the movement and the frustration of Americans, but that is how they seized political power.Establishment Democrats that were in control of Washington swept everything under the carpet and ignored the movement in totality, well.. to be fair they did help demonize and de-legitimize the movement. That only sowed more anger and frustration and helped shift their voters, Obama voters, to either being apathetic and not participating in elections or to MAGA looking for any alternative to bring real change to the system.The problem is that MAGA may seem like the solution to their problem because they are all angry about the same thing, but the people in charge of MAGA are playing them all as fools for more power and more money.

There needs to be more pressure on a two state solution, but neither Trump, nor the current admin have been good at pushing that agenda.Maybe you need to stop being outraged on the Internet and think more critically.","title":"Trumps Cabinet Of Men Accused Of Sexual Misconduct"},{"text":"The best thing I can say about the Trump wall is that at least the sections near me are better looking than the wall that they tore down and replaced.","title":"Texas offers Starr County ranch to Trump for mass deportation plans"},{"text":"In his dreams, thoughts, and prayers.","title":"Absolutely Insane: Pentagon Officials on Trumps Military Deportation Plan"},{"text":"A great deal?

The now-former Florida repersentatives exit from the House stripped the committee of the power to discipline him, and Republican leadership has argued the report should no longer be made public. Trump, meanwhile, has reportedly been directly lobbying Republican senators to confirm his problematic pick to lead the Justice Department. Those efforts have reportedly not gone well, but when the president-elect was asked whether he was reconsidering his pick, he simply replied, No.Gaetz  who was also the subject of a federal investigation that ultimately did not lead to an indictment  has vehemently denied all of the claims against him. This doesnt mean there arent reports, court filings, and testimony suggesting theres something to the claims, which are concerning regardless of whether the Ethics Committees report sees the light of day.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/matt-gaetz-alleged-sex-crimes-explained-1235173669/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/matt-gaetz-alleged-sex-crimes-explained-1235173669/)","title":"Matt Gaetzs Alleged Sex Crimes, Explained"},{"text":"People in London county getting their feathers ruffled by CRT was a pretty big factor.

The latest straw theyve grasped on to is the claim that it would cost the US government $88 billion per year to arrest, detain, process, and remove one million removable aliens.This is a wrong-headed approach for two reasons.First and foremost, you cant put a price on the safety and well-being of the American people.?[The Lefts attempt to make deportation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/10/the-woman-at-the-top-of-donald-trump-mass-deportation-list/)?about money shows how out of touch they are, which is one of the reasons they were beaten so handily by President Trump earlier this month.The second reason is that any serious discussion about the monetary cost of deportation must be had in the context of the cost of mass migration, and thats not something the Left wants to talk about.Let me explain. While the Lefts $88 billion figure is merely an estimate, the Right can point to billions and billions of dollars that the Biden-Harris administration has already spent to entice and resettle migrants and give them handouts. States and localities, who are shouldering the bulk of the burden of the open-borders status quo, are also suffering.Consider, for example, that, from fiscal year 2021 through FY2024, the State Department received approximately $22 billion for migration and refugee assistance.These funds were used to: address mass migration operations abroad; deal with the fall-out from the?[reckless Afghanistan withdrawal,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/17/trump-team-wants-military-chiefs-trial-afghanistan-withdraw/)?including bringing unvetted Afghans directly to the US; resettle Ukrainians in the US; build processing centres (Safe Mobility Offices) in Central America to process and facilitate mass migration to the US; and pay the likes of UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration, and other NGOs, which similarly have facilitated mass migration to the US, including by giving pre-paid debit cards to migrants in Central America.Or consider that, from FY2021-FY2024, Congress funded the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) approximately $31 billion to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services, including wrap-around services, such as housing, medical, and legal services, for aliens and unaccompanied alien children. Indeed, during the Biden administration, a historic 535,000 unaccompanied children were enticed to cross the border by the statutory promise of immigration benefits and impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas public statements that unaccompanied children would not be turned away. ?The result was disastrous. As reported in the?*New York Times*, HHS farmed these children out to unvetted sponsors. Today, HHS has reported that it has lost touch with over 300,000 unaccompanied children. ?Or consider that, from FY2021-FY2024, FEMA C an agency designed to help American citizens suffering from natural disasters C received $2.2 billion for shelter and other services for inadmissible aliens.The above $55 billion dollars are only a subset of the unknown total spent on Biden-Harris open border agenda. There are countless other examples. Numerous other programmes, agencies, and funds contributed money to the administrations opaque open borders operations. To put it simply, the Biden-Harris administration has been awash in money and used it to achieve terrible results for America.States and localities have also paid dearly to provide shelter, food, medical care, public education, and welfare for the millions who unlawfully entered the US these past four years. New York City has spent over $5.5 billion during this crisis. Massachusetts has already spent $1 billion on housing illegal aliens and is expected to pay another $1.8 billion through 2026. Denver spent $340 million over 18 months.These numbers are repeated across the country. And each year these millions of inadmissible aliens stay in the US, these costs multiply. Of course, the value of American?[lives lost to fentanyl poisoning](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/09/30/san-francisco-fentanyl-drugs-addiction-deaths-bill-ab-816/), criminal aliens, and gang members let into the country cannot be quantified. ?As President Trumps team fulfils his promise to the American people in the coming days and months, the open-borders Left will make every argument it can to stop them. But in every case, those arguments will fail. Mass deportation is fiscally responsible, morally just, and politically popular. It is time to give the American people what they want and deserve,\\" writes Lora Ries.","title":"'Donald Trumps mass deportation plans will save America billions'"},{"text":"It is just so, so racist to assert that empiricism and rationality are Western constructs.
