We'll be happy to welcome you aboard, but you should have a better understanding of the principles first.* Deportation - We've been overrun  with illegal immigration. NO ONE is opposed to legal immigrants that go through the process and become citizens. Illegals have jumped the borders by the millions, draining resources (health care, unemployment, housing, etc.) away from our own citizens. Illegals are being housed in 5-star hotels while our veterans are living on the street. They're being provided EBT cards while our inner cities are begging for food. Additionally we're getting the worst of the worst in a lot of cases - criminals, rapists, murderers, gang members. Our citizens deserve better.\\n* DEI - Equal opportunity is the motto of our country. DEI is equal outcome regardless of ability. It tells minorities that they're entitled to something whether they're qualified or not. It also tells them we don't believe they're capable on their own without a handout from the white guy. Frankly, it's insulting and demeaning.\\n* Drug dealers shouldn't be executed, that's ridiculous. However, if some illegal violent gang member kills one of our citizens that should be a one-way ticket to the chair. Is it extreme? Hey if they don't like it don't kill people or better yet, stay home.\\n* Tax cuts should and will be for everyone. The founding fathers of this nation staged a revolution over a 4% tax on tea. Today we're taxed at 50% of our income and the elites act like we should be thankful for it. And where does all this tax money go? The Ukraine gangsters, subsidies for green projects that go nowhere, oh and handouts to illegal immigrants. We would like to keep our own money thanks, and if you're going to spend it, spend it here.\\n* Your lower class statement is just silly. In the 50s the average black family looked no different than anyone else - mom, dad, kids, school, etc. Then LBJ and the southern democrats came along and screwed them good. Now you have generations that don't know anything but public support. They deserve better.Now, if you're on board with that jump on the train.","title":"I give in - the nation is yours."},{"text":"America has double standard where Democrats should always act at a higher level whereas Republicans or Trump are allowed not to concede the election.","title":"Harris calls Trump to concede election loss"},{"text":"\\"wait, I'm going to get deported?\\"","title":"Tim Walz loses home county to Trump"},{"text":"As a person who canvassed, phone banked, donated and voted for Harris...it's everything you just mentioned that I used as reasons for electing her.

Even if he doesn't end up winning Nevada and Arizona, and if Michigan were to also flip via recount (on top of WI), he'd *still* be at 270 on the dot.This election was decided by Pennsylvania (and Georgia), which is much further out of reach than WI (1.97% spread vs. 0.88%).","title":"Harris to concede defeat to Trump in evening speech, sources say"},{"text":"And by viewers like you","title":"Trumps return to power raises serious questions about the medias credibility"},{"text":"The polls didn't have the massive disparities we're seeing though.

Far from reducing inflation, this act has been a catalyst for its increase. Here is a quick break down on why;* Misleading Name: The Inflation Reduction Act, by its very name, promised relief from rising prices, but in practice, it has done the opposite. It's a classic case of government spending exacerbating the very issue it claims to resolve.* Inflationary Policies: This act has injected billions into the economy, not through targeted, inflation-neutral investments but through broad spending that has significantly increased demand. When demand outstrips supply, as it has in the post-COVID economy, prices inevitably rise. The act's push for green energy, while noble, doesn't immediately increase supply, especially when global supply chains are already stretched thin.* Hidden Costs and Future Liabilities: Critics like Senator Rand Paul have pointed out that this act hides costs, particularly in healthcare. By subsidizing certain costs, like Medicare drug prices, it might give the illusion of cost reduction, but in reality, it lead to higher premiums, further straining consumer wallets already hit by inflation.\\n* Ignoring Economic Fundamentals: The act overlooks fundamental economic principles. By increasing public debt without corresponding productivity increases, it caused inflation to sky rocket. The spending spree on domestic manufacturing and renewable energy have not yielded immediate economic benefits, leaving us with higher inflation now and potentially more debt later.* Political and Economic Misstep: This piece of legislation has become emblematic of a broader criticism: that policy makers are out of touch with economic realities. Instead of addressing core issues like supply chain inefficiencies, labor shortages, or monetary policy, the act has arguably contributed to the inflation problem by flooding the economy with cash that doesn't match with real economic growth.In this light, Kamala Harris's vote for the Inflation Reduction Act is seen not as a step towards economic recovery but as a misstep that has contributed to the financial burden on American families, making everyday goods and services more expensive and less accessible.As for how Trump will fix this I guess we will see.","title":"Trump wins Pennsylvania, securing the biggest battleground state"},{"text":"Volunteer for Tennessee Dems!https://www.mobilize.us/civictn/ https://secure.ngpvan.com/li-NqrhvSkqqS6_CxKHj7w2  \\nDonate to Tennessee Dems!https://secure.actblue.com/donate/everydemocrat","title":"Republican supermajority unchanged in Tennessee Statehouse but Democrats don't give up ground"},{"text":"Musk said he plans on crashing the economy and that people will have to expect some pain for a temporary period of time.?","title":"Hispanic men helped propel Donald Trump back to the White House"},{"text":"You either die a villain or live long enough to see yourself become the hero.

The draconian policy package prepared by The Heritage Foundation in preparation for a second Trump administration was so extremist that in the final months of the campaign the former president took great pains to publicly distance himself from the project. Its contents, which include a broad expansion of executive powers; a de facto national abortion ban, increased restrictions on contraception; brutal policies against undocumented migrants; and the elimination of several federal agencies (including the Department of Education), didnt sit well with prospective voters.Trump feigned ignorance of the plan, despite his close ties to those involved in crafting it, while Democrats did all they could to warn about the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term.Sure enough, less than 24 hours after the election was called for Trump, his allies, advisers, and prominent supporters were celebrating the now-open road to Project 2025s implementation. On Wednesday, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon  who just weeks ago completed a four-month prison sentence on a contempt of Congress conviction - lauded Christian Nationalist Matt Walsh, a commentator at The Daily Wire, on his War Room broadcast. Walsh had written on X, formerly Twitter: Now that the election is over I think we can finally say that yeah actually Project 2025 is the agenda. Lol Matt Walsh, I think, is a very smart and funny guy, Bannon said.

But its not like she sold out to win conservatives.But I think the biggest thing was just that people blamed Biden for inflation.Edit: looking through the ideology numbers, from 2020 to 2024, there was a 1 point decrease in liberal turnout, a 4 point increase in moderate turnout and a 4 point decrease in conservative turnout (with some rounding, I guess).Had she received Bidens 2020 level of support among each group but with 2024s turnout, she wouldve received 52.1% of the vote, a little better than Biden.","title":"Can we be finished, now, with the idea that the 'sane republicans' are going to save us?"},{"text":"It's funny how Trump attacked Biden so hard for being old, yet Trump is older now than Biden was when he ran for president in 2020.","title":"Trump wins the presidential election.

There are other parties supporting Ukraine and those who stand against Ukraine. But I hope for their common sense and they will continue to help.But sources in Kyiv on Wednesday told The Telegraph they thought?[Trump might appoint an envoy](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/06/trump-victory-proves-europe-must-stand-on-its-own-two-feet/)?to broker between Ukraine and Russia before the end of this month, and talks could be underway by December.He has been vague on how he would achieve that deal.JD Vance, his running mate, has suggested that Ukraine should give up both occupied territory and military ambitions to join Nato in exchange for establishing a ceasefire.That will be difficult for Ukraine to accept, and it is not obvious Russia would be interested in settling for the current lines when it seems to be taking more and more land.# The Middle EastAt first blush, Trump has a straightforward attitude towards the Middle East crisis.At an event dedicated to combating anti-Semitisim during the election, he vowed to ban refugees from?[terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/01/28/trump-middle-east-deal-two-state-solution-no-good-one-side-doesnt/)?and said: If I dont win, I believe Israel will be eliminated.Amit Segal, a commentator on Israels Channel 12, said: In Israel in general, and in Netanyahus office in particular, Trumps victory is met with great relief.The confrontation with the Democratic administration, which escalated to threats of a weapons embargo, is now replaced by two leaders who were both?[targets of Iranian assassination attempts](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/09/25/donald-trump-iran-assassination-threats-campaign/)?this year, he added.This doesnt mean that Trump will attack Iran, but it does mean that he and Israel understand exactly where the octopus head is and what needs to be done about its arms.US security services briefed Trump on a foiled suspected Iranian assassination plan in September. An Israeli man was arrested the same month on suspicion of working with Iran on a plan to kill Benjamin Netanyahu.But Trump has also criticised how long the war in Gaza is taking. In April he urged Israel: [Youve got to get it over with](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/12/how-israel-invaded-lebanon-map-hezbollah-middle-east/), and you have to get back to normalcy.He thanked Arab-American and Muslim voters who supported him because they believed he would bring peace to the region.On Wednesday, Hamas urged Trump to learn from Bidens mistakes in trying to broker a ceasefire.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/06/donald-trump-ukraine-china-middle-east/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/06/donald-trump-ukraine-china-middle-east/)","title":"What a Trump victory means for the world"},{"text":"This is what you voted for America.

His actual name is Wilhelm Heinrich Sebastian Von Troomp, but for the sake of simplicity he chooses to go by his title of Baron Trump.The young fellow embarks on time travelling adventures through human history. Through his travels, he meets societies of people and tribes from long ago, picking up aspects of their language and social customs. Accompanied by his faithful and protective companion hound Bulger, the young Baron navigates a variety of adventures and surmounts many obstacles.The final book in this volume discusses the rise of a US President and has been variously described as either coincidental or prescient of aspects of the 21st century political climate. Set in an America torn by division and dissent, there are references to a hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York, and an election of an outsider candidate ensuing in a chaotic atmosphere.Ingersoll Lockwood was an author of many childrens books and short stories.

The narrative is that the Republicans were so upset at Obamas win that they did everything they could to undermine him as a president. But thats not the whole story. Obamas victory over Hillary Clinton was not in the Democratic establishments playbook. They were never behind Obama and viewed him as a detour to their agenda. Obama decided to take the highroad and work with the Democratic establishment however, he never fundamentally changed their DNA. Hillary was not a good candidate for president, but the Democrats pushed her in after Obamas two terms even though Biden, as we saw last election cycle was a better candidate to beat somebody like Trump. Biden obviously wanted to run in 2016 but was convinced not to. Instead, they pushed Hillary through the primary process, even though Bernie Sanders was threatening her a second time in the primary, and she eventually lost to Trump because frankly, she was not a good candidate and underestimated Trumps appeal. After Trumps win instead of taking a look in the mirror and finding ways to develop and support new leaders to take over the party, the Democrats doubled down and through a beat Trump at all costs strategy ended up going with Biden and shutting down his primary contenders, but it was only a short term fix to an identity crisis that has been ongoing for over 15 years. Biden was clearly incapacitated during the second half of his term and yet the Democratic establishment somehow believed that we could all just pretend that everything was OK. By the time he relented and turned the campaign over to Kamala. Trump had already had too much of a Headstart.Contrast this to what Trump has done since 2016. He has basically dismantled the entire Republican establishment, one opponent at a time he has remade the Republican Party in his own image and dispatched with any challengers seeking to maintain the old order. He has used a strategy of opportunism to form allies with anyone willing to trade their influence for potential power, and the advancement of their agenda. For some such as conservative evangelicals, this has turned out to be a winning strategy as they were able to overturn Roe v. Wade. For others, such as the myriad of establishment Republicans who sought and failed  to influence him to fall in line with their particular visions for the party and the country weather by joining his cabinet or campaigning for him they quickly learned that the same Trump, who would flatter and pledge allegiance to them one day the next day would completely destroy them if they found themselves to be a threat to him. Because Trump is an opportunist and is not beholden to establishment Republican ideology he was able to reach out to unconventional allies, such as Elon Musk and RFK Junior and Tulsi Gabbard. This was something that Democrats did not have the flexibility or the stomach to do and I believe that this was a fatal Mistake in their strategy. RFK even admitted that he reached out to the Harris campaign to see if they could work something out and they refused to even have a conversation. That plus the Harris campaigns refusal to have conversations on non-traditional, but ever growing platforms such as Joe Rogan and others was laughably shortsighted. Why would you turn down an interview that will be seen by tens of millions of people days before the campaign? This signaled weakness and fear.All this to say, the Democratic Party needs to spend as little time as possible blaming this loss on racism and misogyny and stupid people, and ask themselves some very hard questions regarding the future of their party because they are no longer fighting a monolithic republican party, but a party that has expanded its base to include Young people non-interventionists and a growing amount of minorities.","title":"Harris Calls Trump to Congratulate Him on Win"},{"text":"You know OP is right.

Today, there is no they, only we. We cling to that illusion of division like its the last life raft, pretending were not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Arent we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, The war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it. (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). Its hard to pretend were separate when were all in the same sinking boat.At some point, we sold our future for pocket changesacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like weve won. And yet, most dont see how deep Project 2025 and those innocent tariffs will cut into their lives. Weve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, were too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, We are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice. (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.If this is MAGAs promised land, then surebring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me thats about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can save the economy while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorablelike watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means theyre invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, Markets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional. (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).When the reckoning comes, at least well have the privilege of saying, we told you so. Not that itll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though theyve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame the others when theyre the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacleif it werent so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, Blaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess. (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).This countrys moral compass is so broken, its practically a modern art piece. Were hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned itevery dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, The problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up. (Zinn, A Peoples History of the United States, 1980).  ?","title":"Opinion: Trump wins 2024 election.

The Western depopulation agenda (NSM 200, Jafe memo, the \\"overpopulation\\" issue being quietly shelved with the last UN conference on it taking place in the 1990s, Club of Rome in the 1990s declaring humanity to be the enemy, anti-natalism pushed in corporate media, etc.)2. A significant segment of the ruling class, especially among establishment \\"liberals\\", favors eugenics (dig into \\"effective alturism\\", for example, and you'll find an underlying eugenics agenda)3. The post-Occupy \\"woke\\" cooption of progressivism much more aggressively promotes lifestyles less likely to lead to reproduction while demonstrating the threat, to the non-\\"woke\\", of a society decoupled from traditionThe ruling class in many societies, whether \\"capitalist\\" or \\"communist\\", are willing to kill very large numbers of fellow humans to advance their agendas. And the ruling class pretty much universally have little regard for what the Nazis deemed \\"useless eaters\\". Ergo a depopulation agenda with a eugenics strategy of some sort (either \\"positive\\", to breed a strong society that can conquer others, or \\"negative\\", to breed a weak society that can be more easily controlled) shouldn't come as a big surprise.Aldous Huxley got a lot right in \\"Brave New World\\" about the future we were headed towards. His father was notably the president of the UK Eugenics Society. Planned Parenthood, as many know, originated from eugenics ideology. If you read old issues of \\"Birth Control\\" there's some wild shit in there (including talk of putting the disabled into camps). And the US, as most know, took in lots of Nazi scientists after WWII.Most people don't know about the contamination, for nearly a decade (over the 1950s and 1960s), of the police vaccine with cancer-causing SV40. If the mRNA \\"vaccine\\", concocted over a weekend supposedly, was meant to cull with plausible deniability, as part of the depopulation agenda and aligned with a eugenics strategy, it wouldn't be that shocking given human history.

It shows women aged 18-29 going from a +32 Democratic group in 2020 to +18 Democratic group in 2024. Meanwhile, men aged 18-29 have gone from +15 Democratic to +13 Republican (!) over the same period.Teen and twentysomething men voting Republican isnt some alien phenomenon. Remember?[Alex P. Keaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_P._Keaton)? But Barack Obama was so popular among Millennials that anyone who came of age politically during the late Aughties / early 2010s could be forgiven for thinking young people would always be hopey-changey progressives.Thats clearly not the case now. But why? I have to think that identity-politics backlash, diminished economic prospects (post-Great Recession, post-pandemic) and ever-more-algorithmic online echo chambers (like Elon Musks X) all have something to do with it. Also, Trump has been the dominant gravitational force in U.S. politics for nearly 10 years now.

Trump got 3 million less votes than he did in 2020, that to me is not an emphatic embrace of republican ideas as some people are suggesting. A bigger issue here for the left is the Dems losing ~15 million votes from 2020. What do those voters want that they aren't getting? The right, obviously, champion their own ideals stating that the Dems are too radical and too liberal. But I just don't think you can say that with any certainty. Nothing I've seen supports that statement. I think democrats, read Obama &amp; Biden, keep getting elected on seriously progressive mandates. People are begging for them to actually introduce progressive legislation. Legislation that will really change lives and really change US policies. And then they just... Don't... And, invariably, when they don't, voters get apathetic and then don't turn up for subsequent elections (see 2024...).Perhaps I'm wrong. I could be reading the room incorrectly.

Legal scholars have identified this lack of legal framework as contributing to womens economic and physical insecurities. By situating political and legal institutions only in the public sphere, the state created a society where crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual assault are some of the least reported offences today. Historically, physical and sexual violence against women were considered a right reserved for men. Violence was normalized and not legally considered a form of abuse.https://chicagopolicyreview.org/2022/07/07/is-the-us-still-too-patriarchal-to-talk-about-women-the-silent-epidemic-of-femicide-in-america/","title":"Donald Trump and Olympics on collision course over transgender ban vow"},{"text":"I hope everyone is enjoying gloating in these threads, when Trump still has not conceded his loss 4 years later.Hey, at least you don't need flairs and won't get perma-banned here though for the slightest disagreement, right?","title":"Harris Calls Trump to Congratulate Him on Win"},{"text":"I don't really see how that makes any difference (and would have been a stupid decision to boot given the current Senate makeup).

Here is something a friend sent that I find helpful: By Rebecca Solnit,They want you to feel powerless and to surrender and to let them trample everything and you are not going to let them. You are not giving up, and neither am I. The fact that we cannot save everything does not mean we cannot save anything and everything we can save is worth saving.  You may need to grieve or scream or take time off, but you have a role no matter what, and right now good friends and good principles are worth gathering in. Remember what you love. Remember what loves you. Remember in this tide of hate what love is. The pain you feel is because of what you love. The Wobblies used to say dont mourn, organize, but you can do both at once and you dont have to organize right away in this moment of furious mourning. You can be heartbroken or furious or both at once; you can scream in your car or on a cliff; you can also get up tomorrow and water the flowerpots and call someone whos upset and check your equipment for going onward. A lot of us are going to come under direct attack, and a lot of us are going to resist by building solidarity and sanctuary. Gather up your resources, the metaphysical ones that are heart and soul and care, as well as the practical ones. People kept the faith in the dictatorships of South America in the 1970s and 1980s, in the East Bloc countries and the USSR, women are protesting right now in Iran and people there are writing poetry. There is no alternative to persevering, and that does not require you to feel good. You can keep walking whether its sunny or raining.

He later went to the protest to clean graffiti, try to put out fires, protect local business, offer medical assistance to protesters, etc. All in a place he was at already and had close ties to.

In four years she would be the incumbent and the Democrats would be somewhat obligated to keep her as their candidate. Lets say she serves two terms. History shows us that the White House typically turns over to the other party after two terms. That would mean the Republicans could be in office for two additional terms before the Democrats get it back again. In the scenario, Newsom would not potentially become president for 16 years and might even lose against a Republican eight years from now.Again, this is only my conspiracy theory, but it does make sense.

People are unaware that Covid is still a very serious threat, just a different kind at this point in time: the threat isn't death, it's disability. Covid should be viewed as a toxin akin to cigarette smoking  it (likely) won't kill you if you get it a few times, but it does serious damage to practically every organ in the body. The neurological effects are so severe that a recent studied indicated driving with Covid is equivalent to driving at around the legal BAC limit. A single bout of mild Covid leads to the equivalent of ~7 years of brain aging and a 3-point IQ loss. If that effect is cumulative (and there's no reason to think it's not), then that means that after 3 Covid infections (which is not unusual), IQ would drop 9 points. I would imagine there is a limit as to how much Covid can harm IQ, but that's just speculation. A 9-point IQ drop can put some people in the lower end of normal into the intellectually disabled category. And none of this even touches on the absolute decimation Covid brings to the immune system, which is why people are getting sick more often, why mycoplasma pneumoniae is a trending search right now, etc. And then there's carcinogenicity, cardiac damage, etc. If bird flu hits a population that has weakened immune systems from the ongoing Covid pandemic, is so tired of pandemics that they don't take it seriously, and is experiencing neurological side effects that reduce their capabilities to intelligently deal with threats, we will be in a very bad place.EDIT: Surprised I'm getting upvoted.

Those stats go a long way toward explaining where Trumps margin of victory came from.As for Harris, the exits show her improving on Bidens 2020 margin among white, college-educated voters by seven points. Among college-educated white?*women*, her margin was 11 points better than Bidens. But that wasnt enough to offset Trumps gains among voters without a college degree  particular non-college voters of color  which helped him narrowly flip the suburban vote and lose by less in key cities like Philadelphia.How much of this had to do with Harris being a woman of color? No idea. Probably some.

We used to worship men of caliber; men of character held that office.\\nIts always had the back room deals, and politics. Im not pretending people like Jackson and Hoover didnt exist. But you had to be a person of *substance* to be president. Some of the most intelligent men of their times have held that office. And we just reelected the least intelligent of them all.Was it the Covid checks? Do people think those are coming back? How about the tariffs, the things that literally only have and can raise OUR prices and not hurt others. Do they think he can bring back jobs? He cant. The president, even his twisted ghoul of an office, simply cannot unilaterally order a company to bring all its manufacturing back to the U.S. its impossible! The mechanism simply doesnt exist!Was it the two wars started under Biden that we have no troops involved in? How is any of that his fault?So I have to lay back on the one thing that is always true in this place. The other has to be punished. Immigrants are about to be rounded up like cattle. Who knows if theyll make concentration camps for them. Who knows if they stop feeding them when it becomes expensive. Who knows what happens when their countries wont take them back and we have to figure out what to do with them.What matters to the modern American is that they can get that tiny little hit of dopamine that theyre better than someone else. Anyone else. At any cost.My grandfather fought in WWII, he would abhor this. He didnt  fight fascists to elect one.What a despicable populace. What a disgusting election.\\nFucking shameful.
