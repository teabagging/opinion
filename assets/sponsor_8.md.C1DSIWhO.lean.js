His administration might have pushed for sweeping reforms like Medicare for All, free public college tuition, and aggressive measures to combat climate change, such as the Green New Deal. The Democratic Party could have undergone a dramatic transformation, moving further left and invigorating a new generation of activists and voters. Economic policies aimed at reducing wealth inequality and reigning in corporate power would have faced fierce opposition from Republicans and establishment Democrats, likely resulting in legislative gridlock or intense political battles. Internationally, Sanders' non-interventionist approach and focus on human rights could have reshaped U.S. foreign policy, impacting relationships with allies and adversaries alike. The populist energy that fueled his campaign might have changed the trajectory of American politics, perhaps blunting the rise of Trumpism or at least shifting the terms of the national debate.","title":"Can you imagine today if we had Bernie in 2016"},{"text":"Literally all reports so far point to republicans cheating.

I met Christian Palestinians who were very welcoming and they told me their story. I later went again. I stayed with Palestinians instead of a hotel. They arranged to get me from the airport. I went through the Palestinian checkpoints (the split the checkpoint when going into Palestine: one for \\"whites\\" and the other for Palestinians) the change was very drastic. As a tourist you can go through quickly with no problems. But when I was with the Palestinians, I had guns drawn on me repeatedly for things like, not moving fast enough. For not responding quickly enough (which was natural since I didn't speak the language) I did learn swear words through when the Israeli soldiers called me a donkey and said I was \\"retarded\\" up until they saw my American passport and realized I wasn't from there, then all of a sudden they are relatively polite and asking how I got in the wrong line. They know what they are doing is wrong. I saw a protest (from a safe distance I'm not pretending to be brave here) and one side was peacefully, the other side fired their guns. I saw every Palestinian city has a massive Israeli settlement surrounding them in the hills. When you think of a settlement you probably think of a few houses. No it's a whole city. I saw that there are roads on Palestinian land that only Israelis are allowed to drive on. There were snipers on the hills nearby if Palestinians went down those streets. I saw the IDF pushing around children and the elderly just for a laugh. I came back and I studied. And the number back up what the Palestinians told me. Israel has always been the more violent side. It began with the concept of Zionism where the father of Zionism himself in the 1800s wrote about the need to \\"spirit away\\" the native population and how they won't like that so Zionist have to do it \\"discreetly and circumspectly\\". So it was the plan from day 1 to colonize Palestine and displace the native population. And Herzl was tame compared to other foundational Zionist like Ben Gurion and jabotinsky who plainly argues for the complete military dominance and eradication of Palestinians. Then we have an ethnic cleansing in '48. Israel cleans they were defending themselves and it was a preemptive ethnic cleansing. But the cleansing of villages began before the other Arab counties amassed at the border. Moreover Israel took more than what the UN said they could have. (Even though half the land went to a third of the mostly colonialist population)And more recently we had the first and second intifada, both of which describe the Palestinians as barbarians, yet more Palestinians died than Israelis.Then the UN started keeping track of all deaths and Israelis kill Palestinians 20:1. And this does not count deaths after Oct 7, where it is closer to 40:1. Not only that, Palestinian homes *on Palestinian land* get demolished by Israel because of a lack of an Israeli permit. Meanwhile, any American with a weak Jewish connection can go and live on that same bit of land and they get IDF protection even if they murder an innocent Palestinian. Now we have Oct 7. American have learned what I have known for a while. Israel is a barbaric state. Unfortunately it took a genocide and a mass of Israeli soldiers broadcasting their crimes on social media.which is a good thing since Israel has killed more journalists than anyone. And if you still don't believe me. Spend a week in the \\"good part\\" of the west bank and you will come back horrified. Or you can go to the bad part, Gaza, the israelis will kill you. There is a reason why every human rights group defends Palestine. As a matter of fact I encourage anyone to go visit Palestine and let the Palestinians show you around. I always felt safe with them. And even if you encounter Israelis, who are the only danger to you, Palestinians are trained from birth on how to deescalate with them, so while it's humiliating, you will be safe. https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualtieshttps://apnews.com/article/israel-palestine-settler-bedouin-displacement-violence-un-108e11712310b5ea099dbded7be8effbhttps://www.ochaopt.org/content/west-bank-demolitions-and-displacement-december-2022https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/palestine-state-of/https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/north-africa/israel/palestinehttps://www.btselem.org/voices_from_gaza","title":"CMV: Most People in the West that Support Palestine have no idea on the current situation in Palestine."},{"text":"Doesn't matter lol.","title":"Kamala Harris wins California"},{"text":"Thats kind, I was thinking more towards a dumpster.","title":"Jill Biden wore all red to vote"},{"text":"2024 is not rigged if Trump wins but somehow Kamala ends up winning all remaining states then you'll come out here and say it is rigged.

Is a queer person in Gaza more likely to be killed by Hamas, or by an Israeli airstrike? Homophobia is not unique to Palestine, nor foreign to Israel, and the central idea of the queers for Palestine movement is to note that queer rights in Palestine are tied up with Palestinian rights more generally, and just because their is homophobia within Palestinian society does not mean they don't deserve empathy and humanity. I think your point about the nature of war as violent and harmful to civilians is largely correct, but I think your perspective is quite narrow. What is the root cause of violence in Palestine? It wasn't October 7th or the 1st intifada, and it probably wasn't even the Nakba. An interesting question to ask yourself about the violence happening currently is what will happen in 10 years? If my entire family dies in an airstrike, I am not going to grow up feeling particularly empathetic towards Israel. The violence of Israel directly ensures more violence in the future CC the same question could've been asked at any point in the past, because past violence will ensure present violence if you let it. I am also skeptical of the claim that Israel is *truly* trying to minimise civilian casualties CC palestinians are extremely dehumanised by Israel and the military. I encourage you to look at Breaking the Silence, which is a collection of anonymous testimonies from IDF soldiers, and much of what they describe does not seem to be in the interest of preventing civilian death. The issue of roof-knocking is also interesting, you claim that no military has done that and that it minimises civilian deaths. The US did similar in WW2 (https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/key-documents/warning-leaflets/), and it is no longer being done in Gaza (https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog\\\\_entry/senior-israeli-source-gaza-will-not-be-hamastan-roof-knocking-policy-no-longer-norm/). What seems to happen in practice is that entire areas are destroyed, only for others to be marked safe zones, so Palestinians flee there and live as refugees, only for those same safe zones to be destroyed subsequently. How are civilians meant to live with no food and no home?

Israel does use *fairly precise* targeting, but assuming all of those military aged men are Hamas fighters strains credibility.Palestine claims 0% were Hamas fighters - which is even more improbable.If you split the difference and use an even common sense approach and assume about valid of those military age men are legitimate targets - credible - that would 1 fighter killed for evey 4 civilians.That sounds like a lot - but the official UN number of analogous wars is one fighter killed for every *nine* civilians.By any reasonable measure Israel is very precise and doing its best to minimize civilian casualties - and its pretty remarkable, given that Hamas blends into civilian populations and uses them as a shield as a strategy to wage a PR war.","title":"CMV: Most People in the West that Support Palestine have no idea on the current situation in Palestine."},{"text":"Still sad we couldnt get him as president","title":"Sen.

Colin Allred on Tuesday, defying another spirited and well-funded effort to turn Texas blue and preserving his status as a leading conservative voice in American politics.  \\n  \\n\\"This decisive victory should shake the Democratic establishment to its core,\\" he said in a speech to his supporter in Houston.  \\n  \\nAfter his close scare against then-U.S. Rep. Beto ORourke in 2018, Cruz vowed to enter this election cycle better prepared and more aggressive, determined to avoid the ignominious fate of becoming the first Texas Republican to lose statewide since 1994.  \\n  \\nCruzs victory once again dashes Democrats dream of breaking their decades-long drought in Texas statewide elections. But it was not without a serious challenge: Both candidates raised north of $80 million and attracted millions more from outside groups eager to sway a contest that carried potential to decide control of the U.S. Senate.  \\n  \\nLike in 2018, polls in the lead up to Election Day remained close. Allred was repeatedly polling within single digits behind Cruz, with one September poll showing him one point ahead. The Allred campaign revealed internal polling just days before Election Day showing the two tied.   \\n  \\nFueling Cruzs win was his standing as one of the most popular Republicans among conservative voters in a state where GOP voters still outnumber Democrats. He ran on a message of experience, having racked up a legislative record after 12 years in the Senate and as the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee.","title":"Ted Cruz declares victory over Colin Allred in U.S. Senate race"},{"text":"Georgia called","title":"Kamala Harris wins Colorado"},{"text":"Its ridiculous.

White Democrats often miss that pushing LGBTQ+ issues has ended up being a net negative among Latino voters. You have to be practical about what actually matters to them. The \\"Latinx\\" label, for example, has seriously backfired. For the vast majority of Spanish speakers, who take pride in their language, this term was never an issueuntil it was pushed on them.Yes, there's real progress, with around half of Latino voters now backing same-sex marriage. But \\"Latinx\\" is a major unforced error by Democrats. As a native Spanish speaker whos been around Latinos my whole life, even the most progressive ones I know react to \\"Latinx\\" with a serious eye-roll. The typical response? White people really need to stop. While the term wasnt initially coined by white people, once they saw a few Latino voices championing it, it was quickly weaponized, irritating the majority of Latinos even more.Is this single issue costing Democrats the election? No. But its a perfect example of unnecessary, tone-deaf social blunders that are alienating their own base.","title":"Kamala Harris wins Illinois"},{"text":"I agree with her on 90% of issues but she is a disgusting witch.","title":"Senator Elizabeth Warren wins reelection bid in Massachusetts"},{"text":"I literally administer vaccines on a regular basis, not to mention immunizing myself.

They sell their database to any campaign that can afford it. I think Ive now heard from 40 or 50 dem campaigns from all over the United States over the intervening years. The new campaigns are the only ones that get through now, and only once for each- but they do not stop. I have no idea how many emails get flushed without a trace from sources that match keywords already present in the filters, but I am sure that the number is substantial. I dont even look at the log files any more.The bottom line is that donating to political campaigns, especially those associated with the Circle D Corporation, is a major mistake.

They are pre-selected to be \\"famous\\", to be what they call \\"stars\\". They are dissociative mind-controlled torture victims; literal slaves. You need to understand how the mind control system (MKULTRA/MONARCH programming) works to understand this. This is also the reason many 'famous' people (politicians, actors, singers, movie stars, presidents, etc.) have these 'occult beliefs', they are literally made to, forced through torture and abuse. This is how these cults continue, programming their own children generationally.- [Mind control programming links](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/15vqlrk/comment/jwysg8c/)- [Cult ritual abuse links](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1g00p9a/comment/lr606ib/)- [Large research collection of further information](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1fccli2/large_conspiracy_research_library_books_documents/)\\"*The CIAs Mk-Ultra Mind Slaves are deeply embedded in Hollywood and the music and entertainment industries as actors and musicians and the roles which they play reach far beyond the movie screen and deep into our everyday lives, and our minds. One example of this is Leonardo DiCaprio who is an Mk-Ultra CIA Mind Slave. I personally met this man in my experience with the Agency and the Project. It would appear to the general public that Leo is a rich and powerful individual who is highly skilled at the art of acting and film making, but the reality is that he is nothing but a mouthpiece and a tool for the CIA, the deep state and Hollywood. Leo is a slave and the money he gets is pennies in comparison to the money that is made off of him by his CIA and Hollywood handlers.*\\"\\"*This cover-up runs deep as in my experience there are many involved in Mk-Ultra and Trauma Based Mind Control Programming including but not limited to, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon, the White House, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (The Church is involved with Satanic Ritual Abuse and the protection of the pedophiles abusing children for the CIA and the Satanic Elite, as well as the practice of Blood Atonement and the killing of anyone who speaks out on the dirty work that the Church leadership and Satanic Network in the Church are involved), the Disney Corporation (Disney sponsors trauma based mind control programming, i.e. Monarch Programming, human trafficking, murder, the covering up of evidence, child rape and child pornography, as well as providing space for the CIA at in particular their Anaheim location: Disneyland, for these activities), the music industry (a great deal, many musical artists are CIA mind slaves such as Garth Brooks, Britney Spears, and Billy Joel)...Hollywood and the film industry (many of the actors in Hollywood are CIA mind slaves such as Leonardo Dicaprio whom I personally met in Los Angeles, California and again in Sun Valley, Idaho, and Tom Cruise whom my own grandmother was involved with programming) and many of the so-called 'Elite'.*\\"\\"*...He explained that he was going to take a quick flight [over to The Grove](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1b7fyzb/comment/ktjm2zl/), as Britney Spears was there and was undergoing programming at that location; Gale made it no secret that this programming was in the form of sexual abuse. He asked me if I found her to be attractive and being a seventeen-year-old American male under deep mind control I told him that yes, of course I found her to be attractive. He told me that he would hook me up with her sometime soon as he thought I would enjoy having sex with her.

But the assumption that women will automatically benefit from the election of the first female President of the United States[?is as misleading as it is naive.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/04/women-are-fuelling-kamala-harris-last-minute-polling-surge/)With his penchant for porn stars and grabbing women by the py, Trump has long had a women problem that saw the majority of female voters back Hillary Clinton in 2016 (54 per cent to 39 per cent) and Biden in 2020 (55 per cent to 44 per cent).During this campaign, the former President has continued to struggle to win over female voters, despite declaring himself?[to be the father of IVF](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/17/donald-trump-claims-father-ivf-woos-women-voters/) in one interview, and backing the expansion of child tax credits.Trump may be far more relaxed about abortion than some of his devoutly Christian followers, arguing that states should decide their own laws for their own people, but he is blamed by many women for the[?overturning of Roe vs Wade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-decision-ruling-overturned-abortion-ban-supreme-court/)?C a move that might be partly responsible for any increase in female voter turnout in 2024. According to the Edison Research poll, 53 per cent of voters say either democracy or abortion is the most important issue, versus 45 per cent who say they care most about the economy and immigration C suggesting Harriss campaign has cut through more than Trumps.However, there is arguably an irony in the Vice President seemingly being more popular with American women, not least because she appears unwilling to define one.Far from offering a promised land for anyone with XX chromosomes, a future Harris administration could well further embolden the kind of gender extremists who want men to participate in female sports or children to have easier access to puberty blockers C without their mothers knowing. In her failed 2020 presidential run, she backed taxpayer funding for?[transgender surgeries for prison inmates and illegal immigrants](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/09/10/kamala-harris-gender-transition-surgery-prisoners-paid-for/). And in California, where she served as San Francisco district attorney and state attorney general, legal protections for gender self-identification have effectively ended the rights of women to have protected single-sex spaces.It goes without saying that these are distinctly female unfriendly policies.Women voting for Harris on the basis of my body, my choice appear to have overlooked the fact that her real agenda on issues like trans may end up doing significant damage to her sisterhood of fan girls.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/05/women-may-be-about-to-save-kamala-harris-theyll-come-to-reg/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/05/women-may-be-about-to-save-kamala-harris-theyll-come-to-reg/)","title":"Camilla Tominey: Why did women back Kamala Harris?

Because its run by an unstable meglomaniac with no coherent principles, Norton tweeted on Oct. 4. He took a hard right-wing turn, intentionally appealing to Trumps MAGA followers....Blumenthal fired back. In a lengthy tweet he claimed Norton, a supporter of vaccines, did not leave the Grayzone last year but was in fact fired for publicly criticizing his colleagues anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine stances, which Blumenthal referred to as jab mandates. Blumenthal concluded by attaching a cease and desist letter from February 2022 stating that Norton was fired the previous month for alleged inappropriate and inflammatory posts on social media related to your Grayzone colleagues in breach of the agreement, and neglecting for an extended period to carry out your normal work duties. Blumenthal posted a recording of the incident during their online feud, claiming he confronted Norton for violating their mediation agreement. The video shows Blumenthal tossing accusations at a seated Norton who is shielded by a man and woman who Blumenthal claims are his twin brother and girlfriend. Can you tell the Moderate Rebels patreons why you stole the account from me? How much money you stole from me, because we had a fifty-fifty agreement, Blumenthal says.Thats a fucking lie, Norton retorts.You stole tens of thousands of dollars from me, Blumenthal continues.The video shows Parampil mocking Norton for hiding behind his brother. Norton sits in a huff, angrily flipping off the camera while Blumenthal says youre a white collar criminal, youre guilty of computer fraud, you should be in jail.

It's dishonest to say it's a stupid argument to not like how they chose their candidate because she was already VP. It's entirely dishonest.I think you know this.

I was pretty tired when I wrote that and it is hand-wavey. To the first point, I agree, the buyer isn't entirely shielded from criticism insofar as their dollars support an industry that is adding to an overall surplus of adoptable cats. It's on that basis that I think we can distinguish adopting a stray as the superior option, ethically. I just think that going so far as to characterize the buyer as categorically unethical/morally wrong purely on the fact that they bought from a breeder is a bridge too far. Like, I just googled a British Shorthair cattery near me. They currently have some two-month-old pedigree kittens waiting for adoption. I'm not going to say it's *immoral* to buy one of them, because those kittens deserve love and a kind home. But I'm certainly more impressed with the character of a person who would instead opt to, say, take in and nurture a feral cat, or one of the high needs adult cats at the shelter. To the second point: \\"capitalist argument\\" was a bit of cynical shorthand for \\"argument that conveniently ignores the ethical decision-making involved in production by treating production decisions as automated responses to supply-and-demand while shifting ethical consequences downstream to the consumer\\". All to say, I definitely agree that ethics have to factor into consumer choices. I think it insidiously benefits the worst elements of capitalism when we emphasize the importance of ethical consumer decisions while de-emphasizing the importance of ethical business decisions.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"Dude I swore he was dead, I was just telling my kids about the horror movie he did, what was it called, oh yea chitty chitty bang bang","title":"Dick Van Dyke, 98, Endorses Kamala Harris With Same Speech He Delivered at 1964 MLK Jr. Rally"},{"text":"lol great comment","title":"103-year-old Wisconsin voter casts her ballot for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I dont understand why Elon Musk thinks hes funny.Hes sophomoric and witless at best.","title":"Elon Musk predicts a massive victory for Kamala Harris while calling half of Trump supporters idiots"},{"text":"Yeah, I mean, it's not like the last time trump lost, his supporters tried to over throw the government or something. \\nOh, wait.","title":"This is going to be a no win election"},{"text":"Its Joe Biden searching it","title":"Search interest for did Joe Biden drop out is spiking on Election Day even though he withdrew months ago"},{"text":"Are vice presidents part of the primary elections?When it's an incumbent, yes.
