Trump was leading in basically every swing state, something he had never done, and there were tons of non-polling signs that he was doing well, specifically R voter registration numbers nationwide. Kamala was running defense in Virginia while Trump was on offense in New York.Honestly anybody who really follows elections closely basically knew that Trump was the heavy favorite to win by the time that Iowa poll dropped.She dropped a Harris +3 in Iowa, a few weeks  away from the election, in a state that Trump had handily won in 2016 and gained margin in 2020. There was literally no way that was possible and she knew it. Right when the Harris camp needed a pick-me-up for the last month of funding (she had blown through her entire war chest by then), Ann decided to use her reputation as a weapon for the Harris camp. It even swayed betting markets kind of significantly. She and every dem knew it wasn't going change anything in the long run, but there are short term benefits they can reap like betting with slightly better odds, convincing the PACs to do another round of funding so the campaign can line its pockets by spending on all of their favorite media groups, blunt Trump's roaring momentum to maybe convince a few more Dems to hit up the polls to try to save the down ballot.All of this from a supposed INDEPENDENT POLLSTER for an Iowa newspaper.Again, the fact that she leaked this to the Dem camp before tells you her intentions. If she didn't do that, while it would be obvious what she did on a logical sense, there would be no evidence that she acted biased in favor of the Democrats from a supposed independent platform and there could really be no suit brought against the paper.Fact is, she turned an independent platform into a straight up in-kind donation, and gave damming evidence against her.Edit: And let me add that this lawsuit may get thrown out in court and if it doesn't it'll likely find her not guilty. They are trying to raise this to the level of violations of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act. The problem is, an in-kind campaign donation most likely doesn't reach that threshold. I think they have a case but it is an overall weak one. One of those situations where it's like \\"yeah she shouldn't have done that, but it's at worst a very light violation, and she destroyed her reputation in the process so that's enough\\".What I think the Trump camp is doing is they are simply being aggressive to try fight against the clear media bias that works constantly against Trump and basically all conservatives. They had a big win against ABC so I think that's emboldened them.Ultimately they are trying to put the media on defense for once. Trump's camp has the momentum and they are trying to ride that to as many changes as they can bring.","title":"news is mad that people keep getting sued for lying about Trump"},{"text":"Ill believe that when I see it.","title":"Just to Be Clear, No, Trump Cant Be Elected President Again"},{"text":"Yeah, we can't expect the famous multi billionaires to stand up, that's a job for *checks notes* random election workers and journalists","title":"What choice do they have?: Americas CEOs bend the knee to Donald Trump"},{"text":"\\\\ Sometimes Im rooting for aliens to take over the world, I can only hope they are more rational and enlightened than HALF the damn country.3 Body Problem has entered the chat","title":"A Kansas school board rejects social studies curriculum, claiming it's biased against Trump"},{"text":"also depression, both emotionally and economically","title":"Rep.

I fully expect her to launch a Senate bid. Whether that's for Sullivan's seat in 2026 or for Murkowski's (potentially open, if she retires) seat in 2028 is more the question. My previous prediction had been that Murkoski retires and endorses Peltola for 2028 because they're known to be friends. Now that she's narrowly lost the House seat, I could still see that happening, but I can also see her going with the \\"fuck it, we ball\\" philosophy and gunning for Sullivan's seat.

Anything more than that is just vigilantism - which can easily lead to breakdown of law and order. It'd be no better than street gangs.Are there instances in which the justice system is too lenient?

You might get some satisfaction from maiming the person that maimed your family member, but what about the family members of the attacker? Your reasons for doing so will not matter to them, they will feel hurt nonetheless. On what grounds would you deny them relief of their vengeance filled rage? Something that isn't their fault? This entire concept is the victim/environment exposing the criminals environment to unnecessary harm, because of something they had no fault in, for their personal satisfaction. Which again ties into C1) with being close to any semi-sensible definition of \\"true evil\\"F) It is also, from a strictly utilitarian point of view not useful to punish with aggression. From a utilitarian point of view, the criminals action caused a deficit in personal and social good,so he should be forced to create personal and social good. It might seem macabre to put a price on trauma, but then again governments and militaries regularly put prices on entire human lives. The end result is that it is fsr more beneficial to the victim and society as a whole if the peretrator is forced to actually try and pay his dues to society, instead of just focusing on doing him harm. It might not erase his guilt, but society and the victims might all be better off if the perpetrator could do high value work and contribute funds to therapy for victims or helpful social organizations.G1) But all of this could be ignored at least somewhat if not for one tiny detail in your post. Maybe the criminal can't pay for their crimes, contravening F). Maybe victims might be entitled to some form of relief even at the expense of other people contrary to E). One could ignore that it is an unconstructive base instinct contrary to D1). One could ignore semantics because a case might be without potential issues like in C). One could ignore the immorality of such an act stemming from B), because punishment is at least slightly a deterrent. And one must accept that empathy from A) isn't always seen as the all important thing that it is.\\nBut.\\nAs soon as you brought not just the \\"beating to within an inch of their life\\" from the beginning, but *killing* into the game in the middle of your post all this flew of the window. Why? Because killing is the one thing that a human can not survive.\\nIt blows everything else, apart from other life/death considerations out of the water. Disregarding any possible life after death (because we have no information about that), it is the end for that person and thus infinitely worse than anything else anyone could do to them.\\nI do not know why some societies do not treat it with the weight it deserves. Phrases like the \\"death penalty\\" seem insane, like treating death as a punishment you get between respawns.\\nIf someone is harmed so awfully that they are only able to find a single moment of life worth living in the entire remainder of their life (not that we would know that because who knows what sort of remedies the future holds?) that would still be infinitely more than the amount of moments a dead person would get.\\nAs someone who has dealt with the topic of suicide, even if the entirety of existence is pain and there's just a single moment of niceness, that single moment is still worth it, because no one else could EVER experience it exactly that way.\\nG2) All this is not even addressing practical considerations, like what if we aren't 100% sure about who the perpetrator is, or what about the principle of eye for an eye if you kill someone for less than a killing, or how it would be determined if a killing was done properly or before the identity of the perpetrator was known, etc. But there are numerous such considerations.\\nG3) If you rape a rapist back, if you steal from a thief, if you assault an assaulter, burn the stuff of an arsonist, at least the CHANCE is there that they realize how horrible their actions are and they try to atone for their transgression, or stop doing such things in the future. If not, then you can at least be sure that they did these things because in their view - however messed up it may be - it isn't bad enough. Which might bring some form of relief, knowing that they aren't capable of comprehending what sort of harm they caused, and are just \\"crazy\\".\\nBut if you kill them, there's no benefit. They cant learn, reform, atone, and no insight might be gained into their mind.\\nSo all the other arguments above deal exclusively with vengeance ideas according to batman rules.H1) To address the clarification: That makes things so much worse, because if something is regulated by society, there is at least a chance that it will happen uniformly or in a way that is somehow \\"just\\". If people go outside of the rules of society, they are judge, jury, and executioner, and beholden only to their personal biases. You would have no recourse against someone beating, raping, or killing someone else they thought was \\"evil\\", you could of course try to counter them, but at that point it becomes a game of might, or makes right, and THAT is exsctly the reasoning a lot of these criminals have.\\nH2) Finally a bit of semantics. If you argue that the rules of society shouldn't be changed, but people should be encouraged to break them, you are indirectly arguing for changing the rules of society, by making a society that is conducive to rule breaking.Sorry that this got a bit too long, but I tried to express all the facets of why I am deeply morally opposed to vengeance.","title":"CMV: Most people aren't nearly violent enough against true evil"},{"text":"Its hard to believe there are women that protect rapists, but she is a MAGA after all.","title":"Rep.

No one thinks of themselves as truly evil, and even those that do, simply value their own views of what should be done above the needs of others. This also ties back perfectly into A), since a lack of empathy is what brings one as close to \\"true evil\\" as is possible.\\nC2) As others have pointed out, what *would* one even label as truly evil? Would it change from country to country? To stick with your example of molestation, the age of consent over here in europe (germany) is 14. In Florida acting based on that will get you prison time and on a list for likely life. Sure someone ignoring local laws is evil, either way, but \\"true evil\\"? Does it change based on location, is one location right? What about the degree to which you are guilty of harm? Sticking with the same example, others have pointed out that not reporting such things could also be seen as evil. But lets go a step further: a number of people are not traumatized by something like this occurring to them, or at least not impaired in their normal function. Now of course this doesn't excuse the perpetrator who risked creating lifelong trauma. However there are studies showing that the way a molestation case is handled can ITSELF be seriously traumatic for the victim. (This is why a load of procedures have been put in place to protect victims during the legal process!) And at that point we are faced with the remote but extant possibility of trauma from the act being less than the trauma from the prosecution of the act. But it would be insane to fault panicking parents who just want to protect their child and not a criminal who just happened to be lucky and not traumatized their victim. So what is true evil depends on individual motivation? Or to go with an example by another commenter, what if the guilty party themself is just a child? Does true evil also depend on maturity?\\nIn the best case scenario for the definition it would be based on intent to harm and disregard for others.\\nIn other words it is not possible to define true evil unless you know exactly the internal workings of the person having committed the evil deed, which is impossible, even if we manage to read minds in the future because we can not precisely recreate the circumstances.\\nC3) Even IF it was possible to determine with perfect accuracy that someone is truly evil, has absolutely no care for anyone, and we disregard the dilemma with causation from 3) and the issue with the concept from C1), why would you decide that the person is also irredeemable? Do you mean that they are actually not possible to redeem, or that you wouldn't bother with trying? In the latter case you would basically say that you should decide based on your whims who gets punished how. In the former case, how would you make that determination? Fiction is full of examples of evil being redeemed because humans are hardwired to believe that redemption is almost always possible, which would not have stuck around through social and societal evolution had it been a bad guidance.D) Rage and revenge are base emotions. They stem directly from the unfulfilled action potential of an activated fight or flight response, which neuroendocrine reaction is triggered anew every time the person is confronted with a person one cares about getting harmed. Which happens for a long time after the actual incident, since human brains automatically reanalyze past experiences to try to figure out a good course of action for the future. The issue is that this action potential then has nowhere to go, because it is too late to fight or flee from a memory. This results in an overwhelming amount of anger directed towards whatever the person sees as the source of the harm. This is why humans carry grudges. A delayed fight response. So it is perfectly understandable for people to want to do something ANYTHING to make things right that often can not be made right.

Ironically enough i accidentally stumbled upon this subreddit just now from a post on empathy. You need to empathize with everyone. And i mean EVERYone. The line which people you should have no empathy for is fundamentally arbitrary and defeats the basic concept of empathy, in informing us what we (or a random person) would like to happen if the situation was reversed. Sure you might think that you would never be in the opposing situation, but you should try to imagine anyway. It helps if you've ever been hounded by a group of people who hate your guts without ever being able to explain to them why they shouldn't - read: if you ever belonged to some form of minority. And this is such a core and crucial value of society, that every religion includes it (see: Golden Rule). Limiting empathy thus undermines the foundation of human society.\\nBut even if you acted with empathy during vengeance (which would be difficult) the below would still apply.B1) The basic idea that if someone did something bad they deserve something bad to be enacted on them is not sound. Every decision every person makes comes down to either innate properties - and discriminating based on those would be horrid - or learned behavior - which is entirely the fault of the environment. We are all just a product of circumstances. Punishment only serves to create an environment that teaches the person or others that that course of action is wrong. This however is terribly inefficient, which is why punitive/retributive justice was seen as on its way out in the 60s, before politics brought it back into fashion in america. Which then resulted in the insanely high recidivism rate in the US and the incredibly low recidivism rate in rehabilitation focused european prisons. B2) Tying into this is the actual sane way of viewing things. Crime is a disease. Either innately or through your environment you acquire a potential for it (and if there are other sick people in your environment you're more likely to get it), and then some other circumstance triggers it. Can you imagine if people got tortured for being sick? No. You quarantine them until they are no longer a danger to people around them, you try to give them the necessary things needed to change the things that are going wrong inside them, and if necessary check up on them later to see that they truly don't fall back. This is the exact same with crime.CONT","title":"CMV: Most people aren't nearly violent enough against true evil"},{"text":"The government is going to publish CSAM?","title":"The Matt Gaetz Ethics Report Is Going to Be Released After All"},{"text":"Good reminder that public sentiment has been statistically insignificant to policy outcomes for decades in the US.","title":"Translation: The voice of a Billionaire forced a Bent Knee.

Pfluger said the?Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act of 2024?(H.R.8610) would renew and reform current counter-UAS legal authorities. The bill would extend existing DHS and DoJ counter-UAS authorities through Oct. 1, 2028.The legislation also aims to strengthen public safety in communities across the country. For example, it would require DHS to establish a counter-UAS mitigation pilot program under which select state law enforcement agencies could operate approved counter-UAS mitigation systems and mitigate unauthorized UAS operations on behalf of covered entities.This much hoopla leading up to expiration of the existing drone-countering legislation doesnt appear to be a coincidence. ??","title":"(Repost) Can Americans truly be this clueless?"},{"text":"Ok, I get that","title":"the handling of the NJ thing is a huge tell you can't trust gov"},{"text":" Donald Trump is stoking political mayhem in Canada by intensifying a crisis that threatens to oust Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Makes no sense! Many Canadians want Canada to become the 51st State,\\" he posted on Truth Social. \\"They would save massively on taxes and military protection.\\"And it's to be expected from the U.S. president-elect, said John Bolton, a former senior Trump adviser who's now a Trump critic.\\"I think he's poking at Justin Trudeau and trying to humiliate him, and I think Trump gets a laugh from it.

[She] said Trump's humour has the consequence of creating an \\"in group and out group,\\" putting people into different divisions.[...] The $100,000,000 that Trump is quoting, [seems to be] a figure that is seven years old based on statements made at the time by Lighthizer [...] in his export calculations that included goods that pass through Canada but don't originate here as Canadian exports, artificially inflating the United States's trade deficit in goods with Canada.The figure did not take into account trade in services, and either Lightizer or staff on his behalf appeared to misinterpret Statistics Canada, reaching conclusions at odds with even data from the U.S. Department of Commerce.Trump has long been chagrined by U.S. trade deficits with other countries, though some economists argue that a trade deficit alone does not offer a full accounting of the health of an economy.\\"A larger trade deficit can be the result of a stronger economy, as consumers spend and import more while higher interest rates make foreign investors more eager to place their money in the United States,\\" said the think-tank Council on Foreign Relations in a 2019 report.This summer, Trudeau told a meeting of parliamentarians from NATO nations that Canada is on track to meet its commitment to spend two per cent of GDP on defence by 2032, a pledge that has been met coolly in the U.S.Canada's federal Defence Minister Bill Blair said in recent weeks he was \\"ready to go faster,\\" and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte earlier this month issued a clarion call to alliance members to increase their defence spending to a \\"lot more than two per cent.\\" Alliance members need to be on a \\"wartime footing\\" with their defence spending, he said.\\"Spending at two per cent says very little about a country's actual military capabilities; its readiness, deployability, and\\nsustainability levels; and the quality of the force that it can field,\\" the think-tank Carnegie Europe said in a 2015 report. Despite a $38-billion modernization package announced by the Liberal government in 2022, Canada's commitments to the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) have also come under scrunity.Blair said last month that he is asking for help from the U.S. because much of what the Canadian Armed Forces has to acquire comes from American corporations and defence contractors.A recent Leger poll suggests 13 per cent of Canadians would like the country to become the next U.S. state.","title":"Unpacking Trump's latest broadside about Canada as a '51st state' | CBC News"},{"text":"Tots and pears!","title":"Who Depends Most on Washington?

A highly controversial effort, partly funded by Dunn, it represents one of the best hopes for Christian nationalists, among other interested parties, who want to transform the laws of the land in one fell swoop. When we started the Convention of States  and I was there at the beginning  I knew we had to have a spiritual revival, a Great Awakening and a political restoration for our country to come back to its roots, Dunn said at a 2019 summit for the group, where he spoke alongside Barton. What I did not expect is that the Convention of States would be an organization that would trigger that Great Awakening.Yet nothing in Article V limits the scope of the laws that might be changed.Its a gamble, but if it pays off, it would be the biggest opportunity ever for billionaires to transform the government, Montgomery, the researcher of the religious right, said.","title":"Just to Be Clear, No, Trump Cant Be Elected President Again"},{"text":"Your firewall's gone, guys.

Throwing 50 billion more into an already saturated domestic market would akin to throwing 50 billion into a black hole, you certainly won't be making the 5% growth target with that.

Even when we had potential candidates, we are just told to support ourselves. The state leadership requires in person votes for much of the state leadership positions, meaning only those who can afford to spend the day in Des Moines can vote for who decides how the state party spends money. I have tried talking to my state party multiple times with no responses ever. I also firmly believe many people are idiots and uneducated when to comes to politics. It's just those people take whatever position is common around them. I have talked to democrats who have absolutely zero clue of anything about policies or what's happening in the world. So when you look at the environment of my rural county, you can see why people who don't engage in politics except through memes and voting, vote GOP. (Again, many blue voters I know do the same thing).My county auditor, county supervisor, my state senator have all been proven of committing crimes related to their position. But the county attorney won't prosecute them (the senator was sued for defamation and settled at least). The local government is all corrupt. So your incredibly disengaged voter will believe whatever they are told and don't have the will to learn the truth.

They do, but they dont generally see it. Funding tends to go to the people who have the resources to grab it. Have you ever filled out an application for a federal loan or grant? You often have to pay *just to apply,* and when youre the city manager and head of the food pantry and mail man and park clean up and little league coach all in one, hundreds of pages of reporting and thousands of dollars just isnt a good gamble. Especially not when you know in your heart that those funds will go to someone whos already wealthy, like a corporation or a large town.Most of the federal funding that does hit small rural communities is SNAP and home loans, which you also have access to. Weird how the media never tells you about that stuff when they go on their Cletus safaris out here, right? money is needed elsewhereThis is the other lie youre told. Congress hasnt passed a real, comprehensive budget in years now. **Years.** Theyll rush to give tax cuts to their big business buddies, but when it comes to funding things like water infrastructure, housing, and community facilities like schools and hospitals, where the fuck are they? We could tax the billionaires, pass a real budget or at least a Farm Bill like the one Stabenow proposed, and everyone would benefit. Because thats the other reality. You do benefit from us just like we benefit from you. Were customers, innovators, farmers, researchers, and so on.

My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard, really. At the age of twelve, I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.

To expand on this, oil companies are slowing down production because their investors, share holders, and boards of directors dont want to invest money into oil exploration.Oil exploration costs money and doesnt guarantee a return on investment, some wells will come up empty, if they explore and dont find oil then theyve just wasted a billion dollars finding out where oil isnt, theres no up-side to that, its just a straight loss.Right now oil companies have hundreds if not thousands of federal land leases for oil exploration that the industry isnt using, its not because of regulations, its not because the CEOs dont want to drill, its because their share holders wont let them spend money on oil exploration.

So, they'd like to change education in order to change that.  Put religion back in schools either by doing what Oklahoma did with the Bibles or by pushing for school vouchers and trying to get more kids into private school (also a money making scheme).  They also want kids to hear and see nothing about LGBTQ people so they are less comfortable with that idea and are less accepting of it.

If Walmart increased prices too much someone will move in next door and offer cheaper prices than them.The duopoly and similar issues are only there b/c the government gets in the way of new competition opening up. If it would be profitable to undercut the duopoly people would do it. SO then the duopoly cuts prices to take out the new competition ad then the cycle repeats but the prices remain low the whole time and the consumer benefits.Deregulation helps large business in the short term but hurts them in the long term. Yes now Walmart can expand easier but it lets new companies open up faster, cheaper, and easier than ever.The existing firms can't manipulate supply forever. If they offer to buy at higher price for potatoes that small companies can't buy them they are losing more money and have to sell at a higher price so more people will stop buying potatoes. So they either stop buying the potatoes for as much or they destroy their own market.Imo no. Anti-trust is short sighted and just gives more power to an Authoritarian state and helps consumers in the short term but then the companies can merge later when the new stronger government is able to be bought out as all governments have always been able to be bought out.

There was a huge outreach effort, not just during the election but for years leading up to it. Bidens admin conducted direct outreach not just to assess needs but also to address barriers to funding access for rural communities. The real issue is two-fold. First, Congress cant pass a budget, so there really isnt funding for the massive infrastructure, housing, and public health needs in this country. If you think its bad in cities, just remember that cities have the resources to get the resources, so theyre doing relatively well. Relatively is the key word. Second, rural communities are deeply dependent on corporations as economic drivers. This means the people who get into power are actively incentivized not to go against moneyed interests. Combine that with an aging population and leadership that will never change, and you get what you see here. Last month, I was working with a guy whos blisteringly brilliant, like a true forward thinker, whos been desperately trying to get his rural county to approve new workforce housing. This county is literally about to dissolve because theyve lost so much business and so many families due to lack of housing. Every person on the county commission is either over 70 or the kid of one of those folks. They all refuse to allow it because what if the wrong people move in.

If they did want to do it they could do it in a number of countries aside from Ukraine. Ukraine doesnt change this dynamic at all. With or without Ukraine NATO has the same capacity to locate IRBMs the same distance to Russia its simply chosen not to. So again if the ability for NATO to place IRBMs near Russia is not meaningfully impacted in any way by Ukraine joining NATO then what existential threat does it pose. The argument well instead of NATO having 4 neighboring countries to potentially launch nukes from theyll have 5 doesnt make it seem like Ukraines addition is that consequential. its not stealing landIts the literal definition of territorial conquest.

When the first nuclear plants were build, the movement against them was so big, that it became for the better part of a generation an identity creating Event to fight against nuclear weapons and nuclear power.When Fukushima happened the government (under chancellor Merkel back then) was under pressure. They had to shut the (few) remaining nuclear plants down. The end of nuclear power was decided and started over a decade ago and when Russia started its war the shut down was wayyyy beyond the point of no return. There was just no way to restart the nuclear plants.The relying on Russian gas came from two different points. One was just money. There were a couple of decision makers that simply profited of the pipelines. But it was also justified by the idea that codependency (we need gas, they need money) would ensure peace. Many people have always criticized that russia will turn that against Germany and that making the country dependent of an Autocrats will is in general a bad idea. But they were ultimately in the minority. Probably partially because Russia had managed to influence both, the far left and the far right to support them. Keep also in mind that eastern Germany used to be a part of the UdSSR and therefore has a strong connection to Russia. And after the German reunion and the fall of the UdSSR some politicians were probably just naive.So, yeah, the current German government, that reigned during the invasion of the Ukrainian was kind of not responsible for they just happened to be in charge when it became relevant.

I'd imagine most people on this site thought the UK was foolish to leave, and think Ukraine should join. Canada and the US are far more culturally, economically, and demographically aligned than a large majority of EU member states are with each other. The number of Canadians living and working in the US is similar to the number of Americans living and working in Canada, which given the population size differences would indicate to me there is more demand for immigration from the Canadian side.Again, assuming less centralization of governance like with the EU, there is no reason Canada couldn't essentially keep operating as it has been, but with reduced friction for things like freedom of movement, access to markets, etc. There would also be economies of scale benefits on both sides with things like defense, transportation, etc.Honestly, I think this would benefit Canadians more than it would Americans, if for no other reason than the economic reality that the US is in a much stronger position and in a little over a decade Canadians have seen their currency go from parity with the USD to 70 cents to the dollar.Again, still opposed to to a variety of reasons, including the original governance issue I mentioned - but also don't really understand the knee jerk reaction aside from the fact that Trump said it (TBF, like with most things he was a dick about it), \\"America bad\\", and nationalistic pride.","title":"Donald Trump says Canada becoming 51st U.S. state 'a great idea'"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],W={key:0},B={key:1};function O(t,a,e,c,r,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 public opinion 🥳")])],-1)),n("div",E,[(o(!0),i(b,null,v(s.visiblePoems,(l,p)=>(o(),k(m,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,D)):T("",!0)])}const P=d(H,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-e68965b2"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/26.md","filePath":"guide/26.md"}'),F={name:"guide/26.md"},L=Object.assign(F,{setup(t){return(a,e)=>(o(),i("div",null,[u(P)]))}});export{N as __pageData,L as default};
