The parliamentarian simply offers advice and you are perfectly within your right to bypass it, Republicans have done so in the past, and Dems/Kamala just chose not to and boom the $15 an hour minimum wage died on the floor. Sure Manchin and Sinema were initially opposed but if Biden actually applied leverage to these two then it would have gotten through. The same is true for student debt cancellation, yes Biden has cancelled some but it's only roughly 10% and basically all education and legal experts agreed that he had the power and authority to cancel all debt through the Heroes Act with Covid and yet they chose to not do so and go through the courts instead where it was likely to get struck down and viola that's exactly what happened. Even for something like Medicare for All that obviously would have to go through Congress, Dems have essentially stopped bringing it up even though it is majorly popular, Harris and her campaign have already publicly said they don't support it. Like at this point who cares if you even intend to do it or think you can, at least campaign that you will!

It's only when you combine the results of several that you can definitively say there's movement one way or another.Overall, Trump has the advantage in some places. But I'd be happy with the NYT poll showing Kamala has the edge in PA, because a number of other polls have also suggested she does. If polls were all over the place, that would suggest the margin of error is significant. If they're all matching, it suggests the potential error is narrower than the stated MoE.HOWEVER, as we learnt in 2016, shepherding does happen.

If you purchase a gun for someone else, you both should get years in prison.

Many people want to vote for a party that aligns EXACTLY with everything they think and believe and if neither of the major parties do that, theyll turn to the both sides are awful view. What they dont know is that in countries with more than two parties, coalitions still have to form to get anything done and so your perfect for you party will likely have to collaborate with another party and might end up supporting something you oppose. Here in the US with a two party system, the coalitions are formed prior to the election rather than after. So when it comes time to vote, youre not going to find the party that aligns with *everything* you want and so it makes the both sides suck easier for people to hold on to.","title":"You cant trust who??"},{"text":"It would weaken Republican hold on the government so they will never be willing to do it.

First is look at the debates back in 2016 with Hillary and see how much better DT did back then. 2nd, Look at 2020, he was worse and he lost, the offices he all endorsed lost, I also want to add that I was talking to people at that time, most democrat voters were on the fence with Biden. This is not the case with Harris. 3rd is how many people have time to do polls, how many people answer their phones to unknown numbers, how many people get called? I know a few groups that have the time, and probably get calls and answer to unknown numbers. Retired, unemployed, and wealthy enough to have one person at home or not working. People that attract polling calls also fit the algorithm. So people that browse most likely political sites will more likely get a call than a person who just has enough time to maybe watch a video or two. Get out and vote! That is what we need to do, there is really no way to know this outcome. Polls are like a barometer. It could suggest weather conditions but cant predict weather.

Since then the environment has only gotten worse. As people with influence that are taken seriously pollsters like Nate Coun and Nate Sliver will be considered partisan hacks if Trump performs even a single percentage Point better than their prediction models. That's the impact maga has on the environment. Companies that endorse Harris risk losing government contracts, being investigated by Trump's justice department, etc if Trump wins. That is why Trump attacks and criticizes corporations and individuals who endorse by name. It is his (Trump's) way of threatening people. In my opinion if Harris was up 10 points in PA pollsters wouldn't be willing to say it. Too much fear of being wrong. Trump can be up in swing states but Harris is handicapped (by the media's fear of Trump) at being even.

But the laws effects have been much broader: Individual mental health professionals have curtailed what they say and what support they give to students, and the law gives the strong imprimatur of the Russian state to the false and discriminatory view that LGBT people are a threat to tradition and the family Its passage coincided with an uptick in often-gruesome vigilante violence against LGBT people in Russiafrequently carried out in the name of protecting Russian values and Russias children.

It was virtue signaling around COVID (which continued and cost the Dems elections in 2021), which hurt them here too.  Hence, a bit lower turnout than the polls showed. Plus, Trump supporters may have been under sampled. Also, Biden wasn't the most inspiring candidate: it was an anti-Trump vote, not a pro-Biden vote.","title":"Trump is in a better polling spot now than he was against Clinton or Biden"},{"text":"What you found like five gen Z voters that are undecided in leaning Trump?

That is voting for a mayor or governor of a small state is probably enough to ensure liberty, but voting for president doesn't accomplish that.This is why I think that if countries were the size of 1 or 2 million people then limited government has a pretty good chance of working acceptably well.. but by the time you get to the size of the Federal government is is a impossibility.","title":"Can freedom and democracy coexist?"},{"text":"Nice to see so many Dems challenging republicans in state legislative races this year.

In fact, the party was at the height of its power when it was most unabashedly progressive  and turning towards the center has had exactly the opposite of the intended effect.It's also worth noting that the Republicans very much do make sure to give the various parts of their coalition something to look forward to. Gun nuts get this, Christians get that, libertarians get something else, a rich people get another piece over here... *Every single one* of their key constituencies has something to be excited about.We have to vote for the best option we have. When Harris has the power to make change we can do everything in our power to pressure her to make the changes we want to see. That works, weve seen it work. But if she never makes it to the office because a bunch of petulant leftists defect to the Green Party or sit out the election as some means of protest because the dem candidate isnt progressive enough, then all were doing is shooting ourselves in the foot and placing our goals even farther out of reach.Look, I don't disagree with this from the standpoint of the individual voter. What I disagree with is the party's response to this. If they're worried that a sufficient number of these voters are being turned off to potentially swing the election, then they need to be doing outreach and consider recalibrating some of their policies to appeal to them. This is how every other voting bloc is approached, and I don't see why it should be any different for leftists and progressives.","title":"Democrats attack Green Partys Jill Stein amid spoiler fears"},{"text":"Im mid 20s and have been polled twice, once via phone call and once by mail by reputable groups (RMG and I believe Quinnipiac)","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Good News in Must-Win State From Most Accurate Pollster"},{"text":"That is disturbingly accurate.","title":"Trump Baffles Everybody With Bizarre Biden Circles Babble"},{"text":"The election has barely startedPeople for the love of good stop equivocating polls to the election","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Good News in Must-Win State From Most Accurate Pollster"},{"text":"It became ok when Trump rolled out his lies and the republicans didnt care, and people rewarded them both with their votes and donations.","title":"'When did that become okay?: Obama calls out Trump's hurricane lies"},{"text":"Yes, you are wrong.

Now they flaunt that inclusion to legitimize themselves and pump out more questionable polls that get to effectively be at the same level of NYT polls.?If aggregate polls are to carry any meaningful weight, theres gotta be a higher standard for what is included.","title":"Harris vs. Trump analyst tells panicky Dems: GOP is creating fake polls | Desperate, unhinged, Trumpian"},{"text":" IIRC the only original ask was to ban slavery in the former confederate state constitutions.

Trump has defended his free-wheeling, sometimes unfollowable oratory style as a deliberate ploy he calls the weavebut his latest effort looked more like unraveling.During Trumps speech at the Detroit Economic Clubwhich included a segment insulting the city of Detroit, prompting condemnation from the mayorthe Republican nominee was speaking about how American manufacturing can be affected by other countries tariffs before veering off-topic into a discussion about Elon Musk, rockets, and, for some reason, circles.  Its very sad to see and its so simple, he said, continuing:\\"I mean, you know, this isnt like Elon with his rocket ships that land within 12 inches on the moon where they wanted to land. Or he gets the engines back, that was the first I realizedI said: Who the hell did that? I saw engines about three, four years ago. These things were comingcylinders, no wings, no nothingand theyre coming down very slowly, landing on a raft in the middle of the ocean someplace with a circle. Boom. Reminded me of the Biden circles that he used to have, right? Hed have eight circles and he couldnt fill em up. But then I heard he beat us with the popular vote. I dont know, I dont knowcouldnt fill up the eight circles. I always loved those circles, they were so beautiful. They were so beautiful to look at. In fact the person that did themthat was the best thing about histhe level of that circle was great. But they couldnt get people, so they used to have the press stand in those circles, because they couldnt get the people. Then I heard we lost, Oh, we lost. Now, were never gonna let that happen again. But weve been abused by other countries. Weve been abused by our own politicians, really more than other countries. I cant blame them. Weve been abused by people that represent us in this countrysome of them stupid, some of them naive, and some of em crooked, frankly.\\"Trump appears to be referring to circles on the ground used as a social-distancing measure at President Joe Bidens campaign events four years ago during the COVID pandemic. Trump was seemingly reminded of them by SpaceXs reusable rocket boosters because they land on circular targets painted on drone ships. What any of that has to do with tariffs is anyones guess.The circle ramble wasnt his only bizarre aside during the speech.The word grocery, its a sort of simple word, Trump said at another point in his address.

Theyre the ones that asked her the question. MSM is not the friend of the people. Ive watched it become a cesspool over the last 40 years. Now, shes the one that answered like she did, saying that making it political was utterly irresponsible and it is selfish. DeSantis said that she was the first one trying to politicize the storm. Biden stated that DeSantis was cooperative. These are their words, spoken from their own mouths. The POTUS and the Governor both saying that they are in communication, shes the one politicizing the situation. Im\\nNot interested in her trying to gain clout as people are scrambling to get prepared for the impact of a deadly hurricane. Now shes the one saying this as shes going to fly to NY. I said her poor response to NC, because it took her 5 days to get there after the storm. Shes the one playing political games during a crisis. Its appalling. Im not the one screaming misinformation, disinformation or any of the sort. Though, I believe my fellow citizens over any politician trying to gain power. As a member of the democrat party, I find it foul to use it any crisis as a talking point without any substance to back it up. That goes for Trump as well. Though he appears to be more inclined to listen to the people. I said what I personally think. And that when she says something the opposite is true. Projection and re direction. I watched with my own eyes as Biden slowly became less mobile and started talking slower, something Ive witnessed often in nursing homes. Not anyones fault, however she was the closest to him professionally and lied about his abilities. Which she has since distanced herself from him. She was the one out of sync with these efforts.She also decided to regurgitate the same lies about Charlottesville, my hometown. I was living there during the incident, so I was very invested in what was being said locally, nationally and internationally. I remember watching Trump speak on it and the clips we see that circulate are done in such a fashion to make people think a certain way. I dont like the guy, however I dont appreciate the poor behavior from the media and my party on this. She speaks falsely on the abortion issue as it pertains to Trump and state bans and purposefully stirs fear. If any woman is dying from these bans, is due to her fear mongering because not one state has a ban on emergency situations. Also, the number one cause of death amongst pregnant women is homicide. Not lack of abortion access. She seeks to get us emotionally charged instead of speaking clearly on policies and with truth and Im not interested in her manipulation of feelings. Its a play to further take our rights. She repeats the same sound bits over and over with no real substance.  When she was questioned about Milton, Instead of simply stating that DeSantis was in communication with the president, she made it about her and played victim. Its gross. Period. Its really sad for me to say that I will not be voting for my party this year because of her deception and lies. And the fact that she is a weak leader. I used to be a hiring manager, I wouldnt even hire her for a small position. IDC what Putin, Obama, Biden or Trump have to say about her. I have a mind of my own and do research. And seek Gods guidance. Im horrified of what I know about her. She is not to be trusted. Now I posted the 1984 article of Bezmenovs interview for reference, as far as MSM information, since I had quoted a portion of it. If you want to talk disinformation, I suggest you read it. Again, Putin doesnt care what disinformation he sends, he has no care about either candidate, he seeks to destroy the American way of life.

If not, that's good. But I think what you're concerning yourself with here is First Amendment free speech, and that is an entirely different thing. The first thing to know about the Constitution is that it provides limitations to the actions of *the federal government*, not individuals. In the First Amendment, it makes clear that *the federal government* cannot limit your speech.That said, we all know that any idiot can open their mouth and say stupid, offensive, or even legally harmful things. Nothing physically or legally prevents that; but that does not mean there will not be consequencies.If you raise up a hammer and smash yourself in the toe with it, it's going to hurt like hell, and if you smah my toe with it, I'm liable to beat the hell out of you, if you don't get me first.The TL;dr is, Don't think for one moment that the Constitution protects anyone from anything anyone else says or does (unless they are acting on behalf of the Federal Government), because it simply doesn't.","title":"Apparently, the Left has Evidence that Free Speech is Bad"},{"text":"Biden said high gas prices are good because it makes people drive less and thats good for the environment.

If they dont back off still, then its up to how invested you are in that person. Like if its a coworker or an acquaintance Id probably let it go for the most part because getting into a heated argument and hurting whatever working relationship you have with that person probably isnt worth it. If its a close friend or family member, then Id probably continue pushing back but ramp up the aggressiveness.In general, people are most likely to believe something if they can convince themselves of it.

Yes, Trump demonstrated that the people do not want millions of illegal immigrants pouring over their southern border every year.  It is The Economist's own data that shows this, by the way.  Every moment that Harris fails to state \\"We're going to shut that border down\\" is another moment that Trump might actually win the election.  For some reason Harris is willing to roll the dice and hold off on that.  Who knows.  Not a mind reader.Yes, the Biden administration embraced protectionism after Trump gave him political cover to do so.  But protectionism is traditionally a DEMOCRATIC position that Trump's power in office allowed him to engage in.  The Republican way is free trade and free competition.  As soon as the Republicans demonstrate that they have returned to this ideal (which would actually be better for our consumers and our economy), that's how long it will take to get the Democrats back to economic reality.Of course, Harris is sounding more moderate on more Democrat-only policies.  She's trying to win an election.  For some reason you -- and the Economist -- seem not to have noticed that.  Again:  not a mind reader.The Economist is fully in support of Harris and of course they're going to try to scare people about Trump.  We all like to think of ourselves as unbiased observers but, in some cases, it's hard not to actually take a side.  They have chosen.","title":"CMV: Trump has already secured victory even before November 5"},{"text":"Reading the article is a little confusing.

Speaking at the conclusion of the Windaba 2024 conference on Thursday, South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) CEO Niveshen Govender said over the past decade, wind energy has steadily established itself as a vital component of South Africas energy transition. Our industry has achieved remarkable milestones, contributing to over 3.5 gigawatts of installed capacity. (To date) the wind industry has 1.3 gigawatts of wind projects currently in construction. We have a pipeline of 53 gigawatts of wind projects under development in the country. The Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill (ERA) around unbundling of Eskom and regulatory reform, is laying the groundwork for a more resilient and sustainable energy mix in our country. However, we must acknowledge the challenges that persist whether this is specifically the grid constraints or more generally the structural reforms. He said there was still intervention required to unlock the full potential of renewable energy. Keynote speaker, Electricity Minister Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa said they were revising the transmission development plan which had previously aimed to build 14 000 kilometres over 10 years. Brazil, India, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico have gone this route and were seeing that theyve been able to roll out a significant amount of kilometres over the period 1998 to 2015 C over 100 000 kilometres of new transmission, so it has been done. We are learning from those experiences of countries that are within the same band as ours from a development perspective so that were able to take that as a template and then domesticate it so we know that theres a place for the state, theres a place for the private sector. The minister said that wind energy was a big part of the countrys integrated resource plan, a comprehensive articulation of the energy sources that will help meet the demand. He said they received 4000 submissions on a review of the plan which was out for public consultation, of which 250 would be considered, as they made a substantive contribution. With an ongoing transition from traditional energy sources to renewable solutions, the country had committed to ensuring that it meets its own energy demands while also preparing to assist regional neighbours like Zambia, the minister noted.!ping ECO&amp;AFRICA","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Trump will release his medical information in two weeks.

They fear the PAC has still done too little to reach low-engagement nonwhite voters, both by failing to put enough resources into targeted digital advertisingas opposed to traditional TV and broadly focused digital adsand by being slow to share resources with groups experienced in mobilizing these voters.","title":"Could Trump Win?

The Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI) also require more rigorous testing of drinking water and a lower threshold requiring communities to take action to protect people from lead exposure in water. In addition, the final rule improves communication within communities so that families are better informed about the risk of lead in drinking water, the location of lead pipes, and plans for replacing them. This final rule is part of the Presidents commitment to replace every lead pipe in the country within a decade, making sure that all communities can turn on the tap and drink clean water. Alongside the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements, EPA is announcing $2.6 billion in newly available drinking water infrastructure funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This funding will flow through the drinking water state revolving funds (DWSRFs) and is available to support lead pipe replacement and inventory projects. Additionally, 49% of the funding must be provided to disadvantaged communities as grant funding or principal forgiveness that does not have to be repaid. EPA is also announcing the availability of $35 million in competitive grant funding for reducing lead in drinking water. Communities are invited to apply directly for grant funding through this program. Additional federal funding is available to support lead pipe replacement projects and EPA has developed a website identifying available funding sources.EPA estimates that up to 9 million homes are served through legacy lead pipes across the country, many of which are in lower-income communities and communities of color, creating disproportionate lead exposure burden for these families. Eliminating lead exposure from the air people breathe, the water people drink, and the homes people live in is a crucial component of the Biden-Harris Administrations historic commitment to advancing environmental justice.The Lead and Copper Rule Improvements establish achievable, common-sense practices which have been implemented by several states and cities. The public health and economic benefits of the final rule are estimated to be up to 13 times greater than the costs, and together with new funding announced today under Biden-Harris Administrations Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, water systems will be able to accelerate removal of lead pipes and create good-paying local jobs in the process.  \\n...   \\nThe science is clear: Lead is a potent neurotoxin and there is no safe level of lead exposure, particularly for children. In children, lead can severely harm mental and physical development, slow down learning, and irreversibly damage the brain. In adults, lead can cause increased blood pressure, heart disease, decreased kidney function, and cancer. If someone is impacted by lead exposure, there is no known antidote, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Lead and Copper Rule Improvements strengthen nationwide requirements to protect children and adults from these significant and irreversible health effects from lead in drinking water. Communities across the country have already begun to tackle lead pipes. * Milwaukee Water Works is on track to replace all remaining lead pipes within the EPAs ten-year timeframe. In 2024 alone, Milwaukee received approximately $30 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to replace 3,400 lead service lines. \\n* The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department has received $90 million from the Administration and will replace more than 8,000 lead service lines this year, putting the city on track to replace all lead pipes in 10 years.\\n* The Erie, Pennsylvania Water Works has received $49 million from EPA to enable the city to replace all lead pipes within 5 years instead of 25 years.  \\n* Denver Water has accelerated its efforts through $76 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, allowing the city to be on track to replace all lead pipes within a decade.The Lead and Copper Rule Improvements will help protect millions of Americans from exposure to lead in drinking water. EPA estimates that on average, every year after the LCRI is issued it will: * protect up to 900,000 infants from having low birthweight. \\n* prevent Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in up to 2,600 children.\\n* reduce up to 1,500 cases of premature death from heart disease.\\n* prevent up to 200,000 IQ points lost in children. Investments in identifying lead pipes, planning for their removal, and replacing them will create jobs in local communities while strengthening the foundation of safe drinking water that supports economic opportunity....*Background*EPA is taking a comprehensive approach to getting the lead out, including:* Regulatory Framework: EPAs final Lead and Copper Rule Improvements follow the science and EPAs authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act to strengthen regulatory requirements to address lead in drinking water.\\n* Funding: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $50 billion to support upgrades to the nations drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. This includes $15 billion over five years dedicated to lead service line replacement and $11.7 billion of general Drinking Water State Revolving Funds that can also be used for lead service line replacement. There are a number of additional pathways for systems to receive financial support for lead service line replacement. These include billions available as low- to no-cost financing through annual funding provided through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program and low-cost financing from the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program. Funding may also be available from other federal agencies, state, and local governments. These efforts also advance the Biden-Harris Administrations Justice40 Initiative, which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.\\n* Technical Assistance: EPAs water technical assistance (WaterTA), including the LSLR Accelerators and the Get the Lead Out Initiative, helps communities identify lead services lines, develop replacement plans, and apply for funding, including DWSRF funding, to get the lead out.\\n* Practical Implementation Tools: Through training, tools, webinars, and case studies, EPA provides support to drinking water systems to reduce lead exposure.Statement from EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan:Weve known for decades that lead exposure has serious long-term impacts for childrens health. And yet, millions of lead service lines are still delivering drinking water to homes, said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. President Biden is putting an end to this generational public health problem. With the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements and historic investments in lead pipe replacement, the Biden-Harris Administration is fulfilling its commitment that no community, regardless of race, geography, or wealth, should have to worry about lead-contaminated water in their homes.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Issues Final Rule Requiring Replacement of Lead Pipes Within 10 Years, Announces Funding to Provide Clean Water to Schools and Homes"},{"text":"honestly how can anyone be against this.If possible vote early","title":"Congressional Democrats Call for Immediate Federal Aid to Protect Elections After Hurricanes"},{"text":"That is pure nonsense and crumbles away just by glancing at it, the bullshit is that intense.","title":"Obamas Admonishing Tone to Black Men Presents a Risk for Democrats"},{"text":"Please explain what makes him unqualified and her qualified","title":"Democrats fear Harris losing too many male voters to Trump"},{"text":"Their response is that they were confident in biden/harris and refuse to accept its bullshit and no one votes based on vp or even considers that they need to consider vp because it should be unlikely to be needed unless your voting for a brain dead one foot in the grave stand in.

He then mismanaged Covid. He then added $8.4 trillion to the deficit. Guess what? We are NOW paying for that - its called inflation. I do not claim that its all Trumps fault. But it is partially. Then Covid hit and the whole worlds economy suffered. \\n2. Biden, according to economists, has had one of the best Covid recoveries in the world. Inflation is now down. Based on certain measures, yes, the economy is doing great - take a look at your 401k and what its worth. HOWEVER, prices are still very high and thats what people see. And thats why Harris brings that up. Shes being honest and saying I hear you and I get it. One of her plans is to go after price gouging. But thats not the ONLY economic plan she has. \\n3. Trump on the economy and tariffs. We currently have tariffs in place. Trump is talking about increasing them substantially on imported goods so that American companies can compete. Think about what that really means. If the cost of a product goes up, naturally the seller needs to charge more to the consumer in order to break even or be profitable. And we all know that on certain goods, America cannot compete with the cheap prices from China - and who pays? YOU - the consumer. So there goes your inflation. Trump doesnt know what to do with the economy because the whole environment is not the same as it was years ago when he was president. According to economists, his plans would not stimulate the economy but lead us into a recession within 6 mos. 4. Both parties have said no tax on tips.

Inclusion problems are widespread in the Asian community. I frequently see Chinese people discriminating against Black or Hispanic individuals with terrible words, but no media seems to care about it. If the media truly cares about inclusion, why dont they report discrimination in the Chinese community? Chinese people make up 19% of the US population. The inclusion problem suddenly becomes less of a concern when it involves a different race.\\n3. In Los Angeles, there are areas like Chinatown, Koreatown, and Hispanic neighborhoods, etc. If inclusion is a priority, why does the city of angels allow such racial separation?

Lionblaze complained, huddling under a bush. Lets get back to camp where its dry!Cinderheart ignored him, walking through the rain with great Mary Sue dignity. She settled in the open, her fur dry and untouched as a golden ray of sunshine poked through the clouds and made her fur sparkle.Lionblaze, she meowed. I... I wanted to let you know, that after our midnight walkOh, that old thing? I wanted to let you know that ISHUT UP! Cinderheart spat. THE AUTHORS GIFT FROM STARCLAN IS SPEAKING, SO LISTEN!

Dont play hard to get! she yelled, crashing through the undergrowth. She squeezed through the thorn tunnel after him, following his scent to the elders den. Before she could arrive there, standing in the middle of camp, Lionblaze emerged again from the den, Purdy at his side. Mousefur shot out of the den close behind along with Molekit and Cherrykit at her side, confused looks on their faces. PURDY! Molekit wailed. You HAVE to finish telling us the World War II story!

Mousefur tumbled onto the ground in front of the three cats, trembling.Ah, Mouseyfur, ysee, youre too old for me! I need a fresh young un like Lionblaze! He meowed, purring.Cinderheart stood there, still confused with disbelief. Mousefur began sobbing, but Purdy didnt seem to notice. He seemed distracted by a butterfly that was fluttering around, straying from Ivypaws fantasies.Cinderhearts shock was broken as a tumble of cats, all seeming to fight eachother, rolled across the camp. Out of the tumble came Heathertail, Icecloud, Hazeltail, and Berrynose. LIONBLAZEY! Icecloud screamed. We heard you got a new mate?! HOW DARE YOU?! WHERE IS SHE?Um, ysee- Purdy was cut off by a growl from Heathertail.Its her! Its Cinderfart! GET HER! she threw herself across the clearing, wrestling with the gray she-cat.
