For instance, a Republican judge recently struck down a Biden admin rule that had expanded overtime eligibility to something like 4 million people. That's a single judge that made that decision. It will now presumably be appealed to a higher court, but it demonstrates the importance of the judiciary.","title":"Republicans are going to just let democrats walk their nominees for judges right through the front door"},{"text":"Make that four.

If this becomes a referendum on their chief executive's fitness to choose a winning nominee, the optics will be bad, and optics count.

For example, this bill hands all the powers of the NC State board of elections to the Auditor office instead (held by Rs).

They had the news on and during this very long wait for my vehicle to be serviced, the man started to speak to me. He was reciting Fox News talking points at me, and I'm honestly not sure why because (DUH) I am quite clearly a Black woman.He kept saying \\"they\\" this and \\"the government\\" that as he complained about everything in this world. We were in northern Virginia, about 30 miles south of Washington DC by the way. I finally said to him, \\"Do you see all of these people walking around in here? I bet more than half of them work for the federal government.\\"And what I meant was that the government isn't this big imaginary thing of evil - it's your friends, neighbors, and family if you live around here. He looked at me and said, \\"Really? I wish I could have a good job like that.\\"I kid you not. Trump and Elon are talking straight to the people who are jealous that they don't have \\"a good job like that.\\" They're pushing the idea that it's a cushy gig for lazy elitists who sit at home taking advantage of telework while doing nothing but wasting government money with their salaries.These government haters would join in a second--every last one of them who isn't some rich billionaire--but since they can't they're OK with destroying it.

Trumps choice to be attorney general, to women, including some who testified that Mr. Gaetz hired them for sex, according to a document obtained by The New York Times and a lawyer representing some of the women.The document, assembled by investigators during a three-year sex-trafficking investigation into Mr. Gaetz, is a chart that shows a web of thousands of dollars in Venmo payments between Mr. Gaetz and a group of his friends, associates and women who had drug-fueled sex parties between 2017 and 2020, according to testimony that participants are said to have given to federal and congressional investigators.At the parties, women, and a girl who was 17 at the time, were paid for sex, according to accounts of the participants testimony from people briefed on what they said.The document bolsters recent claims by a lawyer for two of the women who say they had sex with Mr. Gaetz for money. It shows thousands of dollars in payments Mr. Gaetz made to both of the lawyers clients.Let the chest-puffing begin!This purposeful leaking of classified investigative materials is the sort of politicized D.O.J. weaponization that Matt Gaetz will end, Mr. Cheung said.

As of September 30, America PAC reportedly spent $133,841,660 to support or oppose 2024 federal candidates, according to the lawsuit.","title":"Trump thinks he won a mandate to change America.

Is that it? Does the Milgram Experiment mean anything to you? Should look into that one. Because It could never happen here! Has already been tested and it was shown that was thoroughly false. If we do not stay on guard and stay vigilant for forces that would undo our democracy we have already lost. And you seem to keep the door wide open for that because you arent comprehending it.Youre dismissing a very key aspect of the Weimar Republic by saying It was just a short time and didnt matter anyway. Youre telling me exactly what your thoughts on the matter are  democracy is fleeting, but what serves you is for the best. You think its humorous? I wonder if you could speak to the people the Nazis first came after if they thought it was just a little lighthearted tomfoolery. Gays, Jews, Gypsies, others were having laws made against them from the start of the Nazis coming to power and disintegrating the WR. Its just a joke to you, right? You said it: Its funny. As to the DOE, is that what Trump told you? Is that what you believe? Have you done any research on it? DOE provided federally funded assistance for kids needing IEP/504 plans and help for those with special needs. It doesnt come from the States. Teachers are one of the most underpaid, yet among the most valuable, people in our country. And what will happen when States take charge? The wealthy send their kids to private charters, while the poor and special needs are sustained in public schools. Ah but thats fine, right? More voters like you to sustain a system that keeps the wealthy in power while you chuckle and laugh and pat yourself on the back because at least you owned the libs. You really think that Trump is the smartest man in the room? Because he knows smart people and they tell him so? You really think hes draining the swamp? He fired his last cabinet because he needed them to do things you cannot do in a democracy.I am a member of the military. Do you remember General Mattis? Mattis stepped down because he couldnt abide the Fhrers temper tantrums. General Mattis is deeply respected by those who serve. Trump got rid of all of them because they could not in good conscience serve him. Mike Pence was fine  until he wasnt. Because he could not back the events of 6 January.And you truly believe that Trump knows what hes doing, dont you? By putting yes-men into power? By having Elon Musk head up an efficiency department, a man who has tanked no less than 5 major businesses? Tulsi Gabbard and RFK, democrats who jumped ship so they could seize power? How about Linda McMahon being chosen for Secretary of Education?Its a joke. Its all a joke.

There are boundaries because speech has consequences. Hate speech isnt just unpopular opinions. Its rhetoric that dehumanizes, incites violence, and creates a climate of fear for marginalized groups. Laws against it arent there to silence dissent; theyre there to prevent harm. You cant seriously argue that letting people openly call for violence or discrimination doesnt lead to real-world consequenceshistory has proven otherwise.Your example about the womans tweet leading to arson proves the point youre trying to dismiss. Her words directly encouraged violence, and pretending she had no responsibility is naive. Free speech doesnt mean freedom from accountability, especially when your words fuel harm. Claiming hate speech laws are too vague ignores that their purpose is clear: protecting people from being targeted for things like race, religion, or sexual orientation. Thats not suppression; thats society deciding not to tolerate hate.Your slippery slope argument is just fearmongering. Every law has limits and interpretations; that doesnt mean they shouldnt exist. Poppers Paradox of Tolerance makes it clearif we allow unchecked hate in the name of tolerance, we end up destroying tolerance altogether. Hate speech laws dont destroy freedom; they protect it for those most vulnerable. Speech isnt neutral, and protecting hate only empowers those who already hold the most power. Theres no right to hurt others under the guise of free speech.","title":"CMV: \\"Hate speech\\" deserves the same legal protection as all forms of free speech"},{"text":"Not likely to make it through the gop primary though","title":"Bill Clinton predicts that USA is likelier to elect a female if shes a conservative Republican woman"},{"text":"A shocking lesson I learned during the COVID stimulus is that our country is only stable if a lot of people are poor.

Josh Stein, a Democrat, will be the next governor, succeeding Roy Cooper, another Democrat.The bill would significantly restructure the state election board, the top authority over voting in North Carolina, wresting appointment power away from the governors office and handing it to the state auditor, who will be a Republican next year. The change would be likely to put the board, which currently has three Democrats and two Republicans, under G.O.P. control.The legislation would also significantly restrict the governors ability to fill vacancies on state courts, including the Supreme Court, by limiting the options to candidates offered by the political party of the judge leaving the seat. And it would curtail the ability of the attorney general  currently Mr. Stein, and next year Jeff Jackson, another Democrat  to challenge laws passed by the legislature.Beyond those proposals, the bill would make major changes to state election procedures. It would significantly shorten the time voters have after Election Day to address problems with their mail and absentee ballots  a process known as curing  and would require local election officials to finish counting provisional ballots within three days of the election.The State Senates passage of the bill on Wednesday sends it to Mr. Cooper, who has 10 days to sign or veto the legislation before it becomes law automatically. North Carolina does not allow its governors to veto parts of a bill, so he would have to reject the entire measure, including the hurricane relief provisions.","title":"North Carolina Republicans Push to Seize Power From Top Democrats"},{"text":"For the first time i understand the purpose of the 2nd amendment.","title":"Absolutely Insane: Pentagon Officials on Trumps Military Deportation Plan"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|27CZ3WLnGcD2IXEhxR|downsized)[https://youtu.be/aFA1N2VKJF0?si=r0q7FVTR8JU4wIkj&amp;t=46s](https://youtu.be/aFA1N2VKJF0?si=r0q7FVTR8JU4wIkj&amp;t=46s)","title":"Breaking News: Trump nominates Steven Seagal as head of the FBI because, He is hard to kill."},{"text":"She's right but for the wrong reason.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene: GOP Covered Up Sexual Harassment and Assault Claims"},{"text":"No no, he did nothing about immigration, you know, what he campaigned on?

Last time I looked although Biden &amp; Co. screwed the economy pretty bad we are nowhere near that level. German armed forces 100k always answered to an authoritarian.  U.S. 2.1 Million always under civilian control. See apparently I have a lot more faith in the American people than you.  We are probably the only country on Earth that has never known being under an authoritarian government be he/she a king, queen, emperor or some other title since its founding as an independent nation.  Democracy is in our bones and sinew and they will not give that up to Trump or anyone.

Have you warned your family you are doing this?  I hope so because when the camps are up and the death squads begin their grisly task, it will be too late for people like you.

In 'normal' situations, government institutions will hold to conventions over what is and is not considered a) illegitimate and disqualifying acts b) legitimate use of governmental power and c) legitimate power sharing agreements between and amongst different group (i.e. political parties/interest groups). What the past few years, and especially at the moment has shown is that one half of the political elite in the US (Republicans) have little to no interest in maintaining these conventions and instead are going to use these institutions merely to benefit themselves and their chosen group by seizing power. When these conventions break down, the government institutions themselves begin to breakdown, because if power is the only real goal, then real power can more easily be found in force rather than institutions. The current Gaetz saga is merely a symptom of the underlying and far more serious problem facing the American political system.   \\nAnyways, thank you for coming to my TedTalk on 'How the US is fucked RN'","title":"Not one Republican has ethics.

This was not some historical political realignment. Democrats were dealt a bad hand, but they also played it abysmally. Voter turnout stayed relatively consistent for Trump this election compared to last, the same cannot be said for Democrats. The why is something that the party will need to deeply reflect on.Walter Lippman, one of America's most influential journalists, who had the ear of presidents, called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" almost a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever. He argued that Americans don't make politically informed decisions, and that's what happened this election, Americans let their *feelings* decide the outcome. The onus was on Democrats, not Republicans, to help Americans make those politically informed decisions, however unfair that may seem.So Democrats have to take some of the blame. But first, Biden was supposed to be a transitional candidate. His decision to run for re-election put democrats in a very tough spot. He was also tasked with overseeing an economic recovery and his admin was blamed for the fallout that followed the pandemic.In fact, an economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped into office and was forced to oversee an economic recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans exploited that fallout for political gain, choosing to divide Americans during a time of crisis.It was particularly effective this time because, unfortunately, many Americans care more about their immediate circumstances than they do any \\"threat to democracy.\\"What's more, American voters tend to have short memories and a large swath of low propensity voters are who decide our elections. Many of them don't tune in until they're being inundated with political messaging months leading up to an election. And that messaging is excessively sensational, propagandistic, misleading, deceptive, partisan, heavily distorted etc.And this is, in large part, because, as studies consistently show, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda and lies travel farther and faster, reaching wider audiences. The truth receives far less engagement I'll be willing to concede that this type of messaging comes from both parties, but it's Republicans who disproportionately benefit from it.Combine this with the fact that incumbent leaders around the globe were facing political challenges due to world wide economic tensions, and it becomes obvious that this was always going to be an uphill battle.Add Kamala Harris being shoehorned in at the last minute, and you've got yourself a recipe for an election loss What's really frustrating is that Donald Trump is going to be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. One he'll surely take credit for *again*. The only consolation is that Joe Biden's presidency will act as a sort of stop gap effort, sandwiched in between two Trump presidencies. Two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging, the next four years aside.Trump's loss to Biden in 2020 was of necessity. The beginning of a return back to normalcy, and it could very well set up obstacles for Republicans that would not have been put in place otherwiseYes, Democrats would have had a much better shot had Biden refused to run for a second term, but what was done was done. And after Biden stepped down, Democrats played their hand terribly.While they failed to take into account how Americans care more about their immediate circumstances, how they have short memories and show disinterest or lack of concern for nuance, they also failed to articulate a message that should have emphasized, above all else, Trump's poor economic and foreign policy record.Inflation and economic issues were the key drivers this election, and while many Americans tend to think in black and white terms, e.g. \\"when inflation/economy bad, it must be the fault of whoever is in power,\\" it still would have benefitted Democrats if they prioritized, above all else, the message that Trump was *not* better for the economy, and his economic policies for his next term are even more potentially disastrous for Americans.Voters cared far more about this than they did about Trump as a threat to core Democratic values.The national debt ballooned under Trump.He instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. He pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His admin took actions that made it more difficult for workers to unionize, and for unions to operate effectively. He championed tax cut legislation that is estimated to cost the govt trillions (while Republicans bragged that it would pay for itself), and these tax cuts permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations.Trump mishandled the pandemic at nearly every turn, and encouraged Republicans to politicize every aspect of COVID, once again, choosing to divide Americans during a time of crisis.Trump and his Republican allies preserved a GOP agenda that has been hamstringing the labor movement, redistributing wealth to the top, safeguarding a broken tax code, promoting corporate profit-mongering and personhood, prioritizing rich/special interests, cultivating an economic culture of greed and profligacy, and widening the wealth gap, among other things, for *decades**All of these things contributed to inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the Biden administration*Trump's foreign policy record was a disaster too. He weakened our alliances, escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our ability to act as peace brokers, withdrew from the working non-proliferation agreement with Iran, emboldened Putin's autocratic agenda, aided his proxy wars and aligned himself with Putin's goals, cozied up to dictators around the globe, dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone, forced Congress to pass not one, but two historical war powers resolutions, abandoned our Kurdish allies, negotiated with terrorists and the list goes on and on.On immigration, Democrats weren't going to reach through to anyone cheering on mass deportations, but Trump tanking the bipartisan border deal should have been emphasized more along with how Republicans prefer to run on immigration as a wedge issue, rather than run on fixing it.Most Americans don't know these things. And, yeah, maybe they don't care as long as they're paying more for groceries and gas, while believing that whoever's in charge is responsible for higher prices, but even if this is the case, you at least try to convince them otherwise.In the end, there were a multitude of factors working against democrats, they also likely miscalculated how some voters just weren't willing to vote for a woman considering the alternative was a perceived strongman, especially during a period where a movement and \\"crisis of masculinity\\" is on the rise. Walter Lippman was right a century ago, and he's still right today. The general public *is* an irrational force. He argued that voters don't make politically informed decisions. Well, they're especially not making politically informed decisions if you're not *informing* them. So instead, they're voting based on feelings, and that's what won Trump this election, *feelings.*","title":"Trump thinks he won a mandate to change America.

Like, no one seriously believes 90-whatever percent of Americans organically approved of George W. Bush as president, even though that was his approval rating after 9/11.Having said that, I expect Trumps real approval rating to be inexplicably higher than I think it should be well into his term  though I hope Im wrong.

In fact, Biden shouldve done a bunch of fucking air strikes against the Taliban when they started violating the deal. Basically as a sit the fuck down or this deal is over. Also, Biden Admin chose to evactuate Bagram Airbase early on, which meant we had to use the less fortified Kabul airport. Biden Admin absolutely did horrible at evacuating our interpreters.

I cant help but wander if everyone just totally forgot the circus that was his last presidency.

Fast forward to this election and he is literally going into it telling us his playbook, both directly (his own words) and indirectly (through his sycophants and project 2025). He has a republican house, senate, and Supreme Court, and although he had opposition in his last term to check and balance, I feel those have eroded dramatically. This term will look incredibly different. And judging by the picks I have seen thus far for his cabinet.mike rogers for FBI director(see OP), Matt gaetz for attorney general (under ethics investigation for statutory rape), Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence (accused of Russian collusion/spying), Linda McMahon education secretary (fucking WWE founder), Pete Hegseth for SECDEF (Fox News anchor?!?!), Brenda Carr to lead FCC (help author project 2025 and wants to extend power of FCC to regulate online content and providers).

Trustees of Sailor's Snug Harbor: \\nThe rule commonly laid down in the books is, that every person who is born within the ligeance of a sovereign is a subject; and, e converso, that every person born without such allegiance is an alien. . . . Two things usually concur to create citizenship; first, birth locally within the dominions of the sovereign; and secondly, birth within the protection and obedience, or in other words, within the ligenance of the sovereign. That is, the party must be born within a place where the sovereign is at the time in full possession and exercise of his power, and the party must also at his birth derive protection from, and consequently owe obedience or allegiance to the sovereign, as such, de facto.[4]So there would now be a two part rule, that to get citizenship, a baby must be born in United States territory, and be \\"within the protection and obedience\\" of the sovereign. What does that mean, exactly?[There are about 10,000 babies born every day in the United States.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/03/07/how-many-people-born-day-global-national/11266988002/) What happens to the babies born the day after this hypothetical Supreme Court decision? Do they get birth certificates? Do they get social security cards? Is there some new set of hospital paperwork the parents have to do to prove that the parents are U.S. citizens? What's the standard for that now? Do the parents have to prove their ancestors were born in the U.S. going back three generations? More?This would open up an enormous legal can of worms, and it will likely have lifelong consequences for the children born between the Supreme Court decision and whenever Congress manages to pass legislation establishing new criteria for citizenship.","title":"Trump Is Gunning for Birthright Citizenshipand Testing the High Court.

Putin has gone to China, Iran, and finally North Korea for the critical help he's needed to continue to prosecute the war in Ukraine.

The range here is too wide and a lot of them feel like excuses to avoid having an awkward conversation.If you have a genuine fear for your safety, it is fine to ghost.  But there is a difference between \\"I am worried this person might cry\\" and \\"I am worried this person might hit me.\\"If you went on one bad Tinder date and you didn't sleep with the person, it is fine to ghost.  Sex changes the situation as pregnancy and STIs can make follow-up important.But if you meet someone's parents or introduced them to yours... you owe them a break-up conversation.If you have an ongoing relationship with someone where they would care if you died, a change in feelings or increased busyness does not excuse ghostingWhat I come back to is an old quote from Malcom Forbes, You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them or to them.The reason why I try to communicate with other people rather than ghosting isn't because I want people to think well of me.  It is because I want to be the kind of person who does the right thing even when it isn't entirely comfortable.  I want to be upfront, dependable and capable of setting boundaries with grace.  I don't want to be someone who lets my own fear hurt other people.

Or try to help without getting the parents involved?Did teachers in the aughts out gay kids to parents those kids said were homophobic? (genuine question) Especially since homophobia was MUCH more ingrained in 2004.The fundamental issue at play is that certain issues can be presumed as being a potential trigger for parental abuse.

(AP)  President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed a line of guitars, following up on the Bibles, sneakers, watches, photo books and cryptocurrency ventures launched during his third White House campaign.Trump on Wednesday posted to Truth Social a photo of himself holding what he said was a Limited Edition 45 Guitar, an electric model emblazoned with an American flag and eagle on the body, and Trumps Make America Great Again slogan inlaid into the neck. Both acoustic and electric styles are available, for $1,250 and $1,500, respectively, as well as Presidential and God Bless the USA models and Signature Edition guitars, which  with a $10,000 price tag  also include Trumps signature.Whats not clear is the financial relationship between Trump and proceeds from the guitar sales. Following his long tradition of melding his political and business interests, Trump has hawked a series of branded products since he launched his 2024 White House campaign, a slew of items that went up for sale in the wake of a $489 million civil fraud judgment against the former president.Some of them, like the Official Trump Watch Collection  where one model costs $100,000  were listed as affiliated with CIC Ventures LLC, a company that Trump reported owning in his 2023 financial disclosure.Websites for items like the watches note that the products are subject to a paid license agreement, the same mechanism that allowed Trump, well before he entered politics, to profit for years from sales of everything from water to vodka and steaks.As of Wednesday, GetTrumpGuitars.com included no such disclaimers, or even the name of the company selling the items. An FAQ page lists information about how many of each model are being made available  and notes that these models are the ONLY guitars endorsed by President Donald J. Trump!  but includes none of the disclaimers or licensing language on some of Trumps other product sites.The guitar websites privacy policy does include a suburban Nashville address for a couple, neither of whom immediately returned a message seeking comment Wednesday. Photos on their social media pages showed that they attended Trumps election-night party in Florida.Messages left with 16 Creative  a branding agency listed at the bottom of the guitar website  and Trumps transition team also were not immediately returned.Leading up to his win in the general election, Trump this year has announced the sale of $100 silver coins bearing his face, urged his supporters to spend $59.99 for a God Bless the USA Bible, inspired by country singer Lee Greenwoods patriotic ballad, and hawked new Trump-branded sneakers at Sneaker Con, a gathering that bills itself as the The Greatest Sneaker Show on Earth.He also has dabbled in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and last year reported earning between $100,000 and $1 million from a series of digital trading cards that portrayed him in cartoon-like images, including as an astronaut, a cowboy and a superhero.","title":"Donald Trumps latest branded venture is guitars that cost up to $10,000"},{"text":"Maga: He didn't actually cut off a child's head, this is what the media and demonrats do, they lie!

I'm glad he was elected. His comments in support of free speech have been similarly strident and unequivocal and similarly in-your-face to the Establishment, focused on specific proposals rather than just rhetoric. As for chess, go to chess.com. Set your account so that it only presents you with opponents with slightly higher ratings than yours (like from an identical rating to yours to maybe 50 points over your rating). You want to play opponents of similar skill and experience (or lack thereof) that challenge you without always getting your ass kicked. Also, you lose fewer ratings points when you lose to someone with a higher rating than yours (even if slightly higher) versus when you lose to someone with a lower rating than yours. Set your account so that all games you play are 2 or 3 minutes long per player with 1 second put back on the clock after each move (I play only 1 minute per player with 1 second put back after a move because I don't like watching paint dry). This will assure that you play lots of games in a short time, so you will rapidly improve. As you improve, the opponents you're presented with will automatically always have ratings slightly higher than yours. Pick one or two basic openings - e.g., Queen's Gambit (my favorite) or Ruy Lopez - and play them every time you have white like a broken record; you'll have seen it all within a fairly short time. You want to be in a decent overall position as things move into the middle game, and the commonly used openings have been tested over centuries to do just that. Lastly, Google something like basic overall chess principles and strategies for the early game. Follow them until you know what you're doing (they're simple stuff like fight for the middle squares in the early game, or trade pieces of equal value when you've got a nice lead going).","title":"Napolitano: Trump -- \\"We have never been closer to nuclear war\\""},{"text":"....the wrestling lady?","title":"Trump Picks Linda McMahon, Named in 'Ring Boy' Sex Abuse Case, to Run Education Dept."},{"text":" I'll threaten to expose yours.And you have a problem with this why?At worst she would own herself by bringing down both parties - I don't see a problem.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene Suggests Releasing All Ethics Reports, Not Just Gaetz's: \\"If We're Going to Dance, Let's All Dance In The Sunlight'"},{"text":"a splash? we already have a splash of jim crow now","title":"Trump Is Gunning for Birthright Citizenshipand Testing the High Court.
