The idea that simply going into public invites others to comment on everything you say and do is a bit ridiculous. Remember, expression is more than just speech. The space is shared. That means everyone has a right to use it, but that doesn't mean you're all equally involved in everything going on there. And keeping in mind who something is directed at is appropriate. Just because you exist in the space doesn't mean it's directed at you.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) said it was unable to reach a consensus on the risks of the Nippon Steel deal, leaving the final verdict with the White House.\\n \\n In its final evaluation of the transaction, the committee warned that after buying U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel could reduce domestic steel output and pose risks to the national security of the United States. Among the industries hardest hit in that case would be the transportation and energy sectors, said the panel, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen.\\n \\n . . . \\n \\n The collapse of Nippon Steels proposed $14.9 billion acquisition represents a victory for United Steelworkers union president David McCall. A fourth-generation steelworker who rose to lead the union following the 2023 death of his predecessor, McCall objected to the deal from the moment it was announced in December 2023.Disappointing, though not surprising.

It started in the US and right now has 75% workforce in India. It suffered no loss in quality due to shifting of its developers to India while reducing labor costs, and henceforth, generating greater profits.Take my case, I am doing a PhD in CS in a top 20 institute in US. A job at California will pay me 200k-250k while charging me much higher taxes than an American. An American with similar qualification will demand much higher salary while having the ability to switch to a different firm at whim. If I go back to India, I can easily get a 100k USD job in India for example at Qualcolmm, money with which I can buy stuff equivalent to 400k-500k in the US.  If H1B gets scrapped, the companies can do the same as Qualcomm and pay me 100k in India instead of paying an American with same qualification with amount of 400-500k. They are saving 300k in money.  \\nSome of the potential H1B people have a good case for working in the US.","title":"Trump recently"},{"text":"The Republicans created an extremely effective propaganda machine.

What about someone who was making average output asking for a raise to match? This is the general problem, for race I'm going to say it's statistically significant and move on, but for sex there's another elephant in the room, maternity leave. Paid maternity leave makes female workers a liability, and wanting to lower their wages to account for this additional cost is valid, while giving them the same hourly wage and externalizing the cost is subsidizing maternity leave. The libertarian solution to this is to end paid leave, people are paid hourly for the hours they work, and expected to simply take unpaid leave when they want. Conversely, you could do this just as well with a system where all paid leave is borrowing from future wages or inversely where paid leave given by default can be cashed in for more wages spread across the year. The real question here is do we want to subsidize under performing workers? My answer is no at least not in the businesses themselves, if we want to do that it's the government's job, and I don't think it would actually make it through congress because the people don't like the idea, with what we already have being gotten through under the false pretense of being anti-racist while simply being racist in an unconventional direction.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"How much has it changed?

It's intended to prevent the construction of unnecessary and excess healthcare facilities in places that do not need those facilities, while encouraging builders and systems to expand to underserved areas.Things I was not able to verify:Whether or not these laws have been effective.Whether or not these laws have been used to push needed care away from minorities, or restrict access to certain types of healthcare which Tennessean (Republican) leadership doesn't like.Whether or not the supposed limitations of Certificate of Need requirements have caused any harm in terms of healthcare access.Whether or not there are benefits to keeping these restrictions in place.Whether or not the movement against them is grassroots or manufactured.In short, I don't know much. I will say this: The first article I found (across multiple sites) cheers on \\"protecting workers' freedom to decide\\", in other words, Right to Work, a major force in the destruction of unions presented as false empowerment. The article also talks up how the legislature struck down a corporate tax hike and implemented education reform (No idea what that reform was, to be fair).They quote Mercatus Center Scholars (the Mercatus Center is a libertarian free-market thinktank) about how the red tape of CON laws has caused problems.They heavily emphasize that unelected bureaucrats \\"act as gatekeepers\\".There's also a cheap shot or two at COVID lockdowns, suggesting that the government shouldn't have the power to enact those either.... Oh, also, the author is affiliated with the Center for Individual Freedom, a conservative policy advocacy organization best known for trying to say that we should really stop with all those restrictions on smoking tobacco.For reference, two of the places I found the article:https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/09/tennessee-amendments-2022-election-results-1-2-3-4-tn/69610893007/https://www.tennesseeorthopaedicsociety.com/news/why-its-finally-time-to-eliminate-all-certificate-of-need-laws-in-tennesseeFor opposing viewpoints, here's one by Wendy Long, who is CEO and president of the Tennessee Hospital Association.https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2024/03/18/tennessee-health-care-certificate-of-need-law/72972244007/Main point in that one seems to be that, without CON laws, facilities that are more heavily for-profit and ignore or avoid un- or under-insured patients would propagate unrestricted, with the non-profit facilities that desperately need the wealthier patients to help balance their books being effectively stripped of funding by proximity.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"Obama wasn't really an exception.

Democrats voted against this.Since then, every Democrat has opposed money=speech and every Republican has supported it. In 2016, there was an open seat at the Supreme Court--the deciding seat on this very issue. The Democratic candidate mentioned loudly, often, and unprompted that the seat would go to someone who would overturn money=speech.There has been no opportunity since then for Democrats to overturn the case nor even to pass laws to mitigate the damage it caused.Now people complain, 'But Democrats take money too.'

That's a shame.Trump's maximum pressure strategy was more than just \\"fuck Obama\\" (although sadly that encompassed part of the reason he left the deal). It was a strategy designed to bring Iran to its knees economically. I'm not saying it was a good plan. In fact, I do think he should've stayed in the deal even if the deal sadly did indirectly subsidize Iran's nefarious actions in the Middle East. The original deal should've addressed that but oh well. Trump left the deal and instead of developing an actual response to Iran's growing nuclear ambitions these past 4 years, it seems all Biden has done is really not have a strategy and just blame Trump. Like yes he shouldn't have left the deal but that was then. Biden has been in office for 4 years. He also shoulders a lot of responsibility for Iran's nuclear program developing so much.I'm not sucking off Trump but it seems you are sucking off the Ayatollah by explicitly saying he's allowed to have nukes.

Unless you think that Iran is actually spending that money on healthcare, education &amp; infrastructure for its people ??Oh I dont deny that Trump has significant responsibility here. But your initial message implies that Trump is the sole reason for Iran getting a nuke as if Biden hasnt been POTUS for the last 4 years. Yes Trump fucked up by leaving that nuclear deal (which objectively did help Iran fund its terrorist activities if were being honest here). But Biden has had 4 years to solve this. Maybe Biden shouldve either kept Trumps maximum pressure strategy and then leveraged Irans weakness after Israeli strikes to get a new deal or maybe he shouldve got back in the nuclear deal earlier on. But he didnt have any real Iran strategy. So yes Trump probably shouldnt have left the deal without a real plan (although I guess maximum pressure was his plan apparently). But blaming him for Iran being MUCH closer to a nuke today is stupid when Biden has had the last few years to resolve this either diplomatically or militarily. But Biden didnt have any strategy.

And I think sexism and racism absolutely still exists. But the pay gaps do not prove that there is widespread actice discrimination going on in the workplace. The gender pay gap seems to exist largely due to women making very different choices than women when it comes to their career or whether they prioritize spending time with their children over spending time at work. Now, some of that may be due to sexism but it's certainly not primarily due to women being actively discriminated against in the workplace. And racial pay gap in the case of African-Americans is certainly to a large extent due to still lingering effects of historic racism. But the pay gap does not show that there is still widespread direct, active racism towards African-Americans in the workplace today in 2024. And in the case of other ethnicities it's much more to do with the fact that some immigrants like Latinos for example tend to be from rather poor socioeconomic backgrounds when they first arrive in the US. But if the pay gap was actually evidence of widespread racism in the workplace than that would also mean that there must be a massive pro-Asian bias among employers, given that Asian Americans earn much more than other ethnic groups, even more than white Americans. So if racism was the main reason than why do Asians earn so much more than others? And why do people from Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Uruguay earn more than the average white American, while other Latinos earn significantly less?","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"I normally just lurk here, but this comment is too stupid to ignore.

So he is just as liable to that child for compensation for that dependent state. He can't just work a 9-5 and shove an entire 16 hour day of caretaking onto his child's mom (or if both are employed, shove the \\"caretaking shift\\" onto her when they get home).Men's negligence causes this gap. I'd call that sexism, but it doesn't really matter what you call it. It's a means by which men exploit women's labor to supplement their careers via free childcare.most people don't exactly enjoy 9 to 5 jobs, and so to some women being a stay at home parent, or just not having a full-time job may be preferable over working 40 to 50 hours in some stressful, toxic bs corporate job or something. And women who perform domestic labor it's not like they're not compensated for that as well in the form of food, shelter, healthcare and often also access to joint bank accounts.Shared finances only make up for this if 1) each partner is completing equal amounts of labor (including both waged and unwaged together), which is not usually the case because you can't just \\"clock out\\" of childcare - it's a 16-hour-per-day gig. *And* if 2) each partner has equal access to that money (ie. so if she doesn't need to pursue alimony to gain legal access to it, but if she actually has immediate access to her share of the paycheck which was enabled by her labor, and he is prevented from interrupting that access, such as by a lean on his paycheck). Otherwise, she doesn't have income for that labor. She only gains access to a \\"company town,\\" like American railroad strikers in the 1800s.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Well, if Biden's going to strike Iran, he better bring some of that Family Feud energy with him.

Call it paranoia from covid but I really really really hope we take this it's seriously.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"That difference is that women get pregnant and men don't. The sexism is in foisting the burden of procreation and childcare on women. So that it's the women who must take responsibility for condoms and contraception, for what happens in these measures fail. For payment of financial costs of childbirth. For caring for the resulting  child, or finding someone else who can do so.  For taking off time to care for an infant, for the child, for the child who becomes sick. And often for the disabled or elderly relative as well. All simply because they can become pregnant.As I understand racism exists so that some women can get others to provide this care. I'm thinking of Queen Victoria who bore 8 children and had wet nurses for all of them. Not to mention the numerious upper-class women who had slaves and servants caring for their houses, children, and elderly relatives. They could afford this because their husbands were paid far more than the average woman. Paid more because of slavery, classism, and imperialism-- all systemic ills. \\\\Ok, but what exactly is that supposed to mean? I mean if you're married and you're a stay at home parent you often already have joint bank accounts and are able to access your spouses finances. Of course the home is a workplace, but it's not like those who do this work are not compensated for it. If you're a stay at home parent you normally have shelter, food, healthcare and typically also get money from your spouse who works full time. So how exactly should we \\"recognize\\" that the home is a workplace?I think we can agree that work is production of goods and services. If you are providing goods or services you are working.  Care for children, the disabled, and elderly are essential services. Thus, doing so is work.  Those who engage in home caregiving or would like to do so don't necessarily have a partner with a high-paying job. That  families can afford caregiving on the wages of only one adult is inequity on a larger levelIf we recognize this as work, then we must also recognize the home as a place where work is done.   \\nNot recognizing the economic value of home caregiving is the root of sexism. If we are to end sexism and racism, we must provide adequate compensation to those who provide care, regardless of who those people are or where they live.  Factories around the world often rely on unpaid caregiving to keep costs down--resulting in a few people to make enough to support a family on the wages of only one adult.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"100%.

Also Americans:"},{"text":"The American people refuse to hold them accountable","title":"Kamala Harris Heads to Capitol to Swear-In Senators Who Wont Even Say Her Name Right"},{"text":"So, you asked for a spark of hope and I figured I would explain what gives me hope here. At least, a shred of it. Firstly, I do not think Trump will become President for life. The systems in place that he would have to turn over require people to enable that. He *needs* a Congress that will say \\"You know what? Yeah, let's give this guy another shot and upend the explicit language in the Consitution.\\" There is no shield for them to hide behind by doing this. There are two provisions they would have overturn. The 22nd Amendment (term limits) and Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 (elections are up to the states). So, not only do they need a Consitutional convention, which requires 34 States to call, they also need 38 States to Ratify. There are 25ish solid Red states. Even if you discount swing states, blue states alone are 20ish. So, not only would they need EVERY Red state + Swing state, they would also need several Blue states on board. Now look at what is happening on Congress right now with Mike Johnson and the recent budget. Even WITH Trump's desire to remove the debt ceiling, Mike Johnson got a bill through that did not have the removal of our debt ceiling. Sure, Trump and Elon were able to spike the previous bill, but they did not get their golden goose and they did not get a shutdown under Biden. Now, Johnson is looking like he is going to BARELY squeak by if he remains the Speaker of the House. That is, if he even retains it, because the margins are so thin that a few Congress members can tank it. So, zoom out, and think about how strong of a grip Trump *really* has on the party. Is this a party that is going to be able to come together and get a Constitutional convention called and then ratified for the express purpose of installing Trump as President for life? Trump's entire shtick is projecting strength. Even if it is not there.Next, we can talk about Trump himself. Two things are notable about him that prevent his worst impulses. First, he views the stock market as a barometer of his success. Secondly, he *hates* negative media coverage. Which is why he lashes out when he gets it, but also still allows reporters for publications like The NYT to be at Mar-A-Lago. \\"Everyone wants to be my friend now, I guess I've changed.\\" Remember that little quip from a few weeks ago? He revels in being praised. His entire goal is not to enact policies, he does not give a shit about that. He wants wealth and he wants praise. The worst things he can do will guarantee a stock market crash and will certainly guarantee that he gets blasted wall-to-wall in the media.Lastly, he has painted the GOP into a corner with his cult of personality and a cabinet full of inept loyalists. He has made A LOT of promises and he has until the mid-terms to keep them. While his base will not leave him, look at the past few elections. We went from Obama to Trump. That isn't because a whole bunch of people who were politically engaged with well informed ideas suddenly flipped. No. A whole bunch of reactionary, low informed voters went out and voted. While also Trump 'activated' a whole bunch of people that felt like the system forgot about them. The first group there will likely swing back Blue if things get really awful.  The second group, the ones that are totally devoted to Trump really aren't going to show up for the mid-terms since he isn't on the ticket. [See: the massive blue wave that happened in 2018. 234 to 198.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/07/us/politics/how-democrats-took-the-house.html) Trump's presidency ended up with the GOP getting CRUSHED. You think Trump smoked Kamala? Maybe he did, although it again came down to a couple hundred thousand votes in a few states, but the rest of the party underperformed him. These tend to happen, 2006 and 2010 were also massive shifts. To the left and right respectively.So, if you are a GOP member in Congress, you have to think about how shitty you can let things get for the people in your district. Some of them will win no matter what, yeah, but many of them are not so safe. Especially once Elon decides to stick his fingers in the pie with primary challengers and carves the votes up. So, now you are faced with a President that promised the world and won't deliver it, in fact he might just make things shittier in all likelihood (and you, oh wise Congress member, know he will), who also is carried by a base that doesn't transfer that love downballot. Really makes it unlikely that any of them are going to just set the world on fire for him.Trump himself is also pulled in several conflicting directions. You have Rubio for SoState who is a war hawk while others are increasingly isolationist / non-interventionist. You have a DoH head that is basically a Democrat that hates vaccines and medicine but also have big pharma lobbies invading every corner of Washington. You have an FBI Director that is going to waste time going after Liz Cheney and Anne Selzer. While the Orange Grinch at the top's heart grows 3 sizes after the election. You can look at his comments after winning in 2016 re: Hillary. or his comments about RBG dying when he was caught off guard by the news. or how he acts on a podcast like Theo Vonn or Lex Friedman's. I hate the man, but he is ultimately a human with emotions. He is not the unflinching projection of strength and anger that someone really really evil like Putin is.I could go on, but you probably get the point by now. What we are going to see is basically George W. Bush 2. That is not particularly comforting but just like we went Bush - Obama - Trump, the pendulum swings. The 82 year old with a cabinet full of sycophants is not getting 25th'd out by JD Vance. JD Vance is a ghost right now, he likely will continue to be since Trump doesn't like sharing the attention. Much like Obama to Hillary, passing the torch does not mean the people follow.Hope that helps.","title":"What does an America without democracy look like?

I never saw, nor can I find, a single place in which she spoke in depth on economic topics.","title":"James Carville admits why Democrats lost and he was wrong. He didnt listen to himself"},{"text":"No... not like this.And is that really what you took from this commentary? That's what you have to say? Nothing about the actual topic at hand? It really comes off as contrarian...Either way, here's another post of mine that explains it. Maybe it'll help....A potent combination of a unitary executive, broad immunities for the president, executive actions like schedule F, and a MAGA coalition of loyalists that will consolidate power by exploiting Trump's ego to take as much control of the administrative state as they can and pave the way for something resembling a one party system of government with Trump at its helm.This is what we've been warned about, at least those of us who didn't just vote a demagogue back into office because...  *feelings*. This is the future that political junkies and analysts have been calling a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"Schedule F is an executive action that the Trump administration tried implementing towards the end of his previous term, It's also a major policy proposal included in Project 2025. It attempts to strip protections from civil servants whose government positions will depend largely on their allegiance to the president and his agenda. Schedule F, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities granted to the president, will afford Republicans the power to cripple the system of checks and balances holding our democracy together, helping them to consolidate power for the foreseeable future.Project 2025 laid it all out in their manifesto, while heritage foundation members and \\"America first\\" Trump allies have been preparing for this eventuality. People who have already been nominated/appointed to positions of power within Trump's new admin.The Unitary executive Theory is another major goal of project 2025, and a proposal that's been floated before by Republicans. Bill Barr was a major proponent, and it's part of the reason why he shot down the Mueller investigations efforts to hold Trump accountable for obstruction. The UET proposes that the president has unchecked powers and complete control over the executive branch.The goal is to eliminate the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of the executive, crippling the separation of powers in the process and giving Trump unilateral authority over the administrative state. These actions will allow The Trump administration to then install loyalists into positions of power within these agencies, and positions that were formerly reserved for non-partisan civil servants, knowledgeable staff and experts in their field, whose job security didn't previously depend on their loyalty to the president. These are also positions that the president should have no hiring authority over. And come next year, Republicans will have the best opportunity they've had in years to see this agenda through because they'll have a Trump administration with unchecked powers, a Republican majority in both houses, and a conservative SCOTUS.It might seem a little confusing because part of their goal is to \\"gut the administrative state,\\" which is also sometimes called the fourth branch of government, and includes every government agency you can think of that's responsible for running and regulating day to day operations in this country.However, the other part involves taking what's left, dismantling our democratic system of checks and balances, and creating a government that serves the Republican party.Hence, a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"The next Trump administration is also preparing to create new agencies out of thin air, offering people like Elon Musk a top role in these agencies.From this standpoint, they'll have the perfect opportunity to implement a far right agenda backed by special/rich interests, right wing think tanks, dark money groups, Christian nationalists, far right jingoists, corporate powers with the same rights as American citizens, foreign autocrats, right wing power brokers, billionaires, xenophobes, conspiracy theorists, and in some cases, white supremacists...This is an agenda that will also pave the way for future Republican administrations to continue reinforcing their power while setting up roadblocks for any progressive, or even populist efforts or movements that may arise. Because make no mistake, this ain't populism, it more closely resembles an age of modern day robber barons with corrupt ties to politicians, or vice versa. Hell, in some cases, they're basically synonymous.","title":"RFK Jr. Is Trying to Write Himself Out of 2019 Samoan Measles Epidemic"},{"text":"Why should anyone else care that he never had a chance to serve as a ranking chair on a Congressional committee?

And I am not denying that sexism towards women absolutely still does exist.But I do think that there's still quite a bit more nuance to it. So on one hand I think there are genuine differences between the sexes, and I think especially if a woman carries a child for 9 months, which is of course a very intimate and emotional thing she may also be more more inclined to take time off work to look after that child that she carried for so long. It may have something to do with evolution and biology.And also I think quite a lot of women may genuinely actually want to have their spouse or partner take care of them financially. I mean after all most people don't exactly enjoy 9 to 5 jobs, and so to some women being a stay at home parent, or just not having a full-time job may be preferable over working 40 to 50 hours in some stressful, toxic bs corporate job or something. And women who perform domestic labor it's not like they're not compensated for that as well in the form of food, shelter, healthcare and often also access to joint bank accounts.Though, don't get me wrong, I think you made some good points and sexism certainly still exists. But I do think there's quite a bit more nuance to it, not everything is just because of sexism.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"The right choice sadly Trump wants them jailed","title":"Biden to award Presidential Citizens Medals to 20 recipients, including Liz Cheney"},{"text":"I do not think so.","title":"Cybertruck Bomber in Army, Married to Rabid Anti-Trump Democrat"},{"text":"I wonder fucking why","title":"74-Year-Old Democrat Who Ran Against AOC Offers Infuriating Defense"},{"text":"There may be some genetic predisposition towards women gravitating to these roles, I don't know.

I'm the husband but in my marriage it's my wife who went to college and has the career and I'm the main caretaker for the kids and do a ton of housework.

Why is there a wealth disparity between white and black families?Largely because of historic racism. You know slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, and open hostility towards black Americans that has persisted for quite a while even after Jim Crow laws were abolished. Because of this black Americans have been pushed into the worst neighbourhoods in the country with awfully underfunded schools and public services.So that's why African-Americans are still more likely to grow up poor which as a result means they're typically also less likely to get high paying jobs later in life.But this does not prove that there is still massive widespread workplace discrimination against African Americans. And in fact recent immigrants from Africa earn significantly more than African-Americans whose ancestors have been in the US for hundreds of years. So clearly there is more at play here than just outright workplace discrimination.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Sure, but the lower picture is also true for most Democrats.

But I think it's a lot more nuanced than just put all the blame on sexism or racism. I mean there are still for example very real differenes between men and women.And so if you carry a child for 9 months many women may potentially indeed prefer to take some time off work, rather than immediately going back to some corporate job. And I think this inclination may in fact be rooted in evolution and biology. Though on the other hand I can also see how sexism is still in many ways fairly prevelant and so some of it may also have to dow this sexism. But I just think that the gender pay gap itself does not prove widesperad sexism in the workplace, and that there is quite a lot more nuance to it than many people, particularly on the left, seem to think.As for the racial pay gap, black Americans are certainly way more likely to grow up poor due to the still lingerinc effects of historic racism like Jim Crow, redlining etc. And so if you grow up poor you're also less likely to get a high paying job later in life. But I just don't think that today in 2024 direct racism in the workplace today is particularly prevelant, and the racial pay gap does not show that actual direct racism in the workplace is a major issue.To end this, we must recognize that caregiving is work and that the home is a workplace.Ok, but what exactly is that supposed to mean? I mean if you're married and you're a stay at home parent you often already have joint bank accounts and are able to access your spouses finances. Of course the home is a workplace, but it's not like those who do this work are not compensated for it. If you're a stay at home parent you normally have shelter, food, healthcare and typically also get money from your spouse who works full time.

When we talk about a pay gap in gender we aren't really concerned in if a gap exists. We want to know if a gap exists specifically because of gender as the only difference between individual i and j. Controlling for some factors is simple like education or experience, what is not so easy is controlling for factors we have very little data for or metrics that would be subjective in their evaluation. For instance wage negotiations or how often wage increases are asked for. If the difference between wages is explained by men asking for raises more often it can hardly be deemed discrimination. If the difference is explained by men choosing riskier payment options say a contract with some piece rate but a lower base wage that has a higher expected value to compensate for the risk. Both of these would be in line with the knowledge that men on average are less risk averse than women and if this holds at work we would expect a difference. However measuring risk aversion in the contexts that it is relevant to ones pay is rather difficult. We know the difference exists but we cannot exactly just plug a mean value to the regressions and call it a day. This is hardly the only omitted variable that may pose problems in the analysis. The issue in studying wage differences between men and women is that we are comparing two groups that are distinctly different in their behaviour (so we know there are differences) but we are unable to accurately control for these (we don't have data in the context that we would need it in as companies dont track it).For the racism part his argument is faulty as a comparison of means is not how these studies are ran to begin with but here we do not have a reason to expect distinct differences between groups at least not to the extent as with men and women. There are some cultural factors but these are largely irrelevant in expectation to behaviour in the workplace that would affect ones wage or I am not aware of such studies existing. However your counter is also faulty. We do see poor white people face the exact same issue. Look at within-EU immigration and the wages that eastern european immigrants are working for. They do earn less even after controls. I would agree here that it is racism but inconveniently for you shows that being white does not exclude one from prejudices.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Any time a Republican does something they don't agree with other chronically online/delusional Republicans just say that it's a liberal pretending to be a Republican, that the media is lying, or that the person is a FBI/CIA plant lmfao.","title":"Driver In the Las Vegas Cybertruck Incident, Who Shot Himself Before Detonation, Was A Trump Supporter, Not A Dem/Liberal/Progressive"},{"text":"I get it.

By studying how differences in income between men and women changed over time, Goldin and her co-authors, Marianne Bertrand and Lawrence Katz, demonstrated in an article from 2010 that initial earnings differences are small. However, as soon as the first child arrives, the trend changes; earnings immediately fall and do not increase at the same rate for women who have a child as they do for men, even if they have the same education and profession. Studies from other countries have confirmed Goldins conclusion and parenthood can now almost entirely explain the income differences between women and men in high-income countries. Goldin showed that this motherhood effect can partly be explained by the nature of contemporary labour markets, where many sectors expect employees to be constantly available and flexible in the face of the employers demands. Because women often take greater responsibility than men for childcare, for example, this makes career progression and earnings increases more difficult. Tasks that are hard to combine with part-time work also make it more challenging to maintain a career for the person in the household, usually the woman, who chooses to reduce their working hours. All these factors have far-reaching consequences for womens earnings.https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/popular-information/It's about women taking more time off for their kids than men do.

They don't prove that white women are being systemically discriminated against by our bosses, that's correct. They do, however, prove that *something* in our system is discriminating against us.Now, for example women, on average, work significantly fewer years than men and take significantly more time off work than the average man. Women are also more likely to work part-time and, on average, work fewer hours per day. And they're more likely to pursue low paying careers like for example childcare work or retail jobs, and less likely to pursue high paying professions like surgeons or engineers.Women complete *waged* labor for significantly fewer years, take more time off from *waged* labor, and complete fewer hours per day of *waged* labor.The problem isn't that women work less overall (stats show the reverse is true). The problem is that the work of which women *are* completing disproportionately high quantities (domestic and childcare labor) is almost entirely unpaid.Now could it be that sexism may be partially to blame as to why women pursue lower-paing careers and are still much more likely then men to take time off work to look after children? Maybe, sure. But it's hard to say to what extent. There are probably also millions of women who genuinely prefer being a stay-at-home mum or who really may not be interested in pursuing a high-paying but at the same time extremely stressful career that requires crazy hours.Every child that a woman takes care of has a father, as well as a mother. But only one of the two genders is consistently absorbing the economic cost of unpaid parenting labor.If your kid's dad isn't in the picture, or your kid's dad is the \\"breadwinner,\\" or both you and their dad work but he doesn't take the time after work to prepare meals, clean, or get children ready for bed, or take off work to pick up your kids from school, or to take them on school trips ... what are you supposed to do? Just also refuse? No, women see (accurately) that our children would be collateral damage in such a gender war, so most moms just choose not to fight it. They just pick up the slack. Which means less energy and time to spend on waged labor.This is called the Motherhood Penalty, and is a well-documented fact. Women's wages go down with parenthood. Men's don't. Because men don't absorb that burden; they just leave it and assume their childrens' mothers will pick it up.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"No, it is not.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"ahhh yes the J6 committee that couldnt get the job done and now we have the J6 ring leader as our president again, yes lets give out that gold sticker and an orange slice for them.

Could it be that these women have other jobs, for which they receive no pay? They also take low-earning jobs, ones compatible with their unpaid work.So why don't they receive compensation?  Surely this a systemic problem with how we provide care to children,  the disabled, and the elderly, and systemic problem with who provides that care.Dig deeper into these problems and we find racism. Those providing such care are disproportionately women of color. White women can often pay women of color to take over their home jobs of cleaning, childcare, and eldercare--taking advantage of a racist system. The man more the most part have simply taken this distribution of labor as a matter of course, not accepting responsibility for these jobs; the system hasn't asked it of them.To end this, we must recognize that caregiving is work and that the home is a workplace.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Did he have a death wish?","title":"Cybertruck Bomber in Army, Married to Rabid Anti-Trump Democrat"},{"text":" Does that mean there's a bunch of pro-Asian bias going on?\\nMy guess would be selection bias consider the massive amounts of poverty in Asian.

Or that there isn't sufficient proof to say that there isn't workplace discrimination at all?Because I don't think you are fully wrong about the first (at least based on old studies I can no longer find - which may mean they may not be true anymore, too). There is some evidence that men and women entering the same company around the same time doing the same job are compensated about as well as each other, though people can anecdotally find exceptions (that usually favor men). However, the subset of gendered pairs that fit the above criteria is insignificant. Due to systemic sexism, men are more likely to switch companies (their wives are expected to follow) and are more likely to choose companies that don't offer work-life balance because women are expected to attend to domestic duties more frequently. You've noted that (though with the qualifier \\"maybe\\" - it's not maybe).However, the link below discusses a study that notes that women may be rated as higher-performing but with less \\"potential\\" than their male counterparts. \\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/women-are-less-likely-men-to-be-promoted-heres-one-reason-why\\nAs a result, men are more likely to receive promotions than their female counterparts. This technically puts them in \\"different jobs\\" so the pay-gap discussion isn't relevant. But it is still absolutely workplace discrimination. And I don't think it is necessarily overt. The link notes that the qualities that we perceive as being useful for leaders are more positively attributed to men than women (commanding vs bossy; confident vs. arrogant, etc.) So when there are complaints of workplace discrimination, it's not the narrow band of the pay gap between people in the same position - the potential for promotions also come into play.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Yeah, I got banned from r/Army just for pointing out the Military.com chief editor is an ivy league progressive with no military experience.","title":"Reddit will never be great again."},{"text":"More women are expected to be care takers because women overall have lower paying positions, on average.

Her [work](https://www.cato.org/blog/nobel-prize-winner-claudia-goldin-gender-pay-gap) more or less concludes that the gender wage gap is not the result of deliberate discrimination in the work place, but is rather the result of the fact that women tend to place a much higher emphasis on temporal flexibility (i.e. the ability to take time off and work flexible hours) due to their caretaking responsibilities. Whether or not you consider the societal expectation for women to take care of children and the elderly discrimination is a more nuanced question. For example, in a lot of highly compensated, high status professions like law, consulting, medicine or banking, pay brackets are pretty standardized for early career professionals. But what you find is that five or ten years down the line, the women are much less likely to working in the highest compensated elements of the field. In medicine, women are less likely to specialize in surgical specialties. In law, finance and consulting, women are less likely to stay on the partner track and instead tend to move to jobs that pay less but have better work-life balance.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Emily Amick just explained it on her IG: the outcome of this is that internet service providers will be able to control the speed of the internet that comes into your home on a preferential basis.

Back then he headed an anti-vaccine non profit called \\"The Children's Health Defense\\" organization, which, in a disturbingly ironic sort of way, contributed to the deaths of dozens of children...But first,RFK Jr has made it clear that his goals as health secretary, in exchange for loyalty to Trump of course, will be to acknowledge discredited health \\"experts\\" and conspiracy theories, reinforce distrust in the professional medical community, and jeopardize public health by getting on board with the MAGA agenda to cripple the independence of government agencies, especially agencies like the CDC, FDA, the NIH, etc...RFK Jr. is a disastrous pick for this position in the sense that he's capable of doing some serious damage to public health.And this is made all the more evident by his involvement in the measles outbreak in Samoa that claimed the lives of some 83 people.Before I get into it, make sure to tune into *Behind the Bastards* recent four-part series that examines RFK Jr.'s life and career.It's an eye opening look at the guy's lifelong privilege, and his pattern of bizarre, abusive, perverse and hypocritical behavior.That being said, In 2019, there was a measles outbreak in Samoa that led to the deaths of 83 people, mostly children. What did Kennedy have to do with this? Well, of course he denies any involvement, but he visited the island a few months prior to the outbreak, and at the time, he led the Children's Health Defense organization, an anti-vax non profit.His non profit helped spread misinformation pertaining to vaccines that contributed to a decline in measles vaccinations. During his trip to Samoa, he publicly supported prominent anti-vax voices there and by exploiting the power of his last name, lent legitimacy to those voices who were very effective at stoking vaccine hesitancy.Now, prior to 2019, measles wasn't a problem in Samoa, however, in 2018, two infants died after receiving the measles vaccine. The country temporarily placed its vaccination program on hold, and Kennedy's Children's Health Defense took advantage of the tragedy to raise questions about the safety of the measles vaccine. Consequently the vaccination rate plummeted.As it turns out however, the deaths of the infants had nothing to do with the measles vaccine, and everything to do with tragic human error. Nurses administering the vaccine accidentally mixed it with a muscle relaxant, which is what killed the infants.Kennedy and his non profit did not walk back their statements afterwards, particularly as vaccination rates were dropping rapidly in the region.When he visited the island in 2019before the outbreakhe promoted anti-vaxxers and anti-vax rhetoric. He especially lent credibility to voices there that were still using the deaths of the infants to push a narrative. He had a meeting with Taylor Winterstein, a prominent Samoan Australian vaccination foe. In an Instagram post featuring a photo of her with Kennedy, Winterstein wrote, I am deeply honoured to have been in the presence of a man I believe is, can and will change the course of history. This was a divinely timed, once in a lifetime opportunity and I will forever cherish the conversations and moments we shared together in Samoa. She added hashtags used by anti-vaxxers. Public health experts complained Kennedys visit to Samoa helped amplifly anti-vax voices.Kennedy claimed that his meeting with Winterstein was just a coincidence, not \\"divinely timed.\\" He eventually admitted however, that his trip to Samoa had been arranged with a popular anti-vaxxer, Edwin Tamasese. The trip was paid for by the CHD. The point of the trip, he insisted, was to discuss with government officials the introduction of a medical informatics system that would allow Samoas health officials to assess, in real time, the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health. This would include questioning the value of vaccinations.After the measles outbreak in 2019, the government quickly implemented an emergency vaccination program that was compulsory for the population. Kennedy's anti-vax connections on the island vehemently opposed this measure. The operation was compared to Nazi Germany. Tamasese called it a killing spree. He declared the vaccination operation the greatest crime against our people and suggested the vaccine itself was the cause of the outbreak. Tamasese advocated against the use of conventional medicine and antibiotics and urged people to rely on papaya leaf extract and vitamins instead of the vaccine and antibiotics.During this time, Kennedy wrote to the prime Minister, *and he encouraged Samoa officials to examine the measles vaccine to 'determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine.'*Kennedy and these anti-vax voices were pushing the idea that the vaccine itself was responsible for the deaths during the outbreak.The Samoan government declared a state of emergency, and pushed back against prominent anti-vaxxers. Soon after that, Kennedy wrote a blog post for the CHD site that called Tamasese a medical freedom hero. He referred to the 2019 blast of measles in Samoa as merely a mild measles outbreak and praised Tamasese for having infuriated the Global Medical Cartel. He suggested that the vaccine, along with lousy hospital protocols, had caused the deaths. So yah, he's a piece of shit. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. While to this day, he continues to deny his involvement and his responsibility in the Samoa tragedy.Again, this is the guy Trump is appointing as secretary of health. Let that sink in. Imagine this scenario I've laid out for you, but on a national scale.In a better world, this would have disqualified him from working in any government position, let alone director of HHS. Trump and his allies have already outlined a plan to first eliminate the independence of most government agencies, cleanse these agencies of anyone who is not loyal to the MAGA agenda, then put them under the direct control of the president and an executive with newly granted unilateral powers and broad immunities.By doing this, they can install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for non-partisan civil servants and educated experts in their respective fields. They'll target the FDA, the CDC, the EPA, all public health related agencies, and may even try to eliminate them altogether.","title":"RFK Jr. Is Trying to Write Himself Out of 2019 Samoan Measles Epidemic"},{"text":"I've heard that too but I can one up you.

The pay gap is assessed by comparing people from different groups working the same job. For example, female surgeons make, on average, 84 cents for every male surgeons dollar. Same with female teachers vs male teachers. The argument that women (or racial minorities) work different, lower paying jobs does not actually factor into the wage gap calculation. 2. If we want to talk about which careers different groups pursue, we must also talk about what opportunities are available to them. Racial minorities are significantly more likely to experience poverty which reduces availability of and opportunity to pursue things like internships (especially unpaid). We also have to consider things like admissions and job applications. For higher paying jobs that require further education as well as job applications in general, there have been quite a few studies that show someone who has more of an ethnic name is less likely to be hired/admitted or even offered an interview than someone with the same qualifications with an Anglo-Saxon name. With the removal of affirmative action in higher education, we have already seen a decline in admission of black and latine applicants. 3. You made a point about women that included women taking more time off and working fewer years which actually fights your assertion. Employers absolutely factor things like potential pregnancy and maternity leave into their hiring decisions which is inherently sexist. 4. Its near impossibly to unequivocally prove that sexism or racism is the cause of the wage gap because often these are subconscious influences, not necessarily conscious decisions. To write them off as possible influences just because there is no test to prove their presence is disingenuous itself.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Yes that is discrimination","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Slightly west of you in MN, I have to pay an extra $12 a month for uncapped from Xfinity.

By acting as a platform and not competing with their customers, American drone companies can achieve the scale needed to drive down costs and compete with DJI. In the age of AI, a single low-cost drone with high-resolution sensors and a GPU can run a variety of software applications that can make it significantly more capable than a comparable Chinese system. \\nFood for thought for other redditors: I can publish a substack if I want to (no particular offense, Ill look through for relevant sources and the other guests expertise)","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"Oh, dear god, how things have shifted.

Each encounter comes with an innate chance of an expression of romantic interest in one's direction (detected or not, doesn't matter). Let's assume you meet 80k people in your life split 50/50 along gendered lines. If you're straight you're interested in the gender of approximately 40k then (slightly less but we're being generous). Each person has an \\"innate\\" (it's not technically immutable) \\"attraction\\" chance where it's 1 out of the number of sides on your attraction die. There's an incredibly high variance here. Some lucky bastards are rolling a d100 or d1000 (they're really, really, ridiculously good looking, OK?). They're going out to a club, meeting dozens of people and a couple will express interest.Many poor unfortunates are rolling a d10k or even d100k (they're unattractive people inside, out, or some combination). They're going to the club dozens of times, meeting dozens of people each time, and no one is expressing interest.The chance that a person will fail all of their rolls throughout their life is (1-1/d)^40k where d is the number of sides of the attraction die. For the D100 folks it's almost certain you'll be approached at some point in your life. For D10000s though, there's only ~20% chance that you'll be approached *in your entire lifetime*. Chances are that at least some subset of people are going to fail all those dice rolls. Even if there's only 5 d10000s on the planet (there's likely millions) chances are at least 1 has never been approached.And remember, each step along the way we were being *generous* to your premise. I didn't factor that people are only interested in others within a certain age range. I didn't factor in that people are only interested in others under specific circumstances. I didn't factor in that just because you meet someone doesn't mean you actually have a meaningful interaction which would foster an approach. I didn't factor in that sexual minorities have higher d numbers merely because they're interested in a much smaller slice of people. I assumed every single time you met someone you rolled your die. All of these make it *more* likely that the unattractive folk don't meet a person who approaches them.","title":"CMV: I dont think theres really people who have never been approached by anyone of the gender they are interested in."},{"text":"Well, once some Americans figure out what that means, they'll be pretty upset","title":"US appeals court blocks Biden administration effort to restore net neutrality rules"},{"text":"Oligarchy in action.

For example, some carriers may restrict bandwidth when their customers use Netflix to stream videos rather than their own streaming service. This means a user may be able to stream 4k video on one platform perfectly fine, but not at all on another.Some of the issues with non-neutral networks may actually seem like a benefit at first glance C providing free or priority access to particular services. This is when a telco provides free or no-data usage of particular services, usually ones that they own or have a financial relationship with, to make their network seem more appealing than a competitor.By providing privileged access to services from their business partners and affiliates while stifling others, non-neutral ISPs can stifle the competition and make it harder for other businesses to provide services in the same area.What seemed like a good deal for the end-user at first, actually ends up costing them more because they can no longer choose from other services. Over time, this practice can lead to monopolies that drive up prices and provide inferior services C causing detrimental flow-on effects for businesses and non-commercial users alike.edit to add.We can actually already see this here today in the US. Several cell phone carriers will forcibly lower the streaming quality of certain services, and 'allow' for 720p/1080p on their more-expensive 'unlimited' plans. So if you want to stream a 4GB 1080p youtube video, it will be forced down to 480p, but if you want to download a 4GB zip file, you get all 4GB of your data.

The US would blockade the entrance to the greater pacific between the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan, and provide resources to the east side of the island. China's main advantage in this scenario is US unwillingness to risk an all-out war by striking into mainland China, which preserves China's logistical advantage. This means air defenses and supply lines are safe, and they can extend significant air support into the island from their primarily land-based air force. The US would likely focus on providing Taiwan with AA resources to deny China complete air superiority.If China escalated beyond Taiwan, very different story. Air superiority is lost the moment they leave the straight, as the majority of their air force is land-based. US Naval air forces outnumber them 4:1, with far more experience and support from ground and naval-based Counterair assets in the region. They'd lose those 3 carriers to an AGM-84 or their newer brethren in a heartbeat, and be immediately restricted to land-based operations in the region.That last bit is the kicker. The size of their navy becomes moot beyond the SCS if they lose those carriers. You cannot fight a modern war without air support.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"Looks like thill will just be something will have to reinstate every time we come back into office huh...","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"Jason has no idea what tf he's talking about.

The amount of blaming of individual voters (or individual brown people often) on reddit for Donald Trump getting elected just gets tiring because it completely lets the democratic party off the hook, and doesn't acknowledge the realities of our voting system.  I totally take your point, there are anti-intellectual cultural issues and really education/media environment issues in this country that nominate a Donald Trump.  That being said, the Democratic Party doesn't get to pick and choose within their own voting base(despite trying super duper hard to), and it is literally their entire job to win elections and appeal to voters.  Add to that, they are the ones empowered to run the show, not individual voters.  I usually adopt a model of blame that goes top down rather than bottom up, but reddit seems far more convinced often, the person to blame is the lady who wrote in Taylor Swift, with very little question as to why.  As far as responsibility for this election, if I had to put a percentage on it, I have it more like 95% establishment democrats being at fault, 5% voter perception / cultural issues.

That means almost everyone has some kind of military training. They are going to go into the mountains and punish China to the extent that China will need to bring in materials fairly regularly. Most of those materials are going to the bottom of the Taiwan Strait because we only have to park subs there to sink those boats. And if we park several carrier groups there once we get our resources in line, then there is little China can do to stop an allied fleet. They just don't have the navy capable of taking on the US, Japan, some of Europe. That fleet is likely to include Japan, UK, SK, several other European countries. Maybe even Vietnam and the Philippines. Chinese military personnel wont be able to get the resources necessary to hold the island. China only hope at holding Taiwan is about one of two options: The US doesn't care and doesn't actually support Taiwan. That means we don't even fight. Or the Taiwanese accept Chinese authority and the US accepts that.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"exactly.","title":"Jason Hickel on why Kamala Harris lost"},{"text":" I disconnected from politics through the holidays.A break is always a good thing.

Every country acts in accordance to its own self-intrests. To say \\"something is selfish therefore wrong\\" is a principle that could be applied to all countries when they want something limitedThis utterly misunderstands my points and also puts blinkers on your own geopolitical understanding.Yes selfishness is an aspect of geopolitics. So is reciprocity, the rules based order, respecting that other nations. If you stop doing those things then other nations will not work with you as much or as well.Trump is about to test this, especially with his tariff threats - and many economists and geopolitical experts are warning of the severe impacts it could have. This is because it breaks those principles of reciprocity, rules and respect.Is Iceland selfish for its fishing claims because it benefits them? Is this small country now bad?Great comparison to compare and contrast.In one way - no, we don't begrudge Iceland for its fish and other ocean resource claims because it is a small island nation in the middle of a large ocean. Even if it gets a bit cheeky sometimes, we (as a global population and as nationstates) realise they are just trying to do a bit better for themselves.This doesn't compare well to the US, which is one of the richest countries in the world, trying to enrich itself even further. There is a general sentiment of \\"you've already got plenty mate, back off\\" But in cases like the [Rockall Dispute](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48724832) (BBC) ([Rockall Bank dispute - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockall_Bank_dispute)) where Iceland is genuinely encroaching on another country's claims - then yes it does become a point of geopolitical friction that worsens relations with Britain and makes more problems within the EEZ.But ultimately that is still a relatively minor dispute - the sort most have with their neighbours at least sometimes and can be smoothed over with time. It isn't the global stage gaff which is offering to buy Iceland.//That is what I mean when I say that it is insensitive and selfish. Not just that it is in the US's best interest - but that the offer increases geopolitical friction. If Greenland did, as you desire, vote to join the US then that is completely different (and may spark completely different tension). It is the viewing an entire country and people as just a hunk of land to be traded, and salivating over how much the US would gain from it that is insensitive.","title":"CMV: Trump is right about Greenland acquisition being a necessity to the United States of America.

He was completely oblivious because he just couldnt believe any woman would ever want him. He kept saying shit like Ive never been approached by women, I will die alone, when Ive seen women approaching him with my own eyes lmao ?? every time I would tell him and he would just deny it.

From the Internet: Taiwan's military includes around 169,000 active-duty personnel with a reserve force of up to 2.5 million. The armed forces are modernizing with indigenous technologies like the Hai Kun-class submarine, M1A2T Abrams tanks, HIMARS systems, and a robust air force of 600+ aircraft. Its navy has over 117 ships, including destroyers and frigates, focusing on defending against regional threats with advanced, agile capabilities.Those numbers pale in comparison to China, but consider the Taiwanese home advantage, local hostility/insurgency (invading armies always suffer), plus even indirect support from the US, it won't be a walk in the park for China. The US also may not be the only other nation that backs Taiwan. Japan and Australia would likely provide support in some capacity.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"Exactly.

This is something Noah Smith has written about many, many times, such as [in this article](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/manufacturing-is-a-war-now?r=1pduu4&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false), which is headlined by the graph showing China controlling half of all manufacturing in the near future.Your other points showing Chinas relative inferiority to WWII America are valid, but Id point out that most of the West is also experiencing demographic decline. The US itself is in a better position, but many US allies, including Taiwan and especially South Korea, are in worse positions than China.As for German tech superiority being a myth, Ive _heard_ of it being a myth (hence I literally didnt repeat the 5 Shermans for one Tiger tank line verbatim). But its still hard to shake off such a strong preconceived notion.Not to mention its not just about Nazi Germany, but its also the modus operandi of the whole reformer movement. Its easy to clown on them for their most inane suggestions (like not including ejector seats to simplify designs), but the whole idea of a few overengineered boondoggles will lose to many simpler but more rugged weapons seems appealing to a layperson like myself.As for the whole a Taiwan invasion will be a limited operation, eh I can very easily see it becoming a protracted war of attrition, even if it started out anything but. After all, the Russo-Ukraine war started out as a three-day special military operation.

Republican policies have been aimed at benefiting only the top.1%. So unless you're a billionaire, your statement is not true. As far as being bought and paid for, The Republicans engineered the citizens united ruling to allow unlimited corporate spending into politics. That was in 2007. It is only taking 17 years after that ruling for The power balance in our country to take a major shift. Yes, Democrats take money from lobbyists too, but that's a tricky situation because if they did not they would never win another election. They just wouldn't have the money to compete with the Republican messaging. The only real solution is to repeal citizens united, And to cap all political donations from any source to something low like $5,000. But the reality is Republicans have fucked us so bad that I'm not sure if we can recover. And as long as half of the country is supporting Republicans in their goal to fuck everybody over, we definitely can't win.At this point the only possible future America has as a democracy is for enough Republicans to say to themselves \\"oh my God what the fuck have I done?, I will never vote for Republicans again as long as I live\\"","title":"Democra$y in Action"},{"text":"The US has experience, and proven logistics.

Let's say the US and China engage in a conventional war over Panama, who do you think would win? I would say the US, and it wouldn't be particularly close.

The third largest and most capable deep water navy is their neighbor, enemy, and our ally, Japan. \\nIn order for China to defeat the US in open war, they would first need to cross the pacific, against the US Navy and Airforce, then breach our shores following combat with the US Coastguard and the USMC.

Assuming the United States isnt playing at all, thats going to be really hard. And one of the things that the U.S. Navy is working on right now is something called the Replicator Initiative, which will turn its ships into not just combat platforms, but manufacturing platforms to produce exactly the sorts of drones that would be needed to sink everything that the Chinese have in a short period of time.  In the case of a war. Hopefully itll never come to that, but Replicator is supposed to be operational by the end of calendar year 2027. Thats not that far away.](https://zeihan.com/the-future-of-naval-tech-war-on-the-seas/)\\nPeter also points out the fact that Russia is on the verge of a population collapse, like China and will likely experience a civilizational collapse in the next twenty years.

This analysis is incorrect because that model is flawed, and the players in this theoretical contest *do not* match up as you're asserting.First, there are a multitude of flaws and counterarguments to the material analysis - I can dig up just as many quotes suggesting that China is not catching up militarily. But there's also two structural reasons that the China = WWII USA and USA = WWII Germany parallels are absurd. On the one hand, Chinese manufacturing and demographics are relatively inferior to American manufacturing and demographics at the time of the war. In WWII, American manufacturing couldn't be affected by enemy attacks, the American economy (by GDP) was 90% of the entire Axis powers *on its own*, and America had a relatively youthful workforce. Chinese manufacturing is easily within range of American weapons, the Chinese GDP isn't even as large as the American GDP, let alone including US allies, and China is suffering a relative demographic crunch, due to the One-Child Policy.On the other hand, the Nazis simply *didn't* have the best tanks or planes or anything, really, at the opening of the war. They had superior tactics - which the USA might, also, as its military apparatus has been more sophisticated, for longer - but the myth of Nazi technological superiority has been post-facto generated to, among other things, explain the rational for operation paper clip. If the Germans actually had RADAR and the T-34, they might've been able to knock out either Russia or Britain. As it was, British RADAR allowed the RAF to massacre the Luftwaffe in the *Battle of Britain*, and German-made tanks probably only had the edge from the Fall of France to the introduction of the T-34, if we're being generous. Obviously, we cannot know the extent of the USA technological edge in secret military hardware, but it's highly unlikely that the USA and its allies are *actually behind* China in the Air War, e.g.But even if you disagree with that, the second point dispenses with such minutia. WWII is a *bad* proxy for a conflict over Taiwan, because a conflict over Taiwan is more likely to be a limited war, where a full war economy doesn't even come into play. That's because, since WWII, the intercontinental ballistic missile has been invented.   \\n  \\nDuring the Cold War, the US and the Soviets avoided actually engaging in large scale warfare even during the Korean War. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan is far more likely to look like some new kind of limited theater, blitzkrieg-style, undeclared martial action than a true global war. Now, China might win that kind of war! If it can surprise American defenses, and get control over the Taiwanese state apparatus without needing to get a hundred thousand soliders landing through a fully prepared American carrier group, the US might negotiate some face-saving settlement. But China knows it can't risk a protracted war that threatens America's status as a superpower, the same way the US knows it can't drop a Tomahawk missile on the Chinese Premier the day hostilities open. Avoiding nuclear war is more important than annexing territory, which is why essentially no one starts a war that obligates a nuclear-capable nation to bring its full weight to bear.So, we shouldn't be analyzing who would win an Iran-Iraq style total war between the US and China - we should be analyzing if either side will believe it can win a limited war before the opponent believes its status is at stake. Maybe the Chinese could conquer Taiwan under that analysis, and maybe that means they'll try to. But without doing that analysis, it's foolhardy to hold the view stated in the title.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"What happened with her?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"Its the general lack of western interest in anything except oil, Israel and Palestine.Stop seeing crazy conspiracy theories when its obviously just popular apathy about news from the Middle East that doesnt affect them.","title":"Joe Biden says alleged New Orleans attacker supported ISIS in videos"},{"text":"How many times did you have covid?","title":"Norovirus is on the rise and I'm getting rona pandemic deja vu."},{"text":"I think we're in the RPM timeline. where an AI computer virus infects the worlds computer systems and takes over the world. and makes a robotic army. and kills 90% of humanityThat sounds more accurate to our current situation","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 2, 2025"},{"text":"I think the vote is Hakeem Jeffries","title":"All Democrats expected to participate in Speakers vote"},{"text":"Cheney: *Voted with Trump ~90% of the time*Most liberals falling for the ratchet to the right trap: \\"Oh my God, she doesn't like Trump!

An aircraft carrier costs 4 billion dollars, that is a difference of about 4 billion dollars. No major world powers have gone to war with each other in nearly 100 years, so its anybody's guess what a major war would look like, especially because a lot of the relevant capabilities are classified.

Early 1940s US came out of a crippling economy from the Great Depression, and then not only recovered itself, but also managed to have a war-based economy as well in time to actively take part in Europe. As for the technological advancements in the military, yes it is impressive, but who knows what both countries are packing that the public doesn't know about. Also that one time that nuclear submarine sank immediately really put a bad image to the military system.Speaking of which, the rampant corruption and mismanagement in the Chinese inner workings can definitely get China shot in the foot.

Racism against Indians has always existed and has been prevalent and continues to get little pushback because oddly enough, Indians aren't the first thing that comes to mind when we picture a minority that we absolutely should not joke about because of power imbalances (like making classless jokes about Black People or Native Americans). When Americans think of Indian-Americans, they often picture something a bit closer to the Model Minority of like Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese people all doing extremely well in U.S.A as well as being more willing to assimilate into American society and not do crimes. So Indian Racism doesn't get pushback like people would get for being racist to Black people because on a similar but also different level, Indian Racism is like racism against White people. We're kind of in power, we kind of have to expect that people ain't going to like us and may make unsavory accusations and jokes against us. Jokes about Indian people doesn't usually feel like it's punching down because the perception is that Indians, on average, do extremely well in America and so they've got power and influence.

China's cannot, they do not have nuclear powered ships as we do, or anything resembling our logistical ability and supply network.So China's navy cannot reach the strait of Malacca, and that is where their food and oil stops. So while the war would carry on, China would be starving for food and oil very quickly, and there is nothing they could do about it.As to the war itself, please read on the first, second and third island chains, a series of island bases and allies the US has built over five decades plus to contain China.So the USA would have carrier battlegroups outside of this chain hitting coastal targets, where the bulk of Chinese manufacture is, and there isn't much China could do about it, because if they send their navy out, it dies, so in wargames their navy is predicted to stay close to the coast.China's missile forces?

The maintenance wasn't done, and supposedly the fuel was sold as a part of corruption which is rampant in China.And then there is doctrine. The USA has been warfighting pretty much non stop for a hundred years, recently building the combined arms doctrine, practicing it in the middle east and now in Ukraine, where we taught it to Ukraine.China has most recently fought a war in 1978, and Vietnam won that one.Practice matters, and China doesn't have any.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"It really depends.

Currently, there is no need or interest in doing so, but the massive advantages that lead to US dominance still exist even if they have been largely squandered in the last 50 years. Current factories can be scaled up and the knowledge on how to do so exists and is available to the US.We also don't truly know about the US tech lead. There are rumours that the US has been testing 6th gen planes for some time in secret. China can barely compete with current 5th gen planes and although they are catching up are still over a decade away from doing so. The main problem with China is that it cannot project power.

China cant realistically invade the USA, nor can the USA invade China. If China throws its full weight into invading Taiwan, which is on its own doorstep - yeah theyll probably capture it eventually, although the costs are unlikely to be justified by the gains. But yes theyll conquer it. Andwhat then?If you are expecting the US Navy to be destroyed by such a fight, you arent predicting *how* the US would fight in such a conflict. Parking a carrier fleet on Taiwans shores might result in losing it, but theres no reason for the US Navy to do that. The tactical advantage of a Carrier has always been that it can participate in a fight from many miles away, and Chinas ability to destroy a carrier fleet in the middle of the Pacific is much more questionable than their ability to destroy one in the Taiwan Strait.The current Chinese fleet is designed to project power in a relatively small area around China. They arent really capable of attacking, say, Hawaii. Maybe they follow up the attack on Taiwan with an attack on South Korea? Now you can start to wargame some interesting scenarios, but one of the first results from this scenario is a blockade of Chinese shipping. And while China does have a massive manufacturing base right now, they are also very vulnerable to a blockade. Which is also part of why they want to conquer Taiwan, as that eventually lets them establish more secure shipping lanes.Ultimately the scenarios required for them to conquer anything beyond Taiwan probably arent thereyet. This might change in another decade. It also might not. Long term predictions get very fuzzy, and China is facing one of the more pressing demographic crises among major powers, so that has to be factored in as well.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"What MAGA propaganda or RealityBiden did not divide the Democratic Party , Independents  and Progressives  , didnt bother to show up","title":"Biden is leaving the White House with two wildly different legacies"},{"text":"Yeah so much so that non-Americans will regularly make jokes like that with little to no consequences at all and then laugh when Americans get upset at the \\"joke\\"","title":"CMV: Racism against Indians is getting dangerously normalized"},{"text":"It's a hard thing to consider, because a total war between the two nations is so unlikely, and a limited war kind of depends on the specific issue and stakes, but we'll go ahead and talk about a total war here and assume no help from allies on either side.

If victory means \\"expulsion of US interests in the South Pacific\\", then China have a solid chance at winning. Ignoring of course, the nuclear weapons. The issue with this analysis is that China, just like Russia, have a doubtful quality of military. I heard last year reports of Chinese corruption throughout the entire military, so it's unknown whether China has the arsenal for a long term war. Furthermore, though China has great manufacturing, it's current economic situation isn't great: deflation everywhere, falling population... It seems hardly a good spot to start a war against the US. Also, the US is well known for its ultra nationalistic racist response to foreign enemies. Any attack on US soil will transform the right into a nest of war hawks and the pressure on the establishment pro corporate left will create the consensus necessary to wage war. In conclusion, a third world war will in no way be similar to what the last two wars were like. The presence of nukes will make this a mass proxy war, a war of information and of foreign manipulation. And yes, it's true that China seems in a better position to win if the war is quick (China's economy is extremely dependant on exports and it's economy is shrinking), but this war will be different.

China has a ton of personnel to throw at the enemy, but remember also they're only fighting for Taiwan. It's not like the US is invading the mainland here. At a certain point extra boots on Taiwanese soil becomes more of a hindrance than a help.

China can manufacture as many short-distance boats as it wants, but this would not expand any range any more than having more women would make pregnancy quicker.Additionally, with respect to Taiwan being the battleground, which is within this 200-mile belt, Chinese success is less likely than US success because, at a fundamental level, an amphibious invasion is much more difficult for the invader to prevail than for the defender to defend AND China has no military history of successful amphibious invasions, so the skillset is not well-defused throughout its navy.

China lacks the naval power projection at this time to seriously protect its sea lanes. The US could essentially just cut those links and watch the Chinese people starve and Chinese industry grind to a halt.Wars are not won just by manufacturing capacity, they are also won by resources. The germans lost on the eastern front during WW2 because their lack of oil meant they couldn't sustain major offensives after \\\\~1942.

How do you expect them to maintain domestic morale if the war lasts longer than 6 months and Chinese civilians start dying en masse from famine? Chinas only real option at that point would be to take those resources which means invading its neighbours, most of whom already view the Chinese state with a lot of suspicion and have actively been aligning themselves into the American sphere of influence.

There are many more events like this around the world in history that they were held responsible for.In 1773 due to their worldwide shenanigans they were suppressed by the church and Catherine the Great preserved them, hiding them in secret masonic lodges then in 1776 the Illuminati formed.  132 days later the United States was officially declared.

The delta between how your life is now vs how it was before. The rate of change when you are a child through adolescence is huge. A few short years is enough to produce a wildly different life. It's easy to feel nostalgia when the differences are easy to see.  When you reach adulthood, the rate of obvious change slows. Major accomplishments are fewer and can take many years to come to fruition. The differences are less quantitative and more qualitative.  A lot of it comes down to internal vs external circumstances. It's hard to feel nostalgic for something you can't easily point out.My advice look at it like a trip. Childhood is a bunch of short trips and you remember each place you stopped because you felt they were different. Adulthood is more like a longer road trip.

As is, the voters were the problem. When a country struggles to pick between a bad party and a toxic suicide cult hellscape and then goes with the latter, the voters have failed. We can postulate on how it's the fault of constantly worsening education standards or toxic mainstream media or even more toxic and warped social media, but the end result is still: Unless the election was actually rigged (likely by Russia, who has now an intense reputation of rigging elections), then the voters failed.

Also Americans:"},{"text":"I should have clarified more here, because that statement isnt very accurate, and I was writing emotionally rather than being more thorough.I dont think the Democrats are even in the same league as Republicans when it comes to voter suppression.  What I _do_ think, however, is that there is a small core of fairly-to-very wealthy people who, if they dont outright control the Democratic Party as a political organization, definitely have a much-outsized influence over party direction and decisions.  For reference, I point to the recent failed campaign for AOC to head the House Oversight Committee, despite the fact that Democratic voters overwhelmingly approve of her as a representative and that there is a great deal of popular sentiment that younger representatives need to have a greater role in a government that will be instrumental in determining their future.  That bid failed largely due to the influence of Nancy Pelosi, a wealthy septuagenarian who has been in the halls of power for many years.This group of, well, call them establishment Democrats, have personal interests that often conflict with those of the average voter, and that nearly always boils down to a massive division in personal wealth between themselves and their constituents.  What this has led to is a Democratic leadership largely peopled by very rich, very old people who would actually like it, thank you very much, if things more or less just keep going the way they have been.  The system has been very good to them, they have a lot of wealth and property, and so why would we want to risk upending that?These particular folks, I think, are actually happiest when the Democrats _lose_.  If you win, if your party has control of some or all branches of government, you are expected to actually _do_ things.  To deliver on promises and principles.  But if youre _not_ the party in power  if youre a powerless minority party, well, you can simply react on the cable news channel of your choice to whatever outlandish shit is happening with the Republicans before turning around to send me another email that reads can you _believe_ these Republicans and just the awful things that they do and say?  Why not give me another $200 to _Fight Back?_Progress on truly progressive ideas and legislation is _glacial_ in this country, in part because many of the people who need to be on board for, say for the sake of argument, establishing a true single-payer health care system to control the wildly expensive costs of medical care and medication in this country, are also heavily invested in and receiving large donations from the very insurance and pharmaceutical companies whose bottom line would be affected by such policies.So, no, I dont think the Democratic Party is really trying to suppress votes, but I do think that the tension I tried to describe above, between their ostensible loyalty to the masses and desire to advance national policy that would make this country a more pleasant place to live for people who arent billionaires, and those same billionaires to whom theyre utterly dependent for financing their unending reelection campaigns, causes some perverse incentives within the party as a whole.","title":"Americans: Vote and save our democracy!

What could change your view is whether you think it's fine for the *efforts* to be good enough or if the *effect* of the parenting matters. If it's the *effect* of parenting and you think people can change with new information, then shaming plays a role to get people to realize their beliefs are going to lead to suboptimal outcomes. On top of that, there's the chance that others who are on the fence of a parenting style can benefit from seeing the interaction.My sister has a kid and she used to say \\"kids don't have a manual\\" and stuff like that. But there's millions of pages of parenting advice so that's just not true. Knowing some basics of child development would have paid dividends to her and her kid. She's starting to see some of what she was missing seeing me raise my baby. I didn't choose to shame because I didn't think it was effective for her.But, if you're in a space where parenting styles are being discussed, then shaming the worst can let people know the degree to the badness of a parenting style, in particular. If the difference is optimal versus suboptimal then shaming doesn't make sense. But if it's actually closer to abuse then shaming helps let people know the severity.Here's one example: If you see someone say they give their baby a bottle to go to sleep or otherwise freely feed themselves, shame them. Over 26% of children between 6 months and 6 years end up with baby bottle tooth decay and it's fucking awful. It's especially prevalent for people who give milk/juice and let their kids have the bottle in their mouth all the time.Or subtle forms of shaming like *your 4 year old still has a pacifier*? Can clue people in that they're ruining their kid's teeth, forever. I think being unaware of milestones or whatever can also be something that shaming helps with.","title":"CMV: Parent Shaming is almost never done for the childrens best interest."},{"text":"So I wonder what would happen if you wrote an if then statement on your ballot Bernie sanders or Kamala Harris whoever has the most votes excluding this one","title":"Americans: Vote and save our democracy!

Groceries are still unaffordable. Healthcare is still unaffordable. Education is still unaffordable. People still can't save. Social security is still under threat. Half of us are still one missed paycheck away from homelessness. Leisure activities are still unaffordable. The stock market doesn't mean shit to low-wage workers who don't have or can't fund a 401k. Inflation stabilizing is great, but prices are still unaffordable. Unemployment might be going down, but that doesn't mean much to the 90+% who were already employed and doesn't address *under*employment at all. Wages might be going up, but the average person gets a raise once a year if that and so they're a long way from seeing that benefit.People rightfully got annoyed at being told that the economy was doing great under those conditions. I believe that messaging like \\"we're through the worst of it and every day, tomorrow will be better than today\\" would have gone over significantly better.","title":"Biden is leaving the White House with two wildly different legacies"},{"text":"Unfortunately this isnt just a Dem issue.

This was quite awhile ago, a time practically unimaginable today; while I had opinions I was far more of a, whoever and why-ever you vote, just vote for valid reasons. Before we tar and feather me, let me underline, this was in the long past. Anyway, if someone wanted to vote for the candidate with the fewest vowels in their name, I just didnt want them insisting Aeolus was the guy to vote for over Frank. Either find a different pro Aeolus reason, or if vowels was really your thing, vote Frank.So this friend believes a story about a candidate that theyre circulating as good for their image, and a *national publication* does a takedown of how counterfactual that image is. It has no overt political message - candidate may be good or bad on positions whatever, the article is entirely on the *myth* of this candidates image, and it is thorough.I share this with my friend, whom again, Im not trying to change their vote. Either request they have a different reason for their vote - as the article does not impeach the candidate on any grounds besides this image - *or* change their vote if the image is really what theyre voting for. Friend reads the article, is surprised by the information in it, discusses it, seems to have internalized it.Not a week later theyre repeating the same myth-image junk. Now, you or I have probably seen any number of people who we surely believe are in for a penny, in for a pound on their team, or their candidate, and would naturally lump this friend is as a crypto-team/candidate person who is functionally gaslighting me. Except, I underline, this friend gives every indication they cared as much about the candidate - and politics at all - as the average voter cares about bonds on the ballot.One anecdote for your thesis.","title":"Americans: Vote and save our democracy!

When people don't have to spend as much on something, they either buy more or buy something else. Take gasoline for example. If gas prices go down (say due to new drilling technology) in the short term people will buy less gas (you only need so much to drive to work) and will spend the money on something else (like cheese), but in the long run people might take the lower gas prices and decide that it means they can afford a larger and less efficient vehicle. The money either gets spend on buying more units of an item or on buying a different item.Can increased productivity cause deflation? Not really. Such a deflationary spiral would require 2 things. 1.) A dramatic across the board improvement in production efficiency and 2.) The belief that people would sit on the money they saved from lower prices instead of instantly spending it on something else.We know from real world experience that not all production techniques can be substantially improved. TVs are an outlier as they had room for the technology to  improve, but what about scented candles or books? The fundamental process of their production is essentially about as good as it can get.Regarding productivity and credit, its not so much about is the system productive as much as do people have money to spend. During good times, when people have credit , they spend it. People finance cars, they eat at restaurants and spend at convivence stores. When they run out of money to spend, they have to cut back and spend less in order to support their debt. If enough people are sufficiently leveraged with debt, they might have to sell their items which depresses prices and could force others to sell causing a crash in asset prices.","title":"Out of curiosity, does r/neoliberal believe that a deflationary sprial can be created from production and distribution becoming too efficient?

Realistically, the average woman does not stand a chance against the average man in a duel. Seeing as majority of duels would be woth firearms, women could actually have an advantage of a smaller frame, makimg it harder for men to aim at them.Abusive boyfriends? Incels pissed about being rejected? Men retaliating because of sexual assault allegations? There are a million reasons this is a horrible idea, and it guarantees extensive violence against women, who would in turn have to isolate from society for risk of death. This system actually gives them a fighting chance, it evens the field. Would men harass and endanger women, if they knew they could get whacked for it?Im shocked you would call this accountability and say it will ensure every member of society to be considerate of others. I think this does the opposite by putting those with physical strength to determine who lives or dies. I don't think there would be many fist-fights, it's not easy to kill someone in that way.If you do not give me xyz, I will likely kill you. And thats good that thats legal?Women will basically have to go into hiding.
