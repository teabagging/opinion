Biden, who time and again pledged to Americans that he would restore norms and respect for the rule of law after Trumps first term in office, ultimately used his position to help his son, breaking his public pledge to Americans that he would do no such thing In June, Biden categorically ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son, telling reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case, I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him. As recently as Nov. 8, days after Trumps victory, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, Weve been asked that question multiple times.

There's a big difference between the idea that women in power would, for example, permit male genital mutilation whilst banning female genital mutilation, and the idea that women in power would encourage male genital mutilation.Similarly, when it comes to defining rape (the definition usually used in pnetrative act, but I think the distinction you're talking about is the definition that would necessitate the involvement of a penis, hence making it a male-only crime) - there's definitely an argument to say that women are trying to make the crime of sexually assaulting a man a lesser crime, but this is a very edge case and a long way away from \\"kill all men\\" which is the rhetoric OP is referring to. Really, the question when it comes to Male Genital Mutilation is why are men not pushing for this to be made illegal? If you look into this deeper we see that culturally, things like circumcision are quite often seen as normal (bizzaire as that may seem) and are often seen as victimless. In comparison, FGM is almost always a form of male control, and has basically no support amongst women. This means there is actually a significant difference between the outcomes of what is at face-value a very similar act. I don't think any women are saying that MGM must be legal, whilst simultaneously arguing FGM must be illegal.","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"No need to defend anything, it was a good end to conservative's usual bullshit.

It's not an unproblematic pardon, but I don't think it's unjustifiable.I think Hunter Biden was subject of a years long witch hunt in rightwing media and Republican officials weaponised the judiciary against him. Hunter was targeted because Hunters dad is the president Unlike Trumps kids Hunter didn't act like a de facto public official. And he has not chosen a career as a public servant or elected politician, and despite this controversy, Hunter is not much of a public figure. Hunter didn't chose to be Joe Bidens son, but he was targeted as a proxy because of who his father is.This sort of witch hunt is a severe punishment in itself which I think is more than adequate in proportion to the crimes committed.

Trump and company have made it very clear they want to persecute their political enemies, especially the Bidens, so I would probably be more disappointed if Biden didnt try and protect his son.

No, not really.\\nOK, so, when assessing the impact of big political ideologies, shouldn't we take a look at the work by institutions that reclaim themselves of it, more than by the action of John or Barbara next door, who associate themselves with those ideologies ?\\nAnd while feminism doesn't have a single party or whatever, it has plenty of institutions that reclaim themselves of it, and plenty of people in positions of authority, with the ability to heavily impact many things in society and many people's lives.\\nFor example, you have the UN women.? They create a whole lot of \\"gender equality\\" measures, that are then used by various groups to influence policy worldwide. Those gender equality indexes, generally, have one little detail that might get them considered less than ideal : they count disadvantages to men as equality. They only consider disadvantage to women as an inequality.\\nOne might say that this kind of thing is sexist. Misandrist, more precisely.\\nDespite the long established evidence for gender symmetry in domestic violence, the UN keeps to talk about \\"violence against women\\"\\nDespite no reason to make the distinction in why the practice must be forbidden, the UN ignores genital mutilations inflicted on men, to only focus on FGM.\\nThat makes at least 3 topics where something that isn't gendered has been pointlessly gendered in a manner that makes it look hypocritical and reduces the effectiveness of the approaches, all to dismiss the sufferings of men.\\nWould you say that is a positive influence of feminism on the world, or would we be better served by tackling problems in their entirety, without blinders on ?\\nAnd so I know that Emma and Suzette and Bob down the street are really great egalitarian who call themselves feminists. But should I care more about their impact on the world, or the impact of the UN, when talking about feminism as a positive or negative influence ??\\nWhat if Bob and Emma a great egalitarian in their values, but inform their actions based on data collected and reported by the UN on what constitutes equality ? Does their egalitarian values actually matter then, if it can't help their actions being informed by sexistly biased data ?\\nTo me, I would say that while them having egalitarian values is great, their describing themselves as feminists is more likely to get them to just accept UN issued data with less of a critical examination, and as such, their being feminists actually has once again a negative impact on the world, as they get fooled by the label into supporting sexist things while being intimately convinced they are not.\\nAnd that is just taking the UN. There are quite a few governmental and non governmental feminist groups with similar levels of influence and bias.\\nAnd the Bob and Emma and Suzette of the world, who are great egalitarian that get misguided by those biased data, they are precisely being used as cover by the various people like feminist Mary Koss, who defined how the CDC (and therefore a huge chunk of the world) should study rape, along with her belief that men forced into sex by women shouldn't be considered victims because deep down they must have actually wanted it, and defined rape as the act by the rapist of penetrating their victims, excluding most women forcing sex on others from the data.?\\nAnd so they push various biased stats that claim rape is done at 90+% by men (by definition) while trusting the feminist source for such data and not looking into how it was collected or defined. To them, it means that 90+% of the times someone is forced into sex, it is by a man. They build their worldview around that. They end up maybe even thinking that bears might be safer to be around, that men are uniquely monstrous. While holding egalitarian values, they embrace a misandrist worldview.\\nAnd then they get to claim on the Internet that most of the feminist they know are not misandrists, and therefore feminism is not misandrist.\\nThat isn't how things work, but they genuinely believe it. And they help serve as shield for those people they claim to despise, but who built all the infrastructures through which they informed their worldviews without bothering to check critically because \\"all the feminists around them are good people\\".","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Sorry, I thought you were the op of the comment to which I responded.","title":"Do you think it is a Coincidence?"},{"text":"Oh nos!

But Im really tired of the condescending or groveling spam emails begging for money, ending with a bland call to action likely penned by a clueless 19-year-old instructed to write like they're a 13-year-old to reach voters the campaign clearly perceives as low-info aka stupid. I almost hope that's actually the case at this point, frankly.I supported and was impressed with Harris's campaign and candidacy especially considering the circumstances, but solely from an outreach perspective, her campaign has become nothing but a nuisance, especially when each email check reveals yet another groan-worthy subject line begging for my cash.I doubt the funds are being used wisely post-election, particularly with the absurd calls for recounts that keep cropping up in their marketing. Regardless of their campaign spending prior to the election, it's now just plain annoying.Id honestly prefer they just said it was to pay off the debt accumulated in the effort to beat Trump, even though we lost, rather than bombard me with this hot garbage lol.And Im not looking past the actual outreach from the candidate to remember whats at stake, or whatever messaging is chosen, when ultimately the campaign debt will only matter to Harris, and thats only if she wants to run for something again.Edit: tweaked the rant a few minutes after posting","title":"Dems fear Harris continued fundraising erodes trust"},{"text":"And his son blatantly and admittedly committed the crime.

Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012). As a tragic irony, the wider availability of support services for abused women did not appear to have quite the intended effect, at least through the 1980s, as only male victimization declined.\\"\\nLet me be clear in what they are saying :\\nIn the 70s, about as many men as women were killed by their partners. Then we started implementing services to help *female* victims of DV. As a result, the number of women killed by their partner almost didn't change. On the other hand, it is the number of *men* killed by their partner that decreased.\\nThe researchers attribute that to what is commonly referred to as \\"battered wife syndrome\\". The idea is that someone can be trapped in abuse without any hope of getting out, to the point where murder seems like a viable way out. Help to escape abuse means there are other ways out, and so a reduction in murders of abusers.\\nBut then, what can we conclude of the data we have there ?\\nWell, the first thing is that either the services available right now are absolutely ineffective at helping victims in danger of being killed, or that barely any abuser ever kills their victim.\\nIndeed, an abuser is in a position of power over the abused, and killing their victim would strip them of that power. So it might be a bit of both, though one might wonder what, if anything that has been tried since the 70s proved ineffective, could help victims of abuse at risk of being killed.\\nThe second thing we can conclude is that it seems that the majority (at least those 60% of reduction we've seen in men) of spousal murder victims are the murders of abusers that pushed their victims too much into despair, until they snapped.\\nWe could then conclude that the most likely way to reduce partner homicide right now would be to provide just as many services to [the equivalent number of male abuse victims](https://domesticviolenceresearch.org/), who have been [pretty much ignored for the past 50 years by services](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/) run at the hands of [ideologically motivated feminists.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2790940)\\nWhat we can not conclude from that data, though, is that domestic abuse at the hands of men can be much more dangerous.\\nBut then, of course, it is not feminists who will present you that data. It is slightly embarrassing to their point of \\"men bad, please give us money to help women\\".\\nYou see, you claim that the higher number of women killed by a partner is a sign of DV against women, and use that to advocate for more help to be directed towards female victims of DV and to justify misandry.\\nBut the actual reality of that data is that this number is higher because of the disparity in help, and that your proposed solution and the activism you support actually goes against solving that issue you started your comment with.\\nYou want to reduce the number of women killed by their partner ? All the data deem to point towards the necessity of helping male victims of DV as the best way to accomplish it.\\nAnd you know what ? Battered wife syndrome is far from a recent invention. The woman who opened the very first modern shelter for battered women, Erin Pizzey, immediately noticed that most of the women she helped were at least as violent as the men they were fleeing. She tried to open shelters for men too, and to raise awareness about male victims of DV from the beginning, and it were feminist groups that made death threats escalating to the killing of her family's dog before she had to flee the UK. The knowledge of the equivalent number of male victims was also available right from the beginning of the DV movement.\\nSo people have known for decades that as many men as women were suffering from SV, and people have known for decades about battered wife syndrome, meaning that people have known for decades that the most effective way to reduce DV related deaths was to help both men and women equally.\\nAnd it is feminist opposition and desire to maintain the feminist frame of men as perpetrators and women as victims, that kept that knowledge out of the public eye, by their own admission of it. And as a result, it is the desire to protect the feminist ideology and its misandry that led to the suffering of untold numbers of men and the unnecessary deaths of untold numbers of women.\\nNow, here's the question that matter : do you care more about protecting feminism and its message of misandry, or do you care more about actually helping people and saving those lives ? Because as long as the DV industry stays in feminist hands, you won't see a reduction in women's deaths. They have a vested interest in maintaining those numbers as they are. They have sit on the knowledge that could save thousands of lives for decades, because it was inconvenient to the messaging. Misandry over women's lives and interests, that's the feminist M.O.","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Well there were less votes cast last election compared to 2020 so yeah they do","title":"Joe Bidens broken promise on Hunter pardon is ammunition for Trump"},{"text":"Dude thats ALOT of pardons holy crap!","title":"Trump calls Hunter Biden pardon an abuse and miscarriage of Justice"},{"text":"Best I can tell is democrats don't lie enough to get independents interested.

Angry drug addicts shouldnt be buying guns and having them in their possession, particularly around children. It is simply not excusable. But Biden is happy that others are punished with this law and instead of holding his own son as responsible as he wants the general population held, he gives him a literal get out of jail free card.

It is completely normal for a campaign to be in debt after the end of a cycle - its always better to spend everything you receive, particularly if its public funding, than to leave it unspent. On nearly every race Ive ever been on, you end up in the red by the end. The vast majority of this spending went into paid media (all of this can be easily tracked down), which is unfathomably expensive at this scale. Texas, for example has 4 of the 50 largest media markets in the country - running one ad concurrently in all four, during a highly watched event, will cost millions and millions of dollars by itself. And thats literally one ad. Multiply that by god knows how many times across many states, and it adds up pretty neatly.There are enormous ethical and structural issues with fundraising in a post-Citizens United world, and email/SMS targeting in particular is a gross shitshow Ive tried to avoid like the plague my entire career.

There isn't much that's conclusive in this area, as the most indicative statistics are for partner violence, and from a brief look at wiki the facts seem to indicate a fairly steady balance between female on male and male on female abuse. There also isn't a spike in domestic violence in general. Other relevant statisticsc could be the rate of marriages, which is generally down, or the \\"male lonliness epidemic\\", but there's not really much research on this I could find. You could also perhaps look at the amount of people in relationships versus single people, but this is almost always a big estimate and gives no indication of the power dynamics of such relationships.I guess what I'm trying to say is we shouldn't conclude that extremist internet opinions have corrupted feminist movements when we don't see the evidence. What would we expect to see? Perhaps bills introduced into government to curtail men's rights? (We actually see the opposite, what with all the Abortion stuff recently).","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Here's the non misandrist feminist, showing here non misandry by explaining to you why it is perfectly reasonable to feel more afraid of men than of wild potentially man eating animals.\\nBut, you know, she's not a misandrist.

Since it's hard to get numbers in underdeveloped countries, where feminicide is more prevalent, the actual figure is thought to be much higher.How many men were killed by women?It's not feminism telling women to be afraid of men. It's facts. Nearly every woman I know has been assaulted, harassed, or raped by a man at some point, sometimes a combination of all three. Feminism tells women they are equal to men, should have equal rights and opportunities, and shouldn't have to be afraid. That they shouldn't be discriminated against on the basis of their gender, or have to be put in a little box according to what society thinks women should do and want. Feminism is about giving people the chamce to be people, and be viewed as people, before being 'men' or 'women'. Feminism tries to stop toxic masculinity and create a more equal society. Unfortunately,  some men identify so deeply with the patriarchy that they view this as an attack on men. Feminism doesn't hate men. Some people online are vocal in expressing their fear and anger at men, and while it's understandable they would do that because they are rightfully afraid and angry, I agree it's not constructive in creating dialogue.That being said, for a dialogue, the other person has to be open to engaging with you and understanding your point of view. Which is unfortunately rarely the case when people benefit from the status quo. It's much easier to tell women 'why are you afraid, I'm a good guy' than consider that statistically, for her, the question isn't if a man she meets is a rapist or abuser. The question is: 'Which one is it?'And if she gets the answer wrong, she could be r*p*d or killed.What issues did feninism cause? Because sexism and hate against women have been around since the Ancient Greeks... just read Aristotle. being looked down on and hated by certain people for reasons that are both false and outside of our control is nothing new and definitely didn't appear with Feminism.But due to Feminism, we have the right to vote, open a bank account, not have our salary paid to our husband or father, get a loan, own a business... and numerous other things.","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"I'm sure there are posts on that subreddit that demonize all men that were missed by mods, but I haven't yet found any, and I've tried right now.

It comes from Sally Miller Gearhart, a respected feminist scholar, from a text that goes \\"the future is female, to ensure it, the male population must be reduced to 10%\\"... and thanks to hillary Clinton, we know that there is not much unpopular in the eyes of feminists of considering men are not even the primary victims of their own deaths, since she claimed \\"Women have always been the primary victims of war, they lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons\\".?\\nLet's just say I don't blame the guy for viewing anyone who decides to try to cleanup such an ideology's name without actively fighting the misandry in it, with only slightly less suspicion than the previous example. Why would anyone willingly associate with that, and let the misandry go on without much issue.\\nWhich leads me to the second point : how do I know that, on the whole, the people who reclaim themselves of feminism, in all of their diversity and non-monolyth-ness, don't give a flying fuck about misandry ? Well, we know what happens, when some feminists find some other feminists hateful in an unacceptable way. Have you seen what happened with TERFs ? Those people apparently hate on a tiny fraction of the population, and I doubt there are many people who have not heard about the issue.?\\nThe hatred of half the population, though ? No big \\"MERF\\" term, nobody going to war against those... when yet another college professor print in a mainstream journal \\"why can't we hate men?\\" Or yet another version of that, she gets publicity by feminists, gets to keep her job at a prestigious position in a university where she handles the fate of many students, and everything goes along as normal. No sign of the outraged feminists, those who are so quick to tell us that feminism is not a monolith of misandry...\\nSo, tell me, where is your and your friend's outrage when feminists push misandry, that you are so outraged people call out feminism as a hate movement??","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"lol he did one pardon for his son.. one and youre acting like hes just as worse as trump.

There's not one \\"feminism\\", like with any political stream there's tons of different lines of thinking and currents. Saying \\"feminists hate men\\" is like saying \\"black activists hate white people\\". Malcom X vs MLK were two very different approaches to black liberation and I don't think it would be fair to say \\"MLK just hated white people\\".The problem is liberal political discouse tends to project everything on individuals. A system of cultural and economic circumstances can persist even if most people subjected to it don't like it. For these points like male lonelyness, male suicide rates, life expectancy etc. you mention feminists just get mad if you bring it up. is this something you encounter in real life or just online? I think the issue here is that if feminists say \\"women suffer\\" and your response is \\"well why don't you talk about men suffering too\\" you are correct but it is a douche move because you use your own problems to negate the valid problems other people have instead of finding a solution together.There is a very interesting (albeit also pretty provocative) book called [\\"The will to change\\"](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Will-Change-Men-Masculinity-Love/dp/0743456084) that is basically about this exact point.

Other people are bad as well if they don't worship the good book, and they pretty much default to the consequence of going to the bad place for eternity because they didn't believe in the good book, even if they don't do the bad things. The only thing is that it's totally cool at the end of the day to do those bad things that you shouldn't do as long as you:- Believe in the book\\n- Tell people you believe in the book\\n- Say that you are sorry that you did what you did to the people who teach other people about the book\\n- Condemn people who don't believe in the bookSo you end up with people who are pretty vocal about their 'morals' but are not afraid to break the rules because they know they can get a free pass as long as they 'repent'.

You dont want to act, or even talk, alone; you dont want to go out of your way to make trouble. Why not?Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.**Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, Its not so bad or Youre seeing things or Youre an alarmist.**And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you cant prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you dont know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.**But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent toto what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.**But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. Thats the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shockedif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in 43 had come immediately after the German Firm stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in 33. But of course this isnt the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.**And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying Jewish swine, collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live inyour nation, your peopleis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\\" \\\\~* Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free","title":"Even in Exile, the Left Must Fight to Popularize Its Vision"},{"text":"\\"this will show them\\" says the average American who would get eaten alive by the same charges","title":"President Biden set to issue pardon of his son Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Biden should give himself a Blanket Pardon even though he doesnt need it, just to fucking do it.

Take a look at r/MensLib for a men's group that is feminist.However, men's rights movements can also be patriarchal and - unfortunately - most are. A patriarchial men's rights movement has certain anti-feminist tenets, such as:* Biological differences between men and women make men better leaders and better thinkers\\n* Hierarchy is natural and inevitable and we should structure human society around certain hierarchies that just so happen to put men at the top most of the time\\n* Certain bad behaviours that men often do are justified because of a story I made up about evolution\\n* Cultures where men lead and women follow are superior to cultures where women are taken as seriously as men\\n* Women are naturally devious and inevitably use men for material gain (therefore, it is okay for men to use women instrumentally as well)These and other tenets motivate such men to do terrible things in the real world.

Just look at any shitty fandom space.I also recommend looking at different branches of feminism. TERFs are definitely not the best. Feminist spaces inclusive of all genders tend to be more accepting, but that also depends where you look.Feminism itself is the broad category of beliefs, that the current patriarchal systems are bad. There are plenty of feminists who take male issues seriously, and many who point out the demands the patriarchy puts on men and how men are expected to perform a certain level and type of masculinity to be men. Intersectional groups will often point out different cultural views of masculinity and femininity, and talk about how black woman are racialized as being more masculine or Jewish men are attacked for being more 'feminine'. Gender inclusive groups with a lot of intersex and non-binary people also have interesting discussions on gender and work to make things more inclusive for all.","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"He can't legalize weed as it has to follow the scheduling process as outlined by Congress.?

I'll let the mods decide if Rule B is respected.Anyway...It seems like you don't appreciate the mental weight of being a woman in the current crushing patriarchal and toxic masculine prevalent mainstream culture.Humans, when subjected to discrimination since the day they are born, develop both frustration and coping mechanisms. You are entering feminist spaces where women can or try to express their frustrations but you feel personally attacked, and would like them to police their tones not to upset men like you.Missing the point entirely. You want your emotions to be put ahead of theirs, when it's them being discriminated. Or constantly under threat of harassment. All women in my life have experienced some sort of harassment, dozens of times. Since they were 12/13. On top of that, the pressure to BE sexual, possibly in a submissive way. All media, from mainstream to influencers, push aesthetics because \\"sex sells\\". Objectification is a fact.It stands to reason that the brain of someone subject to all of that will need space to vent, rant, and then process. It's also online, it's also Reddit. So their real life attitudes might be much different from what they share online. And you should focus on real-world reality, rather than focus on the super small slice of reality that is Reddit and use that to reject feminism as a whole.TL;DR: Reddit is not the feminist movement, but even if it were, discriminated groups deserve a space to vent.","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Hi.

Bernie wanted to go for the working class.  Conservative Dems (and the Harris campaign) believe there's a groundswell of disaffected Republicans out there.  Others think the votes come from other places.  But you just cannot win by saying \\"screw everyone outside of our one-third of voters\\".  The math does not work.

When I saw the news update on my iPhone, my immediate thought was that this was a massive own goal on Biden's part, a nicely-wrapped gift to the Trumpists that makes their case for them.  It's true.  The headlines say it all - despite having promised not to, Biden pardons his son.  Biden broke his promise for his family member.  Biden broke his word to not run again.  Not for you, of course.  See, when it comes to you and your life - when it comes to American democracy itself! - the Democrats always have lots of reasons they can't get stuff done.  Joe Manchin.  Kyrsten Sinema.  The Senate parliamentarian, whatever the fuck that means.  And most fatal to America, Merrick Garland's glacial plodding.  An attempted self-coup, live on TV, four years ago, the first time in American history a president tried to hold on to power through violence, as cartoonishly inept as it was, and what did we get?  The equivalent of a loud, wet fart, a \\"womp-womp\\" sound effect.  And the coup plotter reelected as President.  Didn't want to seem like we weren't moving on, dontcha know?   I'm sure that will come as great comfort to the political dissidents of the near future who have to go into hiding or flee the United States. Couldn't be helped.  Our hands were tied.  But Biden acted decisively in his own interest and the interest of his family members.  Corruption personified, and look, Trump is taking advantage of it, of course!Here's a question for the \\"yeah, fuck justice, their side did it first\\" crowd - given what we know about Trump, given what his generals said about him, given what Biden and Harris themselves said about him, what do you think that the odds are that Trump will say, after 8 years of Hunter's laptop and all that, \\"oh, well, nothing much I can do here!  I wipe my ass with the Constitution daily, but man, in this case, those magic words will protect Hunter (and his dad!)\\"?  What will prevent a weaponized Justice Department on Day 1 from treating this pardon itself as a criminal action and Trump going after Hunter and Joe anyway?  Trump's got a lot to do and the attention span of a rhesus monkey, but if he really wants to?  This pardon won't save Hunter.  All of this will be for naught.  Worse than that - it is confirmation at the eve of the return of America's first autocrat that yeah, everything that Trump said about corruption and cynicism is absolutely true.

Millennials came in with the '08 crash, but rather than do anything lasting about it voted for Obama then cried that he didn't (couldn't) return us to the economy of our childhoods under Clinton. These two generations let trump come in in 2016, claim all the glory that Obama left him, crash everything and blamed it on Biden. Then instead of keeping him out after 2020, they all cried again that the economy wasn't good enough under Biden despite the US having the BEST recovery from COVID out of any other industrialized nation on the planet... And in addition to all of that, the democratic party did everything they could to ONLY focus on marginalized groups (LGBT, people of color, and women) thinking that young white men would just tag along despite being demonized by EVERYBODY for the past decade. And then we had the rise of figures like Andrew Tate, Joe Rogan, fresh and fit, etc who all captured the young white male audience and told them the right would take care of them. I don't blame gen z at all. They are a product of the environment that we (millennials and X'ers) created.

Atlantis, the 7 great spirits who preside in Agartha, who are from the FUTURE I might add, and Thoth who was tutored by a literal angel? Idk what that being was in the Atlantean temple but apparently normal humans at that time who were already very spiritually advanced couldn't even look at the being without being blinded or something. Thoth's magic include to my understanding: astral travel, immortality by way of rejuvenation in Agartha, a vibrational staff that could perform magic, i theorize it's levitation, and he had a spaceship given by unknown others. He spoke about the true nature of man; we are flames or sparks, and death only quenches 'life' for a time but we are always reborn. The 7 spirits are truly interesting. They're called by numbers, 3-9, and each have a different domain like life, change/ magic, hidden magic, death, weaving the story of fate etc. Very intriguing. Thoth seems to have met the being that is death and was given the secret to immortality. He then was given free reign to do as he wants, and he chose to come back to tutor humanity throughout the ages. Hermes was probably one of his aliases when he went to Greece? Currently asleep, Thoth wrote that he will return again in the future. He speaks of astral travelling to multiple different planets in the galaxy/universe, countless planets with other beings and wonders, where some were so advanced they could create worlds with their thoughts. He also speaks of the fall of Atlantis, when a dark brotherhood of Black Magicians summoned the serpent spirits from deep in the earth, and possessed humans of high status and positions of power. Then there was a meteor called by unknown forces that was going to destroy the world. Thoth and other Atlanteans did escape to Agartha, which is in the Inner Earth. Oh and he built the pyramids with magic (levitation probably but he is very brief in describing it, like it's no big deal).Hell yea this is one of the best things you'll read, a firsthand account from an Egyptian deity, originally an Atlantean human priest/ magician trained by an angelic being.","title":"Magic: where did this knowledge come from?"},{"text":"This is what makes you not hopeful for the next 4+ years?","title":"Biden Pardons His Son Hunter Despite Saying He Wouldnt"},{"text":"Oh and by the way, since Citation seems important to you, it's strange you didn't provide any for your original claim.","title":"Biden pardons his son Hunter despite previous pledges not to"},{"text":"... but didnt he still vote?","title":"'I Hope Americans Will Understand': Biden Pardons His Son Hunter | \\n\\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases,\\" said the president, \\"can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son C and that is wrong.\\""},{"text":"lol.. so ur mad that someone is struggling with addiction? not about anything this case was concerning?     taking it back half a century with this stigma...","title":"Biden pardons son Hunter"},{"text":"Former.

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Departments decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.  The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room C with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunters cases.\\n \\n No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son C and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter C who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break me C and theres no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. Theyll be fair-minded. Heres the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice C and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.

And the main talking point that came up was gen z white males feel victimized. Alot of the ultra feminism of \\"all men are bad\\" and the whole \\"choosing a bear over a man\\". Then alot boiled down to the influencers that run the game for gen z. Even though millennials loudly spout off that people like Andrew Tate are shit heels, it seems to have come off as more targeted \\"hate towards men\\". Personally I think the real answer is they have no popular male role models on the left. No one is trying to relate to the gen z male and being terminally online, they don't have the same reaction to the Internet that millennials have. Yes we went through the whole \\"seeking validation\\" through online social media such as Facebook, AOL, myspace etc  but there wasn't near as much info or false info floating around as there is now. Our personalities weren't online. We made dumb comments, that were sexist, homophobic and whatever cringe cool shit young kids thought was funny and it just stayed in person with other dumb kids. No one posted it online, no one got canceled. We just grew up happy our mistakes were private and forgotten about when we got olderWith genz, they grew up online. Their mistakes were posted, they were put on blast for every dumb thing a kid did. Remember the tide pod bullshit? They didn't grow up with the start of the Internet. It was already there and fully discovered. They didn't have to go to weird ass sites to find dark shit. It was just there and normalized. They can open reddit and find some henious shit In a echo chamber that perpetually spouts the same racist and homophobic, womanizing ideas. And reddit is super left leaning. So a quick google search can bring you to an even more henious area. Ontop of that, Tate may be a dipshit but he knows how to keep his targeted audience engaged and watching. The right has multiple personalities like Tate. The left just doesn't.  The ones that do preach progressiveness are, as bad as it sounds, too effeminate to catch a person's attention that already is being pulled by a far right personality. I think genz voted right because they found inclusion on the right that made them feel more accepted than anything in the left. And unfortunately the lefts preaching doesn't catch the attention of a generation that grew up with sound bites and quick info. Because just like global warming, a loud person can call it bullshit with a few words where as someone explaining it thoughtfully has to use paragraphs. It's easier to say all men bad, and have someone say it's bullshit, than someone explain the situation that leads women to act like all men are bad. For context I'm pretty far left, eat the rich left. But I don't think the left has succeeded in any capacity on grabbing the minds of the younger generation. And I fear that if we don't match the far right talking heads with our own, then we will lose gen alpha and beyond. We were preached at growing up that we need to vett every source and information bit on the Internet. But then our parents turned around and started believing pets were being eaten by immigrants.  Something needs to change on the lefts tactics or we really will slide into a Christo fascist society.","title":"You were the chosen demographic!"},{"text":"Good.

An uneducated voter base that does not believe in, or actively rejects facts, education, and expert consensus, becomes exposed to the potential of being manipulated into voting away their democratic power by bad faith actors who have no intention of helping their electorate. When that happens, democracy has failed. It has failed to protect its people and it has failed to protect itself. On paper, yes. Democracy worked in the most literal sense. The votes were counted and the man who will be king was elected. In practice, the people have mistakenly voted away their democratic rights, and the nation is doomed to become a monarchy in which the king has weaponized loyalists to do his bidding or face persecution.If your only definition of a democracy is the dictionary definition, with zero real world applications or understanding of its outcomes or application of historical analysis, then youre not having a serious conversation. Youre just pointing to a check list and shrugging.To put it in a more obvious to understand way, how could you have a democracy if one day you woke up and half of the people in your country didnt believe that laws applied to them? 50% of the nation now believes they can do and get away with everything.

If Biden only pardoned him for the gun &amp; tax crime he was convicted for itd be more harmless. ButHe gave Hunter a pardon for any or all crimes against the United States of America from 2014-2024.Thats fucking wild and indicates that Hunter Biden was up to some sketchy illegal shit when he served on the board of Burisma Holdings, one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine, from 2014 until his term expired in April 2019.The blanket pardon from 2014-2024 indicates that Biden doesnt want him to be prosecuted for other crimes including corruption with regards to Ukraine once Trump is in office and there are any investigations into potential corruption.Hunter was on the board of the largest natural gas company in Ukraine with interests in the eastern part of the country such as Donbas from 2014-2019. He was granted a position on this board in 2014 when his father Joe Biden was the vice president and completely in charge of US foreign policy interests in Ukraine (Obama had given Biden authority to take charge in ukraine during his presidency). Burisma being such a large energy company (in what we used to admit was the most corrupt country in Europe) would have had SIGNIFICANT power and influence over politics in Ukraine.There is nothing wrong with questioning if any corruption or any illegal actions were taken by Hunter Biden during this time to advance his fathers geopolitical goals in Ukraine.Biden didnt only pardon Hunter for the specific crimes he was convicted of so far (gun crimes &amp; tax evasion). He was given a blanket pardon for any and all offenses against the United States of America for a nearly 11 year period!! Connect the dots and question what corrupt shit may have gone down in Ukraine to advance Bidens geopolitical goals.Joe Biden, while he was vice president of the United States, improperly withheld a loan guarantee and pressured Ukraine into firing prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to prevent a corruption investigation of Ukrainian gas company Burisma and to protect his son, Hunter Biden, who was on the Burisma board.Fucking hell, question the motives of those who had / have lower regardless of your personal political preferences. There is a chance that Hunter was doing illegal shit in Ukraine to advance his fathers geopolitical goals. That should be questioned regardless of political affiliation and if wrongdoing found, Hunter should have been able to face consequences. Joe Biden giving him a blanket immunity for any and all crimes against the United States of America (not just for the gun &amp; tax crimes he was recently convicted on) is highly suspect when all history is taken into consideration.Big guy will be dead soon hes old as fuck!

If Biden only pardoned him for the gun &amp; tax crime he was convicted for itd be more harmless. ButHe gave Hunter a pardon for any or all crimes against the United States of America from 2014-2024.Thats fucking wild and indicates that Hunter Biden was up to some sketchy illegal shit when he served on the board of Burisma Holdings, one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine, from 2014 until his term expired in April 2019.The blanket pardon from 2014-2024 indicates that Biden doesnt want him to be prosecuted for other crimes including corruption with regards to Ukraine once Trump is in office and there are any investigations into potential corruption.Hunter was on the board of the largest natural gas company in Ukraine with interests in the eastern part of the country such as Donbas from 2014-2019. He was granted a position on this board in 2014 when his father Joe Biden was the vice president and completely in charge of US foreign policy interests in Ukraine (Obama had given Biden authority to take charge in ukraine during his presidency). Burisma being such a large energy company (in what we used to admit was the most corrupt country in Europe) would have had SIGNIFICANT power and influence over politics in Ukraine.There is nothing wrong with questioning if any corruption or any illegal actions were taken by Hunter Biden during this time to advance his fathers geopolitical goals in Ukraine.Biden didnt only pardon Hunter for the specific crimes he was convicted of so far (gun crimes &amp; tax evasion). He was given a blanket pardon for any and all offenses against the United States of America for a nearly 11 year period!! Connect the dots and question what corrupt shit may have gone down in Ukraine to advance Bidens geopolitical goals.Fucking hell, question the motives of those who had / have lower regardless of your personal political preferences. There is a chance that Hunter was doing illegal shit in Ukraine to advance his fathers geopolitical goals. That should be questioned regardless of political affiliation and if wrongdoing found, Hunter should have been able to face consequences. Joe Biden giving him a blanket immunity for any and all crimes against the United States of America (not just for the gun &amp; tax crimes he was recently convicted on) is highly suspect when all history is taken into consideration.","title":"Biden pardons his sons crimes"},{"text":"Hot take here but in what way is prosecuting Hunter actually doing \\"real justice\\"? As far as I'm concerned the real crime was the powers that be trying to cover up the laptop story and claim it to be Russian disinformation. Hunter didn't cover it up, prosecuting him does nothing to address the actual problem and in my opinion was done as a means of misdirection intended to falsely portray justice where there is none to be found.If it wasn't for Hunter none of this would have ever come to light and quite frankly i wouldn't be surprised if he intentionally blew the whistle by letting that laptop get out.","title":"Biden pardons his sons crimes"},{"text":"Gen Z is so fucking toxic.

Trump broke the law all the way to the white house. Stop bitching about this one thing Biden did. Maybe spend a little more time focusing on Trump's many crimes and pardons of other people who have committed crimes for him instead of this one pardon that Biden gave.Previously I truly respected Biden's commitment to the rule of law by not pardoning his son, which surely was an incredibly difficult decision to follow through on.

The Finnish Yle (our BBC/NPR) gave three phases, why and how this happens: 1. Young men encounter plenty of misogynistic content online, for example on TikTok. Influencers (like Nick Fuentes) who spread hatred know that they get a lot of resonance, especially if they insert controversial one-liners, making their message spread far and wide. 2. Because the message is served with jokes and one-liners, young men aren't thinking about it critically (\\"hey, it is only a joke, lighten up\\"). The influencers serve their content with an \\"honest and straightforward\\" coating. This means that their audience does not stop to think, if the message they are hearing is smart, responsible or even real.\\nAnd when the message is repeated over and over again, daily, it sows a seed inside the mind. This is nothing new - it is historically very common, and used in propaganda. It also shows boys and young men that suddenly you can say anything without repercussions - before  there would've been shame and social control within the communities.3. Young men find a community centered around social media influencers, which gives them acceptance. Influencers, whose main agenda is hatred towards women and girls, love to pose as rich and successful \\"business men\\". They pose with luxury cars and watches and cigars - and they often also tell that they have several girlfriends. If their audience is not succesful, can't get a girlfriend or sex, or is feeling unwell, they aren't judged. They are told that it is not their fault. \\nHowever the narrative needs a villain, and in this narrative the villains are women and girls. Young women are an easy target for hatred. Women and minorities have more chances to succeed than ever before, in life and at work, and that gives young men the impression that something has been taken away from them - that the world is somehow unfairer to them than it was 100 years ago, or even during the 1950s. Their hatred is also targeted towards certain facets which have been speaking in public about social issues, like researchers, journalists, and social workers.\\nFans are ready and eager to protect their idols and forgive their blunders (or even crimes, like in the case of Andrew Tate). In Finland about 20 % of young men think that physical violence towards women and girls is \\"justified\\", and that a raped woman most likely \\"deserved\\" to be raped. These ideas aren't born in a vacuum.Editing to add that \\"young men\\" in this research means 18 - 25 year old males.","title":"You were the chosen demographic!"},{"text":"I'd have more faith in government and I might think more credibly of the media.","title":"How do you think your life would be different if the pandemic had never happened?"},{"text":"Declassify the pee-pee tapes!","title":"What would happen if Biden declassified all of the documents that the FBI found at mar a lago?"},{"text":"They got away with it.

ButHe gave Hunter a pardon for any or all crimes against the United States of America from 2014-2024.Thats fucking wild and indicates that Hunter Biden was up to some sketchy illegal shit when he served on the board of Burisma Holdings, one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine, from 2014 until his term expired in April 2019.The blanket pardon from 2014-2024 indicates that Biden doesnt want him to be prosecuted for other crimes including corruption with regards to Ukraine once Trump is in office and there are any investigations into potential corruption.Hunter was on the board of the largest natural gas company in Ukraine with interests in the eastern part of the country such as Donbas from 2014-2019. He was granted a position on this board in 2014 when his father Joe Biden was the vice president and completely in charge of US foreign policy interests in Ukraine (Obama had given Biden authority to take charge in ukraine during his presidency). Burisma being such a large energy company (in what we used to admit was the most corrupt country in Europe) would have had SIGNIFICANT power and influence over politics in Ukraine.There is nothing wrong with questioning if any corruption or any illegal actions were taken by Hunter Biden during this time to advance his fathers geopolitical goals in Ukraine.Biden didnt only pardon Hunter for the specific crimes he was convicted of so far (gun crimes &amp; tax evasion). He was given a blanket pardon for any and all offenses against the United States of America for a nearly 11 year period!! Connect the dots and question what corrupt shit may have gone down in Ukraine to advance Bidens geopolitical goals.Fucking hell, question the motives of those who had / have lower regardless of your personal political preferences. There is a chance that Hunter was doing illegal shit in Ukraine to advance his fathers geopolitical goals. That should be questioned regardless of political affiliation and if wrongdoing found, Hunter should have been able to face consequences. Joe Biden giving him a blanket immunity for any and all crimes against the United States of America (not just for the gun &amp; tax crimes he was recently convicted on) is highly suspect when all history is taken into consideration.","title":"Biden Issues a Full and Unconditional Pardon of His Son Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Embarrassing?

Evolutionary theory doesnt view traits solely based on reproductive success in a direct, one-to-one manner.While its true that same-sex attraction doesnt directly contribute to reproduction, there are several factors that complicate the argument. For example, some researchers suggest that non-reproductive behaviors may persist in populations because they offer social, cooperative, or other advantages. Additionally, there may be genetic or environmental factors that influence sexual orientation, with some studies suggesting that genes, prenatal hormone exposure, or even social factors might all play a role.Moreover, evolution isnt just about individual reproduction; its also about the survival and success of groups. Same-sex behavior is observed in many animal species and may serve a variety of roles beyond reproduction, such as reinforcing social bonds or alliances, which can indirectly support the survival of related individuals.In conclusion, sexual orientation is a complex trait and not as straightforward as evolutionary theories based on reproduction alone. Homosexuality is not classified as a mental illness by major health organizations like the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization.","title":"How Anti-Trans Ads Secured Trumps 2024 Victory"},{"text":"people might have maintained more regular in-person interactions with friends and family","title":"How do you think your life would be different if the pandemic had never happened?"},{"text":"Awesome","title":"Joe Biden pardons Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Anyone who deliberately ignores murdering bank robbers to go after harmless jaywalkers has made a conscious choice to forfeit the moral high ground.

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Departments decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.  The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room C with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunters cases.\\n \\n No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son C and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter C who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break me C and theres no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. Theyll be fair-minded. Heres the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice C and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision. Executive Grant of Clemency\\nJoseph R.

How many other cases have you heard of where someone was convicted years and years later after buying a gun under the false pretense of not being addicted to drugs? It literally doesn't happen, and the people criticizing this are the same ones that believe every American should have the unconditional right to bare arms. Yet now all of a sudden they have a problem with someone having a gun and think that this pardon is absolute evil.Just blows my mind. If being addicted to drugs stopped anyone from actually purchasing and owning a firearm then every rural county that runs on meth wouldn't have 5 guns per a household. It was a bull shit conviction, and I honestly respect Biden for standing on business and not taking the high road. He clearly really loves his son, and as a recovering addict, I'm very proud of Hunter for being able to maintain sobriety for the past 5+ years while suffering through constant harassment and threats correlating to the time he spent in active addiction.

They will likely struggle to do things like find good jobs, pay for school or housing, and find fulfillment in their professional and personal lives.  The general outlook for their generation is pretty bad.In times like these, grifters and liars thrive, and bigotry of all stripes finds a toehold.  A wave of manosphere grifters, from the beginnings of the pick-up artist movement on through GamerGate and now guys like Andrew Tate, Joe Rogan, Sneako, Jordan Peterson, and so forth, have come out of the woodwork and offered simple solutions to the very complex problems and feelings young men today are struggling with.Do these solutions work?  Of course not.  The closest to effective would probably be what little practical advice Peterson accidentally gives (it is good for your physical and mental well being to keep a clean room), but its wrapped front and back in a bunch of nonsense about hierarchies and the importance of adherence to traditional gender roles.Like liars throughout history, these grifters have realized that hard times do not produce hard men, they produce desperate men.  Men willing to look to someone, anyone, who offers them some measure of succor.And to these suffering young men, the grifters provide a scapegoat.  Sometimes its immigrants or foreigners, sometimes its the LGBTQ community, but most often, it is women.  They are an easy scapegoat for an audience of young men who feel like someone took something from them, that they are not being given what they are owed.And because so many people are willing to accept a comfortable lie instead of difficult truths, these grifters and liars now have huge audiences of young men looking for respite and meaning that they will never find.Thats why.","title":"You were the chosen demographic!"},{"text":" Been to a few of these places.

We're talking about layered individuals wherein each layer peeled back reveals more unconfronted malignancy which follows from predictable patterns of behavior. They are those who are conditioned to respond to negative stumuli in hyper specific and counterproductive ways. What I've noticed: -Surface Level: A strong desire to avoid confrontation leads these people to project an outward persona which does not reflect their actual beliefs. This curated version of themselves shields them from judgment should they encounter resistance to their point of view.-Going Deeper: These people save their true thoughts for those they perceive to be like minded, and privately consume media that reinforces (and refuses to challenge) their ideologies. Challenges to their ideologies are treated like attacks on their identity, because in some part of their minds the two concepts are synonymous. -Even Deeper: They react to change or uncertainty with fear and anger. Direct confrontation is met with obscene tantrums and, in extreme cases, violence. Because their ideology has become core to their identity, dismantling the one threatens the stability of the other. -Deep: To avoid redefining their identities and thus inviting uncertainty or change into their lives, they select for people and social circumstances that reinforce a concept of self that's rooted in malignant tendencies. They should seek therapy, but do not actually want to heal or grow. Rather there is comfort in familiarity even if the familiar circumstances and structures are rooted in traumatic or otherwise uncomfortable circumstances. As peers pull away, they become increasingly entrenched in their ideology and resist bonding with others who do not share their views, resulting in a personalist cult mentality which, as it currently stands, props up Trump as a messianic figure and GOP politicians as disciples carrying his message and legacy. The last time we saw such devotion to a president, it was Reagan, and I'd argue the sentiment and willful ignorance were rooted in precisely the same structures.I reject the idea that continuing to talk to these people has any real value. Rather if they have proven anything, it is that they have committed themselves to this course and nothing, even losing contact with close family, will deprogram them. Ultimately there is no effective means to make these people see sense except to let their messiah hurt them so bad they can no longer place blame in anyone but him for their suffering. It's bitter medicine, but it's about the only thing remaining that might actually work. Very basically, they've made their bed.

A part of me says this is the wrong precedent that the other side can use to downgrade everything good that Biden did.They were going to do that anyways. This changes nothing. All it is, is a father giving his son a chance to escape a fascist regime coming in. My only thought process outside of this is how bad was it gonna get for Hunter if this pardon was not gonna be there?They were trying to throw the book at him... because he was the Presidents son. Do you not see a problem with that? Additionally, even Trump said he would consider pardoning Hunter. Which honestly means nothing, but the fact of the matter is... nobody thought what he did was that bad and it was all politically based.","title":"Biden pardons his son Hunter despite previous pledges not to"},{"text":"You said Trumps chaotic second term as if his second term has even begun.","title":"CMV: The statement about Hunter Biden's pardon will be a stain on Biden's legacy, deservedly so."},{"text":"The love of a father for  a son, and he does raise a good point about purely political persecution.","title":"President Biden Says He Signed a Pardon for His Son, Hunter"},{"text":"Fuck him, it has the appearance of impropriety.?

They intentionally sabotaged the government, lied to people with promises of money trickling down from the wealthy, and divided the country along political lines.We are literally watching history repeat itself and it's fucking bullshit that most of us learned all this shit in school and should know better.  The Republicans haven't really given a fuck about Americans for nearly 100 years and people are still so blind to it.MAGA is more like MAGDA, Make America Great Depression Again.","title":"I cant believe Joe Biden  loves his son."},{"text":"Remember that sweet moment when Bad Built Bleach Blonde Butch Body started to speak and Hunter and his lawyer immediately got up and walked out with the cameras following them?","title":"Republicans say Biden is a liar after he pardons his son, Hunter"},{"text":"It's about time, we figured that would happen but he waited until it was a moot point.","title":"President Biden pardons his son Hunter Biden --- Rule for thee, not for us!"},{"text":"Finally","title":"Breaking: Biden Pardons His Son"},{"text":"It fits in line with their simplistic world view.
