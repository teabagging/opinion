This is a tired old talking point.  The US spends more as a percentage of GDP.  It also spends more per capita.  But that's because European countries attribute their shortfalls in a way that hides what they have left unpaid at the end of the year.  They do this as an accounting trick to try and avoid for as long as possible an economic crash from outrageous deficit spending.  But that little accounting trick doesn't hold off reality forever.  And when it's time to pay the piper, Europe starts implementing crushing austerity measures.  And one of the first things to go is always healthcare.  Just look at how Wikipedia documented the Greek crash in 2009...\\n  \\nThe crisis included revelations that previous data on government debt levels and deficits had been underreported by the Greek government;[14][15][16] indeed, the official forecast for the 2009 budget deficit was less than half the final value, and after revisions according to Eurostat methodology, the 2009 government debt was raised from $269.3bn to $299.7bn, about 11% higher than previously reported.  \\n  \\nAmenesty.org reported specifically on the necessary changes to Healthcare spending...  \\n  \\nThe Greek government began to introduce austerity measures in 2010, in response to the global financial crisis that started in 2008. Public spending was slashed by 32% across sectors, with public health expenditure falling by nearly 43% between 2009 and 2017.\\n  So, no.  We do not spend more.  We simply report our spending more honestly.  European countries are notorious for lying about their economies to try and embarrass the United States and justify their poor fiscal policies.  And you were very gullible to simply take their word for it.  Don't look at their self reported numbers, and don't look at numbers from globalist-minded organizations.  Look at the eventual economy crashes and the changes that have to be made to fix them.  That is where you find the real numbers.","title":"Trump: US Could Withdraw From NATO"},{"text":"That interviewer dropped the ball so many times.

(He was the head of the CIA that pulled off several regime changes in other countries and did MKUltra here. Ruthless fellow.)  So some people think Allen (possibly with his brother's help) orchestrated the assassination. Allen Dulles was also conveniently on the Warren Commission that investigated the assassination.

Children available for adoption also often have greater difficulties, from dealing with violent and psychotic family members who may stalk and harass you, to the extreme behavioural and medical issues the children will likely have from living in bad circumstances that CPS usually takes a decade to pull them out of (giving the birth parents as many chances as possible is their current guideline, yes, even if theyve physically abused the child or nearly killed them). They call adopting parenting on hard, and for many agencies, they prefer parents whove already raised their own children or have degrees in child psychology, because the difficulty and dedication is so high. I am of course presuming you want to adopt from foster care. If you want to adopt a lovely new baby or child whos family died in a car crash or something, be rest assured that theres a list ten miles long for every baby that becomes available for adoption, even the very sick ones, and the second kind of orphan is extremely uncommon. In most cases, its not foster to adopt that most needed. Its just plain old foster carers. Of course that job has major burnout, because you will love a child and help them and see them grow and recover and see their behaviour improve as they relish in a sense of safety - but its all so you can return to the child to their birth home, which is the main goal of CPS. Yes, that often means handing a child back into abuse knowingly and repeatedly, and seeing them fall apart psychologically due to the repeated betrayals. It can also, sometimes, be the right thing to do. It is usually somewhat gray.It breaks people down, But if you think you could do that, its a very noble thing to do. Look into fostering if youre up for it. They need people. They absolutely do. But they also use them up like toilet paper, so be prepared to get wiped if you do.","title":"Same-sex couples are fast-tracking plans to marry and have kids before Trump takes office"},{"text":"Yeah, it's very obvious.

It does not benefit one partner over another, nor one gender over another.\\"I need you to trust that I do love you. I'm not comfortable using that kind of language around my male friends, and I think you should respect this boundary instead of trying to force me to perform my affection for you in ways that I'm not comfortable with.\\"If a boyfriend says this to his girlfriend, the girlfriend now *knows* her boyfriend's limits and can make a fully informed decision for herself. She is now equipped with the knowledge that 1) her boyfriend will not provide much in the way of affection and 2) that she needs more affection that he is going to give her. Now she knows that the relationship is a dead end and can end things and seek a partner better suited to her needs. Gf wants something super basic and bf has some shitty, likely toxic reason for not providing it, but frames the situation with psychobabble language so that they are the normal one and gf is somehow overstepping/being controlling.This is really just an exercise in each person's sense of self. The girlfriend has a need, and thus she must advocate for herself. The boyfriend is shitty and cannot be expected to look out for his partner's best interests. Just because a shitty person is talking does not mean what they are saying is true. The girlfriend should take an inventory, see they are expressing normal and sincere needs, and then realize that the boyfriend's needs are very different from her own and they are thusly a poor match. To me, the solution is not doing away with \\"therapy speak\\" but rather ensuring that we are all cognizant of our needs and able to fairly determine if our partner is capable and willing to meet them. This necessarily involves being able to clearly communicate those needs. Then, if the partner is incapable or unwilling, then we are just incompatible.I do not think I am victim blaming when I say these undervalued girlfriends and boyfriends need to hike up their britches and take action to create the life they want. And the first step is dumping the partners who are emotionally draining and selfish. However, my further contention is that when abused, therapy speak actively enables/exacerbates the difficulty for the other partner. Because now the abusive partner is NOT just saying \\"I don't care, leave me alone,\\" which is much easier to call out as shitty. They're saying the same thing, trussed up in cosmetically empathetic language that shields them from further scrutiny and valid critique. They use the tropes of therapy speak to rebut partner's efforts to make their own needs heard.How does it shield anyone from anything? A person is still judging how their partner's words and actions are making them feel. And if they make them feel poor, then they are incompatible. It seems to me that your issue with \\"therapy speak\\" requires people to be utterly ignorant of their needs and their ability to act to make their lives better.","title":"CMV: \\"therapy speak\\" as a conflict resolution tool is at best unhelpful and at worst counterproductive for many people in romantic relationships"},{"text":"instead why doesn't he declare a national emegercy all the homeless in this country and help them?","title":"Many targeted for removal by Trump cant be deported, ICE data shows"},{"text":" Nothing about the ammendment would have to be changed.

People like to say they're not sexist or racist, but if that was really the case then we would've long passed policies that would've increase opportunities in black, low income communities, until the incarceration rates weren't so heavily skewed to black people. Instead, we kept the status quo, and continue to let it happen. Harris was a women, and she was black. She doesn't fall under the traditional role. She doesn't have her own blood related children. Which I personally don't care, but god knows half this country takes it very seriously. People judge based on this shit. So the whole \\"I can't put my finger on it but there isn't something quite right with her\\" is bullshit based on emotional feelings rather than logic. THIS is what sexism and racism looks like.

You might be shadow banned or something because the comment seems to have disappeared.The alternatives are almost endless. You are wanting to use tariffs to coerce or incentivise better labour conditions. The tariff isn't actually important here, the coercion or incentive is. Tariffs are not particularly cheap, and have pretty substantial economic costs on the country using them. Obama's tariffs on tires for example cost around $900,000 per job saved, and killed more American jobs then it secured.You could basically just pay off some other countries directly and have better cost:reward outcomes. You could attach foreign aid to labour reform, you could earmark foreign aid directly for investing in better labour protections.You can also just do straight quid pro quos through lateral means. If *you* want access to my counter-narcotics information, *I* want better enforcement of labour standards.There's more direct things you could do, like investing in a populace through education visas (or just visas more broadly) to directly aid the workers gain human capital and prospects. You can use international organisations like the ILO or the UN to push certain things. Hell, you could only support certain country bids to host the Olympics if they have certain labour standards.For more direct coercion, you could sanction specific leaders or entities rather than just a general import tariff. Ban leaders from visiting desirable locations and they might think slave labour is less beneficial. I wouldn't recommend it, but you could use military influence to coerce labour reform.You can create international standards for the sake of lowering transaction costs (like lesser versions of the EU common market). You can create local level engagements and encourage cross-national civic engagement. Have unions be engaged through sister city engagements.There's so many avenues to engage, incentivise or coerce, you're really just limited by your imagination.","title":"And no, I am not a Trump supporter just because I call out free trade"},{"text":"Trump didnt run out the clock, Garland did.

It would not be anything near what you were trying to convey at all.  FOX entertainment has a good habit of that.Let's go to the one thing that EVERYONE keeps skipping over. Do you know how long it takes to do the paperwork for any Reserve Components to be used as law enforcement? It is a new document every time. Do you have any clue how long it takes to organize fuel, vehicles, communication assets, food, water and the thousands of other logistical requirements for just one day of a deployment like that? I have been there, I have done that as they say. It takes days for two hundred troops, it takes weeks for a thousand or more. I have been there. I have done that. If you want to use half truths and misquotes from a source, at least have the integrity to go back and fact check the entire background. You are still sitting there, without research, quoting someone else who purposely misleads someone, using resources that do not have links or references. So go ahead, take the time to listen to the interrogation of the various Extremist Conservative Congress members of the entire question and answer. My colleagues and I obviously watched it. We still wonder why trump or somebody in his staff notify the LEO if they needed help .Do you realize there are public documents that some of trumps staff attempted to enter into the equation after the fact. Didn't go very well with LEO. That documentation suddenly disappeared again. Whatever you do, do not ever tell me or any of my colleagues how the structure works within the branch's that we all have spent most of our lives at. I don't care if you are quoting something written by the chief of staff, YOU have no true idea of what and how BOG are deployed. I am going to give you some really good advice that was given to myself and a group of policy assessment officers, years and years ago. \\"Don't quote shit and garbage. It makes your breath stink\\".

I am well aware that the decision making process not only involves one person; especially when involving unity of command with the National Guard - others involved include USNORTHCOM, Joint Chiefs, the various undersecretaries and even the Secretary of State who confers on such matters. And this is why Congress places the blame more broadly on \\"Pentagon leadership\\" and \\"the Department of Defense.\\"But the fact remains - due to last minute changes in the chain of command, only 3 people could make the call to deploy DCNG at any time; Commander in Chief, SecDef, &amp; SecArmy. The latter 2 fell off the face of the earth and the president watched it unfold live on TV with a diet coke long before anyone even made it in to the building (according to Oval Office CCTV footage). And not only did those three do nothing, but there was no sense of urgency from top military leaders to deploy either - leaving leaders on the ground with a face full of egg. DCNG was geared up &amp; ready two miles up the road waiting for the call from up top (due to last second changes in the chain of command). If you don't want to know the truth, I respect your wishes. Top leaders \\"intentionally\\" endangered Congress that day - again not my words - and Congress wants to know why and who else was involved. Those are the facts as they currently stand.Most citizens would rather not bury their head in the sand over on memory lane just because it feels familiar. So Sir, don't throw sand in my eyes.

In July labor released their yearly report on wages-versus inflation. From Jan 20 2021 to Q1 2024, the average American only has had wage-gains of .7% against inflation. This means in-essence the average American is monetarily doing worse than four-years ago. That yes 30% have likely seen significant gains against inflation, 30% have equally seen similar loses. Its hard to call an economy \\"good\\" when the average person is doing the same. If you compare this to the Trump years, the average American gained 16.5% against inflation. Then you have the choirous of people chanting how the economy is not bad, for people who are in the bottom 50% of wage gains you are going to make them more angry.(2) - Kamala Harris was horrendously unpopular. There was a massive campaign to cover up her misgivings. She would not take interviews, Nate Cohn removed any \\"Trump Favoring\\" polls as being inaccurate (then made an entire op-ed talking about after removing them it didn't change the average), and the media clearly did not act independent (i.e. justifiably calling out Trump for tips being tax-free, but acting like its an amazing policy when Kamala brought it up). Nearly every person had a red-line that Kamala Harris crossed as a promise either during the Joe Biden presidency or her horrendous presidential primary campaign, she never showed people how she changed. If you disliked the rise of crime, Kamala was the person who moved to make theft a misdemeanor. Then her actions nearing the end of the campaign was horrendous from calling husband's wife-beaters if they voted for her or calling anyone voting trump as voting for fascism; its hard to look at Trump and Kamala and say how either rhetoric is actually worse (for me the wife-beating thing was a bridge way too far). (3) - The reason Democrats had more behind them in 2016, was because they had a realistic platform that the majority of the American public is behind. If you look at Pew or Gallup nearly every Progressive policy that the Democratic now puppets is disliked by a super-majority of the population. The only time to fund a resistance is if the majority of Americans is behind you, if they don't it just makes the people against the policy more entrenched. (4) - The movement of Men under the age of 30 is because of the economy. They see what was possible 10-years back and see how it is impossible for them now. You graduate from college, many white-collar jobs are not hiring, and those hiring are generally underemploying people. People want enjoyable careers that they believe are at their level, if they need to buy houses/cars or get careers below what they deserve, they will be unhappy.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Bye bye Baron haha","title":"Trump aims to end birthright citizenship, says American citizens with family here illegally may be deported"},{"text":"Trump is famous for reading rules and abiding by them.","title":"Many targeted for removal by Trump cant be deported, ICE data shows"},{"text":"Have kids?","title":"Same-sex couples are fast-tracking plans to marry and have kids before Trump takes office"},{"text":"Kush strains probably","title":"The Weed Industry Isn't Too Anxious About Donald Trumps Second Term"},{"text":"There are a few problems.Republicans are only committed to TEARING DOWN.Look at all the good ideas theyve pissed on.High Speed Rail.

Don't let these headlines fool you. All he's done through these so called \\"negotiations,\\" is shown us that he's eager to cave into Putin's demands. Even suggesting the U.S. withdraw from NATO.This is as good a time as any to remind people of just how great an asset Trump has been for Putin.While Trump was president, he frequently repeated Kremlin propaganda about things like the annexation of Crimea, about NATO in particular, and about the threat of Russian cyber attacks and election interference, even siding with Putin over our own intelligence agencies on the matter.Trump has repeated Putin's false claims about Ukraine that served as a pretext for his invasion.Trump said that Putin did *\\"an amazing job of taking the mantle\\"* when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. And in 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump encouraged the annexation of the territory and repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, *\\"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\\"*Trump also refused to condemn Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian military vessels in 2018.Ahead of the 2016 RNC, the Trump campaign blocked Republican party language that called for the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, while at a news conference in July 2016, he pleaded with Russia to continue its attacks, saying,  \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\\"Trump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and used hacked emails to attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\\"Trump continued denying that Russia interfered in the election.After the 2016 election, The Trump transition team begged the Russians not to escalate in response to sanctions that were imposed under Obama. Michael Flynn personally asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation because the incoming Trump admin intended to have a good relationship with Putin.Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was considering lifting Russian sanctions, he said, *\\"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\\"*In 2017, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that included new Russian sanctions. Trump was reluctant to signing the bill and it was reported that the Trump admin demanded that the language in the bill be \\"watered down.\\" Those involved said that Trump would have likely shot the sanctions down if they didn't pass with a veto proof majority in both houses.In response to Putin being labeled a \\"killer\\" for murdering his political opponents, Trump said in 2015, *\\"I haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.\\"* Then again, in response to the same accusations against Putin in 2017, he said, *\\"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\\"*Trump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate. Trump even considered returning multiple spy bases to Russia located in Maryland and New York after the Obama administration seized the compounds and expelled all Russian \\"diplomats.\\"Trump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.Trump has also repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin on one of his most important goalsthe weakening of NATO. Trump has called NATO \\"obsolete,\\" and has reportedly, on several occasions, said that he wants to withdraw from NATO.Trump even proposed working directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and lawmakers had to remind him that Russia was responsible for repeatedly engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S.The Trump administration lifted sanctions on Russian Oligarch, and Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska.Trump also tried to rescind Russian sanctions after defector, Sergei Skripal was poisoned in an assassination attempt by Russia.Trump abandoned our Kurdish allies and withdrew from Syria, which helped aid Russian proxy wars and gave Putin the opportunity to take over abandoned U.S. military outposts.Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \\"delinquent.\\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.Trump described NATO as if it was going bankrupt, saying, *\\"I went to NATO. And NATO was essentially going out of business 'cause people weren't paying and it was going down, down, down,\\"*Trump doesn't even know how NATO works...in 2014, NATO members agreed to move \\"toward\\" spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense by 2024. The 2 percent is a benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense in order to be able to contribute to the joint defense of the alliance. However, the goal is voluntary, and there is no debt or \\"delinquency\\" involved.Despite what Trump thinks, each country's spending doesn't go towards some NATO \\"fund\\", but towards their own defense.Trump has called the U.S., *\\"the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.\\"* Not comprehending that the funding benchmark has to do with each country's own defense spending. We're not \\"paying for NATO.\\" In fact, our military spending has actually decreased over recent years.NATO was established after WWII to help combat Soviet expansion. Republicans, much like Trump, have argued NATO is irrelevant now that the Soviet Union is gone. This is absurd.Trump campaigned on the idea of capitulating to Putin. Arguing that if we just give Putin what he wants, the war will end, just like that. However, much like Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he was a dangerous expansionist looking to consolidate power through any means, while his overtures of peace were merely strategic moves, U.S leaders should take the same stance against Putin.That's because Putin is also looking to consolidate power. His goal is to annex as much of Ukraine as possible, rob its people of their independence, then continue with his \\"special military occupation,\\" err, I mean *operation* into other regions of Eastern Europe, where he will expand his oil empire and create soviet-like \\"spheres of influence\\" in territories that his military seizes.Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that if Trump were president, this war wouldn't have happened. Not only is this delusional, but it's very likely, judging by everything I've pointed out, that Trump helped accelerate this war in the first place, and as president, he will continue to help advance Putin's autocratic, warmongering, land grabbing agenda and his efforts to expand his oil empire.","title":"I know Vladimir well, this is his time to act C Donald Trump presses Putin for ceasefire with Ukraine"},{"text":"\\"unwavering in her loyalty\\" - this is why he chose her.

The DNC is not going anywhere this is not the first time they have had to re invent themselves to be relevant again. It is the third. The first was after the Civil war, where the DNC was even more conservative the GOP is now and has just lost the war. That is right the entire southeastern region of the US was a DNC strong hold in most of the 1800's and well into the 1900's It was so bad in fact this is where the term \\"Yellow dog Democrat\\" comes from.Which brings to the second time  the DNC reinvented itself.

It is an eye opener.Shortly after this the DNC slowly stopped being as conservative and began becoming much more liberal while it  also moved away from the rural south and embracing mainstream media, urban centers, and cooperate (cough cough) campaign donations. The DNC and  the GOP are going no where because they have convinced the sheeple that these are your only options.

The thing that is hopefully useful comes from examining the point of failure. So we must ask ourselves: is the problem manageable? To answer, we need to understand where it first arises. Given the problem of Alfie failing to respect Betty: Does Alfie want to respect Betty? Does that mean the same thing to both of them? Is that question of belief and attitude, or a question of behavior? Theres a big difference depending on the point of failure. Im only going to detail two, because this is getting impossibly long for a Reddit comment and I think it illustrates it well enough. In one world, Alfie sincerely considered all the impacts on Betty, heard and integrated her communication about her feelings and perspective, analyzed the totality of the situation, and figures that the things Betty expressed were less impactful than any options of achieving the same outcomes that would require more from him. He tells her that belief, using therapy jargon. Now, a critical step  He either includes her or excludes her in his own opinion making process. If he includes her by opening the door for clarification, by sharing that his viewpoint includes consideration for Bettys well being and desires, and explains how the negative impact on him makes a change undesirable to him, even though he wants to improve the situation, then they can examine that together so Betty can better appreciate it and accept it and they can try to find alternatives to improve the problem  maybe they lower their standards, maybe they hire a maid, maybe they use disposable dishes. Maybe the infrequent help from Alfie is not just after atypical events but also mundane help at a certain once a week or once a month or whatever balances out the impact, practically or symbolically. Maybe they make coupons for it, or they use a game of chance to decide. Whatever solution they find, Alfie is using the verbiage of therapy jargon to represent his actual needs, and thats really good. Betty has to have similar skills for them to understand each other. But communication between people is just the process of connecting, and sometimes people cant reconcile more fundamental issues. Ultimately, even if the connection of ideas is happening, none of it matters if Alfie is unwilling to engage and update his beliefs. He may have completely legitimate reasons to value not contributing more, but if he doesnt honestly engage to check those against Bettys valuation of his help and the impact on her, and work with her to understand each others actual needsthen the relationship is not built on mutual respect. But again, is that because he doesnt want to respect her? Or does he simply lack the awareness and wisdom to understand that he doesnt respect her but is willing to do the work on himself to achieve that? If its the latter, then the therapy tools are useful to help him have a conceptual grasp on the subject and for Betty to help him grow in that space. This is where those elements lists in sections A and B are useful  Alfie can dive in and find if the disrespect is related to his relationship with the topic being more powerful than his respect for Betty in other area, or if its related to his personal beliefs about domestic responsibilities as a feminine role and if that is something he can examine and determine if he wants to hold, or if its related to a deeper selfishness or shame about expressing something authentically, or whatever psychological issue is at play. Regardless, the language of therapy can be helpful to him and to Betty in his process of learning and growth, and can be equally helpful for both to use in managing the negative impacts that arise from the underlying issue.BUTIf he doesnt value respecting her, and doesnt have a desire to change that value, then the use of the language is just another layer of information that isnt doing anything towards a healthy and effective relationship. Not everyone has the maturity of consciousness and self-awareness to have a good understanding of their own value systems or what inform them. Every single person needs help in developing that maturity. Who we choose to help is informed by our own individualized values and beliefs, so Im not going to necessarily say Betty should end her relationship with Alfie because he doesnt respect her. The universal thing I will say is that we should all base our decisions on how we share our lives with other people with deliberate engagement to understand and with consideration for the intentions and capabilities of others. Hope this is helpful for whoever reads it!","title":"CMV: \\"therapy speak\\" as a conflict resolution tool is at best unhelpful and at worst counterproductive for many people in romantic relationships"},{"text":" The Hypothetical Situation Alfred and Betty both want a tidy house, and have casually given each other information about what that means. They generally agree that tidy means a state of the house in which the dishes are washed and put away, the floors are clear of messy clutter and is clean of mud or anything else, the laundry is washed and dried and put away without any piles that sit out. It is especially important to Alfie that the dishes are done before bed, and it also is something he doesnt like to do himself. Its not very important to Alfie that the laundry is done, but Betty enjoys doing that and takes responsibility for keeping up with that. However, Betty also puts in most of the day to day effort on all the tasks and Alfie only puts in effort reliably under atypical circumstances, such as helping with dishes after they have dinner guests or deep cleaning the carpet after an accident got mud on the floor inside. Betty resents the imbalance of effort, and has brought it up to Alfie.A version where Alfie may have or may not have done a lot of deep work but has done enough to use the language youre talking about might end up with Betty feeling bad for bringing it up because of points Alfie raised about imbalance of effort in financial support and the energetic costs of working so hard. Perhaps he includes the detail that justifies his discomfort with the dishes, which is the thing Betty didnt prioritize and is most important to him. # Hypothetical Outcomes of Therapy JargonWhat are the potential outcomes of Alfie using this language? I would say it depends on all the factors in A and B that are relevant to his use of it. Theres a good and bad version of the outcome where he and Betty agree that her share of the workload is the best balance given the totality of circumstances  they both want a tidy house, and Betty values the impact on Alfies comfort and the impact of his contributions in other domains they share, so she updates her belief about the balance of effort.This is only a good outcome if she has agency in that decision and Alfie is a good faith participant  he can use all the jargon to express why he doesnt put in the same degree of effort, but that is only his side of things. He must also consider his prior understanding and expectations of Betty and impacts on her, then receive the information she shares, then integrate that into a new understanding, then share that understanding, then discuss the totality of impacts and intentions with Betty to make a new set of shared expectations  even if it looks the same, the process requires each step to be authentic. If he doesnt participate in reconciling the issues Betty raised about her feelings, if he isnt also listening and considering her wants and needs, then the issue is with Alfies respect for Betty as a teammate towards a shared goal. He may *feel* a sense of those things, but there is a legitimate and fundamental issue of disrespect.","title":"CMV: \\"therapy speak\\" as a conflict resolution tool is at best unhelpful and at worst counterproductive for many people in romantic relationships"},{"text":"I think it's worth a try, but surely if Trump is willing to arrest them already, a legal fiction like a pardon is not going to stop him from seeking revenge","title":"??President-elect Trump says members of Jan. 6 committee should be jailed"},{"text":"That makes no sense and you just outted yourself as lying.

The things I think and believe if Im deliberately considering emotional intelligence;3. The experiences and biological factors that contribute to my defaults/instincts (nature and nurture without deliberate intervention focused on emotional intelligence);4. The same kind of factors as 3 that contribute to my higher-order emotional intelligence thinking (therapy, etc);5. The things I actually express externally;6-9.

The circumstances and setting for problem solving (time and environmental constraints, relative importance to each party, individuals qualities that may affect interpretation or integration, etc) and the impacts on the beliefs and derived posture of each party. Ok, so all those are impacting the relationship and problem-solving process continuously. Thats a lot of moving parts, and there are guaranteed unavoidable differences that present challenges. The most significant are differences in the reality of desired outcomes.

I don't understand how we lost this time around.At the risk of sounding a bit stereotypical, the resentment against \\"coastal elites\\" is definitely a thing. And in some ways, it's pretty warranted. I grew up in a part of the Bay Area that's highly wealthy, liberal, and educated. Many people I grew up around have never left and never really spent time in different parts of the country where people think differently. A lot of my family who still live there are pretty clueless to the struggles of average Americans, let alone the working class (regardless of political affiliation). I'm not necessarily saying that's the case for you, IMO silicon valley is far more elitist than NYC. But I think a big factor is a working class who feel like the system isn't working for them and Democrats represent that system. I don't think Trump is going to help them either, but they at least think he hears them.I also think a decade of being told cops are evil and then proudly saying vote for a cop couldn't have helped Harris among liberals. I saw Harris as a less controversial but also less accomplished version of Hillary.

The party coalitions are fluid and can shift in any direction. A lot can change in four years.The underlying political framework of 2020 through 2024 was highly unique, deeply affected by multiple events and situations that are unlikely to ever occur again this century. Democrats will not nominate someone in their 70s again, who becomes too old to serve a second term. The incumbent president is unlikely to drop out of the race three months before the election. Democrats will likely not nominate another woman, person of color, or LGBTQ person until after Republicans have already done so.The first woman president will be a Republican. Democrats will fret over electability in future primaries and the next few candidates will be straight white men.With that in mind, its possible that just nominating a straight white man under 60, who has a credible blue collar background, is enough to scramble the coalitions again even if the party changes absolutely nothing about their platform.

Rosen.[20][27][17][22][34] Quickly after her hiring, Habba filed a $100 million lawsuit on Trump's behalf against The New York Times, three Times reporters, and Trump's niece, Mary L. Trump.[17] Her lawsuit was dismissed by the judge for \\"fail[ing] as a matter of constitutional law\\".[35\\nTwo months after issuing that decision, Middlebrooks sanctioned the Trump lawyers, including Habba, Michael T. Madaio, Peter Ticktin, and Jamie Alan Sasson. They were assessed $50,000 penalties, plus $16,000 to cover the legal fees paid by one of the defendants.[46] Later in January 2023, Middlebrooks ordered Trump, Habba, and her firm to pay $938,000 in legal costs for 31 defendants, including the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton, and former FBI director James Comey.[47][48] The judge wrote about the lawsuit brought by Habba: \\"No reasonable lawyer would have filed it. Intended for a political purpose, none of the counts of the amended complaint stated a cognizable legal claim.\\"[49] \\nShe basically makes those lawyers that advertise on city buses look like Johnnie Cochran by comparison.","title":"Trump says personal lawyer Habba to serve as presidential counselor, Truth Social post says"},{"text":"Love how he talks about jailing elected reps and its like ahhhh cool cool interesting","title":"Donald Trump's 'Meet the Press' interview was a media failure to defend truth"},{"text":"There's nothing autistic about Elon, does he claim that??

They are just fundamentally miserable fucks. Crybullies. With some people though you can get them to vote economic resentment over cultural resentment. These are the exact people the Democratic party is hemorrhaging. Newsflash; The midwest union vote was *never* culturally progressive, but they still voted left because if you give them big enough populist enough economic stuff  and demonize rich people enough, they will pick their economic resentment over their cultural resentment. The left needs to run and do some retarded left economic populism stuff to gain anti-establishment credibility. As the right falls further into conspiracy nativism the only thing the left has with the juice to fight back is conspiracy class warfare. Like the right does for immigrants the left needs to lock in on a small slice of the population, rich people,  and blame all the nations problems on them. I think it might be too far for politicians, but look at how people are reacting to the United Healthcare CEO getting murdered. There is a real market for class resentment.

That and she made some of the same mistakes as Hillary made, ignoring certain groups of voters as well as topics.What should have happened is this: the day after Joe Biden was inaugurated as President, he should have spoken to the American public and told them he was there for one reason and one reason only: to right the course of the country. He should have said he was only going to serve one term and he would devote all his resources to accomplishing his goal of straightening out the country after the turmoil of the Trump Presidency and the pandemic.This would have given the DNC four years to retool their message to the American people and give ample time to vet and groom a frontrunner for 2024.

I criticize a lack of clear messaging rather than a specific policy direction or ideology for this reason. She expanded Bidens lead in union voters and won non-college educated union men while losing non-college-educated men, suggesting that the way unions consistently organize and inform their members worked well for Harris and that she was good enough to overcome biases against her from racism or sexism when people knew her. Other Democrats who had longer campaigns didnt have the same issues she did. Theres some good talent out there on our side thats waiting to come into leadership.

So the only way you dont break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.Welker also asked about the zero-tolerance policy during Trumps first term, where families would be separated at the border as a means of deterrence for those who chose to enter the U.S. illegally. Trump eventually ended the practice.We dont have to separate families, Trump said. Well send the whole family very humanely, back to the country where they came.So no more family separations? Welker asked. Youre not reviving the zero-tolerance policy?It depends on the family, Trump said, adding later: If they come here illegally but their family is here legally, then the family has a choice.

But according to a?[review by the Library of Congress](https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthright-citizenship/global.php), more than 30 nations provide birthright citizenship, including Canada and Brazil.The president-elect used a softer tone when discussing Dreamers, those who arrived in the U.S. nearly 20 or more years ago as children and are covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program that has allowed them to remain in the country and work legally.We have to do something about the Dreamers, because these are people that have been brought here at a very young age, and many of these are middle-aged people now, they dont even speak the language of their country, Trump said, adding: I will work with the Democrats on a plan.They were brought into this country many years ago, he continued. Some of them are no longer young people, and in many cases they've become successful. They have great jobs. In some cases, they have small businesses.

While Trump claimed that Republicans really are the party for IVF on the campaign trail, the overturning of Roe opened the door to attacks on the fertility treatment, which is often utilized by LGBTQ+ people to have children. In September, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have created a right to access IVF and required insurance companies to cover it. Trump has claimed he supports universal access to IVF and that, as president, he would order the government or insurance companies to cover the cost of the treatment for all Americans. Nonetheless, Woodruff told NBC News that he fears the in-coming administration could ban same-sex couples from accessing IVF or from adopting.Good point about the future availability (or lack thereof) of IVF, honestly.

The program, he said, will begin with undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes and then advance to people outside of criminals. He did not detail which crimes would be included.I think you have to do it, Trump said of his deportation effort. Its a very tough thing to do. Its  but you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally. You know, the people that have been treated very unfairly are the people that have been on line for 10 years to come into the country.We have to get the criminals out of our country, Trump said, later adding: But were starting with the criminals, and we got to do it. And then were starting with others, and were going to see how it goes.Asked by Welker, Who are the others? Trump responded, Others are other people outside of criminals.There was a large increase in the number of unauthorized immigrants crossing into the U.S. during President Joe Bidens time in office, though?[that number has fallen](https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/border-crossings-dropped-lowest-level-biden-administration-september-rcna174574)?following executive actions in recent months.Tightening restrictions around the U.S. border with Mexico was at the forefront of Trumps candidacy  much as it was during his first run in 2016. Trump and allies routinely highlighted acts of violence committed by undocumented immigrants to bolster their case. ([A 2024 study from the National Institute of Justice](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate)?found that Texas arrest records between 2012 and 2018 showed undocumented immigrants were arrested at less than half the rate of native-born Americans for violent crimes.)Trump also described scenarios in which U.S. citizens may choose to be deported along with family members in the country illegally. His comments echoed Tom Homan, his pick to serve as border czar in the upcoming administration, in saying that he will be deporting families with mixed immigration status together.\\"","title":"Trump aims to end birthright citizenship, says American citizens with family here illegally may be deported"},{"text":"I have to admit, this has been my experience the past couple of times I've been to America.

Yes, weed is extremely cheap in California and has gotten cheaper for very good quality. What that reflects is the companies that make up the industry making very little to no money.  Most companies in the cannabis space are either not or barely profitable. The legal industry needs to do this in order to remain price competitive with the black market - if you could buy $100 ounces from the black market, but the cost at a dispensary is $200, most people will choose the $100 option. So companies need to meet a price that the consumer will purchase through the legal market - maybe theyll pay a little premium ($110) but not much more than that. So now they need to price their product at $90 pre sales tax so the consumer will still purchase it. Legal companies have far more overhead, employees, etc., than black market sellers. The black market can make a healthy profit at $100, but legal companies are in the red at $90. So yes, it is a great time to be a consumer of weed in California.

The Bible is a mess. If you look far enough back into any religious body of text, youll eventually find contradictions. In the case of the Bible, it is such a broad text that it actually does this frequently. Practically everything the Bible teaches is at some point contracticted somewhere else in the book, depending on how you look at it. Its pretty subjective to say so, sure, but there is an argument to be made for that. Much of it is comprised of individual stories or pieces of text that originate from all kinds of different places and authors, and they were never written to be consistent with one another. Trying to reconcile them all is a exercise in madness. A nigh impossible task. Just ask the various theologians who have spent centuries trying to find ways to do just that. Its actually quite easy to cherry pick and bend interpretations of its words around to support pretty much anything, precisely because it is so subjective. That is also why it is so easy to mislead people with it by appealing to their existing subjective biases. It explains the people in this country who profess to love thy neighbor whom also violently hate migrants and trans people for simply existing. If you look hard enough, and push those round pegs through the square holes wherever needed, you can find biblical justification for almost anything. This has been a feature of religion for thousands of years. People have always used religious texts in this way for basically as long as we have been writing them.","title":"Trump will most likely pardon Capitol rioters on Day 1 and says Jan. 6 committee members should be jailed"},{"text":"But, he also said: President-elect Donald Trump, in an exclusive interview with Meet the Press, also said he is open to working with Democrats on a legislative way to keep Dreamers in the U.S.Am I losing my mind","title":"Trump aims to end birthright citizenship, says American citizens with family here illegally may be deported"},{"text":"They threw out ballots in heavily democratic leaning areas.
