This has happened before. In the 1980s the Democrats were on their heels and Reagan dominated politics. Democrats were tax and spend liberals who were soft on crime. Clinton resuscitated the party around the economy. He had policy changes and focused much more on job growth rather than social welfare spending.Democrats have to get tougher on immigration. This really is the number one Achilles heel. If they dont do this Republicans will have a persistent advantage for a generation. Democrats got on the wrong side of the discussion on social issues. Some of this was pushed by Republicans. But Democrats have no ability to stop the runaway train around social progressivism. People dont like cancel culture and they want to move more slowly on DEI and other top-down government approaches to legislate social equality. This is probably a more difficult issue for Democrats because theres what feels like a genetic defect among Democrats to understand the pulse of American society on these issues and to move at a pace that Americans will accept. Instead the instinctive tendency is to always move faster and then to call people racist if society doesnt just accept it.Democrats are actually quite good on the economy. However, the decades-long transition that cant be ignored is that Democrats went from the party of working class labor to the party of liberal elites. The people that benefited from higher education and the Internet age became Democrats, and everybody else got left behind. Economic inequality is the fundamental dividing line between the parties now, and education level is the key that determines your socio-economic class and party affiliation. Just saying Democrats want to be the working class party isnt going to work. Its fundamental alignment is with educated people with higher paying jobs and that wont change anytime soon.","title":"whats next for democrats?"},{"text":"Rapist has been proven in court.Pedo has strong ties with Epstein.Fascist, well, that's almost already proven.I'm not saying whether the skin of liberals is thinner or not.

But, we cannot deny that the president elect has shown the strength he has over the AMERICAN PEOPLE! This should now be clear to everyone. We cannot defend the platform of the Democratic Party nor deny any of the reasons why he won. We must acknowledge that the American people overwhelmingly want a better border at ANY COST. Abortion is not as strong an issue as we thought. Americans voted, overwhelmingly against the democratic partys platform. We have to understand Trump has not really changed in what he set out to do in his first term, and neither have Americans. What lost it for him against Biden was how he managed COVID. Well Covid is not a dire issue anymore. The Democratic Party failed to address any strong changes to match the issues of the AVERAGE American person care about and we have no better proof than the election results.

Many people believe that \\"the will of the people\\" is a force for good with quasi-divine power to deliver good governance. This just doesn't work out. Democracy is the least-bad form of governance we've ever come up with, but it's riddled with problems. For example:?\\n-Individual voters have ~0% chance of changing the election outcome, so they have no incentive to be careful with their vote. They have a stronger incentive to vote for nonsense that makes them feel good about themselves than for a hard truth. (Voter ignorance/rational irrationality)?\\n-Its hard for people to understand and coordinate about small, dispersed benefits against concentrated ones. For example, if port automation would benefit every American by $50 per year but cost a few thousand workers $100,000 a year, it's easier for the losers to coordinate for a net loss of billions in total value.?\\n-A democratic majority can use its political power to benefit itself to the detriment of smaller groups. (Tyranny of the Majority)?\\n-Its hard for voters to control politicians. It's hard for politicians to control managers of bureaucrats. It's hard for managers to control lower managers and bureaucrats. Without strong competitive forces from markets, it's increasingly easy for anyone in this chain to pursue his own benefit over that of people up the chain. Special interests or activists can also \\"capture\\" people in this chain and get them to do what they want. (Principal-agent problems and regulatory capture)?\\n?We should take these problems seriously and look for ways to limit the power of democracy to do bad things. My favorite way of doing this is called liberalism. Some ideas:?\\n-Require spacial majorities, numeric majorities, and inter-temporal majorities to sustain state action??\\n-Enshrine in Constitutional super-law the rights of minorities against a tyrannical majority??\\n-Accept minor to serious market \\"failures\\" and social inequities as the lesser evil in many cases.

States still in play"},{"text":"I'm afraid that most issues are noise, the big one that will always move the needle has been and always will be the economy. People finding it hard to afford the things they are used to having is a potential political disaster for whoever is in charge and it shouldn't be minimised. Inflation completely sank Biden's re-election chances even before it was obvious his brain had turned into soup. Harris has been left holding the bag to an extent as the bad vibes economically had already set in regardless of the fundamentals all looking great. We really do live in the age of vibes to an extent.The worst thing is, the Biden admin did an objectively great job riding out the economic malaise he had to govern through, from covid and the hangover from all that spending, the rampant inflation fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the mess that I/P has descended into with the Houthis trying to grind maritime shipping to a halt in the region. Look at how anaemic and stagnant the major European economies are for an example of how much worse it could be. He and his team should genuinely be commended, their legacy will be similar to Obama's in that is that the US economy is in a good enough position to potentially weather another Trump presidency that tries its best to run it into the ground with tariffs and general instability and uncertainty both at home and abroad.Trump's whole image is that he's the money guy and he just happened to govern in the only time of decent economic growth and stability of the post '08 age. His literal name and signature was also on the stimmy cheques, if you're an economic illiterate (aka a super-majority of people, not only Americans) he's the only guy who ever threw you a bone. Biden and Harris were in charge when you suddenly couldn't afford your private taxi for your burrito anymore.Also doesn't help that the only other issues people are moved to vote on is immigration, which is such a lightning rod for people's rage. I think that the democrats should have learned this lesson from looking at their European allies getting trounced for the past near-decade by now. Both the proles and bougie suburban types want less of it and want a big strong leader who is willing and happy to stamp the jackboot on the necks of the brown and black people if it means they don't have to see as many of them in their neighbourhoods, end of story. Appealing to people's humanity is a waste of time, they don't see these people as people for the most part.  They want the democrats to lace up and get stomping and they see the pro-immigration crowd as hopelessly naive and aloof to the issues around immigration at best, actively harming the country at their neighbourhood's expense at the behest of some other external power at worst. The Biden admin should have never lifted Trump's policies at the border as it literally did lead to a surge in crossings, even if numbers are back under control now. Such a stupid own-goal on behalf of people who were going to vote for you anyways.However, in this case I really think it's as simple as bad vibes due to inflation. The Democrats really need to get better PR and messaging when it comes to economic policy. They literally are the better economic managers but the average Joe is convinced they aren't. That is the biggest problem and most urgent issue. Sack all the useless professional-managerial class failchildren in the marketing and comms teams please. It is literally essential for global stability that these people shunned from decision making.","title":"Doomer-ing out hard"},{"text":"I don't think he's going to be well-positioned to institute a fascist totalitarian dictatorship, if that's what you mean.His is gonna be more the Orban-style slow assault on democracy, and that's kind of hard to pull off completely effectively in the US because most of the relevant consequential laws (e.g. voting regulations) are made at the state level, and most state elections are offset with federal ones. I expect the backlash will begin quite quickly and we'll probably see blue wavelets in Virginia and New Jersey next November when those states vote, with similar results in other states in subsequent cycles. By 2026 when the midterms happen the electorate will back to full \\"fuck Trump\\" mode and any chance to suppress votes, manipulate outcomes, etc. at the state level in states that aren't already blood red will be gone because the GOP won't have the power to do it. Thermostatic preference is a very powerful force.As far as violent suppression goes, I definitely think Trump will try it. I don't mean to come across as Pollyanna-ish about that.

Even Kamala at times, behind the cackle laugh and the word salads and the baffling array of accents, seemed to know she wasnt up to it.But they pressed ahead with her anyway. In the end, it didnt seem to matter to the virtue signalling Left that Kamalas position had been achieved by chance to a greater extent than anyone since Lyndon Johnson. That, a diversity hire for VP, she was able to fall into the presidency slot because Joe Biden needed to be put out to pasture with no time for a contest.They sneered at Republicans who claimed Kamala was a DEI-hire candidate, but they surely had to know they had a point. The Left see the world through the prism of identity politics. In their human hierarchy, merit and grit come below race, gender and ethnicity.?Whomever I pick \\\\[for Vice President\\\\], proclaimed Joe Biden in an embarrassing display of performative allyship, [preferably it will be someone who was of a colour and/or different gender](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/11/joe-biden-announces-kamala-harris-running-mate/). That was in 2019. Five years later, the American people have roundly rejected this progressive creed.Most voters, it turns out, still believe that people should be hired and promoted on the strength of their character, ability and experience. And there was simply too little evidence of this in Kamala: she appeared to have no intellectual resources, no managerial ability, and a simplistic view on any topic on which she has spoken.Kamala is the lawyer who can barely get to the end of a sentence, much less string together a coherent thought. She was utterly ineffectual when confronted with the crisis on the Southern Border. Her economic plans were downright bonkers, and exhibited a fundamental misunderstanding of the causes behind the recent spike in inflation.?Her approach to foreign affairs was even worse, in that she didnt appear to have one.?[Her talent for fundraising was remarkable](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/08/02/kamala-harris-raises-more-than-double-donations-trump/)?and her campaign was disciplined, but it was also schizophrenic: she was the change candidate unable to point to a single policy shed have done differently to Biden.Its no wonder Kamala was able to shore up the womens vote; against Trump, almost anyone with XX chromosomes wouldve done. But there was always a certain irony in Kamala as the feminist candidate. Theres the fact she didnt defend womens rights when it mattered C on gender inclusivity in sports, for instance. But more importantly, positive discrimination doesnt help historically marginalised groups, no matter how enthusiastically the Left may peddle it.Allow a woman to become President not because she is uniquely qualified to be leader of the free world, but because she ticks the right diversity boxes, and you send a message that without special assistance certain groups cant compete. Trash the idea of a meritocracy, and you delegitimise the achievements of all women whove made it to the top of their chosen fields. No one should face prejudice because of their immutable characteristics. No one should be elevated because of them, either.**Article Link:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/06/kamala-harriss-humiliating-loss-is-a-final-refutation-dei/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/06/kamala-harriss-humiliating-loss-is-a-final-refutation-dei/)","title":"Annabel Denham: \\"Kamala Harriss humiliating loss is a final refutation of the DEI cult\\""},{"text":"I am not at all enthused about the very real prospect of Elon Musk walking into the White House with a kitchen sink and gutting the Department of Education because he thinks it's funny.

I hear the arguments on both side and I pay attention quite well. Both to the professional politics and the misheard regurgitation from friends and coworkers.I will say, for this cycle I found myself more in dem circles. Here is what I experienced. Dems seem hard nosed on the fact that Trump is the worst person on the planet and anyone who voted for him is a moron.My perspective on this is a bit of confusion, not that I dont see how they could have came to their conclusions, but rather the disconnect of passion for our fellow countrymen.There is so much dismissal and vitriol, disputed between enormous groups of people. Most evidently, everyone is right. Everyone has the right for what they believe in. Yet, many, we as people, do not understand our rights, and seem to put too much pressure upon other people to represent what we think we believe in, as is our representative democracy.Ive felt disillusioned from our government for as long as I could think, not that it doesnt serve a purpose, but I misunderstand how dramatically different world views can affect how we treat each other, and how there really isnt much say for us in the actions of any political figure.Many people see the US as a bastion that I have not seen throughout my lifetime(23), a place of hopes and dreams, built on democracy, and a light of hope for the rest of the world. I see us as unhealthy and unable to change. Trapped and bound as a society, through fear and doubt, descent for our neighbors, and a common unwillingness to compromise or be open minded about complex topics, because frankly, we only care about ourselves as a deeply selfish nation.Ill still be here, bumbling along, being the only way I know how.

Look up the history. Electors were made and put in the Constitution for the exact reason of saying \\"you don't fucking matter and we are going to ignore everything you say.\\" Over time, the people got so mad about this, that they instituted voting. But to assure that Republicans continued to win, they started doodling lines called electoral college. These lines manipulate the numbers to continue to ensure Republicans win. If both sides got the exact same number, Republicans would win. Democrats need to get almost 20% more votes than Republicans just to break even which means they need more than that to win. No that is not fair but it's difficult to change it because it's in the Constitution 3) people are ignorant. They don't realize that when the government decides something it is not instantaneous. The president doesn't make singular decisions. The house and the Senate have a major role. It can take years and years and years to get something passed and even then, it can take more years to tickle down until the common person sees the results. However, people are stupid and think the first day of President takes control that everything that happens thereafter is them. In other words, everything bad that happens while a Democrat is in position, especially near the early term, they blame on the Democrat because they are too stupid to realize that is actually the Republican control finally trickling down to the people. Simultaneously, when a Democrat finally gets shit done, they vote in a republican because they don't realize it takes more than 24 hours and then they get the Republican all the credit for the things that Democrat did come on that's creating a wrongful illusion of who is to blame and who is to praise. Realize that the majority opinion never reversed in the other direction (blaming Republicans for Democratic things or praising democrats for Republican things because such doesn't exist) Only when men become mentally stronger, people become more politically aware, the patriarchy is destroyed and people are truly at treated as equals instead of just claiming they are, and the electoral college is abolished will we finally truly have a democracy","title":"Why do you think the Dems lost?"},{"text":"Woke culture when too far, DEM need to leave ppl alone, this is the takeaway I got from those breaking for Trump, not that they like Trump that much.

They dont have a compelling message, and Kamala wasnt a compelling enough messenger. Her race and gender are only part of the reason she lost (I would even argue a small one, relatively speaking). There is a profound disconnect between the DNC and the American left, one that has only been bridged at the national level when there was a genius-orator at the helm or an inescapable national crisis needing to be fixed. Liberals and progressives were simply not galvanized outside the honeymoon period when Kamala became the nominee, and that had everything to do with Democrats inability to create an identity for themselves and broadcast it to would-be voters.There is simply a fear to go beyond the sterile rhetoric of the Obama years  like trying to squeeze into old clothes that no longer fit. Its not a coincidence that two of the fastest-rising politicians on the left were non-urban populists (Walz and Bernie) who were clamped and silenced, respectively. Ditto AOC, who realized she had to embrace the establishment if she wanted a long term career in politics. Its not a coincidence that Harris pivoted to the center in the final weeks of her campaign.

One is actively malicious, racist, led by a criminal and has religious crazies all over it. But the other is devoting itself fully to identity politics, and prioritizes these issues over much more global problems.I never discriminated against anyone based on skin color or sexual orientation, I'm all for trans rights, I'm fully pro-abortion. But when those issues are all your campaign ever talks about, while sidelining economy and illegal immigration which polls have proven time and time again to be the issues that concern the majority,?*how do you expect to win?*I know what Trump says on those topics is utter bullshit, but what matters to the uninformed is that he says?*something*?while they see Harris campaigning 90% on minority issues.

The Democrats are constantly tied and brought down by their extreme left wing. Yes, Harris isnt socialist but she isnt explicitly condemning them either. We need moments where Democrats openly disavow themselves from DSA, the squad, defund the police etc. Not only that, but do it forcefully and convincingly.2. Drop the fucking DEI/CRT bullshit. Go back to the early 2000s, where the message was more dont concern yourself with what other people do and at least ostensibly it was about equality of opportunity, not outcome. Race and identity based politics is divisive in the best of times, theres a reason why AA failed in deep blue CA. In fact, its probably the single least popular policy that the Dems support. Stuff like Biden openly stating he wants to pick a black woman is anathema to the electorate, the majority of whom believe race/gender should be irrelevant.3. Move right on illegal immigration while expanding legal options. While not my cup of tea, illegal immigration is extremely unpopular.4. Stop with the progressive messaging on greedflation, evil billionaires. People outside of social media by and large admire business leaders, and starting a successful business is a core part of the American Dream. When people like Warren lick their lips at raising taxes on the rich, call it the fuck out in national camera.5. Clamp down on local governments that give Dems a terrible branding nationwide. National Dems might not be the one at fault for exclusionary zoning and high rents, but you can bet your ass theyll be blamed.6. No more career politicians whose opinions change with the wind. People hate fakeness more than anything. Harris did an okay job at ignoring the left, but people just see it as tacit acceptance. No, thats not enough; you need to aggressively refute and marginalize it if you want to win a general election. Democrats who win competitive districts or Republican favored ones are the ones most willing to buck the party and at least outwardly distance themselves from the national brand; you need to do this for the presidency as well because the Democrat brand is toxic.Try a popular governor in a swing or Republican state, not a progressive legislator from one of the most heavily Democrat states in the country.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"She probably needs to collect her thoughts.

Now, y'all might be 'meh' on Biden, but out in the real world, Biden is well liked. I love Kamala, but she did poorly in 2020. The hatred (racism, sexism, etc.) has gotten WORSE between 2020 and 2024.\\n3. Some people were just NOT going to vote for a woman. Y'all was very naive in thinking it was just Hillary. Nope. It wasn't just \\"that woman\\", it's ANY woman and this crosses all races. A lot of people do NOT want a woman 'bossing' them, much less a woman that they think is of an inferior race for the top job in the country. Hell, there are some women that feel like being President is a \\"man's job\\", know how I know? It came out of their mouths in person AND on the news when Hillary ran.\\n4. Trump is a racist. If you want to beat a racist in a contest like this you need a straight white man, **PERIOD.** I can't understand how people could see that half the country was enthralled with this racist sexist monster, see the racism getting worse and thought, \\"Oh I know! I Black/S. Asian woman can beat him!\\" Yeah, NOPE.\\n5. Yeah...I'd HATE to be George Clooney rn. I would say that he won't be bankable anymore, but I'll know that that is a lie. ??\\n6.

We've lost young men by not finding a way to stop this stupid gender war that exists because so many incels think women, rather than a decaying economic system that has no place for thembut that also isn't great for young women, who also tend to hate their dead-end corporate jobsare the cause of their problems.We need to take the centerat least publicly; we can actually be pretty far left and no one will mindon cultural issues while defending the progress we have made, especially on gay rightswe can be centrist here and still hold a historically left-wing position (LGBT equality) by defining the center where we stand; basically, by holding the same positions but no longer screaming at young white men as much. We need to go far left on economics, so people see progress as possible.It's possible that we've failed on Israel/Palestine, but (a) the Democratic Party's position and the Republican one are nearly the same, and (b) quite a large number of Americans don't give a fuck about either side, to be brutally frank. The issue there is not about a \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" position so much as that it's an intractable clusterfuck where people who stand to profit from war, on both sides, are winning while innocent people who want to live in peacealso on both sidesare losing.Democratic arrogance is also a problemwe are so used to thinking of the other side as so horrible that no one could possibly vote for them, and this leads to complacency, which is great for \\"the donor class\\" (rich people) because they get a controlled-opposition fake left. Well, it turns out that people *can* possibly vote for the other side, and they do. Often. The worst president in recent history, by far, just won himself another term.","title":"Why do you think the Dems lost?"},{"text":"They put up a weak contender against Trump.

You folks recovered industries from COVID and have managed to handle inflation faster and better than almost every other major economy. Wages are high, unemployment is low, businesses are thriving, stock market is doing great etc.. The statistics don't lie, and to claim the US economy is \\"bad\\" is to misunderstand macroeconomics.But, as you very well point out, there's a lot of working and middle class Americans who aren't seeing this wealth. Their rents, mortgages, grocery and gas prices have gone up, and they're finding it tougher to manage their finances day to day. I think this is something Democrats have to understand in their messaging: telling people that they're wrong about the economy when their wallets are bleeding come across as arrogant and disdainful.And the truth of the matter is, any Dem candidate would have to deal with this.

People are not feeling good about their current situations financially and just want to feel like they're changing something. It's why generally you always see the party switch every 4-8 years; nothing will ever be perfect for everyone so change feels helpful. In order to overcome that desire for change, the Democrats really needed to get people excited to vote. It's much easier to be excited FOR someone than it is to be excited enough to vote AGAINST someone. Kamala just wasn't exciting for most people. Hillary wasn't either (plus you have to fight against the people who don't want a woman). People weren't even excited about Biden and he barely squeaked by. Trump may be a convicted felon and proud womanizer, but people who want a reason to vote for him find him charismatic and he's telling them what they want to hear. Lies or not, he convinced people that he was the solution and enough people bought in. Not enough people bought into what kamala was selling. Democrats could easily win in 4 years if things aren't wildly better in the US but they need to actually field a good candidate. For example, Obama had a ton of question marks (lack of political experience, first black president which many people were unfortunately scared of, etc.) But he was so overwhelmingly charismatic that people went out to vote. Since then the Dems have fielded Hillary, Biden, and Kamala and I don't think the majority of Dems were particularly excited about any of them.","title":"Why do you think the Dems lost?"},{"text":"Patterns and trends.

One who is literally a convicted felon, was called a fascist by his own former generals, and who led an insurrection against the Capitol. So why did she lose? Perhaps because US voters are actually a lot worse than people assume, have very disturbing views, and are perfectly happy with a candidate with all of those flaws if they are funny.

It was a hail Mary and all of our polling/data hinted at a tight race but Kamala outperforming Joe. It was all terribly wrong.The only silver lining is that stronger national democrats are left untouched by this election cycle for a shot in 2028.

It's quite similar to Obama.I think Democrats also need to do some soul searching on how they approach gender/racial/generational politics. People increasingly make electoral decisions based on social factors. Targeting women voters is inevitably going to create the perception that the party is not for men. The party also needs to resolve the tension in the coalition which was still relying on a small, but important segment of social conservatives.Also the fact that people hate both parties so strongly right now should be a red flag. They will turn on Republicans just as fast, but that doesn't mean they actually like Democrats. That's a problem.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"There won't be any riots you are delusional.

We have to pitch the border wall and deportation as the 7 year old solution to immigration crisis. A good chunk of immigrants come because they're escaping cartel violence homelands, these cartels are fueled by drug money. Now directly fighting them doesn't work as it just creates a hydra effect, but out competing them could starve them out. The laws of supply and clearly show that people cocaine and ultimately are going to get it from somewhere. Wouldn't it be better if that capital instead of going to murderous criminals, went to federal government to be then used in programs like rehab centers? The cartel's have a variety of overheads that the federal government wouldn't have to worry about if we for example told the DEA to start growing coca plants(though I am horribly ignorant about if we have suitable places to grow stateside) and therefore we could be crush them without firing a single bullet.

Democracy lives, propaganda dies tonight."},{"text":"I may write a whole post on this later. But the good news for Democrats is that this election was *always* going to be an uphill battle, and while Kamala Harris actually proved to have surprisingly good political instincts, she personally is a pretty weak candidate. So you can plausibly expect that a better candidate in a more favorable climate would be able to win. Biden's tenure has been awful, and him running for so long, I think, meant a lot of voters came to terms with voting for Trump back in early-mid 2024 before Harris took over [I mean, look at the search results for \\"did Joe Biden drop out\\"...]. The barrier was gone after that. \\nThe bad [well, if you're a D operative/partisan] news is that it's clear that the GOP's new economically populist, socially conservative agenda is in fact able to win large numbers of Latino and Black voters, as well as young voters. Consider this a categorical rejection of Bidenism at the polls. In addition, Harris' strategy to try to gain more conservative/moderate leaning suburbanites largely fizzled. I think we can place the blame here on first, the fact that Harris never really committed to any conservative policies, and second, that Biden's tenure obviated a lot of good-faith that suburban white voters had in Biden to \\"restore normalcy\\". \\nBasically there's two paths forward, but imo really only one path. The first is to abandon social progressivism and max out economic populism--the Bernie Sanders path, but with more Black/Latino appeal. The problem is, this is what the GOP is *already* doing, and they're better at it. Biden and Harris have both tried this path, Biden squeaked over the edge and Harris flopped hard. I see no reason why a future left-populist candidate would see any more success. \\nThe second is to see the path forward in the white suburbs [and multiracial suburbs]. These voters are *reliable*, they're very high quality in terms of showing up to the polls, but they aren't entirely comfortable with the current Democratic agenda. So mold the agenda to fit them, along with college educated voters that increasingly make up the base of the party. I'd say that the future Democratic Party should place at its three corners social liberals/left libertarians, fiscal conservatism, and liberal internationalism. A bit like a liberal version of the old GOP. Basically:1. the \\"I want gay married couples to own AR-15s on their private weed farm\\" vote2. the \\"my god I hate inflation and tariffs\\" vote3. the \\"I don't trust the GOP internationally\\" vote\\nCorresponding with these three, Dems should realign their messaging. Slam Trump's tariffs [get people to put Trump \\"I did this\\" stickers on tarriffed goods]. Pummel him on inflation and deficits. Hit him for restrictions on social issues, while saying you just want people to be free to do what they want (in the privacy of their own homes--try not to associate too much with big, open public displays, it's offputting to normie voters).  Maintain a *strong* line internationally that doesn't waffle about, try to out-muscleman Trump and support defense spending *and* diplomacy--go full Scoop Jackson.

And this just proves that most of America is exactly what we are fighting against and there is a level of apathy in the non-voting population that does not care one bit.

Tank its user base and let those corporations find some place else to go. Elmo does not need more help than he can get.  Hoard money.  Just save as much money as you can. Buy local, buy used when applicable, learn to do things yourself as much as possible.Take care of your health.  Eat right and exercise.We don't know how much fuckery the right is going to do to elections going forward, but if you can move from a red state to a swing state, maybe try for that, but if you truly feel vulnerable and can manage it, move to a blue state.  The issue with moving from a red to a blue state is it further stratifies the divide between how many red states there are versus blue states which then sends more power to the Senate towards the republicans. There are far more red states than blue states.Lastly, just love your loved ones. Hold them and protect them.  Cherish all the good times you will have going forward, and yes, even amongst the coming misery, there will be good times as well. Value those moments. This malaise will last for a bit, but eventually you will recenter yourself.

Conservatives *also* purity test and very regularly throw their own politicians to the wolves - to a far, far, greater extent than dems do. But dems have a *fragile* coalition, *full of sub-factions that hate each other*, and will eat each other alive (case in point: gaza / palestine) if and as we do that.This is also true of republicans, to be clear. But unlike dems republicans are the f---ing borg.And while modern republicans are - so far, *maybe not under trump 2.0* \\\\- completely and utterly incapable of actually *governing* and/or actually *building* anything together, they are 100% capable of unifying into a faceless mass that can and will win elections.I don't even think we need to overstate the gender divide (and apparent south-korean-ification of US politics)Dems problem in general is that our elected politicians, political leaders, and media institutions that back them, are, fundamentally, just *catastrophically terrible* at modern politics. ie. amassing, maintaining, and wielding popular / democratically backed power.At this point we honestly *might* be well off taking a page from republicans. Insofar as throwing out *most* of our establishment (and utterly ineffective and out of touch) politicians, political leaders, and campaign strategists, and *in general* encouraging new blood *and absolutely everyone* who is even moderately qualified for political office to strongly consider doing so. From the *bottom* up.Maybe that's a step way too far, but /rant.Alternatively we maybe really should strongly consider trying to reform US elections (again, *locally* /  from the bottom up), and make real *attempts* to challenge and throw out the US 2-party system, and in particular the hyper-fixation on *national* level politics.Bear in mind that we are in this situation *in the first place* because Trump *is* the only real (and credible) challenger to US establishment dem leadership.Which is a massive f---ing problem given that US electoral politics tends to very reliably yo-yo between / against establishment / incumbent party leadership, and Trump is a populist wanna-be authoritarian - maybe - who has taken over one of the US's only two major parties.And ergo if you *do* have major beef with national-level dem leadership, you may very well end up voting *for that* for a change / rebellion against the current status quo. As we have very self evidently seen in this election. And dems - or more accurately center-left to far-left US media - tend to very regularly have their heads stuck up their own asses on a few issues, which is more or less at least *part* of how we've ended up in this particular situation / completely fucked election *(and trajectory over the past 10 years)* in the first place.In general dems need to take a *really* hard look in the mirror, given that 1) HRC lost to trump in 2016, 2) Biden ran, and literally only won in 2020 due to a) trump, b) *generally* very strongly positive memories of biden as Obama's VP, and a desire to return to that point and style of leadership. Since then we have somehow completely 3) stopped talking about healthcare reform / public option, despite the ACA since becoming a massive (albeit very stopgap) public success, *and* how critical bloated healthcare (and in addition to that housing costs) are to US COL problems, wage gaps, *and* something that adds a massive and very (globally) inefficient burden to US businesses, and helps make US labor *even less* cost effective within certain industries.Oh, and instead of *that* we had somehow apparently, in our infinite wisdom, turned the 2024 election entirely *into purely reactive issues against trump / republicans*, including abortion, 24/7 year-round coverage of the trump criminal proceedings and investigations, and so on and so forth. Oh, and initial stances on immigration + policing, that were 1) anti-trump, 2) blew up in our faces given a) the worldwide (and particularly in eg. europe) pivot away from support for liberal open-borders immigration. And b) the fact that crime, in general, *is* bad, and above all tends to actually affect ethnic minorities, and other groups of people that dems / progressives are *supposedly* fighting for.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"As a non american looking in from the outside, i would think Kamala being appointed into the position rather than winning the primary through voting, would have had a big impact on why she did so much worse?

Where his friends and contemporaries Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, while authors of substantial works, were best remembered for holding high office, Huntington was essentially an academic, a Harvard professor who worked incidentally as a consultant for the State Department, the National Security Council and the CIA under the Johnson and Carter administrations.A cold war liberal with a conservative cast of mind, he tossed highly personal ideas around like confetti. Some were wild and, for many, pernicious; others have come to be seen as wise and prescient. The Nuremberg war crimes trials prosecutor Telford Taylor summed him up as a man whose \\"store of iconoclasm\\" was \\"virtually inexhaustible\\".Huntington aroused heavy criticism for each of his major books. The first, The Soldier and the State (1957), saw him compared to the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. It was seen, perhaps unfairly, as a glorification of the military profession. It certainly praised the West Point military academy as Sparta surrounded by the American Babylon. A second, Political Order in Changing Societies (1968), became the subject of a furious academic debate, with Huntington denounced for describing apartheid South Africa as a \\"satisfied\\" state.His most famous book, The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order (1996), started life as an article in the establishment journal, Foreign Affairs. In it he argued that the conflicts of the future would not be between ideologies but between \\"civilisations\\" defined by culture. He enumerated seven or eight of these, in the manner of an Arnold Toynbee: the west, Islam, orthodox Christianity, Latin America, the \\"Sinic\\" (Chinese) civilisation, the Hindu world, Japan, and perhaps Africa. He predicted that the most likely conflicts would be between the west and Islam or China. Departing from his (critical) support for the US in the Vietnam war, he said: \\"Western intervention in the affairs of other civilisations is probably the single most dangerous source of instability and potential global conflict in a multi-civilisational world.\\"The book set off a thunderous debate in American academic and intellectual circles between Huntington's supporters and those of his former pupil, Francis Fukuyama. Where Huntington predicted divisions in which the west would be only one of several competing civilisations, Fukuyama (who has changed his mind since) saw the collapse of communism as marking the triumph of western and especially American ideas, \\"the end of history\\".Huntington's last book was perhaps the most controversial and certainly the least well received. In Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity (2004), he predicted dire consequences from Hispanic immigration. The US, he argued, is defined '\\"in large part by its Anglo-Protestant culture and its religiosity\\". Spanish-speaking immigrants would transform America into \\"a country of two languages, two cultures, and two peoples\\".Most reviewers and many readers shared the opinion of the New York Times reviewer Michiko Kakutani that it was \\"a crotchety, overstuffed and highly polemical book\\", and \\"pockmarked with perplexing contradictions and curiously blindered \\\\[blinkered\\\\] observations\\".Huntington was born into a white, Anglo-Saxon protestant, in his case Episcopalian, middle-class family in Queen's, New York City. He was precocious. He went to Yale University aged 16 and graduated in two and a half years (instead of the usual four) before going into the army. After the second world war, he earned a master's degree at the University of Chicago and a doctorate from Harvard, returning there as a tenured professor in 1962 and remaining for 45 years.He was an influential teacher, though hardly because of his presentation. He delivered his lectures monotonously, hunched up, blinking and squinting. But he lacked neither moral nor physical courage. He joined in academic controversy with spirit and determination. And once, when he and another Harvard professor were attacked by muggers, he downed his opponent and went to the rescue of his colleague.Huntington was in several respects typical of the American academics who used mathematical or, as their critics said, pseudo-mathematical political science to support their personal theories and the liberal nationalism known as \\"cold war liberalism\\". He claimed to be a disciple of the great protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, but showed little evidence of sharing Niebuhr's awareness of the tragic moral dilemmas of American society. He was a natural target for the 1960s left.When he was put up for membership of the National Academy of Sciences in 1968, a Yale mathematician, Serge Lang, led a bitter onslaught on his credentials. Lang objected to the academy \\"certifying as science\\" what were \\"merely political opinions\\". He sharply criticised Huntington's suggestion that apartheid South Africa was a more stable state than France, on the basis of \\"equations\\" based on the number of telephones and other randomly chosen numerical indications. He concluded that Huntington had given \\"primary evidence of professional incompetence and defective scholarship\\".No wonder the heavyweights of political science leaped angrily to his defence. He was, after all, by the 1980s the most cited political scientist in America on international relations, and several universities made his works required reading. But would be a mistake to dismiss him as no more than an establishment mouthpiece. Even his most problematic ideas were usually balanced with a willingness to see other sides of a question.","title":"Y'know...

The disappointing thing about Kamala is Im a black woman, and I really wish she gave me a reason to want to vote for her. However, she lost my vote because she literally lacked to gain my interest or attention at all in her 90 day span. I also dont know how I feel about trusting someone who told me 90 days before an election and never held a primary seat that this wasnt the plan all along in her four years while shes been in office. That always didnt sit right with me and she never discussed that either . If you want to be president, tell me that youve been dreaming about it since you started university, and that the moment that Biden told you was an opportunity how much it excited you and tell me the organic story of how you grew into a candidate that I would want to vote for. I feel like she tried utilizing the Fame of others to get that type of traction in such a short time but honestly, it just felt more just inauthentic because I know some of these celebrities that she had at her campaign personally and I know that theyre voting red. So it was all confusing!We are absolutely correct by saying she didnt speak very much because she didnt speak authentically. She went to, major media sources to gain popularity , of which helped her filter, her exposure heavily, which was the only exposure she was getting. She never really seemed to go off the script and organically answer a question, and when she did, it was kind of like what are you talking about??and utilized the strategy team to help her build her case rather than doing the work through putting years of experience towards her position. She was a puppet and she always will be.I wish we had better options, sadly, but thats been my case of the past elections and every time end up turning Republican, even though I agree with most Democratic views, but economically Republican will always win in any situation where the other party lacks to address the financial responsibility that contributes to some of the bills that theyre proposing. Republicans usually have a secondary plan in place and limitations in others, democratics also tend to just offer anything and everything without a plan to back it up to gain success or voters. Thats exactly what Kam did tonight, and thats exactly why she isnt feeling attachment to her crowd tonight at Howard University. She got them all riled up and excited that she was one of them too!! but her lack of participation once things went south now is just a harsh reminder that she doesnt necessarily care about them, relate to them and and they are not the same.I wish with all my love in my heart.. that we all understand Trump winning is a good thing for us right now and the extreme fears we read about in the media were literally created by the media and we have hundreds of other people in office that will block any scary / unethical things from happening.I wish democratics would stop getting so distracted with the false promises in details of paid media centric vs organic voting strategies.","title":"Kamala Harris wont speak tonight"},{"text":"Ecstatic","title":"Can Kamala Harris still win the election?

Manufacturing lays everyone off and so does the retail company.Then people will buy something else, shifting demand to new companies and industries. This happens all the time.The classic example is pop. Let's say Coke doubles their prices for whatever reason. That lowers demand for Coke which leaves a market gap for competition which will all gladly take that business and expand production. Same consumption, same jobs, just moving around.If all pop companies doubled their prices, that leaves an even bigger market gap to be filled by a non-exploitative product or alternative products, like water.

I am not crying about it though. Like so many others, I would have voted for Bernie Sanders pet rock over Donald Trump.

There was not much time for her to develop her own strong policy stance since she stepped in and ran a last minute campaign. I cannot imagine how hard that must have been for her to accomplish all at once. Also, I do sense that she is a good person with a lot of empathy and love for other people, shes very sharp, and wants all people to succeed and prosper-I feel the same about Waltz. I know that she planned to keep our civic safety nets in place and she supported a womans right to life. The Grocery and Pharmaceutical industries hold major political influence and they are actively price gouging consumers. Kamala wanted to stop that from happening.

I mean, it would go as you'd expect from a huge group of left-leaning people all gathered together. Nobody seemed delusional or anything and the numbers were too hard to know for sure because 2016 and 2020 were so wonky... but the numbers just played out basically as polled with the margin of error pushing up Trump's side.And now most people seem to be pretty dissatisfied with Trump winning (obviously, Republicans would be dooming about \\"4 more years of Biden/Harris policies\\" too...). But beyond that, lots of people are super critical of the Democrats totally fumbling what they think should have been a sure win if they had just ran any white guy from not-NY/California with clear policies, especially about the economy. But the Dems always have to be trying ridiculous shenanigans like coronating Hillary, having the SC guy back Biden and the establishment rally around him, then this bs with dropping the nomination onto Harris, the most unpopular of the 2020 candidates.I think people seem as mad at the Democratic party for losing as they do at the Republican party for winning.Of course, you also have Republicans coming by for a victory lap as most people left the threads (no need to watch the end).I'm not really even defending it, but people acting like the people are having any kind of meltdown are ridiculous. It's important to remember that absolutely nobody picked Harris and even people on the left voting for her are aware of that.

You have space to welcome a few trans people in your home for a short period so they can find work and either move out together in their own place so you can have room to bring more people in and get them to safety.

So, when the vehicle lost control, he fell out, with the vehicle rolling over his leg. The Ford pickup rolled on and crashed into a house and injured a woman who was sleeping at the time.The incident happened in Orlando at the Dancers Royale Club. The man, later identified as William Edwards, 28, had had enough of the party and decided it was time to go home. A security guard, seeing the man stagger to his car, warned him he had had too much to drink. Well, as expected, Williams just brushed him off and sat at his Ford pickups wheel. The man didnt care to close the door, who knows, he might have wanted a little breather. So, he started driving and before long, he lost control.Before he knew it, the vehicle started wobbling, which made him fall out. The car then came rolling toward his direction and for lack of powerful reflexes, William let the car run over his leg. He couldnt do much at this point and when the pickup crashed into a home, he could only think of fleeing to his home on foot.The 28-year-old followed his intrusive thoughts and immediately fled, which added to his penalties. Instead, he should have reported his mess and probably had a few things to deal with.
