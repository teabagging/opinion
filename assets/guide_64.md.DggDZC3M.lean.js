For instance, a majority of Americans actually do support abortion being legal in at least some capacity. Wanting a full, no exceptions ban on abortion is actually the rare position because in isolation most Americans comprehend that medical issues happen, rape happens, and they (correctly) feel that forcing a child to give birth is gross even if they don't question their assumptions and biases about the other people they perceive as sluts who don't \\"deserve\\" abortions. But, once you make it a culture war issue? Suddenly women who lived through a pre-Roe America are voting against the interests of their children and grandchildren because abortion is on the naughty, \\"opposite\\" side of their cultural identity and they have to *defend that cultural identity* from uh... The other Americans who also live here and don't really impact their daily life in any way other than making them notice differences.Another great example is healthcare for transgender children and adults has existed for a very long time. Growing up literally no one had \\"the trans agenda\\" on their mind to protect me from even though my entire life transition care has existed. No one felt they needed to have an opinion on it even if their opinion of trans people was negative. Now my aunt-in-law is banned from my house because she won't stop talking about children's genitals because the GOP made it a culture war issue.

I've taken other classes from that organization (professional training in specialized topics for environmental professionals) and that was the only course with such an apology.They are utterly ubiquitous and we have only addressed a tiny fraction of them.  There are over 13,000 listed PFAS compounds and the EPA only has federal water quality standards for five of them (six, if you count the unitless hazard index list).To give folks a sense of how absurdly terrible they are, the EPA has set limits of between 4-10 parts per *trillion* for MCLs (maximum contaminant level).  The MCL goals are zero.  There is no known safe level of PFAS.  Most contaminants have MCLs in the part per billion to part per million range.  For instance, the MCL for arsenic is 10 parts per billion.  That is a thousand times higher than the MCL for HFPO-DA (the PFAS initially used as a replacement for PFOA in Teflon manufacturing).","title":"Trump allies begin attack on EPA and rules protecting US drinking water"},{"text":"Gotta hand it to Musk, when Twitree was bleeding visitors, advertisers, and revenue it seemed like he made a dumb investment.

Basically, the right and Donald Trump have spent years attempting to investigate and tie Joe Biden to illegal activity allegedly committed by Hunter Biden.  They continue to attack Hunter Biden as a means to harm the reputation of Joe Biden.  They spent years investigating and Donald Trump was even impeached over his efforts to influence Ukraine to act for his political benefit in the matter.  To be clear... none of these investigations were done in the spirit of justice.  They were all done for political purposes and the accusations date back to an event that (IIRC) happened about a decade ago.After years of investigating, the only thing they can pin on Hunter is apparently some tax evasion and the illegal purchase of a firearm.  After years of the right crying wolf, this is what they got.  No link to Joe.  So, I just don't see how and why I should be upset that this pardon happened.  It makes sense that it goes back 10 years since that is the basis of many of the accusations (which have been investigated and found lacking) against Hunter.  I will admit that I don't think this pardon should have happened.  I'm neither happy nor upset about it.  If someone can show me some real evidence that Hunter did something that is being hidden by this pardon then maybe I'll change my mind on that, but speculating about it is silly.","title":"Bidens pardon of his son is not only him at his Trumpiest but also emboldens Trumps next term"},{"text":"Yeah that was one of the themes in Handmaids Tale - all the so-called Christian men who had high positions would go to a Speakeasy and abuse and screw the (enslaved) girls, then go back to their pulpits on Sunday.

I'm an environmental chemist who works with PFAS and unfortunately right now only industrial wastewater treatment methods have shown any lasting efficacy (and even those require frequent upkeep and maintenance).  Not all PFAS are created equal.  PFAS are a group of more than 10,000 individual chemicals with wildly variable properties.  We can only detect *maybe* a few hundred of those in labs right now, and standard EPA testing methods max out at 42 (EPA Method 1633, which is the new standard for multi-media PFAS testing).  So any evaluation we do of water treatment methods is only looking at a fraction of PFAS.We can use proxy analytical methods to estimate total PFAS (e.g., total oxidizable fluorine assays) but those don't detect individual compounds and typically have lower resolution.  When we are dealing with compounds that have MCLs in the part per trillion range, something with a ppb or ppm detection limit is only so useful.","title":"Trump allies begin attack on EPA and rules protecting US drinking water"},{"text":"I see a lot of memes saying to prevent rape, dont rape people.

As a father, I would rather teach my daughter (and my sons) to fight anyone who tries to restrict their right to autonomy. I would teach any sons of mine that the right response to my daughter wearing \\"suggestive\\" clothing is a simple, \\"You look great/awesome/amazing.\\" They don't need to make catcalls, they don't need to proposition. If my daughter has worn a sexy outfit, and one of her partner prospects is a hetero man, then men who have been taught how to act around women will recognize the opportunity, but allow her to make the first move. What we see \\"victim blaming\\" is much of the world telling women \\"you don't have a right to male free spaces and/or autonomy. Blaming women for not acting correctly doesn't work. Teach your sons and daughters some real hard truths. Things that can keep anyone safe, regardless of sex: There is safety in numbers. You've a large chance of avoiding a problem if you have people with you. Stranger danger isn't real. Ask strangers for help. Especially when you're lost, or in a situation you don't want to be in. You're more likely to be victimized by someone who knows you. Fencing, boxing, dance, judo, Tai chi, or anything else that teaches you to fall, roll, or take a hit will make you more naturally graceful and less likely to injure yourself in a fall or to find yourself unable to get back up. There isn't an easy formula to guarantee success or failure, and fate is a trickster. I think each of us should think about what is the biggest personal danger to ourselves, and we should aim to mitigate it. But we all need to understand that there exists no panacea, and that fear of \\"not taking a chance\\" is very often the source of a life wasted.","title":"CMV: Of course you should educate your sons (all children in fact), but you should also protect your daughters (all children in fact) just in case of the sons being too far gone from any education on how to respect women"},{"text":"Fair but people act like a 25% tariff is all going towards the government.

Free people will have to struggle with this kind of question.There are lots of other questions that fall into this category like who is an individual deserving of protection. Many early liberal states used to say white men, now we say men and women of any ethnic background. We don't grant full rights to animals. We struggle with how to classify humans in utero. We then struggle with how to classify children. How much autonomy should children have from their parents? What do parents owe their children? We also struggle with what to do when asserting these rights and dealing with infractions. How much privacy should people have from law enforcement? How severe should punishments be for those who break the liberal peace? How accurate do our courts need to be?These issues have no definitive answers within the scope of liberalism. They are the edges and building blocks of a liberal society. Free people will always have to argue about these subjects with culture-specific notions of cost, benefit, truth, beauty, and goodness. Different philosophical outlooks will have different answers. We must be comfortable with the discomfort here and pragmatically do the best we can.

It is always possible to marginally lengthen life somehow, but we have finite resources. We cannot possibly allocate all our resources to prolong lives. This means that we have to create a standard of how much we are willing to spend to keep someone alive. This puts a value on human life and is thus considered amoral by many, but it is inevitable from an economic perspective. I am not aware of a single country where cost-effectiveness measures are not taken into account when allocating healthcare resources.This leaves us with the position that we cannot provide limitless care to someone, which might hinder their ability to \\"fight to the end.\\" This cannot be affected in any way by this law or any other law around assisted suicide. Now lets look at the effects of voluntary assisted suicide in this setting. For this topic, only the cases where not enough resources can be allocated are relevant, so we have basically two possible situations:1. Not enough care can be allocated to a person, and they think they would have better utility if they died under those circumstances.\\n2. Not enough care can be allocated to a person, and they think they would not have better utility if they died under those circumstances.The second case is the trivial one where the person would decide against assisted suicide anyway. The first case is where it gets a bit more tricky. Considering that we cannot change the resource allocation, the person will be better off with assisted suicide. Banning it for them would also be a very strange moral position, since it essentially says: \\"You are suffering because we do not want to help you, but you are not allowed to improve your utility by killing yourself, because this would make us feel guilty?\\"I do think that it is better to look at this law in isolation. More choice allows them to choose the better available option. If we think it's cruel to let someone kill themselves under our healthcare constraints, it is at least as cruel to let them die under natural circumstances under the same constraints. In this case, we should decide on those constraints independently from the assisted suicide question.","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"Well said.","title":"You possess neither honor nor integrity, and your children know it."},{"text":"Whaterr..do they think hell do?

I am fine with other people buying expensive insurance that will afford them the right to die fighting, but I do not want to help them pay for it.\\nThis isn't an anti-resistibution thing. I would rather give a poor person $50 a month as a UBI with the option to buy expensive end of life insurance than just force them into a system that incentivizes expensive, low-benefit end of life treatments. I think almost everyone would be better off with the $50 a month, especially the poor. Likewise if I am forced into a health system where everyone is offered extremely expensive end of life care, as someone who does not want this kind of care, I am forced to subsidize well-off people exercising this right.","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"Just like the peaceful people in Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland etc.","title":"Joe Biden just pardoned his son, Hunter.

Biden claimed out of prinicple he wouldn't ultilize the pardon power like this - then once there was no political consequence possible, he went back on it.But in context, Trump has constantly threatened the Biden family, so this grants a bit more leeway IMO. This is a legal use of the pardon power.  We may not like the pardon power and how broad reaching it is but the founders did it this way on purpose. They believed the remedy would be political.  The constitution leaves a window of time where political consequences don't exist and incentivizes pardons like this - but the founders believed that \\"only men of this highest character\\" would obtain the office of the President.  So they thought the pardon power wouldn't be abused. Hell, with the recent immunity ruling, Trump could literally sell pardons on his way out of office and it can not be investigated. The pardon power is a core function of the President which makes him immunue from criminal charges. But I will never make the mistake of openly condemning this pardon in front of a Trump supporter.  Even if you disagree with this pardon, don't disavow it in front of Conservatives. Conservatives want Democrats to operate with standards and be open to criticism for failing them but then operate with impunity on their side in regards to those standards and won't take any criticism at all.It makes for an asymmetrical environment where Democrats are constantly apologizing and making concessions to Conservatives while they refuse to do the same - and it only benefits them.Listen to criticisms coming from the otherside now.  They are critical of Joe Biden lying, they are calling this pardon corrupt, saying it proves the Bidens are corrupt. If any Trump Supporter wants a concession on this pardon, they first have to acknowledge that Trump lies more than Biden and they don't care.  They have to acknowledge that Jared Kushner being appointed as a senior advisor in 2020 was against the anti-nepotism statue (which means Trump broke the law doing this, unlike Joe's pardon here which is legal), and that Trump engaged in pardons that were worse than this pardon in full context (again, I don't claim these were not legal, they were legal pardons).But of course, this is not how it works.  As a Democrat, you are expected to condemn everything and never get a conession in return. Trump is already suggesting this opens the door to him pardoning J6'ers.  Problem is, Trump would do it anyway. This pardon doesn't make a difference at all to what Trump would do.  You think any TS would have been against any Trump pardon but now will be okay with it because of Biden's pardon?  Of course not.I could condemn this pardon now, they will weaponize that concession and then ignore what Trump has and will continue to do - even if it is clearly against the law, is just as bad, is worse, etc. So what is the point and why give them that good faith concession when it will never be reciprocated and worse, used against Democrats?","title":"Geraldo Rivera Slaps Trump Supporters With A Reality Check After Bidens Pardon: Its not like he appointed him Ambassador to France"},{"text":"\\"There are times to overturn precedent.

Some other things Biden could do to be preemptive but could backfire is to call up like 50,000 national guard members to help on both Mexican and Canada boundaries to help homeland security on the mission to slow illegals.Those 50,000 would be tasked so they technically can't really be moved with out replacements if Biden sets up the original order to be for like a set period like 6 years with each unit doing rotations of  7.months to ensure overlap and to not over deploy all.","title":"Democratic senators urge Biden to try to limit Trump's ability to use the U.S. military domestically"},{"text":"There is no emboldening Trumps next term.

Blood is thicker than water. He was willing to tarnish his honor and reputation to save his child (who he believed was being shafted).He added, Too bad, but its not like he appointed him Ambassador to France.Trump announced on Saturday his intention to nominate real estate tycoon Charles Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Jared Kushner, the president-elects son-in-law. Trump pardoned the elder Kushner in December 2020. He spent over a year in prison in the 2000s after pleading guilty on charges of tax evasion, making illegal campaign finance contributions and witness tampering.[Trump also pardoned a bunch of his associates](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-pardons-roger-stone-paul-manafort-other_n_5fe2c9bbc5b6acb534555278) before exiting the White House, including his longtime friend Roger Stone, who was convicted of seven felony charges including lying under oath to a congressional committee and threatening a witness.The president on Sunday pardoned his son despite having vowed not to interfere with the prosecutions against Hunter Biden.The younger Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 12 after he was found guilty in June of illegally owning a gun in 2018. Experts said it was rare to prosecute cases like the one brought against him.He was also due to be sentenced later this month after pleading guilty in September  to avoid another public trial  to not paying his taxes on time.Joe Biden in his announcement asserted that his son had been selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted, arguing that no reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.The decision attracted backlash from Republicans and some Democrats.Some of Trumps Republican allies in Congress cast Biden as corrupt, hypocritical and seeking to dodge accountability.Trumps spokesperson, Steven Cheung, claimed in a statement, The failed witch hunts against President Trump have proven that the Democrat-controlled DOJ and other radical prosecutors are guilty of weaponizing the justice system.","title":"Geraldo Rivera Slaps Trump Supporters With A Reality Check After Bidens Pardon: Its not like he appointed him Ambassador to France"},{"text":"Here is what has me tuned out: A majority of the American people voted to put Trump in office.

Nevermind, this marked a stark reversal from Bidens repeated position that, unlike Trump, he would respect the courts and the rule of law, vowing never to pardon Hunter, despite his love for him.For example, in June,?[Biden told reporters after a jury convicted](https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-hunter-biden-18efb958a5365eebda5bb3da411c4326)?Hunter on three charges related to falsifying a federal form to obtain a gun, I said Id abide by the jurys decision, and I will do that.Later, in September, Hunter Biden, 54, pleaded guilty to?[nine federal tax charges](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-guilty-verdict-tax-evasion-trial/)?in Los Angeles. These stemmed from a period when he struggled with addiction to crack and alcohol, spent recklessly, and fathered a child with an assistant. He initially refused to acknowledge the childs paternity.The pardon was carefully worded to protect Hunter from additional charges he might face under a Trump administration, particularly those involving foreign governments.No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than that Hunter was singled out solely because he is my son C and that is wrong, Biden wrote in a statement explaining his decision. There has been an effort to break Hunter, who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break me C and theres no reason to believe it will stop here.The announcement came roughly 50 days before Biden leaves office and as he prepared to board a flight to Africa.Biden is not the first sitting president to pardon a family member. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton, for drug charges. Jimmy Carter pardoned his brother, Billy Carter, for failing to register as a foreign agent. Benjamin Harrison pardoned his son, Ulysses S. Grant pardoned his brother-in-law, and Andrew Johnson pardoned his son-in-law.And lets not forget Trumps pardon of Charles Kushner, his son-in-laws father, whom he nominated to be the next Ambassador to France.Biden had repeatedly promised to be different, distancing himself from the nepotism and disregard for the rule of law seen during the Trump administration.Of course, much has changed since those promises. Biden was effectively sidelined by his party and denied a chance at re-election (though technically, he framed the decision as his own). Meanwhile, Trump, who vowed to prosecute political enemies, is set to return to power.Though Biden initially sought to demonstrate his administrations commitment to higher standards, his latest move only further emboldens a next Trump administration, which will no doubt repeatedly point to this pardon, further weakening the norms of American politics.","title":"Bidens pardon of his son is not only him at his Trumpiest but also emboldens Trumps next term"},{"text":"Another feel good article saying  he wont be that bad from someone ignoring history.

Legal Eagle did a pretty thorough video on what the Supreme Court ruling means and how it can be used.I see people talk about the ruling all the time on reddit, and everyone seems to use the wording \\"official acts\\". Even users correcting other users focus on that wording According to the Legal Eagle video, the key term however, is core duties. Anything that relates to the President's core duties is automatically legal, anything that's considered an official act is presumed legal but can be challenged later. While there's a lot of leeway for what might constitute a core presidential duty, the one thing that is absolutely not up for debate is commanding the military. Anything Trump would command the military to do is now legal. Now, would the Supreme Court likely regret their ruling if this leads to the military firing into crowds of protesters on American soil? Most likely. Will they do anything about it? It's too late by then, it's done. Can they even change their ruling after the fact without someone bringing up a legal challenge through a court case?

The organizing principle in Trumps chaotic campaigns, the animating passion among his supporters, has been a reactionary turn against dizzying change, specifically the economic and cultural transformations of the past half century: the globalization of trade and migration, the transition from an industrial to an information economy, the growing inequality between metropolis and hinterland, the end of the traditional family, the rise of previously disenfranchised groups, the browning of the American people. Trumps basic appeal is a vow to take power away from the elites and invaders who have imposed these changes and return the country to its rightful ownersthe real Americans. His victory demonstrated the appeals breadth in blue and red states alike, among all ages, ethnicities, and races....The triumph of the Trump Reaction should put an end to two progressive illusions that have considerably strengthened it. One is the notion that identity is political destiny. For a long time, the Democratic Party regarded demographic change in America, the coming minority majority, as a consoling promise during interim Republican victories: As the country turned less white, it would inevitably turn more blue. In the past decade this notion was absorbed into an ideological framework that became the pervasive worldview of progressivesa metaphysics of group identity in which a generalized people of color (adjusted during the social-justice revolution of 2020 to BIPOC) were assumed to share a common experience of oppression that would determine their collective political behavior, driving them far to the left on issues such as immigration, policing, and transgender rights....Adjacent to the demographic illusion is a majoritarian one. By this theory, the Democratic Party is kept out of power by a white Republican minority that thwarts the popular will through voter suppression, gerrymandering, judicial legislating, the filibuster, the composition of the Senate, and the Electoral College. By this thinking, the ultimate obstacle to the American promise is the Constitution itself. The United States needs to become less republican and more democratic, with electoral reforms and perhaps a second constitutional convention to give more power to the people. This analysis contains some undeniable truthsthe publics voice is thwarted by structural barriers, partisan machinations, and enormous quantities of plutocratic cash. As long as Republican presidents continued to lose the popular vote, the majoritarian argument was tempting, even if its advocates ignored the likelihood that a new constitution would turn out to be less democratic than the old one....In some ways, the Biden administration and the Harris campaign tried to reorient the Democratic Party back toward the working class, which was once its backbone. Biden pursued policies and passed legislation to create jobs that dont require a college degree in communities that have been left behind. Harris studiously avoided campaigning on her identity as a Black and South Asian woman, appealing instead to a vague sense of patriotism and hope. But Bidens industrial policy didnt produce results fast enough to offset the damage of inflationno one I talked with in Maricopa County, Arizona, or Washington County, Pennsylvania, this year seemed to have heard of the Inflation Reduction Act. Harris remained something of a cipher because of Bidens stubborn refusal to step aside until it was too late for her or anyone else to make their case to Democratic voters. The partys economic policies turned populist, but its structureunlike the Republican Partys mass cult of personalityappeared to be a glittering shell of power brokers and celebrities around a hollow core. Rebuilding will be the work of years, and realignment could take decades....Journalists will have a special challenge in the era of the Trump Reaction. Were living in a world where facts instantly perish upon contact with human minds. Local news is disappearing, and a much-depleted national press can barely compete with the media platforms of billionaires who control users algorithmically, with an endless stream of conspiracy theories and deepfakes. The internet, which promised to give everyone information and a voice, has consolidated in just a few hands the power to destroy the very notion of objective truth. Legacy journalism is dead, Musk crowed on his own X in the week before the election. Instead of chasing phantoms on social media, journalists would make better use of our dwindling resources, and perhaps regain some of the publics trust, by doing what weve done in every age: expose the lies and graft of oligarchs and plutocrats, and tell the stories of people who cant speak for themselves.These are some points to consider going forwards. It's clear that the system has been broken (both here and also in democracies around the world) for a while, but what's broken and how it might be fixed remains uncertain.","title":"The End of Democratic Delusions | The Trump Reaction and what comes next"},{"text":"That's crazy!

California's problems are not presented at scale by right-wing media so that people like you think \\"wow that place is such a shithole\\" because it's a Democratic stronghold. And then you prioritize those negative things in your brain against the positives such as the largest most successful economy in the nation because *right-wing media literally cannot say anything good about Democrats, leftists, or liberals*.Of course conservatives don't think about any issue beyond surface level emotions. Right-wing media is both the cause and the benefactor of that. So if you're only paying attention to right-wing media then of course you will think California is some hellish liberal wasteland. They won't talk about how rent across the nation is skyrocketing. They won't talk about issues of scale.

Places like California, and other Democratic liberal states, are super expensive to live in **because people actually want to live there which drives up the prices**. People do NOT want to live in Mississippi because of how dog-shit it is to live here and so it's the cheapest state to move to. Look for yourself!

Repeat every time someone says anything about him or any other nutcase. Like a broken record. It gives them no where to go. If  they do go into meltdown just cross your arms and repeat it.Do NOT argue. Do not reason with them. Do not give them anything but those few words. It gives them no place to go. And it does put them in a bind. They and their dear leader will have to bear the responsibility of anything and everything that goes wrong. You bear no burden of proof or responsibly. Their guy won, so you need not defend any of your positions.This avoids the problem of having to spend time arguing. And if you were to make a prediction, it wont be proven until it comes true. What if something happens that mitigates your prediction? For example, if Trump only deports a few people, but makes a really big show of it. His voters will be convinced he did what he said he would (he didnt in our scenario, but they wont believe that) and then they will gloat over their false reality.

Half the country perhaps knew the stakes but figured that there was no point, or many of that half just choose to not be informed about anything, yet they will obviously complain about everything. I remember after election day, someone had calculated that it was roughly 28% of the voting population that picked Donald Trump. I think it might have gone down to 23% now that everything has been tallied. You throw in that roughly 50% that didn't show up, and in my book 75% of the country is responsible for Donald Trump getting a second term. This is why I stopped caring. After 32 years of trying to tell peers and others how much the modern conservative movement is not for the average person and are just cronies for the donor class, these people still think somehow the trickle-down economics is going to one day work, and all the other BS that's fed to them by all of the propaganda media created by the right wing. I'm personally done trying to save the public from itself. I'm honestly at the point that I don't care if people are going to be suffering over the next 4 years. All those people that voted for Trump or didn't bother to show up at all. I'm not going to feel sorry for them when they are complaining about grocery prices, gas prices, job losses, freedoms being taken away, corruption, etc. Knowing that 23% to 28%, they'll just blame immigrants, brown people, teachers, and unions. I've been telling anyone that voted for Harris and anyone with a brain to insulate yourself and your finances. Keep your stuff in order. So when Trump and his cronies trash the economy, you're not going to lose everything. Lord knows the wealthy donor class aren't going to lose much, but everyone at the bottom is going to lose even more. Work to insulate yourself so you're part of that bunch that doesn't lose much. Live in a blue area that's going to fight back and keep freedom alive. But that's it. I'm done with trying to get people to understand. I don't agree with all of these liberals that are saying the fight must continue. I say let's have everybody suffer for 4 years and maybe they're finally going to learn everything the left has been trying to tell them for how many decades. I can't feel sorry for people that somehow bought into Trump's BS, but they have no clue how the economy actually works, and how tariffs actually work. They brought their suffering on themselves.

At a Sept. 12 campaign stop in Tucson, Arizona, Trump promised to begin the largest mass deportation mission in the history of our country.Trumps selection of Thomas Homan as border czar and Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy, two officials seen as hard-liners on immigration, suggest that the administrations approach to a crackdown will attempt to make good on that promise and be aggressive, though details have not been provided by the Trump transition team.While AI wasnt widely used during the first Trump administrations immigration crackdown, the technology has become more accessible and widely deployed across many systems and government agencies, and President Bidens administration began devoting DHS budget and organizational focus to it.In April, the Department of Homeland Security created the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board to help establish perimeters and protocols for the technologys use. The 2025 DHS budget includes $5 million to open an AI Office in the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer. According to the DHS budget memo, the office is responsible for advancing and accelerating the responsible use of AI by establishing standards, policies, and oversight to support the growing adoption of AI across DHS.More: [https://cnb.cx/49oL4Ur](https://cnb.cx/49oL4Ur)","title":"How Trump's mass deportation plan can use AI to extend immigration crackdown"},{"text":"Using the military against citizens will happen because Trump has immunity.

The history and the social.context are even the same : both have been introduced as ways to control sexuality, both have then become cultural standards, both are seen as victimless by many, particularly the people who practice it, both are enforced by the people who have suffered from it.

One of the person involved didn't consent/was forced. That is how people generally understand the term rape. The rapist is the person who forced/violated the consent of the other. The victim is the person who didn't consent/ was forced.\\nThe feminist definition used by the CDC after the direction of people like Mary Koss, rape only happen when the rapist penetrates the victim. Since most penetration of someone else are done by a man, by definition, rape becomes 90+% male committed. Under that definition, a woman who give GHB to a man, then rides him all night long in spite of his protests did not commit rape, despite pretty much everyone agreeing such a case is a case of rape, and thinking, when using the 90+% of rapes done by men that it includes such cases, which they imagine are what constitutes the 10-%, when in reality, that number is the women who did that and either pegged or used a finger to penetrate their victims.\\nNot exactly the most commonplace thing, and skewing the data quite a bit in a very deceptive way.\\nthere's definitely an argument to say that women are trying to make the crime of sexually assaulting a man a lesser crime\\nFeminists, not women. And you are missing the core of the point I am making. It doesn't matter that most people would not want to consider women assaulting a man a lesser crime. It doesn't even matter that most feminists would disagree with such an idea. Because when it comes time to act on those beliefs, they are already acting on data based into that worldview. They don't believe women assaulting men should be considered a lesser crime. But they already believe that rape is committed at 90+% by men. The only difference is that this belief that women assaulting men is an equal crime can be used by them for plausible deniability. Of course no, they aren't sexist. They just have the exact same impact on the world as sexist would, despite not being sexist, because their worldview is informed by people they trusted and shouldn't have, and who are sexists. That is precisely my whole point. You can't base yourself on what \\"most people calling themselves feminist believe their values are\\" to judge the impact of feminism, because those values get irrelevant when they then proceed to inform their action based on faulty data constructed not in accordance to those values.\\nbut this is a very edge case and a long way away from \\"kill all men\\" which is the rhetoric OP is referring to.\\nAnd like I said, it is only edge if it had no influence, but as already demonstrated, the influence is disproportionate if the edge cases are in the appropriate position of influence.\\nYou take the \\"kill all men\\" example. Sure, very few might recognise themselves into it. But how popular, exactly, is the feminist slogan \\"the future is female\\"? Do you know of its origins ? I would bet most feminists who have an item with that slogan have no clue. And just think it a benign piece of \\"female empowerment\\" (and that already tells you a lot about the state of misandry, to exclude a half of the population from the future).Well, it comes from Sally Miller Gearhart, in a document where she stated \\"the future is female, and to make it so, the male population must be reduced to 10%\\".\\nHow nice. Do you start to see the point I am making about the relevance of influence over a movement even in spite of the popularity of a position ? I wouldn't even ask you if you were starting to see a pattern.\\nReally, the question when it comes to Male Genital Mutilation is why are men not pushing for this to be made illegal?\\nAnd what make you think they aren't ? Like I said, look for who is getting in the way. And most of the time, it is feminist groups that are at the forefront.\\nDo you know how people who fight against MGM are called ? MRAs. Men's rights activists.\\nThe intactivists are people fighting for government to enforce respect over men's right to bodily autonomy and self determination. It is literally an issue regarding the rights of men being violated, and so people doing activism to stop this violation of men's rights to bodily autonomy, by the nature of how words work, are what we call men's rights activists, or MRAs.\\nUnlike feminist, which is a specific subset of WRA linked to a specific ideology and view of the world, there is no way around calling people who work at protecting the rights of men anything other than MRAs.\\nTell me, what positive things have you heard about MRAs from feminists ?","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Can't WAIT for another round of deficit exploding tax breaks for the wealthy.More golfing trips on the taxpayers dime.Long winded rambling nonsensical speeches about super scary \\"woke\\" mobs.Nuking hurricanes.Injecting bleach.Whining.Crying.Pissing and moaning.gonna be a great four years of utter stupidity","title":"Trump BROKE the democratic party.

We know that he said he was thinking about pardoning Snowden at the end of his last term, but he didn't do it. That was already a shift in his thinking, because he had told Fox &amp; Friends he thought Snowden was guilty of treason before he was President. Putting Tulsi in charge of intelligence seems like another pro-Snowden move, assuming he knows she had called for the pardon of both of these guys years ago. Elon did a [poll ](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1599224347121500160)on X two years ago asking if they should be pardoned, and 80% voted yes. So the issue has been on Elon's mind as well.One of Joe Rogan's interviews with Snowden is his third most-viewed video on YouTube, right after Trump's. But that topic didn't come up in their interview. If Trump is in tune with the \\"Rogan crowd\\" at all, and gives them any credit for his win, then he should realize that crowd wants to see Snowden pardoned, or given some kind of deal. I think Snowden has only asked that he be allowed to use a defense that the government was denying him, related to being a whistleblower. A plea deal would be somewhere in between that and a pardon. It's definitely more likely something positive happens for Snowden in this term than the last, I think. It would also really annoy John Bolton, so that may be another plus for Trump.","title":"Donald Trump hints at mass pardons for Jan. 6 defendants after Biden pardons son Hunter"},{"text":"Generally I dont like the pardon too much.

And he got away with it without much of a fight. Outside of Reddit and a couple of mailers, I didnt hear a thing about it. Wtf is wrong with the Ohio Democrats Party? Is the national party leadership helping them? The Biden/Harris (which became Harris/Walz obviously) campaign spent over 1 billion dollars on the 2024 campaign, and over 3 billion dollars in 2020. That is an astronomical amount of money to spend, and it sucks up resources from down-ballot Democrats.

There's a big difference between the idea that women in power would, for example, permit male genital mutilation whilst banning female genital mutilation, and the idea that women in power would encourage male genital mutilation.Similarly, when it comes to defining rape (the definition usually used in pnetrative act, but I think the distinction you're talking about is the definition that would necessitate the involvement of a penis, hence making it a male-only crime) - there's definitely an argument to say that women are trying to make the crime of sexually assaulting a man a lesser crime, but this is a very edge case and a long way away from \\"kill all men\\" which is the rhetoric OP is referring to. Really, the question when it comes to Male Genital Mutilation is why are men not pushing for this to be made illegal? If you look into this deeper we see that culturally, things like circumcision are quite often seen as normal (bizzaire as that may seem) and are often seen as victimless. In comparison, FGM is almost always a form of male control, and has basically no support amongst women. This means there is actually a significant difference between the outcomes of what is at face-value a very similar act. I don't think any women are saying that MGM must be legal, whilst simultaneously arguing FGM must be illegal.","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Dont listen to him hes a troll.","title":"California lawmakers to begin special session to 'Trump-proof' state laws"},{"text":"If you have no response, hitem with the ad hominem.

Looking there, **we quickly find that interest is the cause of price inflation, because interest inherently and irreversibly multiplies debt in proportion to the circulation.**Everywhere the ever increasing costs of multiplying debt come to bear upon the subject system then, price inflation is the consequence of interest ?and can only be eradicated by eradicating interest.Even on its surface therefore, **the facade we are constantly spoon fed should be difficult to swallow, because in effect it tells us that the people detect something which does not even exist;** and that then we simply uniformly punish ourselves by unnecessarily, perpetually, and destructively raising prices ?making life so damagingly expensive that our usurers must come to our rescue by elevating the very cause of price inflation so much that we cannot afford to maintain the prices which will preserve margins of solubility.Which of course is why our industry is vanished to elsewhere.**So the purported economist advocates a system which maximizes its unearned taking by the facade price inflation is controlled by interest ?which in fact only makes solubility ever less possible.\\" Mike Montagne**","title":"Why does no one want to hear the truth about the rich?"},{"text":"Yeah I noticed he didn't consult the Parliamentarian in this situation because he didn't want that answer.

You yourself say you don't see these behaviours in real life.\\nFeminism itself is a form for good and for social equality.\\nAre you that sure ? i know i am not.\\nYou see, feminism is a political movement. It has i fluence on policies. Like in most political movements, the foot soldiers have barely any impact of what the brass are doing. The people.who implement policies, who make laws, who build programs.\\nJudging the impact of feminism on the world by what your local? teenager supporting it thinks is like judging the impact of the democrats or the republicans based on what the local person believes.\\nIf you take the time to talk to pretty much anyone near you, you will find that most people have mostly very tame views about most things, and that you can find an agreement with them.\\nIn real life, you never talk to anyone from the CIA and the NSA. And Internet amplifies the voice of people like Assange and Snowden, who are a minority of people drawing the attention of the public on the action of another minority of people.\\nDoes that mean that you should dismiss the things they draw attention to, because the people involved are not typical ? No, not really.\\nOK, so, when assessing the impact of big political ideologies, shouldn't we take a look at the work by institutions that reclaim themselves of it, more than by the action of John or Barbara next door, who associate themselves with those ideologies ?\\nAnd while feminism doesn't have a single party or whatever, it has plenty of institutions that reclaim themselves of it, and plenty of people in positions of authority, with the ability to heavily impact many things in society and many people's lives.\\nFor example, you have the UN women.? They create a whole lot of \\"gender equality\\" measures, that are then used by various groups to influence policy worldwide. Those gender equality indexes, generally, have one little detail that might get them considered less than ideal : they count disadvantages to men as equality. They only consider disadvantage to women as an inequality.\\nOne might say that this kind of thing is sexist. Misandrist, more precisely.\\nDespite the long established evidence for gender symmetry in domestic violence, the UN keeps to talk about \\"violence against women\\"\\nDespite no reason to make the distinction in why the practice must be forbidden, the UN ignores genital mutilations inflicted on men, to only focus on FGM.\\nThat makes at least 3 topics where something that isn't gendered has been pointlessly gendered in a manner that makes it look hypocritical and reduces the effectiveness of the approaches, all to dismiss the sufferings of men.\\nWould you say that is a positive influence of feminism on the world, or would we be better served by tackling problems in their entirety, without blinders on ?\\nAnd so I know that Emma and Suzette and Bob down the street are really great egalitarian who call themselves feminists. But should I care more about their impact on the world, or the impact of the UN, when talking about feminism as a positive or negative influence ??\\nWhat if Bob and Emma a great egalitarian in their values, but inform their actions based on data collected and reported by the UN on what constitutes equality ? Does their egalitarian values actually matter then, if it can't help their actions being informed by sexistly biased data ?\\nTo me, I would say that while them having egalitarian values is great, their describing themselves as feminists is more likely to get them to just accept UN issued data with less of a critical examination, and as such, their being feminists actually has once again a negative impact on the world, as they get fooled by the label into supporting sexist things while being intimately convinced they are not.\\nAnd that is just taking the UN. There are quite a few governmental and non governmental feminist groups with similar levels of influence and bias.\\nAnd the Bob and Emma and Suzette of the world, who are great egalitarian that get misguided by those biased data, they are precisely being used as cover by the various people like feminist Mary Koss, who defined how the CDC (and therefore a huge chunk of the world) should study rape, along with her belief that men forced into sex by women shouldn't be considered victims because deep down they must have actually wanted it, and defined rape as the act by the rapist of penetrating their victims, excluding most women forcing sex on others from the data.?\\nAnd so they push various biased stats that claim rape is done at 90+% by men (by definition) while trusting the feminist source for such data and not looking into how it was collected or defined. To them, it means that 90+% of the times someone is forced into sex, it is by a man. They build their worldview around that. They end up maybe even thinking that bears might be safer to be around, that men are uniquely monstrous. While holding egalitarian values, they embrace a misandrist worldview.\\nAnd then they get to claim on the Internet that most of the feminist they know are not misandrists, and therefore feminism is not misandrist.\\nThat isn't how things work, but they genuinely believe it. And they help serve as shield for those people they claim to despise, but who built all the infrastructures through which they informed their worldviews without bothering to check critically because \\"all the feminists around them are good people\\".","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Oh nos!

Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012). As a tragic irony, the wider availability of support services for abused women did not appear to have quite the intended effect, at least through the 1980s, as only male victimization declined.\\"\\nLet me be clear in what they are saying :\\nIn the 70s, about as many men as women were killed by their partners. Then we started implementing services to help *female* victims of DV. As a result, the number of women killed by their partner almost didn't change. On the other hand, it is the number of *men* killed by their partner that decreased.\\nThe researchers attribute that to what is commonly referred to as \\"battered wife syndrome\\". The idea is that someone can be trapped in abuse without any hope of getting out, to the point where murder seems like a viable way out. Help to escape abuse means there are other ways out, and so a reduction in murders of abusers.\\nBut then, what can we conclude of the data we have there ?\\nWell, the first thing is that either the services available right now are absolutely ineffective at helping victims in danger of being killed, or that barely any abuser ever kills their victim.\\nIndeed, an abuser is in a position of power over the abused, and killing their victim would strip them of that power. So it might be a bit of both, though one might wonder what, if anything that has been tried since the 70s proved ineffective, could help victims of abuse at risk of being killed.\\nThe second thing we can conclude is that it seems that the majority (at least those 60% of reduction we've seen in men) of spousal murder victims are the murders of abusers that pushed their victims too much into despair, until they snapped.\\nWe could then conclude that the most likely way to reduce partner homicide right now would be to provide just as many services to [the equivalent number of male abuse victims](https://domesticviolenceresearch.org/), who have been [pretty much ignored for the past 50 years by services](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/) run at the hands of [ideologically motivated feminists.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2790940)\\nWhat we can not conclude from that data, though, is that domestic abuse at the hands of men can be much more dangerous.\\nBut then, of course, it is not feminists who will present you that data. It is slightly embarrassing to their point of \\"men bad, please give us money to help women\\".\\nYou see, you claim that the higher number of women killed by a partner is a sign of DV against women, and use that to advocate for more help to be directed towards female victims of DV and to justify misandry.\\nBut the actual reality of that data is that this number is higher because of the disparity in help, and that your proposed solution and the activism you support actually goes against solving that issue you started your comment with.\\nYou want to reduce the number of women killed by their partner ? All the data deem to point towards the necessity of helping male victims of DV as the best way to accomplish it.\\nAnd you know what ? Battered wife syndrome is far from a recent invention. The woman who opened the very first modern shelter for battered women, Erin Pizzey, immediately noticed that most of the women she helped were at least as violent as the men they were fleeing. She tried to open shelters for men too, and to raise awareness about male victims of DV from the beginning, and it were feminist groups that made death threats escalating to the killing of her family's dog before she had to flee the UK. The knowledge of the equivalent number of male victims was also available right from the beginning of the DV movement.\\nSo people have known for decades that as many men as women were suffering from SV, and people have known for decades about battered wife syndrome, meaning that people have known for decades that the most effective way to reduce DV related deaths was to help both men and women equally.\\nAnd it is feminist opposition and desire to maintain the feminist frame of men as perpetrators and women as victims, that kept that knowledge out of the public eye, by their own admission of it. And as a result, it is the desire to protect the feminist ideology and its misandry that led to the suffering of untold numbers of men and the unnecessary deaths of untold numbers of women.\\nNow, here's the question that matter : do you care more about protecting feminism and its message of misandry, or do you care more about actually helping people and saving those lives ? Because as long as the DV industry stays in feminist hands, you won't see a reduction in women's deaths. They have a vested interest in maintaining those numbers as they are. They have sit on the knowledge that could save thousands of lives for decades, because it was inconvenient to the messaging. Misandry over women's lives and interests, that's the feminist M.O.","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Well there were less votes cast last election compared to 2020 so yeah they do","title":"Joe Bidens broken promise on Hunter pardon is ammunition for Trump"},{"text":"Dude thats ALOT of pardons holy crap!","title":"Trump calls Hunter Biden pardon an abuse and miscarriage of Justice"},{"text":"Everything the Democrats do or say is picked apart and hyper-analyzed.why are we still playing by the rules Conservatives set down for us?... because they claim to be the moral party who has the values of liberalism.

We know people like Andrew Tate are a threat because there are children in schools parroting his lines and emulating his behaviours. It's definitely possible there are many feminists who think the way the extremists do online - the question is, do we see those thoughts and behaviours emulated in real life?To work out if there actually is an issue the most reliable way is to look at the statistics. There isn't much that's conclusive in this area, as the most indicative statistics are for partner violence, and from a brief look at wiki the facts seem to indicate a fairly steady balance between female on male and male on female abuse. There also isn't a spike in domestic violence in general. Other relevant statisticsc could be the rate of marriages, which is generally down, or the \\"male lonliness epidemic\\", but there's not really much research on this I could find. You could also perhaps look at the amount of people in relationships versus single people, but this is almost always a big estimate and gives no indication of the power dynamics of such relationships.I guess what I'm trying to say is we shouldn't conclude that extremist internet opinions have corrupted feminist movements when we don't see the evidence.

Since it's hard to get numbers in underdeveloped countries, where feminicide is more prevalent, the actual figure is thought to be much higher.How many men were killed by women?It's not feminism telling women to be afraid of men. It's facts. Nearly every woman I know has been assaulted, harassed, or raped by a man at some point, sometimes a combination of all three. Feminism tells women they are equal to men, should have equal rights and opportunities, and shouldn't have to be afraid. That they shouldn't be discriminated against on the basis of their gender, or have to be put in a little box according to what society thinks women should do and want. Feminism is about giving people the chamce to be people, and be viewed as people, before being 'men' or 'women'. Feminism tries to stop toxic masculinity and create a more equal society. Unfortunately,  some men identify so deeply with the patriarchy that they view this as an attack on men. Feminism doesn't hate men. Some people online are vocal in expressing their fear and anger at men, and while it's understandable they would do that because they are rightfully afraid and angry, I agree it's not constructive in creating dialogue.That being said, for a dialogue, the other person has to be open to engaging with you and understanding your point of view. Which is unfortunately rarely the case when people benefit from the status quo. It's much easier to tell women 'why are you afraid, I'm a good guy' than consider that statistically, for her, the question isn't if a man she meets is a rapist or abuser. The question is: 'Which one is it?'And if she gets the answer wrong, she could be r*p*d or killed.What issues did feninism cause?

For example, feminists often complain that they feel like it is exhausting to talk about their issues with the men in their life because every statement in every discussion needs to be couched in careful language to make sure the man isn't offended. The discussion we are having right now is, unfortunately, super common.I would invite you to consider the kinds of things that women complain about men about versus the kinds of things men complain about women about.**(Harsh generalizations incoming! #notallmen /s)**Women complain about:* Unwanted sexual attention from coworkers and bystanders on the street\\n* Feeling like their safety is threatened by strangers\\n* Feeling like their safety is threatened by romantic partners\\n* Having their access to medical care taken away\\n* Not being taken seriously in work, politics, and social interaction with men\\n* Not being taken seriously by law enforcementMen complain about:* Not getting to have sex\\n* A video game character not showing as much cleavage\\n* Women complaining about men\\n* The draft (which American men haven't had to worry about for about 50 years and probably won't come up anytime soon)\\n* Divorce court proceedings (I mean, every man gets divorced at least once in life amiright??1!)One side faces struggles in everyday life every day.

It was decades, centuries even of women pushing for their rights.  Now certainly there were men who supported this- even took part in driving it- but it wasnt like women just chilled at home and let men fight for their rights.  \\nWhen people talk about boys falling behind and how societys definition hadnt caught up- I cant help but think- well, sure. Because who is fighting for this? Its not going to be women- and it shouldnt be. So that means men have to step up and fight. They need to organise. They need to march. Or whatever it means.  But you dont see that.Why? I cant help but think that the type of man who is amongst this group of the ones missing out is also the type of guy I know that just sit at home and are still living on their parents sofa.  Theyre barely motivated in day to day- which is why they struggle in life or to find a partner.  Theres no way they are going to be organizing a big march or something.  The kind of guy that would be? Theyre probably motivated in other aspects- and therefore dont have the need to fight or the drive to do so- theyre busy.Perhaps it was different with women- because I imagine the sort of women who felt had back and was motivated would have been someone who could do all they needed to at home and then go out and drive other things.  Probably they were also partnered to high achieving men who supported them.I saw some post on X or something where a man was making a snide comment about womens day and mens day - about how he hadnt seen any big things organised for mens day. And a woman commented back well, were you expecting a woman to organise it?And it feels like it encapsulates some of these issues we are seeing. Theres no question men are falling behind - but what are they doing about it? Whos pushing for change? Whos organising the modern equivalent of the suffrage movement?Theres a difference in the style as well- women, when demanding right or vote or access to bank accounts- they didnt campaign by asking to take away or lessens mens own access. They argued for equal.  With what were seeing today with taking away abortion access or these articles that are always talking about issues with lack of dating for men or incels- men arent fighting for equal. Theyre fighting to take away or maybe to make it as thought it is womens issue to solve.I dont know what the solution is but I do think men need to step up- together- to figure it out, to fight for it- and they need to ensure the solution isnt about pulling women back from\\nWhat theyre achieved but figuring out how to help eachother step up.","title":"How Our Messed-Up Dating Culture Leads to Loneliness, Anger and Donald Trump"},{"text":"Yeah all of the \\"Were planning on leaving the US\\" people sound good on reddit.In reality unless they posses skills that are needed it's highly unlikely they are going to be given permanent visa's.","title":"Women are getting sterilized after Donald Trump's victory: 'Only option'"},{"text":"No sex in public.","title":"I regret college"},{"text":"Maybe in the case of an abusive relationship?

This is the reason it is wrong and absurd to generalise about it. Feminist is a self attributed descriptor of belonging to an ideology. There is nothing wrong with generalising about people.who choose to embrace an ideology.?\\nEven if someone decided that they would try to clean up the name of nazism and make it again about only helping Germany getting a strong industry, everyone would look suspiciously at that person for even choosing to embrace that term and trying to do such a clean up, even if their own ideological opinions did not align with other nazi aligned opinion.?\\nWell, you know the feminist beloved slogan \\"the future is female\\"? It comes from Sally Miller Gearhart, a respected feminist scholar, from a text that goes \\"the future is female, to ensure it, the male population must be reduced to 10%\\"... and thanks to hillary Clinton, we know that there is not much unpopular in the eyes of feminists of considering men are not even the primary victims of their own deaths, since she claimed \\"Women have always been the primary victims of war, they lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons\\".?\\nLet's just say I don't blame the guy for viewing anyone who decides to try to cleanup such an ideology's name without actively fighting the misandry in it, with only slightly less suspicion than the previous example. Why would anyone willingly associate with that, and let the misandry go on without much issue.\\nWhich leads me to the second point : how do I know that, on the whole, the people who reclaim themselves of feminism, in all of their diversity and non-monolyth-ness, don't give a flying fuck about misandry ? Well, we know what happens, when some feminists find some other feminists hateful in an unacceptable way. Have you seen what happened with TERFs ? Those people apparently hate on a tiny fraction of the population, and I doubt there are many people who have not heard about the issue.?\\nThe hatred of half the population, though ? No big \\"MERF\\" term, nobody going to war against those... when yet another college professor print in a mainstream journal \\"why can't we hate men?\\" Or yet another version of that, she gets publicity by feminists, gets to keep her job at a prestigious position in a university where she handles the fate of many students, and everything goes along as normal. No sign of the outraged feminists, those who are so quick to tell us that feminism is not a monolith of misandry...\\nSo, tell me, where is your and your friend's outrage when feminists push misandry, that you are so outraged people call out feminism as a hate movement??","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Thank you, I found this article helpful in thinking about how I want to move forward.","title":"Trump Will Overplay His Hand.

There are pretty harsh consequences for doing the bad things, and you get sent to a bad place to get tortured for the rest of eternity if you do them. Other people are bad as well if they don't worship the good book, and they pretty much default to the consequence of going to the bad place for eternity because they didn't believe in the good book, even if they don't do the bad things. The only thing is that it's totally cool at the end of the day to do those bad things that you shouldn't do as long as you:- Believe in the book\\n- Tell people you believe in the book\\n- Say that you are sorry that you did what you did to the people who teach other people about the book\\n- Condemn people who don't believe in the bookSo you end up with people who are pretty vocal about their 'morals' but are not afraid to break the rules because they know they can get a free pass as long as they 'repent'. But when other people break those rules and aren't inside the right book club, they are actually the actual 'bad people' because they can't be forgiven by the author of the book because of the way they were born, where they grew up, how they look, how they think, etcIt creates a 'we are the good people' attitude.

You dont want to act, or even talk, alone; you dont want to go out of your way to make trouble. Why not?Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.**Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, Its not so bad or Youre seeing things or Youre an alarmist.**And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you cant prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you dont know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.**But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent toto what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.**But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. Thats the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shockedif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in 43 had come immediately after the German Firm stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in 33. But of course this isnt the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.**And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying Jewish swine, collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live inyour nation, your peopleis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\\" \\\\~* Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free","title":"Even in Exile, the Left Must Fight to Popularize Its Vision"},{"text":"Biden should give himself a Blanket Pardon even though he doesnt need it, just to fucking do it.

Most women you meet are probably feminist to some degree or another. Because they believe in one or more of the following:* Women deserve to social, political, legal, and economic equity to men\\n* Women deserve to be taken as seriously as equally qualified men in every area of life\\n* Women have historically been second class persons, subordinate to men economically, politically, legally, and socially\\n* All people, men and women, are affected by their culture and most cultures have remnants of a time when women's subordination was not just implicit, but explicitAnd most feminists act in a way in harmony with those values and - as a result - have won liberties for women that did not exist even just 50 years ago. Men have not suffered from women winning those liberties except insofar as their dominance in social, political, legal, and economic areas of life have been reduced somewhat.

The headlines say it all - despite having promised not to, Biden pardons his son.  Biden broke his promise for his family member.  Biden broke his word to not run again.  Not for you, of course.  See, when it comes to you and your life - when it comes to American democracy itself! - the Democrats always have lots of reasons they can't get stuff done.  Joe Manchin.  Kyrsten Sinema.  The Senate parliamentarian, whatever the fuck that means.  And most fatal to America, Merrick Garland's glacial plodding.  An attempted self-coup, live on TV, four years ago, the first time in American history a president tried to hold on to power through violence, as cartoonishly inept as it was, and what did we get?  The equivalent of a loud, wet fart, a \\"womp-womp\\" sound effect.  And the coup plotter reelected as President.  Didn't want to seem like we weren't moving on, dontcha know?   I'm sure that will come as great comfort to the political dissidents of the near future who have to go into hiding or flee the United States. Couldn't be helped.  Our hands were tied.  But Biden acted decisively in his own interest and the interest of his family members.  Corruption personified, and look, Trump is taking advantage of it, of course!Here's a question for the \\"yeah, fuck justice, their side did it first\\" crowd - given what we know about Trump, given what his generals said about him, given what Biden and Harris themselves said about him, what do you think that the odds are that Trump will say, after 8 years of Hunter's laptop and all that, \\"oh, well, nothing much I can do here!  I wipe my ass with the Constitution daily, but man, in this case, those magic words will protect Hunter (and his dad!)\\"?  What will prevent a weaponized Justice Department on Day 1 from treating this pardon itself as a criminal action and Trump going after Hunter and Joe anyway?  Trump's got a lot to do and the attention span of a rhesus monkey, but if he really wants to?  This pardon won't save Hunter.  All of this will be for naught.  Worse than that - it is confirmation at the eve of the return of America's first autocrat that yeah, everything that Trump said about corruption and cynicism is absolutely true.

Getting to the middle of the middle class is when you stop being moral. You own a home that isn't yours and tell others to pay you to make that their home. Are the other side of that where they invest in trading goods and services. If the business owners rent then they are controlled by the upper middle class who own their property.You see you don't even start to get liquid income until you reach the middle of the middle class. Then the liquid income increases slowly. You need to start even thinking about liquid assets at around $100k which allows you to either own not just your home but other properties. To own a business location you would need around $1mil. Which most business rent and their rent goes for a minimum of $5k a month.That's only going locally. Lower upper class starts renting franchises and multiple locations. They still have higher ups which is the middle strata of the upper class. These move the money around in the markets. These are the CEO, CFO, and presidents of companies. The upper strata has hands in the governments and owns banks. The upper strata is where the vacuum lies.So in order to reach the middle strata of the middle class you need around $100k liquid assets. The upper strata of the middle class needs $1mil. The lower strata upper class is where the absurd numbers start because it's literally the lottery winning amount. The middle strata upper class is at the start of the billions.

Freedom of speech however works both ways and it appears that the majority of the electorate only respond to simplistic messaging and have a huge appetite for propaganda. They eat it up and if told that up is down they will believe it. Literacy levels are so low, on average, that critical thinking abilities have not been developed, and complex issues relating to the economy and society fall on deaf ears. Turkiye also suffers from this but the sheer weight of numbers appears greater in the USA.Trump will not live for much longer but Vance and the billionaire backers will and this is the main difference between Turkiye and the USA. It has been taken over by what was once known as the robber barons and Musk has so much money that he can afford to buy Congress ten times over. The tech bros control the narrative in social media and are pushing for crypto currency to essentially supplant the USD as a reserve currency.States do have some power in the USA, but a large number of them are red, and it is doubtful that enough of them can combine to thwart the worst of Trumps excesses.Therefore, I suggest that these factors require a greater sense of urgency rather than digging in for a decade. Midterms are crucial but organising on the ground is equally important if the USA has any chance of turning itself around.","title":"Trump Will Overplay His Hand.

Trump refused to visit a cemetery where more than 1800 fallen Marines are buried and called them SUCKERS and LOSERS because they died. Trump downplayed the injuries of troops who suffered traumatic brain injuries following missile strikes against a U.S. base at the end of his time in office, Jan 2020, referring to them as headaches at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Tues, Oct 1, 2024. None of those very accurate missiles hit our fort. They all hit outside. There was nobody hurt, other than the sound was loud. Some people said that hurt, and I accept that. Nearly 80 troops received Purple Hearts for injuries related to the attack, most connected to traumatic brain injury.Trump said John McCain shouldnt be considered a war hero because he was captured. Trump called military advisors dopes and babies. In 2016, then-candidate Trump told a supporter who gave him a copy of his Purple Heart: I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.  Trump said of a severely wounded Army Captain event guest who had completed five combat tours, had lost a leg in an IED attack in Afghanistan and had suffered two heart attacks, two strokes, and brain damage as a result of his injuries: Why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded.  In 2017, Trump made a widow of a soldier cry when he called her to offer condolences and forgot her husbands name. He apparently told her that her husband knew what he had signed up for.Trump said of injured veterans as part of a Bastille Day parade, including wheelchair-bound soldiers who had lost limbs in battle: Look, I dont want any wounded guys in the parade...This doesnt look good for me and I dont want themThe US Army made a statement claiming Trumps aides physically pushed an Arlington National Cemetery staff member who was following professional decorum on August 26, 2024. The Army, in its statement, called the incident unfortunate, adding: it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked. Trump has ZERO actual respect for ANC nor those laid to rest in it.During the Vietnam War, Trump avoided the draft due to bone spurs. However, he has claimed that his time at a prep school gave him more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military. In the 90s, Trump said that dating while trying to avoid sexually transmitted diseases was his own personal Vietnam  an act of bravery deserving of a Congressional Medal of Honor.","title":"Musk, Ramaswamy Proposal to Slash Spending Could Include VA Medical Services"},{"text":"Idiots.

Cuban has said he called the campaign two or three times a week. He was critical of Bidens approach to antitrust. Her price gouging proposal was considered to have little to no effect according to many economists. Her campaign chose not to run their best-performing ad which mentioned price gouging and grocery prices. She claimed most companies are trying to do good and she would go after bad actors.Data analysis of her campaign shows she was backing off her own economic message as time went on until she almost never mentioned taxes on the wealthy or her child tax credit and small business tax deductions. She pivoted to democracy focused rhetoric.Altogether, she was a candidate that tried to appeal to moderates by signaling a more business-friendly approach than the current administration instead of emphasizing policies that wouldve more directly helped workers concerned about the economy.","title":"California swung right this election.

Now that women are pulling ahead, the fairy tale has become increasingly unattainable. This development is causing both men and women to backslide to old gender stereotypes and creating a hostile division between them that provides fuel for the exploding manosphere.*Yep. We have a social dilemma going on where you have a lot of women making a lot more money these days than they used to. And while everyone applauds that accomplishment, no one has addressed where men fit in the new dynamic. The traditional family dynamic that has been the standard for centuries no longer works. Where do men fit in this new world where the traditional roles to provide are still very much expected from them by society, but have become increasingly unattainable? The left at best ignores or insult them, calls them \\"incels\\". The right wing hugs them and offers them a home. And now you have a generation of young men voting for Donald Trump and supporting alt-right ideology. It also gives a talking point to older social/religious conservative men as they claim feminism has destroyed the American family. And they claim we need to get rid of the \\"woke\\" and get back to the traditional family roles for society to function \\"correctly\\" again. And some people (including some women) are buying into this rhetoric. They think society is broke.The left wing ignoring this and just calling everyone an \\"incel\\" is not going to work. This is a social problem that needs to be addressed in some manner. Otherwise the right wing will continue to benefit from this politically and will ultimately very much limit how much more progress women are going to be able to make.","title":"How Our Messed-Up Dating Culture Leads to Loneliness, Anger and Donald Trump"},{"text":"Wouldnt something like this be what Project 2025 would want in the first place?By all means, your body your choice and Im here for anything that makes a conservative wet their pants in rage, but I thought sterilizing yourself is what the conservatives who are more likely to want to breed the master race would want you to do.","title":"Women are getting sterilized after Donald Trump's victory: 'Only option'"},{"text":"How?","title":"Sen.

Dont even try it.He was literally proven liable for fraud in the state of New York and owes the state over $500 million. Hes also a 34 time convicted felon. He was also held liable for defamation and sexual abuse. So if you wanna talk lies, lets start there because the current president pardoning his son is the least of anyones concerns. Also, what happened to Hunter? He literally plead guilty and admitted to his crimes. Not to mention, Hunter Biden wasnt in political office when he did his criminal activity. He was going to be sentenced this month, but Joe Biden nullified all of that.Joe Biden has less than 60 days left in office. I dont think he gives two shits about what people like you think. Saying hes not going to pardon his son is nothing compared to all of the lies Donald Trump ever told during his first term. Over 33,000 lies in four years.Also, the Trump kids (e.g. Trump Jr, Ivanka, Eric) may not have done anything worth pardoning, but they did misuse charitable funds, and had to go through mandatory training on how to properly run a charitable foundation since they were all serving on the board. So upstanding citizens, my ass.

Evolutionary theory doesnt view traits solely based on reproductive success in a direct, one-to-one manner.While its true that same-sex attraction doesnt directly contribute to reproduction, there are several factors that complicate the argument. For example, some researchers suggest that non-reproductive behaviors may persist in populations because they offer social, cooperative, or other advantages. Additionally, there may be genetic or environmental factors that influence sexual orientation, with some studies suggesting that genes, prenatal hormone exposure, or even social factors might all play a role.Moreover, evolution isnt just about individual reproduction; its also about the survival and success of groups. Same-sex behavior is observed in many animal species and may serve a variety of roles beyond reproduction, such as reinforcing social bonds or alliances, which can indirectly support the survival of related individuals.In conclusion, sexual orientation is a complex trait and not as straightforward as evolutionary theories based on reproduction alone. Homosexuality is not classified as a mental illness by major health organizations like the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization.","title":"How Anti-Trans Ads Secured Trumps 2024 Victory"},{"text":"My concern is that irrational people (MAGA) will have tons of kids and though not all will turn out like their parents, I have the perspective that rational parents tend to produce rational kids.","title":"Women are getting sterilized after Donald Trump's victory: 'Only option'"},{"text":"In all fairness, female reporters go in the mens locker room after a game and men are naked.

On the other hand, the result of the American 4B is that as more progressive and intelligent women opt out of having kids, the greater share of children who are born in the country will be born to tradwives and their conservative families.  This leads to conservatives locking down an intergenerational demographic win, in which the vast majority of future voters will skew towards \\"traditional values\\" and secure a permanent Republican political majority indefinitely, thus preventing any hope of a progressive political moment that will restore the rights of women in the future.","title":"Women are getting sterilized after Donald Trump's victory: 'Only option'"},{"text":"Sounds like the perfect guy for Trumps new-old stock America.","title":"Pete Hegseths Secret History C A whistle-blower report and other documents suggest that Trumps nominee to run the Pentagon was forced out of previous leadership positions for financial mismanagement, sexist behavior, and being repeatedly intoxicated on the job"},{"text":"The party is a traitor to the country yes.

Also just how the denials rely pretty much on attacking the source as \\"not journalism\\" once again.But Hegseths record before becoming a full-time Fox News TV host, in 2017, raises additional questions about his suitability to run the worlds largest and most lethal military force. A trail of documents, corroborated by the accounts of former colleagues, indicates that Hegseth was forced to step down by both of the two nonprofit advocacy groups that he ranVeterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for Americain the face of serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct.A previously undisclosed whistle-blower report on Hegseths tenure as the president of Concerned Veterans for America, from 2013 until 2016, describes him as being repeatedly intoxicated while acting in his official capacityto the point of needing to be carried out of the organizations events. The detailed seven-page reportwhich was compiled by multiple former C.V.A. employees and sent to the organizations senior management in February, 2015states that, at one point, Hegseth had to be restrained while drunk from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club, where he had brought his team. The report also says that Hegseth, who was married at the time, and other members of his management team sexually pursued the organizations female staffers, whom they divided into two groupsthe party girls and the not party girls. In addition, the report asserts that, under Hegseths leadership, the organization became a hostile workplace that ignored serious accusations of impropriety, including an allegation made by a female employee that another employee on Hegseths staff had attempted to sexually assault her at the Louisiana strip club. In a separate letter of complaint, which was sent to the organization in late 2015, a different former employee described Hegseth being at a bar in the early-morning hours of May 29, 2015, while on an official tour through Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, drunkenly chanting Kill All Muslims! Kill All Muslims!In response to questions from this magazine, Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for Hegseth, replied with the following statement, which he said came from an advisor to Hegseth: Were not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through?*The New Yorker*?by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseths. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.Edit, and more:The whistle-blower report makes extensive allegations. It describes several top managers being involved in drunken episodes, including an altercation at a casino and a hotel Christmas party at which food was thrown from the balcony. Hegseth, it says, was seen drunk at multiple CVA events between 2013 and 2015, a time when the organization was engaged in an ambitious nationwide effort to mobilize veterans to vote for conservative candidates and causes. The project gave Hegseth and his team the opportunity to travel far from the organizations headquarters, in northern Virginia. Hegseth and his team gave speeches, assisted conservative campaigns, and collected voter data valuable for the Kochs political operation. As a decorated veteran who by 2014 had become an on-air contributor to Fox News, Hegseth was the public face of the groups mission, conducting a whistle-stop tour with his team from city to city, packaged by C.V.A. as the Defend Freedom Tour.","title":"Pete Hegseths Secret History C A whistle-blower report and other documents suggest that Trumps nominee to run the Pentagon was forced out of previous leadership positions for financial mismanagement, sexist behavior, and being repeatedly intoxicated on the job"},{"text":"Don't forget getting to make a shitty transphobic 'joke'.

From Shakespeare, Walt Disney, The Beatles, Elvis, Billie Holiday, Whitney Houston's behemoth cover of Dolly Parton's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and Adam Sandler comedies.The concepts of romance have evolved, and many of the old models are not only dated but frowned upon. Take for example the main protagonist in the 1989 movie Say Anything with John Cusack. He's a young man graduating high school and has no idea what he wants to do with his life. He falls in love with a high achieving classmate. She has a very bright future with scholarships and straight A's. At night he even blasts a boom box from outside her bedroom window playing the song \\"In Your Eyes\\" by Peter Gabriel. For pop culture of the time this was considered romantic. This is now considered at the very least harassment and possibly even stalking depending on consent. At the time of release. It was a hallmark of \\"romance.\\" Another example, Marlon Brando's character in 1954's  \\"On the Waterfront\\". The main protagonist Terry Bogard is a washed up boxer in his mid 30s who never \\"made it\\" and now works as a union dock worker moving freight containers. He falls in love with the sister of a man who was tossed off the roof of his building for being a \\"rat\\" to the union boss. Terry has sympathy for her but doesn't tell her he was there the night her brother was thrown off the roof. In one dramatic scene, after she tells him she doesn't want to see him, he shows up at her apartment and breaks the door down, demanding she say that she loves him and they embrace each other. This was also deemed \\"romantic\\" during its time. No doubt this is considered stalking, potentially burglary, and emotional abuse.Men and women both grew up with a fantasy of sensationalized romance and idealism.Many young girls of today idolize Taylor Swift who is a mid 30s billionaire who constantly sings about shitty ex boyfriends. Young men of today are left with billionaires like Elon Musk and Trump who have children with many wives and amassed their obscene wealth through crimes and lies. There is no romance in the role models of today. Just the obsession of money, power and status. There is a common theme though. Men and women look up to billionaires. They just choose different ones to evaluate \\"success.\\"\\"Romance\\" has been thrown against the wall as a transactional relationship not always by choice but as a result of the 2008 financial crisis where young men and women lived in an era of desperation and survival in crowded professional industries. Millenials for instance graduated college and it took years to even be considered at companies within the fields of their studies. I haven't even mentioned the Me Too era, which is a whole other valley to walk through.Me Too is a combination of gender power dynamics, an absence of healthy communication, boundaries, and dysfunctional sexual encounters. More than likely, also blurring the lines of love and sex being the same thing which they are not. Robin Thicke has not aged like fine wine and \\"Blurred Lines\\" is potentially the 2010s own version of \\"Baby it's Cold Outside.\\"Me Too began as a justice reform. It was a reaction to the culture of harassment, date rape and abuse suffered by women throughout the 20th and 21st century. Me Too is likely one of the main sources of the breakdown of modern romance or at least the sensationalism of it. The love story ends, and confusion sets in. Distorted romance and narcissism can result in dangerous consequences for people who can not and refuse to accept rejection. I believe life sometimes imitates art instead of the other way around. For the majority of people who were born and grew up in the 20th and early 21st century, romance was an ideal. A woman playing hard to get was a challenge, not a rejection.For Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, Diddy and I'd throw Trump in the same category. Romance doesn't exist. Women are a prize for their success, an extension of their narcissism. The idea that they could even be rejected is impossible.What further complicates Me Too is the usefulness of its ability to be misused and potentially weaponized. Some men can be taken down effortlessly with allegations alone while others may be permanently immune and perhaps even gain more power and influence if they can successfully run a campaign of denying any such misconduct ever occurring. The justice reform of the Me Too movement is far from perfect and those criticisms may run the risk of further dividing gender conflicts.","title":"How Our Messed-Up Dating Culture Leads to Loneliness, Anger and Donald Trump"},{"text":"Fuck all repugs.

I agree that if there was ever a year for Buffalo to beat us, it was this year. Then again, we said the same thing last year, but what I like about the Bills now is the support system they've built around Josh Allen even without a clear top target. Sports media was pronouncing the Bills dead after they traded Stefon Diggs and I was like \\"Uhhh you do know who's their quarterback right, they'll be fine.\\" And they've been damn good so far! I love that run game and offensive line playBut I still trust the Chiefs to put their best foot forward in the postseason, especially once we get guys like Hollywood Brown back from injury. Xavier Worthy has been playing damn well and honestly should be getting more targets at all levels of the field because his separation is excellent. Hopefully the new left tackle we signed will be at least serviceable because Mahomes has been getting hammered this season, and NOT the kind that gave him that dad bod.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 1, 2024"},{"text":"unbelievable, isnt it!!i mean she was the vice-president but that doesn't really count right","title":"Gay couples rush to marry and have children before Trump inauguration"}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],M={key:0},O={key:1};function J(t,o,e,m,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 public opinion 🥳")])],-1)),n("div",R,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.visiblePoems,(l,p)=>(a(),T(c,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,j)):k("",!0)])}const N=d(W,[["render",J],["__scopeId","data-v-a572af48"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/64.md","filePath":"guide/64.md"}'),z={name:"guide/64.md"},Y=Object.assign(z,{setup(t){return(o,e)=>(a(),i("div",null,[u(N)]))}});export{F as __pageData,Y as default};
