I voted for the abortion amendment in my state.  I would never vote for Trump or any MAGA-sympathizing politician.  But I can still recognize that in the United States, men have some advantages in some areas and women have some advantages in other areas.  Overall, it's probably pretty close to equal.So by continuing to adopt policies that advantage women and/or disadvantage men, we are no longer eliminating inequality, **we are creating inequality**.  We need to start ignoring demographics, and just start adopting policies that advantage as many people as possible and disadvantage as few of people as possible - regardless of the demographics of those people.So long as Democratic leaders continue to genuinely believe that, overall, men are advantaged in the United States and women are disadvantaged, they will continue to lose more and more voters who disagree with that premise.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Fuck it man, appoint him to the department of agriculture because why the fuck not at this point","title":"Hulk Hogan says Trump may nominate him for leadership post"},{"text":"No. The tarnish is on the Republican Senators that failed to convict Trump during the Impeachment for January 6 and the biased judges and Justices that slowed down the process so that Trump would face trial for any federal crimes until after the 2024 election.

Trump and his goons will spend the entire presidency hunting down anyone that's been involved in the prosecutions against Trump.

The current government were afraid of what would happen if they just went for the kill. They were afraid that by not doing everything by the book, to the smallest detail, coming off as completely impartial, it would spark a trend where every new government starts persecuting the last one. But, in the end, that's exactly what happened anyway. Trump and MAGA have been crystal clear from the start that any investigation - the mere *idea of investigations* - would be seen as a weaponized DOJ being used as a partisan witch hunt.This adds to the long, long list of instances where democrats have been obsessed with decorum.

I believe it is (a), but it is often messaged as (b) - especially by supporters of the Democratic party.  And that messaging is often subtle, such as the comment I'm responding to.I agree with the OP that if the leaders of the Democratic party did the bare minimum to support men and distance themselves from the male-bashing, they could easily sway 5%-10% of men (especially young men) who weren't enthusiastic about Trump, but were offered nothing by the Democrats.In my opinion, Dems already have a bit of a monopoly on the \\"bigotry is bad\\" message.  All they need to do is to expand that and say, out loud, \\"bigotry is bad, and that includes bigotry against men\\".  Like just add that to the party platform and mention it occasionally.And then have the party leaders just kind of live that.  Start telling people that if they treat men differently than women because of his gender, that's bigotry, and that's wrong.  That if you wait for the next elevator because you fear sharing one with a man (but not a woman), that's bigotry, and that's wrong.

Only problem is, it could be considered a import tariff by the WTO since every non-top tax bracket of the income tax would be effectively subsidizing domestic production as it would be a lower rate than the DBCFT.I think it's worth trying to set/change WTO rules to allow DBCFT at the same rate as the top bracket of an income tax as long as the non-top bracket of an income tax doesn't subsidize domestic production too much.

But that figure is only about 20% of the nation's farm workers, according to the USDA. Many farmers say they cannot afford the visa's wage and housing requirements. Others have year-round labor needs that rule out the seasonal visas.Luckily for the farmers, the current Trump administration is not likely to make widespread enforcement of food industry a high priority given the necessity of a food supply that's already going to be straining under [Trumps tariff plan.](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/trump-tariffs-food-imports-grocery-prices/732675/) Instead, they'll probably target a few business here and there as they did during the last administration.Still, one can dream that these farmers get a taste of the FO stage of FAFO after months of supporting the criminalization of the very workers that they hire and rely on to keep their farms afloat.","title":"California farmers were big Trump backers.

If theyre complaining about gas prices or seeing too many gay people on TV despite being totally fine with it, they probably still fall into this camp.Now if theyre going off into a different planet with crackpot conspiracy theories, theres a good chance theyre a part of the QAnon cult (which genuinely believes there are thousands of people involved in a satanic cannibalistic cabal that controls an international child sex trafficking ring, and who will all imminently be arrested and executed by Trump on a day called The Storm). This cult has gripped possibly as many as 1 in 4 Americans so a lot of the legitimately insane Trump voters who show near-godlike reverence towards him are in this group.","title":"Two-thirds of Americans think Trump tariffs will lead to higher prices, poll says"},{"text":"Both Democrats and Republicans serve the capital class not the common stock.

Specifically I feel this is going to be an \\"attack\\" on not just the \\"no child left behind\\" rhetoric of most public schools, but also holding the teachers accountable for their performance. Ultimately this will also go into not just public schools, but also take a jab at colleges that provide little to no substance in terms of degrees and tack on unnecessary classes for degrees.On overhaul on education would make the jobs out there like construction, manufacturing, stem related, and yes, the jobs most people see as \\"deplorable\\" actually get more interest. Which honestly I still do not comprehend why people see them as deplorable as many jobs in those fields are paying record highs due to lack of workers and at minimum only a high school diploma is needed and most of the companies pay for additional schooling for short classes that last at a minimum a few months and up to 2 years. After that pay is 75-125k in most cases. The current model focuses on kids going to college for degrees they're statistically likely to never use, but they're still responsible for that debt incurred. Yes, 4 years is hardly enough time to end this malicious cycle of colleges scamming young adults for worthless pieces of paper, but a lot can be done to fix the broken education system we have currently at the root of it by overhauling everything and cutting the wasteful spending and bad teachers that focus more on gender and critical race theory instead of math, history, and other subjects that sadly most young adults today have limited knowledge on.","title":"thoughts?"},{"text":"Trade balance is a simple economic measurement.  \\nExports - imports = trade balanceAn improvement in our favor means that there is an increase in exports greater than an increase in our imports.

Language differs from place to place but there was a King at the top, dukes below, subsequently counts, lords, barons, and peasants (with the church being a different structure in parallel). There was a separation of power all along the chain as well, for example Lord A owes allegiance to Duke A, not Duke B.The currently emerging scenario isnt like this. Theres a small group of rich assholes in power doling out favours which is more similar to the Gilded Age in US politics.Tech feudalism could still happen if companies start running their own towns and pretty much turning the citizens of said town into their subjects essentially, but I dont see that happening because then companies would have to provide more benefits and itd probably cost more than the current set up where they avoid as much taxes as possible and have the people fund it themselves through their taxes, while services decline as inflation is ever going up but funding seems to remain static.None of this is very encouraging but my basic thought is that theres certain levels of exploitation and violence which are possible and other sorts that are not. It remains to be seen if the current system survives this presidency but history says the US has survived worse than Trump (off the top of my head, I think you had like 3 decent presidents in the 1800s?).

Before Trump begins implementing tariffs carte blanche against countries, hes going to use the threat of tariffs to put pressure on those countries. The goal is force countries where we have serious trade imbalances to resolve said imbalances and deficits. Whether that is by renegotiating awfully one sided trade agreements, forcing other countries to reduce their tariffs against us, coercing those countries to pledge an increase of imports from the US, or coercing them into moving some operations on US soil. Now the only other scenario where tariffs will be used as coercion will be with Mexico to force them to get migrant caravans in check. Right now they know the caravans come through their country, they know cartels are smuggling people, and they turn a blind eye to it because its not their problem. They just allow them to pass through their country with impunity because they are on the way here. Trump is telling them, either you crack down on that and help us here, or the hammer is dropping. Its all leverage, the art of the deal type stuff. Anyone who says, Tariffs are a tax on the consumer, dont run the full exercise. Universal tariffs likely would be since now all imports would cost X% more to bring in country. But what people neglect is when tariffs hurt economies of other countries, they look to circumvent those tariffs. The easiest way to do that is to stand up operations inside the country so they still receive the business but dont have to pay the import tax. Think what Japan did building multiple Toyota factories in the US. US labor is not much more expensive than Japanese labor, so that leads to a negligible increase in product price, and promotes job growth in the country.","title":"thoughts?"},{"text":"They should just allow the Republicans to run amok for the next four years thereby assuring they'll create such an economic catastrophe they won't win again for 50 years.","title":"Mary Trump urges Democrats to \\"fight back\\" against GOP's total control"},{"text":"Just another page from some low level mob boss playbook.

Controversially, the President has also approved the transfer of non-persistent anti-personnel mines.Elsewhere, Biden has used the CHIPS Act of 2022 to give $6.6bn to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to build microchip factories in Phoenix, Arizona, and reduce Americas reliance on imported semiconductors. The Department of Transportation has authorised $3.4bn in grants for passenger rail, road safety and port expansion projects.As Inauguration Day draws nearer, this burst of activity will continue. The United States Senate, currently controlled 51-49 by the Democrats, will attempt to confirm the nominations of as many federal judges as possible, to see them safely ensconced on the bench before Trump takes the oath of office.Civil liberties group the ACLU has also urged Biden to halt any expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, commute the sentences of prisoners on death row to life imprisonment and consider some 8,000 petitions for clemency from other prisoners.There is a limit, however, to how far Biden can make any changes irreversible. Trump, just as in January 2017, is likely to arrive in the Oval Office primed to issue a blizzard of executive orders under Article Two of the US Constitution, to carry out as much policy without congressional approval or legislation as possible. But all of this activity raises a more profound issue.No one seriously contests the validity of the outcome of this months presidential election. A small margin in the popular vote was magnified by the quirks of the Electoral College, but Trump defeated Vice-President Kamala Harris clearly if not emphatically. Like it or not, he will be a legitimate president and he has never hidden his intentions from the voters. So it is possible to understand, at least, the unhappy accusations of some Republicans that Biden is engaged in last-gasp sabotage.There is still a significant section of the Democratic Party that believes Harris should have won the election, that because of her obvious virtue she deserved victory. For them, no popular mandate can redeem Trumps monstrousness.And it is because of this revulsion that, in practical terms, all of this Trump-proofing will prove self-defeating. President Trump 2.0 is a fact of life. If the Democrats are to have any hope of a speedy recovery and a realistic chance of recapturing the White House in 2028, they will first have to understand and analyse the reasons they lost unexpectedly in 2024. Frantically trying to cement parts of Bidens agenda will not change the fact that America decided C however marginally C to reject both it and his Vice-President. However painful it may be, they will have to come to terms with the adage that democracy is never wrong.Read more here: [https://inews.co.uk/opinion/bidens-efforts-to-trump-proof-america-are-desperate-and-self-defeating-3399515](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/bidens-efforts-to-trump-proof-america-are-desperate-and-self-defeating-3399515)","title":"Bidens efforts to Trump-proof America are desperate and self-defeating"},{"text":"Bro, you can't even make your car payment on time and you want to discuss the economy!?","title":"Trump says he will impose new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on first day"},{"text":"Eliot Wilson writes:Joe Biden still has nearly eight weeks left of his presidency before Donald Trump is sworn in for a second time. This transition period between presidents can feel alien to British observers: we are used to a new prime minister walking triumphantly up Downing Street the morning after a general election, ready to take possession of No 10 and begin appointing ministers.For the incoming president, the transition period is increasingly seen as a critical time for preparation, ensuring that the new administration is already at full speed come January. For the outgoing president, the transition inevitably has a very different atmosphere.Only two men C Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump himself C have left the White House and then returned after an interval, so a departing chief executive is usually all but certain that his political career is over. Biden is 82 years old, but Bill Clinton was only 54 and Theodore Roosevelt 50. This transition period is often thought of as the lame duck period, when a president is, to use Norman Lamonts phrase, in office but not in power.President Biden has not entirely conformed to stereotype. Despite his age and the fact that he abruptly stepped aside from his partys nomination in July because of seeming cognitive decline, there has been a sudden crackle of electricity. The popular perception is that the re-election of Donald Trump has been so shocking and offensive to the Democratic Party that Biden has suddenly resolved not to go gentle into that good night.Instead, he has set about Trump-proofing his political legacy. Trump has made no secret of the changes he would like to make, which has allowed Biden to identify areas where he can achieve most in the remaining few weeks.","title":"Bidens efforts to Trump-proof America are desperate and self-defeating"},{"text":"Because he lets them openly hate other Americans.","title":"Two-thirds of Americans think Trump tariffs will lead to higher prices, poll says"},{"text":"The DOJ has a long-standing policy that cases are dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated, to stop presidents being hindered by legal cases.

When a small group amasses a disproportionate share of wealth, it can undermine economic mobility by limiting access to quality education, healthcare, and opportunities for the majority. This concentration of wealth often translates into outsized political influence, enabling the affluent to shape policies in their favorsuch as tax loopholes, deregulation, and diminished support for social programswhich can exacerbate inequality and erode democratic principles.Moreover, wealth inequality can stifle overall economic growth. When the purchasing power of the middle and lower classes diminishes, consumer spendingan engine of economic activityslows down, potentially leading to recessions or sluggish economies. High levels of inequality are also linked to social unrest, increased crime rates, and lower levels of trust in institutions. These factors collectively contribute to a weaker society where the majority faces stagnating wages and rising living costs, making it harder to achieve financial stability or upward mobility. Therefore, while a billionaire doubling their wealth might not directly take money from your pocket, the systemic effects of such disparities can materially and adversely impact the broader populations well-being.","title":"CMV: money in politics will lead to a new age techno-feudalism in the US"},{"text":"These nazis sure do love their camps.","title":"Trump opens up a new war on public schools: MAGA leaders promise an \\"educational insurgency\\" to create \\"boot camps for winning back America\\""},{"text":"Why is this a thing?

If its the former, I disagree pretty strongly if the latter, then at-least I understand the line of thinking.  Since the ultra wealthy increasingly control our politicians and control our mediaThey always did since the very founding of the Republic, wealthy Americans have established and supported media outlets that supported their own political agendas. You can even see this today in the digital content space, look at the earnings of explicitly right-wing content creators and companies vs their left-wing counterparts its not even close. there is no reason to assume that the hyper-concentration of wealth and power to elites will reverse. History begs to differ. The most dangerous group to any government is not, as many assume, a starving mob of peasants instead it is a discontented and angry middle class watching their material conditions deteriorate. This one of the reasons why Kamala lost the Biden Administration wasnt able to tackle issues like price inflation, unaffordable housing, and stagnant wages. People who said the economy was their most important issue voted for Trump by about 70-30. If these sale issues arent addressed under a Trump admin, you will see the pendulum swing back in 2026/2028.

It will harm American consumers, manufacturers, and retail businesses. This leads to a decline in material conditions for all of the people that will be impacted by higher prices. Higher prices that do not equate to higher profits for corporations or business meaning its not just the working and middle classes that will be impacted.

The public grew food, made goods, provided services, and staffed militaries, creating a mutual dependence. Without this broad support, the elite risked collapse or rebellion, giving the public leverage in the social order. When that balance was pushed too far, revolutions eruptedAmerica itself was founded on rebellion against exploitation.**The issue in our present time, the \\"new phenomenon\\", is that balance is disappearing more than ever.** Automation and artificial intelligence are rapidly replacing human labor in industries ranging from manufacturing to customer service. Machines dont need wages, benefits, or breaks, making them far more profitable than people. At the same time, advanced surveillance tools allow those in power to monitor and control populations without fear of resistance. Even law enforcement is becoming automated, removing the human element that once allowed for dissent or reform.Some argue that the wealthy still need the public as consumers, but this dependence is fading. Automation and monopolization enable the elite to profit from smaller, wealthier markets, bypassing the broader population. High-end luxury markets and subscription-based models thrive, while affordable goods and services shrink. With enough automation, even this limited reliance could vanish. Advanced AI and robotics could allow the wealthy to create self-sustaining systems, producing goods and services exclusively for themselves, cutting the majority out of both work and consumption.The result? The public is no longer a foundation of power but an inconvenience to be managed. Wages stagnate, jobs vanish, and public needs like housing and healthcare are deprioritized.

We grow weaker over time, and the elites grow stronger every passing day.How do we grow weaker over time? I see this kind of rhetoric a lot with people who do not understand finances and it's an education problem. A billionaire making an extra billion this year does not take anything away from you. It's not a big pie where someone increasing in net worth means someone else lost it. That's not how modern economies work and misunderstanding that basic principle means you likely misunderstand all sorts of different systems.How are you materially affected by a billionaire doubling his wealth in 2024? What happens to your pay or compensation, your property taxes, or anything like that? If you can't draw a clear, substantiated line to your personal situation being affected, then making the claim that you are now worse off is not correct. It cannot be substantiated with the claims that you have made. In fact, barring some major catastrophe that shakes things up, it can be expected that the US economy will end up resembling a new age techno feudalism- where we own nothing and are beholden to an elite class, who will wield such control over our laws that they may as well be a monarchy.There's no evidence for that. This idea is fear-mongered every day in this subreddit. Politicians have no incentive to remove money from politics, because it financially benefits them to maintain the status quo. The US population is akin to rats on a sinking ship, unable to affect the outcome, and unable to save ourselves on an individual level.Run of the mill doomerism is already rampant online. Please don't contribute to that miasma. Look at evidence to determine your ideas, not feelings you've manifested based on reading doomerism.","title":"CMV: money in politics will lead to a new age techno-feudalism in the US"},{"text":"Blame Garland","title":"Jack Smith Has Made a Grave Mistake Letting Trump Off the Hook | \\nWhat became of the principle that no person is above the law, not even a former president?"},{"text":"Youre wrong.

This time, he simply needs someone who will stand aside as an army of far-right Christians, emboldened by the rise of groups like Moms for Liberty, take the lead in attacking the very foundations of free, secular education. \\n \\n Christian nationalists aren't even waiting for Trump to be sworn in for a second time before they make their move. Pete Hegseth, the Fox News host who Trump tapped to be Defense Secretary, was on a Christian nationalist podcast last week that described the vision. \\"I think we need to be thinking in terms of these classical Christian schools are boot camps for winning back America,\\" explained the host, who is closely linked with Douglas Wilson, a far-right pastor who advocates for theocracy.

Taxes is the big one. They dont pay their 'fair share' and it places stresses on local government services which become quickly underfunded for the population; additional stress on housing, public transport and infrastructure. This is without including detention centres, deportation and the justice system trying to pick up the slack. Further to this some states even pay welfare to illegal immigrants. Its easy to see hidden costs quickly add up.But doesn't the US need the cheap immigrant labour? No, what you need is costs to accurately reflect their inputs and everyone to pay their fair share (unlikely in the US I know). Prices will adjust and the market will take a shock as real input labour prices adjust. Industries relying on black market labour will be heavily audited once Trump gets in office and I think many family farms and construction companies will go under due to these changes. It will depend on the domestic producer policies they initiate in conjunction with the deportation policy.I think Trump is moving to a immigration policy more similar to Australia's. The only people who come in are skilled labourers in demand or seasonal workers who are only here for the work season, mainly picking fruit, then they go home. We do accept political refugees but they must be legitimate and enter through the system. No one just gets in.Tariffs will increase costs from other countries, part of Trumps plan to rebuild domestic supply chains, infrastructure and bring jobs back home.

The best they could offer was the guy who looks at his daughter and \\"does it for her.\\" A noble gesture, sure, but it's also tells men \\"yeah sorry pal, we've got nothing for you.\\" The ads where the two wives wink and nod while voting Dem also goes with the \\"nobody has to know\\" theme, implying their evil, Republican husbands would beat them if they found out. Just awful messaging.But back my main point, to successfully win male voters, their efforts would need to outweigh any perceived (rightly or wrongly) anti-male/pro-female platform. This risks alienating or discouraging the least engaged, who really need to be fired up and motivated. And also some of the most staunchly engaged, who would see any inch given as a betrayal and abandonment - as already demonstrated somewhat in the comments. They could cut down the rhetoric - which would result in capturing less of the female vote. Or they could push policies that benefited men  - which would then be perceived as anti-women and also capture less of the female vote.It may be true that a legitimate effort to woo male voters would not necessarily require a great sacrifice in terms of policy or political position. The sacrifice would come in the form of votes they fail to capture from their most dependable base - votes lost, which would far outweigh any votes gained.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"See what i mean?

Our norms-based, rather than law-based system of oversight and behavioral guidance is useless in the face of anyone brave enough to subvert them. Our lack of enforcement mechanisms for many laws actually on the books has been a disaster. Our much-vaunted checks-and-balances do neither, as a takeover of two or more of the branches means that the executive can do whatever it wants. Our constitution, disputed and creaky from the start, has proven woefully inadequate in today's world, showing that a quarter-millenium old document cannot be relied on to protect us.Now that it's been shown that not only can some politicians commit the most heinous crimes with impunity, but that they can also get back in to power and exact retribution on the very people and institutions that attempted to obtain justice. It's sick and everyone has to know it by now.The writing has been on the wall, and will remain the wall until something radical changes. The chances of us reforming our way out of this now (e.g., with a constitutional convention and new enforcement powers) are nil. A break from the past is not only necessary, it'll be the only way to have a system that isn't the catastrophe that ours has come to be.

The first is putting a lot of emphasis on the abortion issue. If men can't get abortions, then their interest in it is philosophical or academic, not a \\"bread-and-butter\\" issue. The other was the emphasis on celebrities. Unless maybe they're major sports figures, men just don't care who Oprah, Taylor Swift, Beyonce or George Clooney are voting for. And frankly, the few ads I saw that tried to get across the point that men \\"just like you\\" were Harris supporters never came off as genuine.And, frankly, a lot of men didn't connect with her, and didn't like her.

The motivating factor appears to be women becoming more left wing rather than men become more right wing, to the point where women make left wing parties unappealing to men.[https://www.axios.com/2024/02/16/gen-z-gender-gap-political-left-women](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/16/gen-z-gender-gap-political-left-women)[https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-male-dominated-gender-balance-equality-stalls-right-wing-decline/](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-male-dominated-gender-balance-equality-stalls-right-wing-decline/)Lots of reasons as to why. Personally I think this is because the left wing personifies feminine values more - harm avoidance, care for the marginalised and vulnerable, not much of a risk appetite, whereas the right wing personifies male values more - merit over equality, self-responsibility rather than relying on others, and greater appetite for risk.However, it's also been pointed out the current gender split was reversed until quite recently - women were more conservative than men - and what's causing this change might simply be due to the fact that women are more socially influenceable than men, particularly at places like colleges, and have become left wing because of this. Basically, women tend to uphold whatever status quo is around them, men to be more stubborn. And currently in colleges and corporate culture, the slant is left.[https://theconversation.com/women-used-to-be-more-likely-to-vote-conservative-than-men-but-that-all-changed-in-2017-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-214019](https://theconversation.com/women-used-to-be-more-likely-to-vote-conservative-than-men-but-that-all-changed-in-2017-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-214019)You say 'a mere lip-service towards men' should be enough to address men's concerns and counterbalance  republican arguments. However, as you point out, when the Harris campaign became aware it had a 'man problem' it already tried to address this issue with 'mere lip-service' and it didn't work. Although Harris didn't make any explicit sexist arguments, the entire Democratic party still represents left wing values which men find unappealing.The question you should ask yourself is whether you think right wing parties could persuade more women to vote for them by mere lip-service? Because if the answer is no, then I don't see why you would expect it to work the other way around. The only way it will change is for more men to become involved in the left, but for that to work the left would have to change, which I'm not sure its willing to do.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"If we could resurrect Lee Harvey Oswald and have him reassign Adam Schiff, George Soros, Chuck Schumer, and all of those pesky Russians that Hillary Clinton keeps blaming everything on, I don't see why not!","title":"Could John F.

The revolution-talk and progress-talk are two different flavours of rhetoric for middle/upper middle class-types who sense opportunities for social-climbing.

But I think a much better analog can be found in the Shu'ubiyya movement from Persia: downwardly mobile, middle-men of all shapes and sizes who feel the powers that be don't treat them with the respect they're owed. These people are less interested in seriously overthrowing or reforming the Empire, and more interested in getting a seat at the table. Just as the Persians had ruthlessly criticized the Arabs, calling them chauvinistic, slaving colonizers, who contrive their religion to maintain social control, so too do people do the same to whites today. Hence, the Left is Neo-Shu'ubist and not Neo-Marxist. And just as the Shu'ubites could never give up the rhetorical device of the despoiling, looter Arab, so too can the Neo-Shu'ubites never give up the rhetorical device of the oppressive white.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Scotus killed that idea.","title":"Jack Smith Has Made a Grave Mistake Letting Trump Off the Hook | \\nWhat became of the principle that no person is above the law, not even a former president?"},{"text":"It sucks bc as a country we are saying that was ok and it will happen again and be worse next time","title":"Trumps evasion of January 6 accountability will echo for next four years and generations to come"},{"text":"The reason that white men (because it's white men we're talking about here) favour conservatism is that progressives target the patriarchy and white privilege and white men are threatened by that; they have power, they don't want to lose it.

Education outcomes of boys. Body autonomy for boysAre any of these significant voting issues in any way shape or form? The problem with 'you need to appeal to men' argument is that it's a dog whistle, there are no actual men's issues that are effecting voting habits. The reason that white men (because it's white men we're talking about here) favour conservatism is that progressives target the patriarchy and white privilege and white men are threatened by that; they have power, they don't want to lose it.   \\nThis is a problem for progressive parties to solve but adding men's issues to your platform can't solve it because that's not what white men are worried about. Progressive parties need to convince white men to sharing their privilege is OK and that's nigh on impossible without long term social change.   The truth is that 'men's issues' aren't, and shouldn't be, part of progressive strategy, partly because it goes directly against their ideology (promoting equality) but also because for every vote you gain by defending white male privilege you lose elsewhere from women and minorities.   The actual strategy to pursue is wealth disparity. A large proportion of conservative voters are working class men who currently vote against their interests because of populist causes like immigration and nationalism. If they can be convinced to vote for progressive policies that will increase their wages and job security then progressives could clean up but, currently these voters believe that conservatism is what helps them.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"I've seen multiple women on Instagram, wealthy white women who have never worked a day in their lives generally, calling Trump King or saying the king has returned.","title":"Schiff on possible Trump retribution: Thats dictator talk"},{"text":"I heard of one example,  how other countries places tariffs on American made cars, while keeping their native cars cheaper.

The issue is that there is inertia in politics, cultural mood and memes. The Dems had branded themselves since the late Obama years as the vanguard of progressive cultural issues. And on many issues, probably for good. However, as with all movements within weak institutions, the extremes blossom. The \\"quaint\\" idea of legal gay marriage from Obama's second presidency turned into far more radical expression in 2020 and onwards. My point here is that there was no single leader who decides, no committee of grey beards who vote on what should be championed. The closest we get are the primary voters, who skew to the extremes for both Dems and GOP.So when the Harris campaign a few months prior to the election began signalling its changing priorities, any voter can reasonably wonder if that change is genuine, considering the years prior.My point therefore is that making the kind of change you outline takes far more effort. There is no central committee. Rather, donors, primary voters, interest groups, and left-leaning cultural institutions have to change somewhat for some duration to be credible. Will they? Perhaps, but it wouldn't be without sacrifice. None of the above is an argument for or against the change you outline. My only point is that in decentralized or weak institutions, coordinated change is hard, especially when years of growing interest groups have attached to one party over the other. Of course, a major electoral loss tends to be a galvanizing moment for change.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"If killing 500  North Korean soldiers  with the missiles is an act of escalating,, then wait until they come for you.","title":"Biden isnt escalating the war in Ukraine  hes doing the right thing"},{"text":"How exactly would it harm women and minorities if you admit that men can be discriminated against for their gender?","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Republicans have captured all the media channels.

It is based on one year's number of marriages and the same year's number of divorces. This says nothing about the amount of marriages that end in divorce. In reality if we wanted an accurate divorce rate statistic we should monitor all marriages, but that would leave one large sum of numbers. Even if we go by the aforementioned statistic, the rate is declining.Now, personally, I am 30 and married, whether you would class that as young is up to you. I do agree that sometimes you do see people with a Disneyfied outlook on marriage, but you also do see many apocalyptic prophets.Why do it when living together works just fine? Well, this is a Danish case, as that is where I am from. If you have children and are unmarried, in the case one part dies, the children inherit everything, including life insurance (unless you make a will of course). This can potentially mean that you will have to move because you cannot afford to stay put. If you are married the widow automatically inherits (unless you make a will of course).My father, who is in his second marriage, once told me: \\"If you have children together, you might as well get married, as that is a much bigger commitment.\\"\\nOverall yes, divorce is a risk, but there is not a 50 % chance of your individual marriage ending in divorce.

My fianc and I plan to get married in a nice courthouse wedding with just us two, go on some nice dates, and then leave for our honeymoon in the evening. My ring costs about $30.Marriage is also what you make of it. I love him very much and wanted to marry him as a sign of commitment and because I think its really sweet.If youre feeling strongs societal pressures over marriage, you may be talking to the wrong people. In my opinion, whatever you and your partner decide on is whats best. Marriage and weddings are literally just a celebrarion and declaration of your love, and you can celebrate it however you please.I understand why your partner wants marriage. It shows commitment and that you want to declare and celebrate your love, as described above. If your partner doesnt want to get married, it can come off that they dont want to do those things with you, which can be soul crushing. Its like they only want to go so far with you in the relationship.?\\nI am also concerned that you think people cannot be trusted by nature. Ive come to realize that trusting my partner is necessary to feel secure in the relationship and for us to get the most out of it. One recent example is that my partner and I intend to keep separate finances and jointly save for goals such as vacations and a house. I was worrying over this because what happens if I save for my portion of a vacation, and he gets lazy or financially irresponsible and doesnt save his share? But Ive come to realize that, this isnt my partner at all. He is mindful of his money and I know he values being financially responsible and independent. Knowing that, I know its on me to trust him to prioritize saving the money. Sure, if he loses his job, I can cover his expenses for a while until he gets back in his feet, but I also trust him so that if I lose my job, he will take care of me at well, and we will both prioritize getting another job and back on our feet. This level of trust is my ultimate goal to feel truly loved and secure in a relationship, and I feel so lucky to have met someone I can trust to this level.Sure, anything can happen. Ultimately, you dont control your partner and they can make choices that hurt you and the relationship. But in my experience, this sort of thinking does no good. It brings in doubt and can make you scared to commit. By the time you reach marriage, I gooe youve known your partner long and deeply enough to understand their values and that they are trustworthy and align with yours. The last little bit of trust relies on you to say, I trust you to always be there for me and I want to be wirh you for life. Think of traditional wedding vows: for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, to love and to hold. Other wedding vows might include commitments to strive to build a home together. Its literally vowing to do these things for each other in you life and trusting your partner to do the same, and it can be very sweet.","title":"cmv: Marriage is trapping and suffocating"},{"text":"54% of American adults between the ages of 16 and 74 read below a sixth-grade level","title":"Majority of voters (59%) approve of Trump transition, (CBS) poll finds"},{"text":"I agree with most of what youre saying.

Which is a huge issue that shouldve been addressed long ago - and to be fair, Bernie Sanders achieved a lot with his platform to make the issue better.

A lot of shit he got done although Congress blocked him again and again, the ball moved in the right direction. Not on all issues, but on big issues nonetheless. By not supporting democrats, who are the only party who actually are the home of social democrats / socialists who really work to make it better, these people also lost power.On the other side, there are the republicans who day in and day out make everything worse. While democrats are the object of political pressure and hatred if they dont follow up on every single issue, they just lose support - although not living in a perfect system, the one party who actually does care and has people who care in it has to be perfect. Republicans just dont. They are supported no matter how vile, unproductive and chaotic they get. Its insanity.Additionally, its just not how any of this shit works. Why did Harris got Cheney to campaign for her? Because centrists supported the Democratic Party, while a huge group of leftists just gave up their influence because they rather moped around for various reasons. To remove oneself from influence is the absolute wrong way to go about things. instead of making the strongest case for the own movement so they have sway over the campaign.

How could this happen?The need for a Constitutional Amendment that clearly states ineligibility to run for or hold ANY public office after having been convicted of a felony is obviously long overdue.Where is our moral compass? Trust in our government and its institutions? How can we expect our citizens to respect and follow the rule of law when our countrys (supposed) leader balks at answering for his crimes and is ultimately allowed to laugh in the face of justice and have his felonious behavior excused? Are we to believe that the other world leaders will respect this person? Respect his (supposed) leadership? Believe in his ability to be diplomatic? Have faith that he will live and lead by example? Our president should be a reflection of our people, our values, our vision for the future of our country and our ability to set an example for other nations to follow. They should be honest, compassionate, driven to duty, and many other things our president elect lacks.Accountability cant just be something you talk about, its something that must be upheld, without consideration for bias. Isnt this ideal the bedrock of justice?? If we want the kind of people that we can trust to run our government, we MUST hold our elected officials accountable, at all costs. If they lie, cheat, steal and recklessly deceive, they should be punished. No one in this country should be above the law, INCLUDING the President of the United States.

When has India had a willingness to disregard the sovereignty of other nations? And for India, India has little history of the Government of India performing patent theft or Espionage. The Government of India does have  native technologies &amp; native production capabilities in Computers &amp; Microchip production for Government sectors such as Defense, Space and Nuclear Energy. Which has been done since the sanctions the US put on India in the 1990s so the Government of India has prepared in case the US decides to isolate them again. India does have modern tech, and India has domestic production capabilities of all products except for historically semiconductors in the private sector. But the semiconductor capabilities and production in India are in the public sector.  When has India or anyone in the Government said that their rightful place in the world has been denied ? At best India felt like they should be a country with an Independent Foreign policy and not be involved within the USs bloc. Especially considering the US used to have Pakistan part of its bloc until the 2010s as part of its bloc, as the US had the US military &amp; US military bases in Pakistan all the way from the 1950s and 2010s. In fact much of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan was funded through Pakistan which led to the war on terror by the US.  This sounds like a myth developed for no random reason and false equivalence. And for Taiwan, Taiwan and India do not have any negative relations. And I dont think India would come to defense due to not wanting a regional war with China, a country they border, and potentially lose territory. So portraying India as some anti-Taiwan country is a bit dishonest. India is more equivalent to being in the bloc of independent developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia &amp; Ethiopia than it is to China or Russia.","title":"Apple ramping up India manufacturing expansion to avoid Trump tariffs on China"},{"text":"Press 1 to self deport!","title":"The Trump Effect: Haitian Migrants Self-Deport from Springfield, Ohio"},{"text":"Obama is 63.","title":"Biden gets blame from voters for Democratic losses against Trump, Republicans"},{"text":"So he wanted alex jones secretary of press and joe rogan asking the questions??

This is obvious so I wont explain it further2. Lets say she tells him shes pregnant, and he bails. Hes made it clear that he doesnt care about her or the baby, so why should it be his right to know that she had to have an abortion?3. The partner is very against abortion, but the wife has an ectopic pregnancy and will have severe consequences if she doesnt abort. He says he doesnt care and that she should carry it to term and the relationship will end if she does the abortion. They are in love but this has always been a topic they disagree on. She decides to get the abortion and tells him she had a miscarriage. They have second baby with no issues afterwards and a long and happy marriage. Baby would have died anyways, why does the woman have to because the partner is an idiot on this one issue?4. Guy was a one night stand, moved on to several other women in the time it took her to find out she was pregnant. They see each other at Starbucks and he doesnt even remember her. Why does she need to tell him anything?5. Woman does some digging on her man, turns out he has a criminal record she didnt know about. He seems normal but what other secrets does he have? She decides to get an abortion without telling him and leaves shortly afterwards when he denies having the record6. Man rapes a woman after viciously beating her, goes to jail and shes traumatized for life. Gets pregnant and immediately has an abortion. Never tells the man and hopes to never see him ever again\\nProbably countless other examples. Your viewpoint seems contingent on the guy not being a piece of shit. Many guys are pieces of shit.

OP, you're predetermining what are favorable parameters for when a person must disclose they've had an abortion. But you leave out one glaring issue -  there's just not one specific reason to disclose or not to disclose. It's entirely particular to the situation that an individual is in. And men, complicate things. Always. Either for better or worse. If a person wants to abort and they disclose before they go through with it, they run the risk of being talked out of it or even losing their autonomy in the decision  altogether. That's just not what someone who, by themselves, can determine what's right for themselves wants to subject themselves to, because emotions cloud judgement. Women, especially understand this. There are so many well-meaning men out there who would say the \\"right\\" thing but not the \\"real\\" thing. It's easy to get swept up in the optimism of a partner who is just as scared about his future and has no idea how they're going to make this work. So we determine for ourselves if the partner will be told and/if when based entirely on how we measure their demeanor and capacity for information of this caliber. If you're capable of handling it, you should be told, yes. But again, there's much protection that a partner offers in choosing not to disclose. It's really up to the situation and the players.

That would answer almost all your questions, and until everyone wakes up and goes against these people then no true justice will ever occur. But unfortunately human psychology is easily manipulated and most are too stupid or sheepish to go against the ruling class.There are failsafes in place too, for example in the UK they started arresting citizens for \\"wrong think\\" and inciting violence for protesting against the mass immigration that led to the stabbing murder of 3 kids in Southport. While letting any Muslim protestors off free despite some of them carrying weapons. They want to demoralise and beat you into submission of whatever they want, and will make examples of anyone brave enough to stand up as a result.For Trump, there are enough people that believe that hes not part of this ruling class to vote him into presidency - including a large percentage of women.

I'm very inclined to believe the Secret Service was given orders to stand down and give that kid a clear shot at Trump, I mean he had to turn at the exact right moment to not have his head blown off, that is not indicative of a staged attempt, Trump would never agree to that and he was clearly suffering from Trauma in the days after, even mentioning God and divine intervention.As for the \\"what is a woman\\" question, it may not be important to you but it encapsulates how far gone the Democrats are from a social policy standpoint.

The prosecutor even resigned in the case. So that Case is a dud. https://daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay?newsID=1247748 Also what does mean by Anti-Western trends? If were talking about the BJP &amp; Modi, they dont have a different foreign policy compared to Congress. And the Congress Party is not like theyre anti-Russia lmao. Rahul Gandhi himself actually SUPPORTS the Modi government on Russia &amp; doesnt want to encourage any aid to Ukraine. https://youtu.be/hehnvhOlYkk?si=d9GkMHuyYIc57W-F https://youtu.be/z53oHkc9SPo?si=OshrBufdfwDdO_XA\\nUnless you think Rahul Gandhi AND Narendra Modi are autocrats, then you basically lost the Indian Left or Indian Right in foreign policy lol. There is ZERO staunch pro-US parties in India, the same way there are ZERO staunch pro-China parties in India. (Well except for Maoist parties, but theyre criminal gangs which are banned and the government of India has mainly successfully defeated during the Naxal crackdown in India from increased funding for police by the Government of India.) India doesnt support Russia because of Putin or Russias domestic politics. But more or so the US preferring Pakistan and having better relations with Pakistan since 1950s to the 2010s. This isnt propaganda, but more or so anti-western sentiments due to real history. US was helping Pakistan, and even had US military bases and American soldiers occupy in Pakistan all the way until the late 2010s. A lot of the Mujahideen and insurgency in Afghanistan was propped through the US and Pakistan during that period. India has every right to distrust the US if the US had an unfavorable policy to India until the 2010s. Now Pakistan is seen as a Chinese territory or Chinese vassal state with PLA soldiers occupying Pakistan and using Pakistan as a Chinese military base, so theres a lot less for the US to support Pakistan now. Also where did you get India being pro-US in the populaces views until 2002? India faced Sanctions from the US &amp; US bloc during the Kargil War Siachen Conflict India was fighting. The only pro-US country that didnt sanction India was Israel, who sold Arms to India during the Kargil War &amp; Siachen war in which India won. (Thanks Israel.) The Democracy Index and the Human Rights Index by V-Dem are not objective measures. The rankings are given by scores from anonymous experts, without telling how the actual score is given other than opinion on the experts. Morocco is given a higher HRI score than India, despite being an authoritarian monarchy who has more power than the PM of Morocco. The BJP is equivalent to Japans LDP than they are to Orbans party or the US Republican party. And the BJP definitely does not have the same power or undemocratic measures as Putins United Russia. And India has free and fair democratic elections, they are not undermining the electoral process like MAGA is in the US. Theres no partisan gerrymandering, massive new voter restrictions, voter registration purges, attacks on mail in ballots, or disproportional upper legislature in favor of rural areas like the US has with the Senate.If you really want India to be pro-US. Have the US be pro-India, unapologetically.

Bush on appointments to the State Department, Defense Department and other key agencies and roles. These appointments saw a long delay. At that time of the 9/11 attacks, only 57% of the top 123 Senate-confirmed positions had been filled, due to a slow Senate confirmation process and time-intensive background investigations. Prior to 9/11, while certain parts of the government were deeply concerned about the threat from al-Qaida, others considered ballistic missile defense the highest priority. As history proved, failures to effectively share critical information can lead to lapses.Heres the 9-11 report itself https://9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdfPre-election info from presidential transition website:\\nhttps://presidentialtransition.org/lessons-from-the-9-11-commission-report/Saturday marks the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, a tragedy that changed our country and the world. In 2004, a bipartisan commission investigating the attacks issued the 9/11 Commission Report, which made 41 recommendations to prevent future terrorist attacks and strengthen our national security. One of the reports most notable findings was that a delayed presidential transition in 2000 hampered the new administration in identifying, recruiting, clearing, and obtaining Senate confirmation of key appointees.Importantly, this finding revealed our countrys flawed political appointment process and showed how slow Senate confirmations can imperil our national security.

The tariff would not take effect, however, if Canada were to take concrete action in addressing the specific concerns raised by former President Trumpnamely, the need to secure the U.S.-Canada border and curb the smuggling of fentanyl-laced drugs. Such a move would allow Canada to avoid the severe economic disruption that would arise from this punitive tariff, which would have profound implications for key sectors of the Canadian economy. This creates an opportunity for Canada to act decisively, leveraging its ability to secure the border as a means of preserving trade relations with the U.S., thus safeguarding industries, jobs, and overall economic stability, while simultaneously fulfilling a critical demand to address shared security concerns.Securing the U.S.-Canada border, particularly when it comes to curbing the flow of dangerous substances like fentanyl, is not merely an external demand but an urgent priority for Canada in its own right. The opioid crisis, exacerbated by the illicit trafficking of fentanyl, has taken an enormous toll on Canadian society, contributing to a staggering number of overdose deaths and overwhelming healthcare resources. While much of the fentanyl that reaches the U.S. originates from overseas, Canada remains a conduit for these lethal drugs due to its extensive and often porous border with the United States. By enhancing border securitywhether through increased patrols, advanced surveillance technology, or improved cooperation with U.S. authoritiesCanada could take meaningful strides toward preventing fentanyl trafficking. This would, in turn, help alleviate a significant public health crisis in both countries, and demonstrate that Canada is not just responding to U.S. pressure, but also taking ownership of its role in tackling the opioid epidemic.Ultimately, the decision to act on these concerns presents Canada with the opportunity to transform a potential economic and security crisis into a long-term advantage. By taking proactive and substantial steps to secure the border, Canada would avoid the immediate negative impact of the tariff while simultaneously addressing an urgent national and international issue. Beyond the immediate benefit of avoiding economic disruption, strengthening border security would bolster Canadas sovereignty and enhance its international standing as a responsible partner in combating the spread of illicit drugs. Moreover, this collaborative approach with the U.S. would foster stronger cross-border relations, improve border infrastructure, and contribute to safer communities on both sides of the border. In essence, this is an opportunity for Canada to turn a difficult situation into a foundation for future cooperation, security, and prosperity, ensuring that both nations are better equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century.","title":"Trump ups the ante on tariffs, vowing massive taxes on goods from Mexico, Canada and China on Day 1"},{"text":"My mother watches it every day.

Its been terrible for his own health and sanity, and hes lost a lot of legitimacy. He didnt come out raving against feminism and cultural Marxism, he made points like how being a major corporations CEO is a very toxic goal to have as an individual so it was strange to use it as a measure for gender disparities. Fine discussion points, whether or not you agree.

Well, do politics.If I asked you what can the Democrats do to uplift women and craft the identity of empowered femininity, Im sure its not hard to imagine.

It is something anyone can do at any time for any reason.People can absolutely be hurt or disappointed by the decisions someone else makes regarding their own body, but at the end of the day we all have to recognize that the whatever standard of morality would apply to their actions is only worth anything because they have that ability.Telling someone that you want children (when you consciously know that you don't) in order to keep them in a relationship is wrong because it is a calculated form of control. At that point bodies are not involved and everything is still abstract, your autonomy is not conditional on keeping this person in a relationship and there isn't an actual baby inside you that is putting you in a difficult position. Instead, all you're doing in that situation is taking control of their life away from them by denying them the ability to make an informed choice.Essentially, people have the right to lie in order to protect their own autonomy. Conversely, it is wrong to try and deprive someone else of autonomy by lying to them.

It was passed in 1978 as a reaction to Nixon and it bounced around with odd extensions every couple of years. It expired in 1992 and then was reinstated for five more years in 1994 before it was ultimately allowed to die off in 1999, 25 years ago, after the Clinton debacle. It hasn't been the law of the land for most of the time that you and I have been alive.Notably the reason people had to be approved by congress for that law is that the law was passed *explicitly by congress* because they felt the US needed an independent law enforcement wing that couldn't be shitcanned by the new president if he was corrupt like Nixon. Would be nice if we'd kept that around huh?The requirement for Senate approval was *never* a thing. Archibald Cox was the special investigator for Nixon. He'd previously worked as Solicitor General under Kennedy but he held no position in the DOJ and was hired directly by Nixon's AG. Notably United States V Nixon was later brought by Cox and the court accepted that Cox's appointment was legitimate, as they have done for countless special prosecutors.So historically you're clearly wrong. But I'll humor your request.John Danforth - Installed Sept 9, 1999, roughly three months after the end of the Independent Counsel Statute in Jun 30th of that year, Danforth had been an AG of the state of Missouri in the 70's but had never been approved by the senate for any position. He was actually a sitting (outgoing) US Senator when he was selected for the WACO investigation.There are also a huge number who were not acting AG's at the time of their selection including:Archibald Cox - A former Soliciter general under Kennedy tapped to lead the Nixon investigation.Bob Fiske - Worked one term as an AG under Reagan and was appointed by Reno in 1994 during the period in which the indepentent Counsel had temporarily lapsed.And a couple others. So if your argument is: They have to be a current AG, then it is defeated by Coxe and Fiske. If you want to get very technical and go \\"Anyone approved by the senate previously can be a SC, then it is defeated by Danforth who was never a US AG.You're simply wrong, no matter how you slice it or wiggle. The position of Special Counsel has a long and storied history.","title":"CMV: Jack Smith should have insisted on being fired."},{"text":"Its bizarre that a person CONVICTED by a jury, selected by, and approved by HIS lawyers, was allowed to run for the most powerful position in the free world, with not just one, but THIRTY FOUR FELONIES!

Where is our moral compass? Trust in our government and its institutions? How can we expect our citizens to respect and follow the rule of law when our countrys (supposed) leader balks at answering for his crimes and is ultimately allowed to laugh in the face of justice and have his felonious behavior excused? Are we to believe that the other world leaders will respect this person? Respect his (supposed) leadership? Believe in his ability to be diplomatic? Have faith that he will live and lead by example? Our president should be a reflection of our people, our values, our vision for the future of our country and our ability to set an example for other nations to follow. They should be honest, compassionate, driven to duty, and many other things our president elect lacks. Accountability cant just be something you talk about, its something that must be upheld, without consideration for bias. Isnt this ideal the bedrock of justice?? If we want the kind of people that we can trust to run our government, we MUST hold our elected officials accountable, at all costs. If they lie, cheat, steal and recklessly deceive, they should be punished. No one in this country should be above the law, INCLUDING the President of the United States.

The US could remain a force to be reckoned with if it could get out of its own way; if it could recognize its own deficits and work to correct its failings, but thats too late now. Adios amigos!!!

Probably moreso than on Canada's.See Trump wants to slap tariffs on imports coming from Canada, Mexico, and China. These are literally the top 3 trade partners for the US. This means huge price hikes on almost everything in the States. US businesses couldn't produce the imported goods domestically for the cheap, which is why the US imports them in the first place. But even if they were forced to, they couldn't magically replace imported goods overnight, and the cost will still be significantly more expensive than un-tariffed imports anyways. Especially when the businesses that produce them realize they don't have to compete with cheap imports no more, and have a field day artificially inflating the prices as a result.Then you have the possibility that these countries could choose to retaliate by slapping their own tariffs on US goods.And finally, everyone is talking about layoffs happening in Canada because Canadian exports will see less demand, but they forget that importing stuff from Canada/Mexico/China requires hiring US workers who will also be laid off.

In any kind of **meaningful** way, it did not \\"reduce the chance of contracting COVID\\" based on the reality that 100% of people, vaccinated included, caught COVID, often very shortly after vaccination. In an unmeaningful way, it may have delayed your time to infection by a few weeks which has very little value, even at a population level, at that point in time when the mandate was relevant.  To ethically justify a mandate you need a *meaningful* 3rd party benefit and delaying time to infection when (a) everyone who wanted the vaccine already got it and (b) health services are not over capacity is not sufficient. The primary purpose of a vaccine is to protect people against serious clinical outcomes that we care about such as serious illness, hospitalization, and death.  Delaying time to infection unto itself is not a sufficient reason without some effect on those clinical outcomes. Pouring a cup of water in your yard while a forest fire burns around it is not a meaningful intervention even if it is measurable.  The reality is the transmissability and reduced pathogenicity of Omicron changed the calculus and the vaccine did not halt transmission in any meaningful way to a 3rd party to ethically justify mandate.No he makes statements that are supported by the evidence but are at odds with the flawed public health messaging that was unfortunately all too often not supported by evidence.","title":"Trump picks Johns Hopkins surgeon who argued against COVID lockdowns to lead FDA"},{"text":"That was just for putting black people in jail.

I addressed that in my original post. In that regard, liberals are much less tolerant of dissent.

They reported him repeatedly to the Stasi, so on his profile page when you looked him up ( again he is long gone) C he is branded with SCIENCE DENIER as a moniker for all at see.

If anything, cancel culture is something liberals tend to resort to when they don't have counterarguments.
