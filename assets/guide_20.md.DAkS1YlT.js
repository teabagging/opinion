David Scott Who gave you the right to take my picture, a--hole?' | Time To Put Another One Out To Pasture ??"},{"text":"That's not TERFish. That's pragmatic. The fact is that most Americans simply do not sympathize nearly as much with some progressive values as many here tend to believe. Here's one example:[America is becoming less woke](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/09/19/america-is-becoming-less-woke) ([non-paywall version](https://archive.ph/knWrN))Almost everywhere we looked a similar trend emerged: wokeness grew sharply in 2015, as Donald Trump appeared on the political scene, continued to spread during the subsequent efflorescence of #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, peaked in 2021-22 and has been declining ever since (see charts). The only exception is corporate wokeness, which took off only after Mr Floyds murder, but has also retreated in the past year or two.The simplest way to measure the spread of woke views is through polling. \\\\[...\\\\] Woke opinions on racial discrimination began to grow around 2015 and peaked around 2021. In the most recent Gallup \\\\[poll\\\\] 35% of people said they worried a great deal about race relations, down from a peak of 48% in 2021 \\\\[...\\\\] Polling about sexual discrimination reveals a similar pattern \\\\[...\\\\]Woke views on gender are also in decline. Pew finds that the share of people who believe someone can be a different sex from the one of their birth has fallen steadily since 2017, when it first asked the question. Opposition to trans students playing in sports teams that match their chosen gender rather than their biological sex has grown from 53% in 2022 to 61% in 2024, according to YouGov.And so on. The issue of trans rights, in particular, is not popular at all. A recent Gallup poll ranked it the least important issue for the voters, the very bottom of list. On other issues like Palestine, the public also disagrees: even though we became more critical of Israel, far more Americans are sympathetic to Israelis than Palestinians on the whole.So yeah, some ideas that are hugely popular with the far left are not at all popular with the rest of the public. Our personal views aside, the majority of Americans dislike or even downright hate some of them. Now, I'm not arguing that we should give up, embrace full-blown sexism and racism and forget about things like climate change for good, but we obviously need to address the issues most voters actually care about if we want a Democrat to win in 2028 and beyond.

All you can do is work (a) create an environment that makes fascism less enticing, this can be done through addressing the root causes, such as insecurities and lack of populisitic alternatives, and (b) work to create an environment that entices other (not fascist) voters to turn out for you.The problem is that moderates like Biden fail to understand this so they try to just not lie (as often), be \\"better than fascism\\", and somehow convince the moderate that they are totally into the same policies they are.It's a losing recipe because fascism does not care about lies or dignity in tactics, it is almost always a reactionary movement lashing out against a perceived elite establishment. Fascism is always populist, so picking a decades old figure of the establishment that does not understand the game at all was doomed to fail.Again we needed FDR or Churchill, and we elected chamberlin/hoover.","title":"Joe Bidens Bodyguard of Liars Betrayed American Democracy - Gerontocracy, pro-establishment politics and deception by Democratic Party insiders all helped elect Donald Trump."},{"text":"Walz isn't a debator.

Obama came to northern Colorado twice when it was a conservative district and this place went wild. Both times he ran for President. Hillary popped in to Denver for a private fundraiser with wealthy donors.  Regular Voters were not invited. Harris stopped in and fueled the campaign jet. I'm not cutting VP Harris down.

Then both Parties find themselves in uncharted waters, with Cons failing to appoint a successor to Trump who can match his energy or galvanize his base.Well, one will just have to wait and see!","title":"Trumps Congress chaos is a reminder we should brace for unknown unknowns"},{"text":"Mario, your turn","title":"Republicans Quietly Remove Child Cancer Research Funds from Budget After Elon Push to Kill Government Spending Bill"},{"text":"The amount of fuckiness with this election was off the charts; Something is wrong","title":"To those who did not vote for Harris &amp; Democrats: It's not that Dems didn't earn your Vote.

Rather ask yourselves why Trump &amp; his GOP earned your COMPLICITY."},{"text":"As the Democratic party transformed itself from the party of the New Deal to the party of Nafta it embraced a new constituency: progressive professionals. Since Bill Clinton, liberals presided over the offshoring of high-wage blue-collar jobs in manufacturing. They watched as abandoned factories, and the towns that once relied on them, slowly oxidized. As the Rust belt stretched across the heartland, Democrats helped to subsidize the growth of a new elite primarily concentrated on the coasts. They pushed for policies that pulled the economy away from blue-collar industries and toward more dynamic sectors primarily in information technologies. They fashioned a new economy through public policy, and attracted a new constituency as a result. They hoped that as high-wage jobs disappeared, they would be replaced by new high-tech careers; as the party lost blue-collar voters, they invested in white-collar professionals. They got what they wished for.Today, working-class voters C as defined by income (less than $100k a year), occupation (manual work and service work) or education (less than a college education) C are more likely to vote for Republican candidates than for Democrats. Professionals, meanwhile, have successfully gentrified the Democratic party. Unfortunately for liberals, this group isnt nearly large enough to win elections. Worse, the folkways, mannerisms, and tastes of salaried high-income professionals have come to define the party, and now serve as a powerful repellent for working-class voters. Indeed, not only has the embrace of the knowledge class led to the economic neglect of the working class but the aggressive advocacy of professional class cultural values has played a major role in pushing working-class voters away.As a first-time voter in 1992 I have watched this transformation take place in real time over the past 32 years and this sums it up as well as I've seen.","title":"The lefts best defense against Trump?

That definitely *matters* -- I'm not saying she's innocent -- but it complicates the question of what legal consequences she should face for her crimes.Moreover, she didn't receive a pardon, as OP was advocating for Jan 6 defendants. She had her sentence commuted, 22 years in, at the age of 78, after already moving from prison to home arrest. A pardon says \\"you're not guilty of anything\\"; a commuted sentence says you're just as guilty but it reduces the time you spend incarcerated.I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with Biden commuting sentences of Jan 6 rioters who had already served a significant part of their sentences.

His middle east platform was built around anti-muslim/Palestinian attitudes and policies, interventionist and contentious measures that emboldened Netanyahu and heightened provocations in the region, a transactional relationship with aggressors, and a coalition of vehemently pro-Israel allies, among other things.Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with other \\"strongmen,\\" he caved in to Bibi's political pressures, indicating that he is willing to take an uncompromising stance on this war that he likely knows nothing about.Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved in. When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump already acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his handlers, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.What's more, Trump's \\"Middle East peace plan\\" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. As foreign policy goes, it was more of a political stunt than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This laughably brief, insincere and ineffective plan also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.In terms of his rhetoric, Trump has referred to all pro Palestinian protestors as \\"radicals.\\" Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said, Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, were going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,Trump has not only vowed to crush pro Palestinian protests, but he's threatened to deport *all* demonstrators. Trump has made statements like, they (Israel) \\"have to have a victory.\\" And speaking to Netanyahu, Trump has stated, \\"do what you have to do\\" in Gaza, while he has also said that we have to \\"let Israel finish the job.\\" Republicans in his orbit have also been pushing to annex the West bank, which is a real possibility considering Trump's MAGA coalition is willing to trade their loyalty for a chance to use him to enact their Islamophobic agenda.Trump hasn't laid out a viable plan for addressing the war in Israel. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gazas current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy. Gazas waterfront property could be very valuable, Kushner saidCaution around the controversial topic hasn't kept Trump from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.Trump has a long history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a \\"Muslim problem.\\" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.In 2015, he said he will \\"look at\\" closing mosques.He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.Trump once said he would certainly implement a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registryHe called for a \\"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.\\"He's called Muslims \\"sick people.\\"Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that the Judeo-Christian west is engaged in a global war against jihadist Islamic fascism.Then there's Trump's first \\"Muslim ban\\", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of \\"radical islamic terror.\\"While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.Let's not forget the recent \\"rally\\" at MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric and talking points. Some of it directed at Palestinians. Trump even used \\"Palestinian\\" as a slur during his debate with Biden.All that being said, the consequences for Palestinians and Muslims will be far more severe with Trump in office again and a MAGA coalition of fierce loyalists and islamophobes behind him. Not only that, but over the next four years, this agenda will encumber any future progressive efforts to broker a peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Criticize Biden all you want, but this is a war that the US has been complicit in for decades. Biden's role as a mediator during this stage of the war was made more challenging by not only the U.S's involvement in this conflict for over a half century, but also by the previous admin's position and its relationship with Netanyahu's coalition of far right jingoists.","title":"Netanyahu says he spoke with Trump about need for victory, as Israeli government approves plan for Golan expansion"},{"text":"If Trump can be manipulated this easily by Musk, imagine what adversaries of America can do!https://preview.redd.it/5vj06of8t38e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c8c93d8bf1cb31b9db773cf395ab3cbc6b2897","title":"The Dems to the rescue...

She had transformed the grand halls into a winter wonderland, with towering Christmas trees, each uniquely themed and meticulously decorated. The ornaments, made from cheap plastic derived from oil, sparkled under the lights, adding a touch of phony glitz to the festive atmosphere.Donnie had planned a unique Christmas Eve dinner, opting for a fun and casual twist. Instead of the traditional feast, she decided to order the entire meal from McDonald's. The spread included an array of burgers, fries, chicken nuggets, and apple pies, much to the delight of the younger guests. There were also plenty of McFlurries and milkshakes to go around, adding a sweet touch to the festive meal.Meanwhile, outside on the White House lawn, President Elon Musk's dog, a playful and curious Shiba Inu named Vance, was having an adventure of his own. Vance loved the snow and was busy chasing snowflakes, his fur dusted with white. As the evening grew darker, Vance noticed something unusual near the large Christmas tree that stood proudly on the lawn.With his keen sense of smell, Vance discovered a small, wrapped gift hidden among the tree's lower branches. He barked excitedly, drawing the attention of the Secret Service agents nearby. They approached cautiously and were surprised to find that the gift was actually a little \\"present\\" left by Vance himself!Unsure of what to do next, the agents decided to ask President Elon Musk for instructions. With his characteristic sense of humor, Elon chuckled and suggested they serve it as a joke during Christmas dinner.The agents were initially taken aback but couldn't help but laugh at Elon's unconventional idea. They carefully wrapped Vance's \\"gift\\" in festive paper and placed it among the other presents under the tree.Inside, the Christmas Eve dinner was a grand success, filled with laughter, joy, and the warmth of family and friends. As dessert was being served, Elon revealed his prank to everyone at the table. The room erupted in laughter as Donnie playfully scolded him for his mischievousness.As the night drew to a close, Donnie and Elon stepped outside to admire the peaceful, snow-covered lawn. They smiled as they saw Vance playing happily in the snowa perfect symbol of the simple joys of the holiday season.","title":"Dozens of House Republicans Defy Trump in Test of His Grip on G.O.P."},{"text":"CountyFamous (one of our generation's greatest minds) said it, we can finally put this matter to bed","title":"Canadian Redditors Unable To Differentiate Trolling From Reality"},{"text":"I should know the exact quote by now but one of my favorite Michael Scott quotes which is relevant here is from the golden ticket Wonka episode.

I know right now living in Canada isnt always easy and the cost of living is high, but regular every day people in the US have that complaint without the social nets that we have. Do our systems need work? Yes. That doesnt mean the US would be any better. The majority of the world has been struggling since 2020, not just Canada, and while I think we need to work much harder to help the people here and to make life more affordable, we could also have it much, much worse.

These things are complicated and need clearly defined language so they are not vague. People love stealing money from the government, so yeah it ends up being a lot of pages.I can outline 8 spending items in the original spending bill that were axed:?A fix for stolen food stamp funds:One provision taken out of the initial bill was aimed at ensuring that states replenish food stamp funds for Americans who rely on the program whose benefits are stolen.?Pharmacy benefit overhaul:The original bill called for a series of changes to the operations of pharmacy benefit managers  middlemen in the medicine business that negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and help determine what medications are covered by insurance firms. (Dropping these provisions shaved hundreds of pages out of the legislation.)?RFK Stadium transfer:The original legislation included a provision that would transfer control of the land in Washington, D.C., where RFK Stadium sits from the federal government to the District government. That would have enabled Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) to negotiate with the Washington Commanders about a possible new stadium for the NFL team on the site near the Anacostia River, moving from their current home in Maryland. Pay raises for members of Congress:The original legislation would have allowed a 3.8 percent cost-of-living pay bump for lawmakers to take effect, which would result in a pay raise of $6,600. They make $174,000 a year now.?Targeting junk fees:The original version of the spending package included two bipartisan bills that aimed to crack down on so-called junk fees, specifically by requiring ticket sellers and hotels to disclose any service charges and other add-ons up front to customers, rather than waiting until the end of the checkout process.Childhood cancer research:The revised resolution dropped the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which was named for a 10-year-old Virginia girl who died from an inoperable brain tumor. The legislation was signed into law by President Barack Obama, has historically drawn bipartisan support and has put about $125 million toward childhood cancer research over the past decade.Criminalizing some deepfake images:The revised legislation also jettisoned a bipartisan provision that would have criminalized the publication of nonconsensual, intimate images, known as revenge porn, as well as sexual images and videos generated by artificial intelligence, called deepfakes.Restrictions on investment in China:Congress was initially set to pass as part of the legislation a measure restricting U.S. investments in China, expanding existing rules currently being implemented by the Treasury Department. The legislation also would have affirmed presidential authority to impose economic sanctions on advanced technologies in China, according to the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank.","title":"Republicans Own This Government Shutdown S--t Show"},{"text":"Treaties require ratification by the Senate.

Ex. Albania and North Macedonia just dont have as much to spare for a military equipped to NATO standard. So the 2% of GDP thing is supposed to be a more or less equivalent burden in accord with what member economies can afford that is enough to show theyre taking it seriously, while being able to take into account the unique strengths a country may have - like dont expect any aircraft carriers out of Scandinavian countries because thats kind of intense for their low population, but they could focus heavily on arctic combat and intelligence gathering with their proximity to Russia meanwhile very populated countries with far flung islands like France and the UK can focus on buff navies that do have such things, other continental powers without much of anything overseas could focus on developing land or air forces, etc.In practice a lot kind of went whatever and disregarded the 2% until Russia started doing more jumpscares but its beneficial to have a measure of flexibility and specialization for armies which are supposed to fight together as a block.","title":"Trump wants 5% Nato defence spending target, Europe told"},{"text":"Begon bot!","title":"Should President Donald Trump Pass the Bastion to Elon Musk in 2028?

Meanwhile, pharmacies are closing across the country in recent years, which their owners blame in part on a reimbursement squeeze from the PBMs that pay them.PBMs have come under fire in recent years as the public, taxpayers and Congress question whether they are passing along as much savings as they should to health plan enrollees. The noise about coming regulation of PBMs and the companies that own them got even louder when Trump earlier this week said, were going to knock out the middleman, in reference to these companies.  \\n...  \\nBut Democrats blamed Republicans and a cozy relationship they say they have with PBMs as well as health insurers as the reason the PBM reforms were taken out of the legislation. Three of the largest PBMs are owned by **UnitedHealth Group**, CVS Health and Cigna, which also operate health insurance companies.A CR that includes health provisions but excludes bipartisan PBM reform is an embarrassing capitulation to the health insurance lobby, U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a post on X Thursday afternoon.

It was after the 1992 election that Newt Gingrich started to employ an obstructionist strategy in the House which resulted in Federal Employees getting an extra two weeks of paid leave in November 1995 when he decided to block a vote on the budget.Founding fathers gave the Congress the power of the purse as a check and balance over the Executive Branch under the President which actually runs the country. Each year the President proposes a budget the House and Senate committees debate and amend it and it would in years past get approved in a series of appropriations bills by September 30th, the end of the FY as part of regular order since it was the primary function of the Congress: funding and oversight.When a budget bill wasnt passed by Sept 30 the standard practice became to pass a straight continuing resolution which would allow all the Departments and Agencies of the Govt. to keep running based on a proration of the previous FYs budget, i.e., a one month CR would allow a spending 1/12th of the previous years budget, giving the appropriation committees in House and Senate to gain support from those objecting via a process of pork barrel earmarks; add ons to the budget that would benefit the state of a hold-out Senator or district of a single house member.  Not surprisingly once legislators realized they stood to gain pork by becoming obstructionists there were more and more earmarks added to the budget bills to get them past.Now its progressed to point that what used to be a simple CR process of kicking the budget can down the road at previous FY spending levels gets bogged down by using the CY as a vehicle to fund pet projects and issues which is why 37 fiscally conservative Republicans voted to block the CR to send a shot over the bow of the Majority Leader.","title":"Trump Demands Any Shutdown Start Now So Its a Biden Problem | \\nWith just hours left to find a resolution, the president-elect appeared to be mostly concerned with ensuring he isnt being blamed for the crisis he created."},{"text":"Coming from the co-president that means very little","title":"'No talent': Trump attacks Texas congressman amid looming government shutdown"},{"text":"Its all projection.

Here's a snippet:A\\"The response of the medical establishment, both in America and in Britain, was one of outrage; the institution of lodge practice was denounced in harsh language and apocalyptic tones. Such low fees, many doctors charged, were bankrupting the medical profession. Moreover, many saw it as a blow to the dignity of the profession that trained physicians should be eagerly bidding for the chance to serve as the hirelings of lower-class tradesmen. It was particularly detestable that such uneducated and socially inferior people should be permitted to set fees for the physicians' services, or to sit in judgment on professionals to determine whether their services had been satisfactory. The government, they demanded, must do something.And so it did. In Britain, the state put an end to the \\"evil\\" of lodge practice by bringing health care under political control. Physicians' fees would now be determined by panels of trained professionals (*i.e.,*?the physicians themselves) rather than by ignorant patients. State-financed medical care edged out lodge practice; those who were being forced to pay taxes for \\"free\\" health care whether they wanted it or not had little incentive to pay extra for health care through the fraternal societies, rather than using the government care they had already paid for.In America, it took longer for the nation's health care system to be socialized, so the medical establishment had to achieve its ends more indirectly; but the essential result was the same. Medical societies like the AMA imposed sanctions on doctors who dared to sign lodge practice contracts. This might have been less effective if such medical societies had not had access to government power; but in fact, thanks to governmental grants of privilege, they controlled the medical licensure procedure, thus ensuring that those in their disfavor would be denied the right to practice medicine.\\"","title":"In case I'm not preaching to the choir here.

I am also pro-gun and pro-choice, so if a pro-choice, anti-gun candidate if running against a pro-gun, anti-choice candidate, who do I choose? I choose the pro choice candidate because that issue is far more pressing and important to me. Now I have to defend to my like-minded peers why I would vote for the pro-choice candidate despite their position on guns. It's not always easy, but it's an important exercise in accountability for your beliefs and votes.If I just threw up my hands and said \\"I'm an independent\\" I would not have to defend my vote.

Anytime they're not fighting they are basically at home. European armed forces and their reserves are basically almost all already in theater and could be activated in an emergency. Also on a related note military salaries are a lot less in Eastern European countries than they are in the US and many of these countries also have sizable weapons manufacturing capabilities. One of the reasons US defense spending is so high in terms of nominal figures is because the US is paying American level salaries and buying weapons that were made in America. When Bulgaria buys artillery shells they are typically made in Bulgaria and when they pay their soldiers Bulgarian level wages.

I'm suggesting that this should be seriously looked at for a host of other reasons.You're acting like the NATO agreement is set in stone and can't be adjusted to reflect changing circumstances. International relations and global security aren't static. The world has changed dramatically since the agreement was made, and it's reasonable to reassess the terms. NATO has a history of changing these targets precisely for these reasons.Historically, alliances have had to adapt to new threats and challenges. Look at the formation of NATO itself - it was a response to the changing post-WWII landscape. Why can't we reevaluate and adjust the agreement now, especially when faced with new threats like Russia's aggression in Ukraine, threats, and hybrid warfare being waged against Europe?Let's not pretend like the US is the only one benefiting from NATO. European countries get a lot out of it too (at least they USED TO), including a security umbrella that allows them to focus on economic growth. It's not just about the US \\"demanding\\" something; it's about shared responsibilities and burdens.The resupply issue in Ukraine highlights the need for increased defense spending, not just better allocation. The capacity for manufacturing ammunition and equipment has been reduced in many Western countries, and this shortfall must be addressed to meet the current and future challenges. Factories need to constructed. Entire supply chains need to be augmented or created.And finally, Trump does not need an \\"excuse\\" to pull back from NATO. He'll just do it. Or he won't come to NATO's aid in an effective way if Article 5 is invoked. That makes increasing defense spending across NATO even more pressing.","title":"Trump wants 5% Nato defence spending target, Europe told"},{"text":"\\"Catch up\\" with what?

About 32 million people across the country are served by community health centers, regardless of their ability to pay.Federally funded community health centers are non-profit clinics that receive grants from the Health Center Program of the Health Resources and Services Administration. If the grants end, the centers will have no funding for employees or medical care. The Community Health Center Fund provides about 70% of federal money for health centers.Community Health Centers represent the largest primary care network in the U.S. Health centers have been in existence for nearly 60 years and care for 31.5 million patients nationwide, the vast majority of whom are low-income and need a place to go for affordable care.In August of this year the DHHS celebrated a milestone achieved with HRSA-funded community health centers:[New Data Show Highest Number of Health Center Patients in Nearly 60 Year History of the Program | HRSA-Funded Health Centers Served 2.7 Million More Patients Over Past Four Years, Reaching High of More than 31 Million Patients](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/05/new-data-show-highest-number-health-center-patients-nearly-60-year-history-program.html)Community health centers play a pivotal, and growing, role in Americas health care system. They are especially important in our effort to reduce health care disparities in underserved communities, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. More than 31 million people across the country - in every U.S. state, territory, and the District of Columbia - depend on health centers, making them a vital resource. The Biden-Harris Administration wants all Americans to have access to high-quality primary health care services, regardless of a patients ability to pay, and community health centers help make that possible.Under the Biden-Harris Admin they were being [expanded into every underserved community:](https://www.hrsa.gov/about/news/press-releases) rural, low-income neighborhoods, etc.; red or blue, it didn't matter.

Since the truth of her statements were at issue, the Court heard evidence about what happened in the 1990s. The jury concluded that it did happen, she was therefore not a liar, and that calling her one was defamatory. Her second lawsuit included the battery claim, because of that SOL extension you mentioned and because the facts had already been litigated.","title":"CMV: Special Counsel Jack Smith voluntarily dismissing the Trump indictments after the election was a mistake and a dereliction of his Constitutional duty"},{"text":"ya I am hearing that starlink had something to do with the voting machines and there were the ballot boxes that were set on fire and the pollsters that were threatning people not to mention the constant dump tshirts and hats at polls where they werent allowed to wear them but they cried about it","title":"Its crazy how for 8 years up to and including election night we were constantly harassed about election interference...

Your merit is always determined by people with bias and goals of their own and is directly influenced by the station of your birth. Meritocracy is a myth that only works on paper, the same way that perfect harmonious communism only works in theory. Also, I don't think the rich are actively trying to prevent others from having a fair shot. That is simply a by-product of capitalism. They're acting on what is good for themselves, not what is bad for others. It just happens to be bad for others. Its inherent to heavily capitalist systems.The only way to avoid all this is to balance that capitalism with the right amount of socialist concepts.
