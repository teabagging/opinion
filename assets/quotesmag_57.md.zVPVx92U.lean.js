However, many women are pro-life and we now see how many supported Trump.Any nominee would have held the same immigration stance as Harris.

So no nominee would have had a comprehensive plan other than to blame the other side.Lastly, \\"inflation\\", shrinkflation, and tipflation are issues that Harris should have addressed more aggressively.

And while Democrats were busy making the case that Republicans should leave Trump, voters fled the Democratic Party instead  or stayed home. On The Daily Show several weeks ago, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz laid out the thinking behind the Harris campaigns strategy of courting support from conservative elites. Republican voters are trying to find permission to get off the MAGA stuff and move over, he said. When host Jon Stewart expressed discomfort about the alliance with the Cheneys in particular, Walz said they give permission to those folks who want to find a reason to do the right thing. Unfortunately for Democrats, not many Republicans wanted permission to cross over to Team Blue, and Democratic voters needed no such permission to bail.Harris efforts to run to the right on immigration did not persuade voters, either. A majority said he would be better able to handle immigration, while only 36 percent said Harris, according to the Fox survey. What's the takeaway here? Any progressives voting in the next primary should reject civility, institutionalism, and bipartisanship candidates. Progressives should be absolutely alarmed and brace for impending failure when their running horse starts saying anything positive about republicans, when they start seriously considering republican policies as good ideas, when they stop talking about big progressive policies, or when they start brandishing their republican endorsements.

This comprised 85% of the population that inhabited the lands that the Jewish settlers had now claimed as their own.I do understand that those actions didn't happen in a vacuum, Palestinians were also using violence to oppose the occupation of their lands. But in the end one group was fighting to keep their homes, and the other was fighting to take their homes.If you had been in charge of advising the people who were buying land and helping Jews move there, what would you have recommended they do? I'd probably point out that any atrocities inflicted upon the people living there right now, will cause those people to justifiably hate us, and give them cause for doing the same to us into the future.

Regulations for things like wire gauge, smoke detectors, etc are probably not the holdup on building more.Housing prices went sky high because rates were down so long. Most people look less at the total price and more at the monthly payment. If they can afford a $350k home at 7% interest, then interest rates drop to 3% and they can suddenly afford more, sellers raise their price. And people pay it, because they can afford it. It's the same monthly price after all. But then when the rate goes back to 7%, those prices look silly. The monthly payment coupled with the now-normal high price is unaffordable.

And of course there is a correlation. But the median member of the working class views \\"class\\", at a subconscious level, as a matter of taste and behavior, of \\" virtue signaling\\" if you will. So when they imagine the rich people who exploit them, they invariably imagine them as possessing elite tastes, and to be fair, most of those rich people do indeed have elite tastes ! But what this MEANS is that when they see a rich person displaying VULGAR tastes,( i. E Donald Trump) that person BECOMES ABSOLVED from belonging in the oppressive capitalist class. They see someone like Trump and they say \\" oh he is not like the other rich people. He is not using the money that was extracted from my labor to  put his name on art museum buildings. He  behaves like  I behave.\\"The evidence that Donald Trump does not oppress them is HE BROADCASTS THAT HE SHARES THE SAME TASTES AS THEM.Also remember that in our country, EVERYONE WANTS TO BECOME A BILLIONAIRE. That is in fact, the ultimate dream for the overwhelming majority of Americans. Thus they do not see GREAT WEALTH AS INHERENTLY BAD. Don't get me wrong, they all agree that they are being exploited by rich people, but it cannot be that the exploitation is inexorably linked to THE PROCESS BY WHICH THEY BECAME RICH because all these people also want to become rich, and very few of them, in this fantasy, see themselves as having to oppress people to get there. Therefore, they conclude, there must be something else that is LINKED to being Rich, but IS NOT \\" BEING RICH\\" ITSELF that causes the rich people that exploit them to, well, exploit them.The genius move here the GOP has made is to make \\" non vulgarity\\" into the marker of the exploiting capitalist class. If a rich person is VULGAR in their behavior and affect, then they are immeadiately ABSOLVED from membership in the exploiting capitalist class. Whereas an economically middle or even working class person who has educated affectations and beliefs ( for example anti-racism) becomes suspect as perhaps being an agent of the exploiter.How do we solve this? Only way I can think of is to make non vulgarity near universal, which would mean sending the overwhelming majority of americans through university at no cost to them. Something that is clearly politically impossible in the foreseeable future.?Or, and this is probably the key, finding a way to? vulgarly express ?concepts such as?  dont be racist and  women are not destined to be your property that right wing propaganda has successfully ?coded as beliefs held only by the capitalists that exploit you.","title":"I dont understand how Republicans became the party for the working class"},{"text":"BUT THAT WOULD BE STOOPING TO REPUBLICAN LEVELS, WHEN THEY GO LOW WE HOLD OUR HEADS HIGH!

See the children of these people went to college, and their children went to college at a higher level still etc. So while economic mobility has gone nowhere in this country over the last 50 years, the number of people obtaining higher education has gone up.What does this do? well in many cases it strips you of your vulgar tastes.Moreover the economic stagnation of the last 50 years meant that many of these highly educated people did not see any increases in their standard of living. However the non educated saw their standard of living , and in many cases their lifespans, plummet.So we are now in a point in  time where the struggle, as seen by the median american is NOT between the rich and the poor, but between the VULGAR AND THE NON VULGAR.The vulgar resent the non vulgar, and they view being not vulgar as the mark of the elite. Essentially the elitist view that the tastes of the masses were to be exterminated has been turned on its head. Now it is the tastes of the educated that are viewed as the enemy of the \\" real american,\\" so anything that smacks of non vulgarity ( for example, not being racist) is coded as elite behavior.THIS IS WHY DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT CODE AS ELITE to these people. Because he is an extravagantly VULGAR human. And THAT is the marker that matters in America today. When you hear him described as a \\" working class billionaire\\" this is what is meant. He signals he has vulgar tastes, not elite tastes. Thus he represents the \\" common man\\" in the classic literal sense, in a world where common and elite are based not on wealth but on behavior and taste. An adjunct college professor stitching together jobs at three college campuses to make 50k a year is working class economically, but she is INFINITELY MORE ELITE than Donald Trump, and Conversely, Donald Trump is INFINITELY MORE WORKING CLASS than her, using the definitions of those terms that actually exist within the mind of the median american voter.That is it, That is the root of it.

The VULGAR class.Don't downvote. let me explain.The term vulgar literally originally meant \\" of and or relating to the common people\\" ( common people being called Vulgus in latin.) see also the term \\" plebeian\\".This set up a dichotomy, one set up by the elite in Roman Times , in which the tastes of the common person was viewed as crass and wrong. Because of this, one's mannerisms and modes of behaving became class markers, and so they remained until extremely recent times ( and by recent I mean the change STARTED in the 1960's)The key difference here, is that, before about 1960, it was commonly understood that the working, vulgar, class would aspire to imitate their \\" betters\\". Thus the media would for example, often broadcast opera and symphony orchestral music over the radio, not because this was popular but precisely because it was NOT popular. It was to show the vulgar masses what they should aspire to become etc. It was a paternalistic and elitist world view, and one that had existed for millennia. As you moved up in life, your tastes had to change. This was a truth universally understood.What changed? Mass Media, and World war 2. In the 1950's thanks to strong unions, the fact that the United States was the largest industrial area in the world that had not been turned into rubble during the war, and in the case of white people, massive housing subsidies leading to the american suburbs, much of the \\" vulgar\\" class was economically elevated into the middle class.Again this happened over a period of maybe 15 years. So their tastes did not change because that would take a lot longer . All of a sudden you had a bunch of people with vulgar tastes but middle class purchasing power. Then in the 1970's the economy stagnated. No new members of the vulgar class were being elevated into the middle class, and they haven't really been at any point since then. Gradually, many of those who had been elevated into the middle class slipped back into poverty, a process that continues to this day.","title":"I dont understand how Republicans became the party for the working class"},{"text":"It was *really weird* how she got a bump from Walz, and everyone learned about his policies from Minnesota, and then he was suddenly parroting the same milquetoast policies sounding nothing like the guy who accomplished what he did.

I thought I was a democrat too with all those same values you listed above. One night in 2015 before Trump debated Hilary, I was registered to vote by my best friends girlfriend. She listed me as a democrat and told me to vote for Bernie or Hillary. Later that night, my best friends of 5 years sat me down to tell me I had white privilege and I need to acknowledge I dont have to struggle etc blahblahblah. Even though they know my family had less money than theirs, I had plenty of friends in other races and they were my friends because they knew I was a kind empathetic guy. Yet they insisted I was racist for not acknowledging my white privilege, on top of that they explained the patriarchy and how white men are keeping everyone else poor yadayadayada. Thats when I started looking into everything about each candidate and exactly why everyone seemed so threatened/disgusted with Trump. I was much more curious than upset because I love dystopian sci fi books and movies and we had JUST read 1984 by George Orwell in class TOGETHER. I needed to know why these great friends that I loved so dearly, seemed to shift their entire focus on social justice and seeing race, gender etc in every aspect of their lives. Ironically, its because of them that I voted for Trump twice now. Its simply because of the media dragging him through the mud every single day on television but nothing was sticking. I thought, if thats all the dirt they can dig up on him, and are even making things up out of thin air, he must be a better man than most of the slimeballs in office and that was before the 34 FELONY charges for a single misdemeanor that was out of the statute of limitations anyway.

You have young men, across all races failing in school at record numbers, you have young men with skyrocketing rates from deaths of despair, far higher than the increase women are seeing, which still make up only a fraction, you have young men not in university and not working, programs geared towards them such as vocational programs are the first things cut across school districts, and an entire education system that doesn't address their learning styles. When you removed test scores for university placement young men placements plummeted as young men outperform on tests compared to teacher evaluations. You have the vast majority of homeless under 30 being young men, 50% of those young white men btw. If we want to blame races for crime statistics this would get extremely racist very quickly - in cities it was school closures that put young black men into vulnerable situations, with massive increase in gang membership - a direct result of democrats closing schools far longer than needed which will take decades to undo. At the end of the day democrats didn't mention a single issue for young men, didn't put them in the platform as they listed out 16 categories of groups they were for, spent 10 years saying they were toxic and the problem for everything. I mean so many extremely privileged female academics, have spent a decade lobbing stones at young men shouting about their privilege it was like an SNL skit. So yes, young men have many issues, and democrats spat on them instead of extending an olive branch. I think your commentary is a prime example of the issue on the left. What else you want, incarceration rates, mental health, live expectancy? For young men all these trajectories are plummeting across the board and still democrats spat on them and told them, no - no opportunities for you, as we have too many boomer men, and too many gen x men in positions of power.","title":"Fetterman says bros are Democrats childless cat ladies"},{"text":"Thing, as clearly shown by the divide, we can't seem to agree on WHAT is good for the country.","title":"A Red-District Conqueror Wants Fellow Democrats to Look in the Mirror"},{"text":"To fight for what is morally right, one will always be at a disadvantage, because a moral person must adhere to strict principles and an immoral person can do what he likes.

They said no, he did it to bring jobs back here instead of China, etc. Then he said everything on Google is fake. He kept sending me anti-Kamala videos he got from Facebook that came from a weird account on Instagram that had nothing on it but these short anti-Kamala videos. I saw an account on here with 100s of similar posts about how Kamala was going to bomb Pakistan. I am pretty sure both of these were Russian troll accounts.   A lot of Republicans are constantly being fed biased, false information and don't question it. I think some other reasons are fear, ignorance, racism, religious beliefs, and sexism. They think migrants are being given all these free things and committing crimes. The Bible tells them abortion is wrong and they either aren't hearing about the deaths from forced births, don't care about it, or think it is fake news. I have heard people say a woman is too emotional to be president and isn't strong enough. There are a lot of sexist memes going around about Kamala. Some falsely believe things were better under Trump because of something he did. The economy actually got better since Biden was in office and we were in a recession under Trump. Prices have still been high under Biden so they think it will get better with someone else as President.  Some people think the party has focused too much on the woke stuff instead of the economy, jobs, wages, and healthcare. This one I agree with. I still voted for Harris but don't think she would have made a lot of changes. I consider myself an Independent but my beliefs lean left. In my state, a lot of people switched from Democrat to Independent this election. I still voted for Harris but I know what was on the line and quite a bit about politics. There are a lot of people out there who don't pay attention to current events and politics and who don't care about these issues. I think we are currently living in an Oligarchy where the Democrats work for the wealthy much more than they do for us but are the lesser evil. The gap between parties has been shrinking for some time and it is like voting for the right or voting for the center/right. Some people look at the party and they see that they work for corporate interests and at the same time only care about social issues. We need a new party if the Democrats aren't willing to nominate someone like Bernie Sanders who will work for us instead of the wealthy and wants to fix the things all of us care about.  I know someone who liked Bernie but voted for Trump because they didn't like Hillary. My father who is Republican seems to like him quite a bit too. Maybe a part of that is because he isn't being fed a bunch of misinformation about him though.","title":"Is the average American really as pro-Trump like the election shows?

Fast forward to 2020: They screwed him over again, lied about Tulsi, kept Warren in to steal progressive votes, used Bloomberg to flood ads, and push Biden as nominee. Then 2024nuff said. But a lot of people dont know the DNC sued states to have Jill Stein, RFK and Trump off the ballots. Literally the only person they wanted on a ballot in swing states was Harris and the libertarian. Thats beyond messed up and not reported on enough.  No one around me was doing this kind of analysis and looking into it, they were just accepting whatever was said. \\nYep. In the age of the internet, where you yourself can witness videos of history first hand. People didnt bother to google the videos with unbelievable Trump quotes. Those who did, half didnt believe their eyes. I have a veryindoctrinated family member. In 2020 she was whining about the very fine people hoax and how she couldnt believe Id support someone who called nazis very fine people. So I stopped her, asked if she saw the video. She said yes. So I pulled up the transcript on my phone and asked her to find me where he said that. She couldnt find it. Rather than realizing she was believing liesshe decided that source wasnt real and she knew exactly what she heard. No self reflection, no realization, nothing. Thats the moment I realized, some people just want to believe lies and others dont.  I think what happened was, the DNC adopted Karl Rove tactics and no one noticed.  I started to question and point these things out to the people around me and what I got in return was vicious attacks, name calling, and a refusal to look at the evidence. \\n^^^^ yep. To finish the story she continued attacking me for daring to support Trump. Even though her own eyes just proved Trump never called nazis very fine people. She also claimed Trump never condemned white supremacyyet in that same speech Trump condemned white supremacy. Cant make it up.

Which isn't surprising at all. Just as a question for you, when was the last time you read an article from a \\"right wing\\" media outlet? Or watched a video from a \\"right wing\\" commentator? Or paid attention to literally anything that didn't get published by CNN or MSNBC or whatever other leftist media outlet you choose to read. You *are* out of touch with reality, your ideas aren't popular and the media you consume lies to you to convince you that you're the one on the \\"right side of history\\", as the left so often says.but Im seeing a lot of wanting it to increase incomes which again just seems super against the basic conservative values.What? So you unironically believe that conservatives just want people to be poor? That just seems to be the most disingenuous take you could get.Which to me seems completely antithetical to the conservative ideals of small government and free market? A completely free market isn't a conservative value. Regulation, to a certain extent, is good. Like saying companies can't dump waste into rivers. The small government is in regards to things the government shouldn't have a place in, like trying to force medicate people for them to be able to work.  Or when people protested lockdowns. Or when the IRS targeted Christian under the Obama administration. Or when parents were targeted because they didn't like books with graphic depictions of sexual acts (genderqueer) or explicit instruction on how to make a Grindr account and descriptions of scat (this book is gay). What about that \\"trans\\" kid in lauden county that raped two girls? Where was big daddy government when that happened? Oh, yeah, that's who tried to cover it up. The idea that a big government solves any kind of problem is laughable.Another thing that I find interesting, and I think maybe this gets to some of the fundamental differences between conservatives and liberals, I find it really strange that theres this desire to distort markets in a way that brings back hard and laborious jobs, but not in a way that allows everyone to work less?Some people don't have a problem with labor, but it's more than that. Remember during COVID when Chinese people abroad had bought up a bunch of medical supplies and sent them back to China? The supplies that China sent to other countries that super conveniently were defective? Yeah, it's almost like relying almost entirely on other countries to produce essential goods like medicine and medical supplies wasn't actually a good idea, who coulda knownI guess my feelings on it are that I think we are wealthy enough as a nation that with some market reallocation we could all work less and reap the benefits, and I dont understand why we dont all want that for each other and for our future generations? What is the source of our wealth? What do we produce that the rest of the world wants so much? What do we produce here at all? What would we have without the reliance on other countries?","title":"Why so much pro market-distorting sentiment? (I.e.

As others have stated, Covid lockdowns and restrictions meant a lot of people were at home doing nish, so voting by mail was a great option. Gave them a chance to get out and do something. This year people are busy dont have time or cant be bothered. People also didnt like trumps mishandling of covid so they probably voted against him.Arguably the lower iq of the population vote for trump (Im not saying thats all that votes for him but I mean the out in the sticks hills have eyes never seen a school type) and when hes gearing them up for 4 years that the dems are 100% going to cheat unless they vote otherwise they will be performing sex change operations on their children these people will queue and wait and if theres a bomb threat they will return later or go to another place because they have to vote. Dems would go home, 2 hour line? Nah my vote doesnt matter shes going to win in a landslide anyway.The college kids who were protesting Israel on campus.

I saw young people heckle Harris at her rallies about genocide. I didnt see one person do it at a trump rally. Even though he said he would help Israel win the war fast. These college kids most likely voted for nobody. Especially after the government kept sending money and weapons to Israel.These are just a few options. Of course maybe it was stolen.

It was won by too many people thinking Project 2025 was fear mongering and not a real threat. They are not going to take the resulting price hikes of suddenly cutting out everything that makes our prices as cheap as they are lightly.Nor are they going to respond well to Project 2025 mandates restricting their freedoms. We have to realize this was a very close election when we look at the projected vote totals (votes are still being counted), it only seems much worse because of the EC making specific states more important than others. We may be looking at a 1-2 million difference. This is still a contested country with millions of voters that barely pay attention to politics until election time comes, and who vote party line because they always have. This stuff is scary, but we also need to be realistic. Trump voters are not all the crazed MAGA people we see at rallies. Some of them just vote for the not-Democrat. Many of them just voted based on groceries being more expensive than during Trump. These people are still reachable.We need to look at the polls and focus groups and keep a clear head with this. American voters have been woefully uninformed for every election until now, that is nothing new. Those undecideds and those that thought Project 2025 was just fear mongering are going to get a cold, hard smack of reality real soon.Contraception, pornography, department of education, NOAA, and shit ton of other things they didn't realize were on the ballot being banned or disappearing because of the government? That's not going to go over well. It shouldn't have come this far, but Americans historically are not nearly as politically engaged as any of us spending our time talking about politics on reddit are. Conservative Evangelicals who would support this stuff are very loud but they are not the majority. We're going to see the clash of those who pound their chest about American freedom and those who want to enforce a specific life style.It seems like they overlap a lot, and as a rural midwesterner there is a lot of overlap, but they are also going to be at odds like never before. I'm positive my neighbor voted for Trump. I also know he and his wife like their porn (don't ask). I HIGHLY doubt they knew what they just voted for.We also have tons of polling data on specific issues. Project 2025 mandates are wildly unpopular among voters regardless of party. Issues like abortion access are favored by the majority nationally. Multiple Trump-won states voted in favor of abortion access in this election. They're not going to take it well if Trump's administration overrules their state's rights to enforce a total ban.Maybe I'm just coping hard, but everything I have heard and seen makes me firmly believe Americans did not realize what was on the table and MAGA Republicans think they have won an ideological battle in this country that many of their voters are not going to take well. We cannot underestimate the power of our two party system and voters that are checked out until election season where they vote party line because they always have. All this is to say, yes they are going to make it much more difficult. But the policies they think they have support for now, when in reality it is just support for the Trump brand, are going to piss a shit load of people off by taking away freedoms they took for granted and low prices by means of cheap labor and imports that they took for granted. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic here, but I think the resulting backlash from what this government is planning to do is going to be far too strong to suppress.To think of it in much more imaginative terms... Republicans only care about things when it affects them. This is about to affect all of them regardless of if they are MAGA church goers or not.It's going to be rough, it's going to suck. But we need to keep our heads up because we have the opportunity to turn this around once this stuff is put into action and non-MAGA Trump supporters are forced to look at the results of their vote in the face.","title":"Guys remember what Biden said setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable"},{"text":"\\"No, you are!\\" Typical Trumplet response.","title":"Not Christian but hear me out - why does no Trumper think Trump is the Antichrist?"},{"text":"Usually when you engage them, acknowledge you arent debating the merits of trump.

I mentioned an article I read about whether the Democrats should have a policy platform for guys. Dems campaign on abortion rights, gender equality, stopping racial discrimination, making sure underrepresented folks have a fair shots, etc. But the article talked about having a policy platform that you could pitch to any young guy. My first thought was I was unsure how big the young men shift to Trump would be. Young men dont vote that much, is this just preemptively blaming minorities and women for the loss?But I thought they could be onto something. I shared this with a more progressive person, and she thought it was crazy. That voting to protect women and people of color should be good enough. She explained that it felt like she was back in 2010 explaining to the boys in her high school friend group why feminism helped society. Fast forward 14 years, she felt like she would be doing the same thing all over again.  So its tricky. But at the end of the day, and seeing how the election went, I do think Democrats should simplify. We should have a shorter message that resonates with everyone. And every self-serving voter (which is everyone, and thats not evil) should feel theyre benefitting from our platform. Telling people to vote to save democracy or do it for women or well you see how Trump treats minorities  that is not a positive message. It is true, but thats inherently a negative campaign against the other guy. We should start by running a positive campaign with simple short wins for everyone. Then maybe we could actually win the White House again :(","title":"Post-mortem polling found inflation, illegal immigration, and a focus on transgender issues to rank among the top reasons for not voting for Harris.

And I'm pretty sure every Democratic leader agrees with her that they need more candidates like her in swing and red districts. Having said all of that, many of her criticisms are silly and performative if you look at specifics. Here's a quote: \\"I noticed that almost all of the garlands were plastic. My district grows a hell of a lot of Christmas trees. I was strong-armed into taking a picture. I said, Madam Vice President, we grow those where I live. She just walked away from me. There was kind of an eye roll, maybe. My thinking was, it does matter to people where I live. Its the respect, the cultural regard for farmers\\"Come on. Acting offended at plastic Christmas trees? Which Harris likely had no part in ordering? I don't begrudge her for it, I'm sure the voters of her district eat it up. But this is theatre, it's a not serious profound criticism. She wants Democrats to talk about securing the Southern border. Already done, they've pivoted hard in the last year and you'd be hard pressed to distinguish Kamala Harris quotes from Republican quotes on the border over the campaign season.And let's be honest here - she can't really come out and acknowledge that she won in large part because her opponent was horrible.

I'm in the red part of a blue state. They think Biden should have done something, anything about inflation and talking to them more, what they were describing was companies price gauging. Regular people have the perception that companies are price gouging on everything, that that's why groceries are expensive.As I've been thinking about the election results this week, I think what Trump offers is someone who at least appears to be trying to do something. The first criticism of Biden I remember was that after the Afghanistan withdrawal, he didn't fire anyone. In hindsight, he needed the optics of making some heads roll. It's stupid and it burns some people, who are probably very decent people, but it keeps the bigger mission going. I think that's the \\"Sleep Joe\\" thing was getting at--he doesn't *appear* to do anything. I've been thinking this week we need to get back to an LBJ-type Democrat. Basically our own asshole bully who rather than being angry about sports and hitting women, slaps around Congress and CEOs, pushes equal rights, and raises taxes higher on billionaires. An asshole bully Dem president would have set up a price gouging tribunal and at least put on the show of having CEOs having to testify about why their prices are higher and that would have given the news material to run for a while and low info people would see clips of a president \\"fighting for them!\\". Another thing to do would have been to make the PPP loans into a scandal about the GOP giving away/stealing taxpayer money. That could have been a Benghazi circus in Congress to help the Dems.Politics is theater and the Dems have/had the stage and didn't put on a show. I love Obama but my main criticism or regret of him is that his background was being a law professor and he didn't want to get down in the weeds and play hardball with Congress, so then things just stalled for most of his time. Asshole Dem President would have started pulling levers to make things increasingly uncomfortable for the GOP and their major sponsors. When you're the president, you have the biggest microphone in the world. Use it!I like Biden a lot, he got a lot of legislation through, but what he absolutely failed at was communicating anything. He and his administration couldn't get a message out of a wet paper bag if they tried. Secretary Mayor Pete B seems to be literally the only one who can communicate anything.Think about it, Trump accomplished like 2 things out of 100s of things he promised and didn't deliver on, but he talks constantly about his 2 things like they're the biggest and greatest things ever and that creates the messaging that \\"this guy gets stuff done!\\".","title":"Pelosi Laments Bidens Late Exit and the Lack of an Open Primary"},{"text":"I think the data may actually have said it was in play.

I dont dislike Harris, and think she did *kind of* do the best she could considering. But she was overall a very weak candidate, with *massive* optics + achievement problems as VP.Particularly compared to Biden under Obama. Who was at the time a good communicator, excellent debater, could point to the auto bailouts and general GFC recovery + harm mitigation as things he had personally worked on, and in general had a fantastic and well documented great rapport + cooperation with the US president.Harris had quite literally NONE of those things. And got tied very publicly to the asylum / immigration crisis, when Biden tasked her to that as her *first* real VP assignment, and - outside of to be clear doing slme very effective negotiaton with the Mexican govt, *publicly* pretty much gave up on and ran away from that issue. Something which left wing media tried to astroturf, but Fox et al did NOT forget about, and which singlehandedly may have very well cost her the election, given that trumps rhetoric *revolves* around this issue.Harriss relationship with Biden very publicly fell apart after that. There was to be clear some degree of recovery after that. But Harriss staff among other things has publicly blamed *Biden* staffers for sabotaging her by giving her a hard to impossible assignment to work with. That in and of itself should quite frankly be disqualifying, given that public expectations for POTUS are Trumans the buck stops here, and handling / doing something about the southern immigration crisis (ie working with congress, state govts, et al) was very obviously done and seen as a trial run by the Biden administration.Harris was a CA AG turned junior senator. Who had, quite frankly, nearly nonexistent experience, and above all actual policy and legislative and/or executive achievements outside of that. She ranked 12th or something in the 2020 primary, and had both opportunistically attacked Biden - very very poorly - and subsequently got wrecked by Haley.She was picked by Biden as basically one of only two or three black women who was remotely quialified for that. Which was an explicit requirement asked for by the southern black caucus of Biden, which netted him an early victory and ergo the nomination.She did probably help win GA, and ergo the critical senate seat that was critical to passing *everything* in the biden policy agenda.She was however by no means the strongest candidate that the dems could field, and basically forced her way into this position through seniority and luck.Her main experience in the senate was grilling conservatives in the US senate. Which while cathartic, was an *actually useful* bit of experience + presidential capability only as seen by the ~~idiots~~ pundits on MSNBC et al.*As a Californian*, I was not particularly impressed or happy with her. Particularly given that our other seat was occupied perpetually by Feinstein, a godawful but impossible to primary + remove 80s / 90s era (and to be clear extremely conservative by SF standards) SF politician. And a good / great replacement to Boxer Harris was quite frankly not.Very long rant aside, my point is that Harris very obviously put Biden in a very difficult situation. The original plan may very well have been to serve for 4 years and then step down. Harris however very clearly did not adequately step up to the plate - as Biden had probably hoped she would. and while she would have been *fine* as POTUS, actually winning election *as a VP* with her track record and optics was pretty clearly - for everyone with eyes - going to be next to impossible.Her actual run and *initial* interviews changed a lot of peoples minds, myself included, but she was ultimately rejected by the US electorate, and for reasons that we quite frankly *were* well aware of 2 years ago.This left Biden the choice of either just running for a full 8 years, or stepping down for a party primary. The latter has historically *always* wrecked incumbents / incumbent parties, which is why he did not do that.In hindsight we maybe / probably should have tried, anyways, since that outcome at the very least probably wouldnt have been worse than what *did* happen.In general Biden was unpopular for no fault of his own (EVERY post covid incumbent across the world has got wrecked), but his age and very clear cognitive decline made it literally impossible to actually campaign properly, and/or win.The real hindsight / coulda-shoulda-woulda is that Obama shouldnt have caved to hillary and locked Biden out of the race in 2016. Biden was the middle ground to Hillary + Sanders, *would have* won the rust belt states, and would have most likely / quite possibly won the primary and general vs trump.He would have lost in 2020 due to covid. But Trump wouldve just gone away to go grift on TV. As was pretty clearly the plan originally.And far more importantly we would have a 5-4 *liberal* SCOTUS. Not a 6-3 conservative one. And one mind, now that weve re-elected Trump again, where that will most likely be the case + status quo *for the next 50 years*.RIP sweeping legislative climate change action. Minority legal protections. Anti-trust rulings. Et al.And if you think we can just fix thay by expanding SCOTUS you are fucked in the head. Dem control of state govts is fucked. We dont have any kind of clear path to ever retake the senate. (short of us all moving to WY or whatever). And are at this point could struggle a bit to retake the f-ing house.We lost in 2016. Period. Not *everything* is terrible about the 24 election. But red + swing states are quite frankly gonna deserve every horrible thing that happens to them over the next X years. Above all the stayed-at-home-cuz-both-sides are the same, and/or lets-own-the-libs voters, and non-voters.Long live federalism, states rights, and the EC that at the very least will ensure we have democratic, ish, federal elections (and/or a constitutional crisis / civil war) for the forseeable future.

I bet you a dollar that newly elected city mayor is going to operate with the mindset of, see, people want conservative values. So Im going to go ahead with this plan to cut school spending and support the police more.Its also a matter of compromise. While we most likely agree on social issues, we may not agree on other stuff. Even though we voted for the same candidate this year we would still need to compromise on policies that we can all agree with. Its far better to convince others to join your cause than it is to force that cause onto people who dont understand or dont want it.

The fact is that the POTUS is in charge of a lot of daily nonsense that many people do not understand. Trump was POTUS years ago, but the Justices he elected are going to be around for decades. Again, a slow burn that people wont see the outcome of until Trump was out of office. While politicians are not entitled to our vote the people should still make their choice heard.

These are just my own observationsBut now that weve got social media and thats how many of us meet and talk to each other it strikes me that even how we talk about these things amongst ourselves (ignoring how the party establishment wants to talk about these things) is having an effect here. I think its part of the stew that caused 15 million of our own voters to stop caring/stop supporting us. That number is - insanely - striking given who the opponent was this election. This was not John McCain, where you can kinda stay home cause hes a good and decent guy tooSo something really huge is going on and Im trying to figure it out. What I can say is that when I joined the party a quarter century ago as a young heterosexual male I felt completely welcomed. I never felt judged. I never felt like I had to be X level of progressive. Identity politics wasnt a thing we talked about. We talked about wealth disparity, losing our manufacturing, corporations exploiting foreign labor markets and leaving our working class decimated. We talked about policy that would make companies offshoring their labor and manufacturing pay for doing so. Taking that money and investing it into our own labor force. We talked about tax relief for the lower and middle classes. We talked about how we needed to lower the estate tax thresholds. We talked about private student loans being predatory blah blah blah. You get my point.No one ever put me on the spot and said how do you feel about (insert socially polarizing issue here)  and if I wasnt rabid about it then I was smeared as (insert insult here). And had that happened Im not sure I ever would have joined the party! I suspect I would have but I would have resented it quite a bit. As I said, I am just thinking out loud trying to figure out why we are turning off our own voters and getting swept in every. single. swing state.And I suspect this is a pretty big part of that problem.

My instinct is to think Biden's exit could have successfully been framed as a health issue if the Republicans hadn't spent his entire 2020 campaign and presidency spreading misinformation about his health and abilities. Another trouble is that his dropping out under the circumstances he did gives the impression of a tacit admission by the party that all the noise from the right about cover ups of his \\"decline\\" were true all along. I think the damage of that was severe and it probably would have only been moreso if he framed his exit as a health issue. Not only does it undermine perceived credibility for the Dems, it aids the perceived credibility of right wing propaganda outlets and sensationalized gossip that had been pushing the narrative. In an alternate world where Biden was covered more fairly I think he could have said an unforseen health issue had arisen and due to that he had decided not to seek a second term and that could have been accepted by the public without prejudice and in that scenario it wouldn't have necessarily harmed the party.I think if Biden were going to be replaced the best way for that to have any chance of working would have been for him to decline to seek reelection at all on the basis of his age. I think there is a chance this could have been successful if the Dems then competing in a primary could resist descending into self sabotage of the party by arguing over the merits of Biden's administration. Instead they would need to focus on their approaches to the future while promoting the administration's successes and framing their visions as building on those successes.... Given the criticisms of Harris for not distancing herself from Biden's policies I don't have a lot of confidence this would have happened, but maybe there could have been some discipline... And even in that best case scenario the primary contest would still be a leap of faith. Maybe it would have worked but I don't see that there were any obvious indications it would be a great idea at the time.","title":"Pelosi Laments Bidens Late Exit and the Lack of an Open Primary"},{"text":"Wasn't this guy president in 2016 and it was good?He was president, so yes to the first part.1,000,000 Americans died from Covid, so those dead people might disagree with second part of your question.","title":"I'm a little nervous/confused about trump(hear me out)"},{"text":"Not the democrats.

Genesis 1:1-3 (KJV): 1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  The beginning of Enuma Elish is slightly familiar but with big differences :Vers 1-8: 1 When the heavens above did not exist,\\n2 And earth beneath had not come into being \\n3 There was Aps?, the first in order, their begetter,\\n4 And demiurge Tia-mat, who gave birth to them all;\\n5 They had mingled their waters together\\n6 Before meadow-land had coalesced and reed-bed was to he found \\n7 When not one of the gods had been formed\\n8 Or had come into being, when no destinies had been decreed,\\n9 The gods were created within them:\\nIn both myths heaven and earth is called out in the beginning. In Genesis Yahweh creates them. In Enuma Elish they exist before the gods exists. Before creation two primordial beings exists, Absu and Tiamat, two water dragons C symbolizing primordial chaos. Its from the primordial chaos that the gods gets created (pretty much the same as in Greek mythology).water in Genesis 1:2-3?  darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\\nThe Hebrew word that bibles translate as face of the deep or abyss is tehom.\\nTiamat = The primordial chaos in the Babylonian creation myth personified by a water dragon.\\nTehom = Literally meaning deep or darkness.\\nTsulah = Sea deep, deep flood.\\nTihamah = The modern Arabic word for the coastal plain of the Red Sea.Genesis 2:6 of the King James Version has the translation \\"mist\\" for this word, but the actual word translation generally accepted is \\"spring of underground water\\"  (again, the serpent from both narratives that has the same domain and performs the same duties). [All of Job 41 was writing about the same as well](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2041&amp;version=NIV).

Just like with the internet you need to make sure everything it says is valid and get info from trusted source. That all being said this speeds up that process ten fold and gives you a much better starting point. So here ya go.\\nFrom a libertarian perspective rooted in natural rights theory, the focus is on individual sovereignty, the right to self-ownership, and the right to private property. These principles assert that individuals inherently possess rights that cannot be legitimately violated by others, including the government, unless its to protect the rights of others (such as in cases of self-defense). Based on this framework, violations of natural rights can be seen in various actions taken by the government, particularly actions by the Democratic Party in the last few years. Here are several examples where Democrats have been criticized for violating natural rights:1. Free Speech (First Amendment)\\nCensorship and Content Moderation: Libertarians argue that the government, particularly through pressure on private companies like social media platforms, has infringed on freedom of speecha key natural right.\\nThe Biden administration has been involved in efforts to combat misinformation, leading to social media censorship (e.g., pressuring platforms like Facebook to suppress stories like the Hunter Biden laptop). Libertarians view this as a violation of individuals natural right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.\\nThe growing push for government regulation of speech, particularly with an eye on regulating disinformation or enforcing truth standards, can be seen as a violation of natural rights to communicate freely.\\n2. The Right to Bear Arms (Second Amendment)\\nGun Control: Libertarians hold that individuals have an inherent right to defend themselves, and that includes the right to own and carry arms. Any government action that infringes on this right is viewed as an unjust violation of natural rights.\\nThe Biden administration has supported stricter gun control measures, including proposals for assault weapon bans, red flag laws, and expanded background checks. Libertarians argue that these measures infringe upon the natural right to self-defense and property defense by denying individuals the means to protect themselves.\\nMandatory gun buybacks or policies that restrict firearm ownership in the name of public safety are viewed as coercive measures that violate the fundamental natural right to own property (in this case, firearms) and defend ones life and property.\\n3. Bodily Autonomy and Health (Self-Ownership)\\nVaccine Mandates and Public Health Restrictions: Libertarians believe that individuals have an inherent right to self-ownership, meaning they alone should have authority over their bodies. The COVID-19 pandemic led to government interventions that many libertarians view as violations of bodily autonomy.\\nThe Biden administration imposed vaccine mandates for federal workers and businesses with over 100 employees, which many libertarians saw as a violation of the natural right to bodily autonomy and the right to make personal health decisions.\\nFurther restrictions like mask mandates, lockdowns, and the forced closure of businesses were seen as infringements on the right to freely associate, work, and move about. Libertarians believe these restrictions violate the natural right to personal freedom and property rights (e.g., the ability of business owners to operate freely).\\n4. Privacy Rights and Surveillance\\nIncreased Surveillance: Libertarians argue that the right to privacy is a natural right that is being increasingly infringed upon by government surveillance programs and the use of big data. In the last few years, Democrats have pushed for expanding government powers to monitor individuals, especially in the name of national security or public health.\\nThe Biden administration has been involved in efforts to monitor online activity to combat misinformation and extremism, which, for libertarians, violates privacy rights and the right to free association. These efforts often lead to mass surveillance of citizens activities, undermining the natural right to private property and personal space.\\nAdditionally, proposals to expand government access to private data or to use technologies like facial recognition and tracking apps can be seen as violations of natural privacy rights.\\n5. Property Rights and Economic Freedom\\nTaxation and Wealth Redistribution: A fundamental tenet of natural rights is the right to own property and control ones labor. Libertarians view high levels of taxation and wealth redistribution as violations of these rights.\\nThe Biden administration has supported tax hikes, particularly on corporations and the wealthy, and proposed new social welfare programs. Libertarians argue that this infringes on the natural right to the fruits of ones labor and private property, as it forcibly redistributes wealth to fund government programs.\\nCorporate taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate taxes are seen as coercive tools of government that interfere with individuals right to freely dispose of their property and the wealth they generate.\\n6. Civil Asset Forfeiture\\nProperty Seizure Without Due Process: Libertarians are particularly critical of the practice of civil asset forfeiture, where the government can seize assets (money, cars, homes) from individuals suspected of a crime without due process or a conviction. This practice is viewed as a direct violation of the natural right to private property.\\nDespite calls for reform, many Democratic-led states continue to use civil forfeiture as a tool for law enforcement, a practice that libertarians believe undermines individual rights and property rights, since people can lose their assets without a fair trial or legal justification.\\n7. Government Overreach in Housing and Land Use\\nZoning Laws and Property Restrictions: Libertarians argue that government restrictions on property use, such as zoning laws or restrictions on land development, violate the natural rights of property owners to do with their property as they see fit.\\nMany Democratic policies, particularly at the state and local level, often promote environmental regulations or housing policies that restrict land use and property development. These policies, while often justified in the name of public good, are seen as unjust by libertarians because they infringe on property rights and hinder the freedom to engage in voluntary transactions.\\n8. Expanding State Power in the Name of Social Justice\\nWelfare Programs and Government Dependency: While not a direct rights violation in the traditional sense, libertarians believe that extensive welfare programs and policies that encourage state dependency infringe upon individual sovereignty and economic freedom.\\nThe Biden administration has pursued significant expansions of welfare programs, including extended child tax credits, universal basic income discussions, and various other social safety nets. Libertarians argue that these programs incentivize government dependency, reduce personal autonomy, and violate the right to control ones wealth.","title":"Talking with very liberal family members"},{"text":"Its the right thing to do, and someones gotta do it.","title":"The Biden-Harris Lowering Costs Agenda"},{"text":"I don't remember drone bombing a hospital during ww2.","title":"Sorry War-Mongering liberals and neocons"},{"text":"I've seen the claim made that he and Jill did per alleged inside sources, but at least to my knowledge when I last saw it there's no evidence and it's at best hearsay, if not entire confabulated.","title":"Do you think Biden voted for Trump?"},{"text":"Thank you for your insight, it makes a lot of sense.

You are already wise beyond your years for that reason alone. I think everyone can agree that Trump isnt the smoothest talker. He himself even acknowledges that he goes on what he calls weaves aka tangents. But hes said if you keep listening, hell always come back to his points. This makes it really easy for liberals and media to take clips of what he says out of context, because they dont show the whole clip. So that contributes to a lot of the hate. One of the best things he did on this election was going on long form podcasts. This helped so many people see the real side of him. In the podcasts, you see hes actually really funny and you realize he makes sarcastic jokes. Hes not perfect by any means and hes made mistakes like all of us but hes not the monster the left/mainstream media makes him out to be and he has done some really nice things! Like did you know he charted a plane for Nelson Mandela in 1991 when no one else would? He also donated $100k to help train dogs that would go to help veterans - he admitted he isnt a huge dog person, but his daughter in law is and its something shes passionate about so he wanted to help her. He paid $10k to a bus driver who helped save a suicidal person. He worked with Kim Kardashian to release a lady, Alice Johnson, from prison who was serving a life sentence for a first time drug offense. Hes done so many nice things that the media doesnt show- its quite sad. I recommend watching the podcasts to see him and hopefully thatll help you see a different side of him. To me, he just seems like a loving grandpa who talks too much and still has his humor lol. But outside of that, you know hes tough and a straight shooter which is why other countries respected us more when he was in power. You need that sort of toughness to run a country. Here are some of the podcasts-Maintaining with Tyrus https://youtu.be/nwQil7tcImI?si=D045LRqLWn0zYTEl-Joe Rogan https://youtu.be/hBMoPUAeLnY?si=KgJ-XItRQ466zQ3q-Theo Von https://youtu.be/vC5cHjcgt5g?si=cfiJ1-wyy7aCyhBtHe went on a lot more so you can google them I dont want to overwhelm you!Also just in general, I recommend watching the last 5 or so episodes of Joe Rogan (Im a female and I just started listening since the trump episode and Rogan is great! He asks thought provoking questions and he has a wide variety of guests from both sides)I also recommend looking up some of these accounts on IG for unbiased info:@i.am.link@grand_ole_evan@jordanismylawyerHope this helps and thanks again for wanting to learn more and try and see both sides!","title":"Teenager curious about Trump"},{"text":"Not all of it is effective, but there is a very comprehensive list of specific policies theyve passed to lower prices.

This was something that was a talking point in the 2016 and 2020 DNC primary elections; Bernie needed to concede to unify, they said. Bernie drew voters to Trump by not backing Hillary immediately, they said. So Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Buttigieg all fell in line, and there was nothing wrong with that either. If anything, these people all put their party over themselves.This really, IMO, mostly falls on Biden. I don't know when the mistake was made. Maybe it was not dropping out sooner. Maybe it was not replacing the Attorney General. Maybe it was running at all in 2020, or not running in 2016. Yes, we can blame Mitch McConnell and the other Republicans, of course.

People seem to need someone to hate, someone to look down on, and someone to fear most especially. It is hardwired in the human animal it looks like. People don't really follow politics all that closely, despite what reddit seems to suggest. People are busy trying to survive. Easily digestible soundbites end up doing all of the work. My fear for the future is a country without an opposition party, and social media inundated with bots pushing propaganda, where you can't tell what's true and what's not and justy disengage. (I know, I know...)  If the opposition is completely ineffective at getting their message across, it comes out to the same. You HAVE to have a valid opposition, unless you prefer One-Party Rule. I think whoever is pulling the strings needs to go out and talk to regular people more and do some introspection and analysis. Quit shaming people for not voting for them and find out WHY. My take as a left-libertarian.","title":"A question for the remaining Democratic Party Faithful..."},{"text":"There is a way to talk about it that is smart, politically. And I welcome people who can do that to continue to speak up. But I do believe that the party has become somewhat subsumed by the issue in this last election cycle and that, to me at least, the discussions I observe from progressives on this issue strike me as problematic. Whether the notion originated from within the party or without, if you asked many Americans to list what the D partys main concerns were. What they were politically focused on. I imagine many respondents would struggle to come up with any other issue other than this issue.Within the leftist spaces themselves, here on Reddit for example, this issue tends to dominate the feeds. To me, a leftist, it feels like its been a constant barrage. Which could be ok, in theory, I whole heartedly support trans rights but if you enter any of these threads and observe those discussions, what you see is leftist people being amazingly nasty. You see brigading. You see people ganging up on a person.  Smearing that person as human garbage. And most of the times the recipient of all of this is a died-in-the-wool progressive whos voted D their entire voting lives. Now I dont know if this happens on other social media, but I have seen a constant stream of it here on Reddit over the last few years. And its beyond off-putting. Its borderline revolting. Since the events of October 7th and those that followed, you could see this same ugliness and vitriol. People voicing their support for human rights - basic human rights - for Palestinian people yet, inexplicably, they are getting absolutely destroyed and harassed by the progressives who have determined their support is not radical enough. Im having a hard time explaining this phenomenon but I have GOT to imagine youve seen loads of it on this app and know what Im talking about.","title":"Texas Democratic chair resigns after blaming election losses on transgender issues"},{"text":"Sanders analysis of the election was to soon and to harsh.

Finding a common culprit is ideal, and an easy one even better. Calamities like Harris failure cannot be reduced to one flaw, as much as that search may be tempting. But conceding ground to the winners, as seems to be the case here in a culture-war fight that is as over-simplified as it is ill-considered, is not a way to dig out of this deep hole. Rather than ask why Democrats didnt do more to explain that standing up for trans kids is just the right thing to do, these politicians are trying to absolve their compatriots silence. No one would describe Allreds response as being woke or even inclusive, but at least he said something in the crass pursuit of winning a campaign. The silence elsewhere from Democrats, hoping the bullying of trans students would just go away, was no better.At this point, I'm feeling like I'm just done supporting the Democratic Party. LGBTQ+ people voted the most loyally with them in the election, and yet, they want to throw trans people under the bus, because they find it an easy scapegoat for their failure.

(Or at least I would hope we all would)Dems had an opportunity to solidify / get back the working class in 2016 but worked hard against it, thinking giving platitudes were enough, and counting on support for otherwise disenfranchised groups.Sadly, while I'm willing to live with lower financial means if it means ensuring lgbt folk, racial minorities etc can get basic human rights, this is not true of the electorate at large. Hell, even many staunch democrats were willing to continue funding genocide if it meant getting a specific policy they personally benefited from.Yes, I realize the economy may technically be numerically better as a whole, but most of this only served to benefit the Bezoses of the world. So many people are actually struggling even more to pay higher prices on basic needs like rent and food.

There is absolutely no way to judge if a winning candidate would or could have emerged, nor whether a candidate with a better chance than Biden would have. There are no \\"next generation\\" Dems with national recognition so there is no way to even make an educated guess at how any potential candidates would have faired in a national competition. It would have been a pure leap of faith and that's it. Biden was an extremely well tested candidate with national recognition dating back long before he became president and he had already beaten a slew of supposed \\"rising stars\\" and \\"next generation leaders\\" in 2020. On top of that, the notion that any Democrat, whether they served in the administration or not, could run in opposition to Biden's four years as president is just a fantasy. That is not how it works. Any Democrat was going to have to be willing to defend Biden's record. When your party is the party in power you *cannot* credibly run as the change candidate. Also, due to the previous two points, there is a strong possibility that a primary would have resulted in party in fighting and division based on clashes and arguments over the current administration to the point that the entire party and the party platform would have been irredeemably weakened. Even with Biden willingly stepping down without ever announcing for reelection the primary process would inevitably revolve in large part around disagreements about the current administration, and this would inevitably result in criticisms of the currently governing Biden administration from *within Biden's  own party* being greatly amplified on the national stage. This would have been harmful to any Democratic candidate. You just cannot tear down you own side when you are the party in power. Look at the history of US elections. It does not work.","title":"Pelosi Laments Bidens Late Exit and the Lack of an Open Primary"},{"text":"To be fair, that was the adage.

Our politicians do not represent us and our system works against us, the people.We need a new system that will empower us to govern ourselves today, in the environment in which we live - not a system of 'isms'. The Political/Religious/Social forces/movements/philosophies of our time have been misrepresented/misconstrued that they have become undefinable and thus, meaningless.

These are all very different - only loosely related - ideas.Second, **even if** swing voters really do believe Kamala is too focused on transgender issues (which we don't know), that **doesn't** mean swing voters have immense antipathy toward transgender people and want to see politicians be more mean toward them and support public policy that makes their lives worse.

But if you don't cheat, the cheaters just keep eroding the status further. If you can justify cheating because *they* cheat, can they not use the same justification to cheat too? *maybe* if both sides are cheating in the same way, they could come to an agreement to stop, but why? If one side gains an advantage, they wouldn't agree to stop. If neither side gains any advantage either way, why would they use any of their influence just to increase \\"fairness\\" for its own sake without changing outcomes? The conclusion is that Democracy enters a slow but spiraling trajectory of failure the very instant that the law is not equal and fair both in the way it's written and how justice is dispensed. It's not that damage is irreversible, but it gets more damaging if allowed to persist until it isn't reversible.\\nIt's probably not a coincidence that in every case I can think of, the biggest violators are extremely rich. The vast majority of people view some modest inequality as perfectly fair. Some people are smarter and work harder, and they deserve some benefits. People don't like perfect equality, but they don't like extreme inequality either. It is my belief that future attempts at democracy must focus on equality at its foundation, and bake in hard checks to limit the concentration of wealth and power.","title":"Jeffries: Still a clear pathway for Democratic majority in House as votes are counted"},{"text":"Dean Phillips was openly mocked and ridiculed for daring to challenge Biden.

Only 2 that I know of actually focused on trans issues in their campaign, Allred and Brown ran ads *against* trans women in sports, and they both lost. The republicans are the ones who spent $20 million+ on transphobic advertising to convince the American people that Dems are too focused on trans issues. And while I think its stupid, as a trans person, to vote for anyone but Democratstheyve consistently fallen short in protecting us and I definitely feel the disillusionment that led your friend to vote for someone else. But to me thats more a symptom of the broader issue with American electoral politics nowadays, which is really that the majority of Americans are misinformed and ignorant. Most people arent paying attention beyond the big social media talking points, so theyre vulnerable to manipulation by foreign powers, corporate media, and the similarly misinformed views of the people around them. People also arent really talking about voter suppression as a contributing factor to Republican victories, but its been a consistent strategy of conservatives in America since Black people got the right to vote. They know very well that Democrats lose when turnout is low. Election Day still isnt a holiday. Red and purple states alike purged their voter rolls several times this year, targeting voters who are more likely to vote Dem. Some states even allow citizens to report registered voters to try to get them kicked off the rolls! How many people got turned away at the polls and didnt know they could get a provisional ballot? And how many mail-in ballots were lost or delayed USPS was defunded and DeJoy is still postmaster general? My point is that it really isnt so simple as Democrats needing better messaging. They needed better strategy to figure out how to get people to turn out despite all the barriers to voting. Messaging should have been part of that, but they also needed much stronger grassroots efforts to get voters registered and informed. I dont think they understood how much of an uphill battle they were fighting, which is extremely frustrating considering how 2016 went.","title":"Texas Democratic chair resigns after blaming election losses on transgender issues"},{"text":"She can speak out against him all she wants.She chose not to","title":"Pelosi Laments Bidens Late Exit and the Lack of an Open Primary | Had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race, the former House speaker said in an interview with The New York Times, suggesting she had anticipated an open primary."},{"text":"That's part of the problem, sure.

Raising minimum wage is great, in theory, but it will take years for other wages to adjust. Most of those people struggling aren't making minimum wage.

The Democratic party performed the act of democratic genocide in plain view and proceeded to gaslight everyone that Kamala Harris was already chosen as the candidate based on her unelected placement as the vice president on the election ticket.?\\n0% the fault of Joe Biden who practically had his arm twisted out of location and into submission and definitely didn't drop out without a lot of his own Democratic party excoriating and demolishing his candidacy. This was 100% the fault of the media, George Clooney, Pelosi, Obama, no name congress people, etc. Candidate switcheroo strategies that rob Dem primary voters of their primary choice for Joe Biden, all over a tenuous June debate performance, are always a really bad idea that really contaminated the democratic process of every vote counts; this strategy should've been avoided at all costs. If this was a real primary candidate selection rather than a default excuse to the effect of, \\"it's too late now to pick another candidate now type choice,\\" then the media's much hyped, \\"So much enthusiasm behind Kamala Harris,\\" and alleged $1 billion raised BS would've equalled an actual win at the ballot box. It was all nonsensical strategy and had zero to do with misogyny and racism. If there was a real primary, then I wouldn't have had to cross out, \\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,\\" and write in, \\" Joseph R Biden Jr and current Vice President,\\" (to avoid confusion). I woul've? had zero objection to casting my vote for Kamala Harris, a WOMAN OF COLOR, following a real primary with Kamala Harris having received the most votes at the top of the ticket, but this just wasn't that scenario. Our primary ballot in the March San Francisco, California ballot did not identify the name of a running mate and only included the name, \\"Joseph R Biden Jr,\\" as the candidate for president and that was our selection in March and in the November general election. Our California vote doesn't count anyway and apparently our primary vote in March was completely ignored.The power players and Democrat elites forced away many votes or forced write-in candidates.

If you care about progressive policies, the only viable option is to vote blue. Liberals are the best shot we have at making meaningful change (or even just staying afloat), and hopefully the DNC will learn from this. Maybe in 2028 well primary a young Bernie Sanders or AOC, with a platform that has more substance than Im not Trump. Your emotions are valid and I encourage you to take some time to feel them, but ultimately if you care about change youre gonna have to think about the bigger picture and be strategic. Dont be the emotion-driven idealistic stereotype conservatives want you to be. Let your values guide you, accept that progress will be incremental (if you voted for Harris, you already know this), and if youre understandably unsatisfied with the Democratic Party, take some action to try to improve it.

The Democratic Party adapted policies in support of Civil Rights in opposition to the Jim Crow laws enacted in Southern States that mandated separation of white &amp; black people, red-line laws, separation in education (Brown vs Board of Education), lynchings, etc.  when President LBJ (a Democrat) signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, essentially ALL of the Southern Democrats, the Dixiecrats, abandoned the Democratic Party &amp; joined the Republican Party in protest &amp; opposition to Civil Rights, Equal Rights, etc.  As happens with people, they move for jobs, &amp; many other reasons, so we have a lot of Southerners (not all Southern US citizens are racist, but by history, most of them have been - hates teaches hate &amp; needs hate &amp; fear to continue to grow) moved out of the South &amp; to other parts of the US.  This is where you find a lot of the racist policies &amp; racist dog-whistles you hear coming from Trump - these are his people.  The KKK has morphed into White Militia groups, like The 3 Percenters &amp; The Proud Boys, and many more, who were solidly represented at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  Charles Koch &amp; his Bros, born &amp; raised in Kansas, family of oil-barons, still one of the richest people in the USA, joined the Libertarian Party (founded in 1971), whose platform emphasizes individual liberty (freedom) in personal &amp; economic affairs (stress economic), avoidance of foreign entanglements (isolationism &amp; America First), free trade &amp; migration (Wikipedia definition).  As the Libertarianism Party couldnt really get enough voters to get behind its platform, they kinda bought-up the Republican Party who rolled right over for all the financial backing &amp; money that Charles Koch &amp; many other ultra-rich billionaires gave them (this is the impetus behind Citizens United decision of the SCOTUS), at about the time that Ronald Reagan, a charismatic actor who was active in California politics, &amp; who they supported.  After 50 yrs of billions &amp; billions of dollars poured into the GOP (Grand Ole Party - what it was back-in-the-days of the Civil War, now the Republican Party), through many tax-free organizational &amp; research groups, like The Heritage Foundatiin, the GOP adopted many of the ideas of the Libertarian Party - this is where the marriage of fiscal conservatism (the idea that people shouldnt have to pay taxes, at least the rich corporate &amp; business class) &amp; racial bigotry, hatred &amp; resentment occurs.  Theyre all still very much of the Republican Party believers belief system (now, to be fair, not all Republicans are selfish &amp; racist, but, to be fair also, many are, &amp; you can hear the subtle gas-lighting &amp; dog-whistles in the speeches of Trump, etc.).  Then, and still, in the 1960s - 1980s, Republicans still had a hard time getting voters to join their party in a solid-enough way as to ensure winning National elections.  The pendulum of history had swung to the Left in politics - the Civil Rights mvmt, the Kennedys War on Poverty, the backlash of young people against conservative beliefs (this was when the SCOTUS struck down state laws banning marriage between people of different races, when SCOTUS decided that states couldnt prevent the use of birth control by people, that women couldnt be discriminated against, prior, they couldnt take out loans, own a credit card or have their own private checking account in most states prior to 1974, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), &amp; Roe v Wade, decided in 1973, that women all across the USA had equal rights to Abortion &amp; Reproductive Care.  This is what MAGA means, the Koch Bros, Heritage Foundation, etc, have been pushing since they joined the Republican Party to have many, if not all of these Freedoms &amp; Rights repealed).  In the 1970s the GOP courted &amp; incorporated the Moral Majority political mvt, a Born Again Christian mvt, mostly of white followers, into the folds of the Republican Party.  Many White Christian churches (some Evangelical, some Catholic, Pentecostal, the Christian Liberty Party, etc), have congregations that believe in Christian Dominianism, a belief that God gave them the theological mandate to rule the USA - this is where you see them pray over Trump, &amp; he says things like I will protect you &amp; I am your salvation, because most of them believe that he was sent by God to help them enact their beliefs on the American Public, the 1st big one was the Dobbs Decision by the SCOTUS &amp; his appointment of 3 additions SCOTUS Justices on the Supreme Court.

Policies that could have been prevented by a truly deserving Democratic candidate.-Cornel West is a fine intellectual but a horrible politician. Still, his critique of American politics, which he gave in a recent conversation with Chris Hedges, was spot on.-West said the U.S. system (both Biden and Trump, of course) consists of legalized bribery, normalized corruption, and politicized larceny. That both Harris and Trump represented business as usual in DC. That those within the Beltway bubble are obsessed with careers, careers that feature conformity, complacency, and cowardice. That success is measured in terms of power and profit, where profit is put over the health of the planet, and where morality and spirituality simply dont matter.-I doubt any of this will change under Donald Trump.-I noticed this blurb courtesy of FP: Foreign Policy:-    The Ukraine aid scramble. More than $6 billion in outstanding U.S. military aid to Ukraine has yet to make its way to the country, but the Biden administration plans to rush that out the door before Trumps inauguration, two administration officials told Politico. Yet there are challenges to doing so quickly enough, and Trump could still stop shipments once he takes office.-That blurb is a big reason why Biden/Harris lost in 2024. They areor at least seem to bemuch more concerned about rushing (mostly military) aid to Ukraine (more than $6 billion between now and early January) than getting aid to Americans who are suffering. And that military aid is incredibly generous compared to the parsimonious funds offered to Americans.","title":"Kamala Harris Deserved Better?
