However, due to the fact that white Christian nationalism and white supremacy have intersected over the years, they tend to cherry-pick symbols, texts, and traditions that serve its purposes, regardless of their original meaning. While Latin and Catholic elements may not be central to white supremacist ideology, there are instances of co-opting Catholic imagery (such as Crusader crosses) or rhetoric to justify their beliefs.I understand your concerns about the disconnect between Catholicism and white supremacy. However, my point was to highlight their association. symbols or traditions not inherently tied to hate can be weaponized by those with hateful agendas, which complicates things.Now regarding your concerns about giving up something just because theyve co-opted it for their movement boils down to his position. When youre working in politics or on a public stage in general it is paramount that youre aware of these things.

His numbers of combined removals &amp; returns (returns are people convinced to leave without challenging) was the lowest of any administration since LBJ. Administrative changes to USCIS, ICE &amp; CBP bogged down the system so it was harder for them to do their jobs.\\nOn the visa/lawful immigration side wait times increased enormously due to additional checks &amp; interviews he introduced. I'm sure this will happen again. From personal experience I had to do my 10y LPR renewal in 2011 and it took about 19 months for USCIS to simply press the button to send my card for printing.\\nThis is obviously bad for those seeking to immigrate but it provides an insight on what we should expect with removals next year. The current wait time for an initial immigration court hearing is 762 days, it peaked at 934 days during Trump's first term. The current average time for an asylum petition to make it through the court is 2096 days, nearly 6 years. 56% of asylum cases are denied. Immigration courts cleared 911k cases last FY with 1.799m new cases. DHS also don't have enough staff, they failed to file appearances in about 200k removal cases last year which resulted in those cases being dropped.\\nRemovals (IE those who are not seeking asylum or who have failed an asylum claim) the current time for a case to be decided is 805 days.\\nIn short; even without an increase in enforcement the system is unable to handle its current case load in a timely manner. There are 600 immigration judges currently which is based on how much congress appropriates for the system, last FY that was $840m. This also funds lawyers for those facing deportation, depending on the type of case they may or may not get a court appointed lawyer.\\nI don't see congress agreeing to correctly fund the immigration court system given they never have before.\\n# Detention of Migrants\\nCongress provided $3.4b last FY for a capacity of 41,500 migrant detentions. This is why the parole program exists, flows have been too high to hold migrants until they have an initial hearing to establish a bond. Current flows are so high that there isn't even capacity to temporarily detain migrants to fully establish identity.\\nThere is no excess capacity for any form of operation to detain a significant number of migrants.\\nBased on the $82k/migrant cost congress would have to authorize a spend $820b/year to detain 10 million migrants. This would be the 3rd most expensive program the US government operates. This doesn't seem a likely outcome.\\n# Actually performing removals\\nEven if Trump gets here and predisposing they have enough planes &amp; busses to actually deport people (for reference a fleet of 200-300 737's would be required to deport 10,000,000 people in a year, they will need to rent American's entire fleet of 737's or half of Southwest) the next problem is getting countries to accept them back.\\nCurrently the US has removal agreements with Mexico and the EU. Mexico is not the largest source of migrants. Based on removals data last FY the top 5 are:\\n* Honduras - 56,319\\n* Mexico - 52,431\\n* Guatemala - 51,035\\n* Nicaragua - 26,305\\n* Colombia - 21,584\\nMexico is currently the only one on that list with a removals agreement where the US is guaranteed to be able to deport Mexican citizens to Mexico. Its the only case where the US can simply notify them, they will be deporting people and then do it.\\nAll other cases the US has to work with the government to accept the citizens back. They can absolutely refuse deportations. For instance Venezuela has been refusing deportations since February 2024.\\nCountries will not accept back large flows they have trouble providing assistance for, for instance Guatemala have a cap of 52,000 a year currently. They won't accept back people if they are not being treated appropriately, for instance Mexico have made clear they will cancel the existing removal treaty if due process is not followed.\\nCriminal deportations are harder and more expensive. Countries are reluctant to accept back criminals, they require special detention and removal from the US.\\nI don't see the net flow of removals increasing substantially. There are some carrots an admin could use but this wouldn't be consistent with how Trump did foreign policy last time. I am going to be very interested to see what he does about Venezuela.\\n# Changing status\\nWhile there isn't a physical reason they can't detain people who have parole/other status I do think it's worth pointing out judges don't look kindly on retroactive changes to bond conditions. People who are paroled pending a hearing are no different to someone who saw a judge and received a PR bond. The only way that can be legally changed is if a judge revokes their parole.\\n# Birthright Citizenship\\nThe US inherited *jus soli* (citizenship by place of birth) from the colonies, it's a common law concept. SCOTUS confirmed this in [Talbot v. Jansen (1795)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/3/133/) and it was reconfirmed many times until passage of the 14th Amendment.\\nThe 14th amendment codified jus soli. Some commenters are claiming that intent was not birthright citizenship however both the plain English reading of the amendment and the congressional record of the debate discussing its passage make clear both those for and against its passage agreed it was establishing jus soli for *all* people irrespective of race or national origin. A quote from the debate is mentioned in nearly every court case that touches on this.\\nSenator Cowan (PA) asked:\\nWhether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?\\nSenator Trumbull (IL) replied:\\nUndoubtedly, is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen?\\nSenator Cowan replied:\\nThe children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese.\\nSenator Trumbull replied:\\nThe law makes no such distinction, and the child of an Asiatic is just as much a citizen as the child of a European.\\nThere have been very occasional mentions in federal court decisions that maybe this doesn't apply to illegal immigrants however that would struggle with the problem that people not subject to US jurisdiction can't be illegal immigrants; if the US has jurisdiction to remove them then their children born here are US citizens.","title":"Trumps Knock on the Door The former president and his aides are formulating plans to deport millions of migrants."},{"text":"Honestly, I wish trump won in 2020 now.Trump has sailed on two recovering economys now and is falsely taking credit for both.Dems would've had 4 years to pick a fresh new candidate.","title":"Just a thought here .if Trump won in 2020, he would be leaving the White House in January ..does anyone think back and wonder this ?"},{"text":"It's just a hassle to get banned in my state Reddit, buy mods that probably don't even live here!","title":"Apparently i got permanantly banned for this?"},{"text":"Okay and exactly how do you research the regional and global techno-commercial resource availability in the latter half of the 21st century with any credibility?

I see a world where children are harmed &amp; religious organizations cover it up and still present themselves as moral authority. Our existences are less safe since the first time he ran. I am angry and rightfully so that someone fueling hate &amp; violence is someone anyone could support. The GOP should have fallen apart long ago, or  distanced themselves from his rhetoric. So, yes. It is ironic. I've always thought we were screwed with a 2 party system. I grew up &amp; was watching the news since the George HW Bush. Which means I grew up through that war. No one had to tell me what wasn't adding up. Increasing the threat of safety to our own citizens is a damn problem. Don't you agree? So, my frustration with everything isn't because I \\"buy into\\" shit.It's because the GOP has run on hate &amp; promoted division within our people, and it is clear to me that it's far worse than even what may have laid dormant within some.

I mean all kinds, not just salary. Some occupations are exempt, some specific types of work (like seasonal work) are exempt. You can go Google FLSA to get a whole list. What the judge ruled is that the Dept of Labor didn't have the authority to raise the salary limit, because that conflicted with some of the other exemptions. I went and read the judgment and this wasn't just a judge making a political ruling, there were real issues with the DOL not having the authority to make the kind of change they were trying to make.

Four years ago, Trump refused to concede defeat to Biden, spreading baseless conspiracy theories that ultimately fueled the January 6 Capitol attack. This time, Biden hosted Trump with the calm demeanor he has championed as essential to preserving democracy, emphasizing collaboration with Trumps transition team to ensure a smooth handover of federal responsibilities.The transition stands in stark contrast to Trumps behavior in 2020, when his administration delayed key bureaucratic processes, stalling necessary preparations for the incoming Biden administration. By contrast, the Biden administration has been proactive, with the General Services Administration promptly acknowledging Trumps victory and initiating the transfer of administrative services. This underscores Bidens dedication to upholding democratic norms, even in the face of political rivalry.Another defining moment will occur on January 6, 2025, when Vice President Kamala Harris fulfills her duty to certify the election results, a solemn task performed in the very spot pro-Trump extremists overran four years prior. Her actions, alongside Bidens, illustrate a commitment to democracy that transcends personal political ambition, offering a fleeting return to normalcy before the uncertainties of a second Trump presidency. Together, these actions serve as a final testament to Bidens belief in the resilience of democratic principles.","title":"The Biden-Trump White House meeting was more than just a photo-op"},{"text":"Exactly why he chose them, not to run the country well but to \\"own libruls'\\"","title":"Trump names fossil fuel executive Chris Wright as energy secretary"},{"text":"\\nThere is no climate crisis.

In his book The Coddling of the American Mind, Haidt and his colleague Greg Lukianoff argue that the proliferation of three great untruths, namely what doesnt kill you makes you weaker, always trust your feelings, and life is a battle between good people and evil people, have set the stage for political absolutism on college campuses. By holding sacred the ideas of intersectionality, microaggressions, trigger warnings and other like terms, Haidt contends that a generation has been set up for failure, instilled with a mindset towards safetyism, the acceptance of revisionist history, and the belief that institutions that did not guarantee equitable outcomes must be intrinsically inequitable.

This is [nothing new](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2022/11/07/gop-sues-reject-mail-ballots/):Republicans have waged a sustained campaign against alleged voter fraud. Experts say the litigation  which could significantly affect Tuesdays vote  represents a parallel strategy of suing to disqualify mail ballots based on technicalities. While the rejections may have some basis in state law, experts say they appear to go against a principle, enshrined in federal law, of not disenfranchising voters for minor errors.The suits coincide with a systematic attempt by Republicans  led by Donald Trump  to persuade GOP voters to cast their ballots only on Election Day. Critics argue that the overall purpose is to separate Republicans and Democrats by method of voting and then to use lawsuits to void mail ballots that are disproportionately Democratic.Theyre looking for every advantage they can get, and theyve calculated that this is a way that they can win more seats, said Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections for Common Cause, a nonpartisan democracy advocacy organization. Research has shown that absentee ballots are more likely to be discarded if they are voted by young people and people of color, which are not generally seen as the Republican base. Albert said legal battles over mail ballot eligibility have the potential to delay results and even change outcomes.I think part of Muskrats overall strategy was also submitting a lot of fraudulent ballots on behalf of Latino votersin a perverse attempt to turn the 2020 election fraud theory on its head. Its just their pathetic schoolyard bully variation of two can play that game.Also consider [fElons illegal sweepstakes](https://electionlawblog.org/?p=146397) that was **only** available for registered voters in swing states.

In the twenty-first century, those are simple: dying in bed as a billionaire.  To enrich himself and to stay out of prison, the strongman dismantles the justice system and replaces civil servants with loyalists. The new bureaucrats will have no sense of accountability.  Basic government functions will break down. Citizens who want access will learn to pay bribes.  Bureaucrats in office thanks to patronage will be corrupt, and citizens will be desperate.  Quickly the corruption becomes normal, even unquestioned. As the fantasy of strongman rule fades into everyday dictatorship, people realize that they need things like water or schools or Social Security checks.  Insofar as such goods are available under a dictatorship, they come with a moral as well as a financial price.  When you go to a government office, you will be expected to declare your personal loyalty to the strongman.   \\nIf you have a complaint about these practices, too bad.  Americans are litigious people, and many of us assume that we can go to the police or sue.  But when you vote a strong man in, you vote out the rule of law.  In court, only loyalism and wealth will matter.  Americans who do not fear the police will learn to do so.  Those who wear the uniform must either resign or become the enforcers of the whims of one man.__________________________________\\nEverybody (except the dictator and his family and friends) gets poorer.  The market system depends upon competition.  Under a strongman, there will be no such thing.  The strongman's clan will be favored by government.  Our wealth inequality, bad enough already, will get worse.  Anyone hoping for prosperity will have to seek the patronage of the official oligarchs. Running a small business will become impossible.  As soon as you achieve any sort of success, someone who wants your business denounces you. In the fantasy of the strongman, politics vanishes and all is clear and bright.  In fact, a dreary politics penetrates everything.  You can't run a business without the threat of denunciation.  You can't get basic services without humiliation.  You feel bad about yourself.  You think about what you say, since it can be used against you later.  What you do on the internet is recorded forever, and can land you in prison.[The Strongman Fantasy\\nAnd Dictatorship in Real Life](https://snyder.substack.com/p/the-strongman-fantasy)","title":"Trump Picks Man Who Helped Him Get Away With Crimes to Run the Courts"},{"text":"Lawfare","title":"Trump team weighs Pentagon pick after sexual assault allegation surfaces | Stars and Stripes"},{"text":"They wont learn anything.

It shows that us Democrats are as racist as Republicans.?First, lots of hot takes saying that the results prove that Muslims and Arabs are more conservative than the average American. This looking at the numbers, Trump and the conservative goons only got plurality of votes, not the majority of Arab and Muslim votes. To the contrary, the left got the majority of Muslim and Arab votes, but it was split between Stein and Harris. In that same election, a Democrat overwhelmingly won the Arab and Muslim vote for House race. This Representative has voted in favor of abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, Medicare expansion, among many things, demonstrating that she and her constituents are not conservatives.Second, stop conflating Arabs and Muslims. A huge percentage of the Arab population on Michigan is and has always been Christian. Same with a lot of Palestinians suffering Israeli aggression right now, especially at the West Bank, are Christians.Finally, Im also mad that Kamala lost and that people voted against their self-interests. However, instead of attacking them, why not reflect on why were losing those voters? Last time we lost, we were upset that the working class voted for Trump, mocking them because Trumps policies would hurt them in the long run. Did that help us earn their votes back? No. We lost the working-class vote even more now (the real reason why we lost Pennsylvania). Now, the way we are behaving will guarantee that well lose Michigan for the foreseeable future.Lets be better at fighting the real fight to defend the vulnerable.

There was a whole institute who researched them. In fact, they performed the first Gender Reassignment Surgery. What happened to them?Oh, right, the first crop of Nazis burned the entire institute to ash, before targeting trans people for removal to concentration camps. Now the New Nazis are trying to segregate trans people from their political base of support, and also happen to be building concentration camps. Huh, That sure is fucking suspicious!Don't buy any of the \\"abandon trans people\\" bullshit, by the way. They're trying to normalize trans people being silenced so when the Republicans move to the extermination phase, there is nobody speaking for or standing up for them.

When it comes to those championing the indefensible addition of known neurotoxin (derived from industrial waste, no less) to all of our drinking water, no rational arguments whatsoever are ever mounted or responded to. It's always straight to appeals to ridicule and/or authority since this strategy was [first outlined by Edward Bernays in the 1950s](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/08/lifeandhealth.health).Now, a new book, The Fluoride Deception by Christopher Bryson, just published in the US, examines the background of the fluoridation debate. Bryson, who has had the advantage of access to recently declassified files, concludes that fluoridation is a triumph not of medical science but of US government spin, adding that, \\"The very same professionals and institutions who told us that fluoride was safe said much the same about lead, asbestos or DDT, or persuaded us to smoke more cigarettes.\\"In fact, in the 1930s, the very first researcher into fluoride, a Dane called Kaj Roholm, specifically advised against exposing children to fluoride, but his work was soon buried. Bryson links **the subsequent \\"discovery\\" that fluoride benefited teeth with research paid for by major US industries that needed to be able to defend \\"lawsuits from workers and communities poisoned by industrial fluoride emissions\\".**In 1955, farmers in Oregon took Reynolds Metals to court, alleging harm from fluoride emissions. The key medical experts for the farmers were Donald Hunter, an English specialist in industrial diseases, who told the court that fluoride was particularly dangerous because it was \\"an enzyme poison\\"; and Dr Richard Capps from Chicago, who gave evidence that fluoride displaced iodine in the body, thus leading to thyroid dysfunction. The farmers won a sensational victory, and US industrialists were shaken.** Dr Robert Kehoe, whose work was funded by major US companies, resolved - according to Bryson - to create a new medical orthodoxy that would be unassailable in future court cases. Kehoe set up an experiment with beagles, with the dogs breathing in fluoride. The results were alarming, and showed that fluoride travelled rapidly from the lungs into the blood stream, causing significant harm. Lawyers for major US companies received copies of the dog study; needless to say, it went no further. Until Bryson found it, no one knew of its existence.**The drive to encourage public acceptance of fluoride was handed over to Edward Bernays, known as the father of PR, or the original spin doctor, and the man who helped persuade women to take up smoking. **\\"You can get practically any idea accepted,\\" Bernays explained, \\"if doctors are in favour. The public is willing to accept it because a doctor is an authority to most people, regardless of how much he knows or doesn't know.\\"**Among the things that the doctors who endorsed fluoridation didn't know, according to Bryson, were that research impugning fluoride's safety was either suppressed or not conducted in the first place. When one doctor reported that fluoride supplements produced harmful side-effects in pregnant women, he received no funding to carry out further work.So fluoride became equated with scientific progress, and those opposing it were dismissed as cranks. For 30 years, little changed, with both sides in their entrenched positions.","title":"Trump just appointed RFKjr to run HHS."},{"text":"Man, this is not an over generalization at all, right?

Biden, and most likely Kamala, would have let Israel annex the West Bank. Israel was making moves to annexing northern Gaza under Biden's administration. Israel was committing a genocide under the Biden/Harris admin. Biden has been the most Pro-Israel president in history, besides Trump. And I'm not sure he wouldn't have just moved the embassy to Jerusalem if Israel had asked him to. Trump just did it because he loves facsists and his rabid evangelical zionist base.Obviously Kamala would have been better on domestic issues. But we do have a uni party when it comes to foreign policy, and Democrats will beat the war drums just like Republicans. Republicans are just more open about it.Blaming the voters is a fool's errand.

In the case of any such determination which was based on classified information (as defined in section 1(a) of the Classified Information Procedures Act), such information may be submitted to the reviewing court ex parte and in camera. For purposes of this subparagraph, a determination with respect to an organizations designation as a terrorist supporting organization shall not fail to be treated as a final determination merely because such organization fails to utilize the dispute resolution process of the Internal Revenue Service Independent Office of Appeals provided under subparagraph (E)..(b) Effective Date.The amendment made by this section shall apply to designations made after the date of the enactment of this Act in taxable years ending after such date.","title":"ACLU warns new House bill would give Trump dangerous tool to stifle free speech and target political enemies"},{"text":"If she was white they would have kicked her off television a long time ago.

So the idea that Democrats must then stay bound to an agreement that the other party backed out of, seems self-defeating.

Having the leader of America democracy fight against tyranny to preserve our democracy is in the spirit of that.Moreover, Biden's oath is to protect and preserve the Constitution. How is he doing that by giving it over to Trump so that Trump can establish an authoritarian government?No I'm not saying Biden has to do it. I'm not saying that he has the resources to do it.

I do not think it means what you think it means. It is ironic though that you would imply I have half a brain without actually responding to any of my premises.If you think Kamala came across as a candidate for all, please enlighten me as to why? Every commercial I saw was either about abortion or trying to convince conservative women it was okay to vote how they wish. Which just offended most of the conservative women I know and actually made them more likely to vote against her, while also voting men to get out and vote just in case their wives were going to listen. I mean, are you seriously going to tell me that Kamala's message didn't come off, vote for me because I'm female and Trump hates females?If you acknowledge that to be true, then why would any man vote for her knowing that she thinks being female makes her inherently superior?I think you and the other guy should practice formal logic. All you're doing is ad hominem. To be clear, ad hominem is a fallacy. \\"If 'everything...'\\" here you are confusing cause and effect. To clarify, I think the vast majority of things Kamala says are either true, or not-quite-false equivocation. I believe Trump tells WAAAAYYYYYYYY more lies. That said, when Biden or Kamala promise to do something, I don't believe they will, or the things they will do, I don't want. Trump promises things I don't want, and I believe he will try to do them. I just hope his incompetence will prevent those things from coming true. Other than confusing cause and effect above, the rest of your statements failed to address what I had said in any significant way, so it is not possible for me to argue against it lmao like, why not provide examples of my self contradiction if it's there. I think you are finding it difficult to distinguish between my criticism of democrats political strategy and criticisms of their policies.  I'm not surprised, as individuals who jump into conversations for which they are not prepared, as you have done, are often incapable of distinguishing such nuances. Therefore, I will enlighten you: it is possible to think that her policies overall are better for society but still not willing to vote for her due to not wanting to contribute to a culture of encouraging victimhood. Maybe people like me are just begging people like you to come back to center so we have a chance to avoid further polarization, but you prefer your extremism.","title":"Good Job, Radical Lefties!

It is certain that the war will end sooner with the policies of the team that will now lead the White House.

Zelensky says there has been some constructive interaction with the US President-elect, Donald Trump, and the Ukrainian side had the opportunity to state its position on the vision of peace in a reasoned manner in an interview with Suspilne published Friday. [Trump] has heard the basis on which we stand. I have not heard anything against our position, he emphasized. To a clarifying question, of whether Trump made a demand for Ukraine to participate in negotiations with Russia, Zelensky answered: We are an independent country. And we, during this war, both our people and I, personally, are in negotiations with the United States, with both Trump and Biden, and with European leaders, proved that the sit and listen rhetoric doesnt work with us. At the same time, the war will end sooner,\\" according to the nominated head of state under the next Trump administration, It is very important for us to have a just peace so that we do not feel that we have lost our best people because of the injustice that has been imposed on us. The war will end, but there is no exact date. Certainly, with the policies of the team that will now lead the White House, the war will end sooner.

What if I told you Trump is partly popular, even on the other side of the aisle, due to demonizing China? So much so that even Biden continued many of his politics wrt China. Now...what if I told you that that tactic isn't something new he invented, but both old - and found aplenty among Dems too? What if I told you that just as Trump demonized millions of people abroad, the Dems have also demonized millions of people at home? And what if I told you that the result in both cases is belligerence.What if I told you that Trump is a narcissist? You'd probably agree. Now what if I told you that ironically many of his opponents are also narcissists? You probably wouldn't. But everytime they exclaim 'it's (current year)!' or about themselves being on the 'right side of history' (which, btw, is a really vacuous and mercenary 'argument' to make) they're basically patting themselves on the back. And what if I told you that, ironically, just as you likely find his narcissism horrible, they feel the same about yours? So much so that they're happy to elect their narcissist to fight it.Have you ever wondered why a rather vacuous warcry like 'own the libs!' exists at all? What kind of a political position is that?! Just how insufferable must you be to give rise to such a thing? 'Own the libs!' isn't about abortion, or taxes, or inflation, or foreign policy, or race, or anything really. It's literally just your side being so unlikeable that they just want to see you taken down.You can demonize them all you want, but ultimately they're your fellow citizens. Learn to live with them, or get used to fighting them till the end of time, weakening the nation as a whole.As a sidenote, this is why I've long felt Singapore is a better model for how to handle diversity. Ghettos and assortative movement ensures people always end up living in self-similar enclaves. Singapore uses its housing system to [force different groups to live together](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/st-explains-what-is-the-ethnic-integration-policy-and-how-does-it-work), not allowing any one to predominate and concentrate in various regions. Unfortunately such a thing is a non-starter in a country like the US, but it would've been better off for it. It even naturally fixes gerrymandering too, but alas it's far too late now. People have already sorted, and divided.And divided they fall.Edit: Btw, this was Nikki Haley, a Republican, criticising owning the libs -I know that it's fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you're accomplishing when you do this. Are you persuading anyone? Who are you persuading? We've all been guilty of it at some point or another, but this kind of speech isn't leadership. It's the exact opposite.Ironically that's a level of self-awareness, introspection and self-reflection that isn't seen in the self-congratulatory opponents they seek to 'own'. They aren't convincing anyone sure, but then neither are you lot. All you're doing is pandering to your own egos, like them.","title":"Dont dare blame Arab and Muslim Americans for Trumps victory"},{"text":"$30 visa gift cards","title":"George Bush Sr Funeral &amp; the Envelopes"},{"text":"Jesus is chill.

When times like these arise in a capitalist democracy, the ability for malicious actors to subvert the will of the people is at a peak.

Only then can we discuss meaningful solutions and find a place where we disagree on ideas as opposed to cheering for a political party like a sports team. This is not sports. We are not fundamentally opposed with our common man. For too long we have been divided and conquered. Religion and politics need not always mix, but to appeal to the good in the hearts of the right is to appeal to the words of Christ. Christ is the greatest commonality between illegal immigrants in our nation and the right, and they claim that Christ is what they put above all.Nothing else is going to get through based on where they are now.

I was a completely healthy adult 10 years ago who rode my bike to work in decent weather and had lost 40 lbs on weight watchers and kept it off. I got sick suddenly and nobody seemed to be able to tell me why. I was misdiagnosed repeatedly for about 7 years and finally got a diagnosis that makes sense with a treatment that helps but isnt helping me as much as avoiding processed food and chemicals. I installed a reverse osmosis in my house to filter all the water we cook and eat with. I only use free and clear chemicals to clean. I rarely eat out. I dont eat any wheat at all. I dont drink alcohol or soda. There are still chemicals that cannot be avoided. My medicine was making me worse. I weaned myself from drugs that had the worst side effects. I found natural supplements that give the positive effects on my health that I took meds for with significantly tamer side effects than the meds. I take probiotics. I exercise in a significantly different way than most people now because the muscles I need to work are in my hands and legs. I have watched many people around me go thru something similar. They each have a different diagnosis. Those who dont change their lifestyles continue to get worse and rely on medicine to tame the side effects of their other medicine. Its a real problem. When I saw that he appointed RFK to the HHS I cried because 95% of the people I talk to act like I am crazy for avoiding all of this. My husband and my kids are the only ones who believe me cuz they saw how bad it got and they knew  it wasnt just laziness on my part. Swimming through all the information out there to figure out whats real and whats not was a huge part of my life. The government and doctors and mainstream media all tell us this is just a hoax but even published studies show its not. We dont have a healthcare system we have a sick care system that aims to keep us sick so they can make more money. I have good insurance and still spent thousands of dollars on medical care only to slowly abandon it when it didnt work. I only take 2 prescriptions now and they are both for vitamin deficiencies so still technically natural. I am in physical therapy and thats the extent of my medical care now. I am improving a lot and I am so hopeful that RFK can help keep the people from having to deal with these types of scenarios.","title":"This is insane.
