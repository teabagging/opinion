I think the point being made is that the different states and cities in America do their own thing, and you should take issue with the folks that did it to you yourself, and allow other people in other areas to agree or disagree with their local governments as they see fit. Considering Chicago, you have only two posts that mention the city, and they are both today, so it certainly seems like you're fighting someone elses fight. You should be using sources local to you, as those are the situations that actually effect you. You shouldn't be deciding for other people in other cities. Also, the local, state, and federal government are all separate entities. It's not just \\"the government\\". Some of those governments apply to you and some don't. If my city got together and decided something as a group to keep the city safe and then someone from Chicago came in and said it was wrong, I'd tell the person from Chicago to mind their own business. It's not up to them. Even if it really really REALLY seems like a bad idea. Because it's worse to allow you as an outsider to force other people's decisions when you have zero business making them for other people.

Regardless of the last time they voted, regardless if they moved somewhere else, regardless if they have dementia and are confined to a nursing home and couldn't name a single candidate on the ballot.  Voter turnout here is usually around 66% participation.  In 2020 it was 74%.  We mailed these, or placed them into ballot drop boxes in our town.  There was no \\"chain of custody\\" or id verification to figure out who filled out the ballot.  So that's where ballot harvesting came in: a friendly volunteer working to \\"Get Out The Vote,\\" would show up to that nursing home to collect everyone's ballot and drop them off.  Maybe they would convince people to fill it out for Biden.  Maybe they would simply concentrate on heavily Dem areas.  There's various levels of legally but sketchy, and fraud.  Also, Republicans in states with choice didn't trust the mail in process.  In many states, there's no way to track your vote to see if it was counted.  There were actual news stories in my state of mail carriers throwing out ballots from heavily Republican areas.  It was a small time, isolated incident, something like a few dozen ballots.  But it stoked fear.  A lot of these procedures were thrown together last minute due to Covid, so people were skeptical.  By 2024, there was time to fix and promote the systems, so R's were more comfortable using it.

For the record: Now Im for trump but I used to be more center/center left on certain things. Mainly I was against trump because I thought he represented something very ugly about us (I no longer think that). Heres how I see this situation and the 4 million delta you mention. I think for Biden, the left was so shocked by 2016 that the thought never again and came out hard in 2020. That is people who care politically but normally think voting doesnt matter much - those people, including myself, came out.Fast forward to 2024 and they no longer felt the same. Why? Three reasons:\\n(1) the left has spent 4 years focusing, from a discourse standpoint, on non-issues (irresolvable) or crazy issues (identity politics)\\n(2) the candidate did not feel like a continuation of good statesmanship Obama/early Biden and was crammed down throats of dems without vetting. She was not particularly competent but more than that she was not very likable. Joe Biden at the time of his electoral victory represented a steady hand and was both likable and compelling in statesman sense *at that time*. Kamala never had that and her messaging was watered down and confusing.\\n(3) but ok Oeuffy does #2 matter if there are never again dems? Yes! Because trump has had 4 more years to normalize his behavior (both in adjusting our expectations and softening his rhetoric) and shift political discourse. He has become much much more palatable. Which means the never againers are chill and de-activated from both ends: they dont find him unpalatable enough to come out, and they didnt find Kamala palatable enough to come out.

When Reps watch Rep Politicians they dont care too deeply about policy besides the broad basics (Immigration, Social Norms, 2nd Ammendment and etc).\\nWhen Rep Voters watch Dem Politicians they dont care too deeply about the Dem Policy because they operate under the assumption that its mostly going to be bad. so its generally Dem Voters like to see Dem Politician's politician's policy so the news agency's ask on that. Nobody really cares about Rep Politician's policy beyond the broad basics.

No, this is what you accused me of last time. I dont have views that are summed up this simply.Except the illegal market is highly related to the legal market, so of course these things are related. The reason why people are so readily able to obtain illegal guns in the US is the abundance of legal guns.I dont dispute this.And yet the poorer regions of Europe also have lower homicide rates. Romania is at 1.26. Serbia is at 1.06. Bulgaria is at 1.28.? And not all poor regions of the US have significant homicide rates either. I didnt say that poverty causes high homicide rates, I said that some blighted areas have cycles of poverty and violence.Happen to have a quantification for the more predictive gang metric? Because so far gangs seem like an ad hoc explanation you can toss in any time you dont want to admit gun access plays a factor.I dont really care what you call the urban violence cycles, but you can look at explicitly gang-related homicides and find a strong correlation between them and the more distributed cases of cycles of violence.Regarding your gun access point, as I pointed out in our last discussion, local gun ownership does not predict local homicide rates.

They use it to pretend things like Republicans are now the majority party or higher turnout now favors Republicans.If Republican turnout is higher than Democratic turnout one election compared to the one before, basic math says--other things equal--all demographics 'shift' toward Republicans. Thus, such analysis is meaningless. Sure, there are particular areas like Latinos or very young men that moved more and we need to look at those. But all this talk about women, or Black people, or whoever is nonsense.We've seen time and again Republicans winning elections on higher turnout--2004 and 2010 for example--but the basic rule still applies, as you said:Turnout is the single largest variable in determining outcomes. Although there was higher turnout in 2004 and 2010 when Republicans won, Democrats came back later with even higher turnout and won.As for Democrats failing to turn out, this is a chronic problem. Every time since Jimmy Carter, Democrats got in on a spike in turnout, 1976, 1992, 2008, 2020, and turnout fell in the next election. But let's not be too glum about these things in 2024. Here are some things to consider:* Donald Trump was wildly popular, attaining higher turnout in 2024 than Barack Obama earned in 2008.* In 2020, Republicans received their highest House turnout ever and still lost. In 2024, they beat that record albeit slightly. We must be reaching the absolute max here and it is lower than Democrats have done.* Republicans reached their highest turnout ever in House elections in 2024 and lost a seat.* Democrats gained their third highest House turnout ever, with only 2008 and 2020 higher.* Kamala Harris in 2024 is ahead in turnout of Barack Obama in 2012 and just a hair behind Donald Trump was in 2020 in turnout, and could still catch up when all votes are counted--which makes her quite popular, not some major failure.Note: all comparisons are adjusted for current population at the time.","title":"A bright spot for Democrats as voters shifted right: Flipping 3 House seats in California"},{"text":"Looks insideenvy and bitternessPriors remain unchallenged","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Would explain the NeinIf she dislikes Germany so much, she shouldnt visit","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Put any redditors on those tracks and they'd shit their pants","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"No. shit.

Foundations are typically thick concrete, while walls are structurally supported with wood but also often include thick stucco, depending on climate. Fiberglass is a common insulator.

Due to Covid, mail in ballots were sent to people that normally wouldnt go out of their way to vote, thus vastly increasing turnout.The reason turnout was down this year is due simply to the lack of Covid and the extreme measures taken during that unusual election year.I very highly doubt there was some kind of mass conspiracy that somehow fabricated millions of votes and there is somehow no evidence of that happening.

In these societies the rich become so deluded that they completely break the social contract.

Historically this ends with average people also ignoring the rules in order to overthrow the rich one way or another. What you are seeing us one way.

Why? Because many of these people who are celebrating the CEO's death might not believe he **deserves** to die, and that in a system with accountability, maybe he would be tried for his role in exploitative consumer practices.I think it's not about **deserves** and killing for the sake of vengeance/punishment. Rather, many people see it as a justified action in context of an oppressive system, and considering that there aren't viable alternatives, an ultimately good act. It's a utilitarian worldview or at least a worldview in which oppression merits response and those who are wronged have permission to fight.Exploitative CEOs have to be punished somehow, not because they're inherently evil and **deserve** death, but because permitting their actions to go unpunished incentivizes further bad behavior. A society which doesn't hold its oppressors to account will see more suffering, more oppression, and more violence. Thus, in context of power structures, striking out at individual members of the corrupt system becomes a crude but justified form of combating an extreme situation. It's not about the individual, though. It's about the system and the necessity of resisting it, by any means necessary.It's also more or less the only option: if the exploitative CEO is not assassinated, he will never go to jail, he will never be punished, and oppressive forces at large will rejoice at their impunity and untouchability.","title":"CMV: If you believe people deserve to die because of their actions, you are in essence in support of capital punishment"},{"text":"Doxxing is 100% of the time done with the purpose of harassment.

It also serves as a signal, that Germany actually cares about defense and deterrence and may have put pressure on other European states to spend in the ~2.5% range.Even if it wouldn't have been enough to deter Russia, it would have been a hell of a lot of materiel to send Ukraine and meant a DIB that could better support the war. I love how people think Germany spending a total of 500-650B on defense *wouldn't* be world changing. Granted Germany's issue were more than just funding, but many of those institutional issues stem from lack of funding.","title":"Merkel-worship was liberalism at its worst"},{"text":"Deliberately targeting a synagogue is pretty sus, no?","title":"CMV: Australian governments have not taken sufficient action to protect Jews"},{"text":"Its funny how gracious the Bidens and Trump are being toward each other despite the years of bitter cutthroat attacks.

A destabilized America with a wrecked economy will likely cause a global depression, with widespread losses and even death. All that to beat a guy who cant run again.

I'm sorry, but nobody cares so much they would go to open war with Israel. Jordan doesn't. Egypt doesn't. Lebanon doesn't. Even Syria, Iran, and Iraq, don't. The most aggression even the most openly hostile states like Iran can afford are long-range strikes that are used for posturing rather than actual military gain, and proxy warfare, which is largely lost by now.As for, lets say, Egypt, it is not in their interest to even be hostile to Israel. This is because there is a very credible threat of extreme violence and destruction as well as American military intervention ( seen with Libya, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq where nearly 4 million people died, entire cities decimated, and wars still raging. ).Those two are very different from each other.  This is very reductive. A credible threat of potential destruction is basically any war, with any country of Israel's level. It applies to France and Germany as well. Also, there are economic relations between Israel and Egypt, and Israel and Jordan. Israel manages and builds desalination plants for Jordan. Egypt trades with Israel in natural gas, heavy machinery, chemicals, and so on. Of course its nowhere near the levels of cooperation and agreement as that of the EU countries, but surely you're not suggesting that countries outside of EU are basically on the brink of all-out war because they are not as friendly.

I wanted to pass on something I intend to publish on Syria and Iran, because I think it is worth trying to urge the President and his political advisers to act. As you can see from today's column by Jackson Diehl, the pundits and many in the media will push the Syria issue very hard for the foreseeable future. It may not be on the front burner every day, but it will be close to or at the top of the media's attention indefinitely. Interestingly, the Republicans have showed their hand on the foreign policy debate, in which inaction on Syria is pretty much the only serious criticism they can offer that will stick. As you will see from the attached piece, I believe that action on Syria will forestall the biggest danger on the horizon, that Israel launches a surprise attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Although the pressure has now eased for a variety of reasons, it will return. Action by Washington on Syria, on the other hand, I believe will eliminate much of the urgency for Israeli action. In other words, a more aggressive policy on Syria will eliminate the best case the republican's have going into the November election, will ease substantially the pressure on Israel to attack Iran and possibly spark a wider war in the Middle East, and finally would be the right stance on Syria going forward. I know you may not agree but I thought it was better to share this with you first as at least a new way to look at the problem. All best, your friend, Jamie James P.

The democrats have become so obsessed with being right that they no longer care about winning. I have no use, for example, for a justice department who wont convict a president who does coups why do I care about that institution if it cant protect the government. LGBTQ right dont matter already because the government is incapable of protecting any right for anyone! Billionaires can buy politics and CEOs can decide you die. Cops can kill whomever they want, and the courts do nothing. Ive got my own problems. Government needs to address those problem before I give a fuck about anyone elses.

A lot of work goes into producing proof that health care is necessary for insurers, and then insurers spend a lot of work to deny those claims. Hospital/doctors and Pharma come up with complicated payment systems that insurers and then users have to end up navigating (there is a sticker price, which gets charged to uninsured, and then each insurer negotiates a different discount - and none of it is available before treatment, you just have to see what the bill is afterwards).

Assuming Trump manages to maintain the economy (a big if), I would argue that the tide in which Asian and Hispanic voters moving to the Republican Party will be complete. The issue stems from the radical progressives. Progressive justice and crime has failed urban cities, let criminals back on the street and destroyed democratic credibility on crime. The problem is that Asian and Hispanic voters have become a victim on this progressive crime approach as their communities have been wrecked. The same is true of illegal immigration and free services to illegal immigrants in big cities. Actual Hispanic and Asian American are furious. Asian specifically are tired to Asian hate crimes and the abolition of advanced placement classes and institution of affirmative action or diversity quotas. This stuff is deeply unpopular. \\nAdd in to the fact that Democratic NIMBYs have destroyed all credibility for democrats on making housing more affordable. Nimbyism may be a bipartisan problem, but republicans are still building single family homes throughout their states while democrats abuse environmental law and put ridiculous regulations to prevent the construction of either single family or high density homes. The progressives are the problem on most issues This new diverse coalition is not going to disappear in 2026. For instance, The New York Governors race may cost democrats, seats in NY again.

However, I don't think this policy supports your point for two reasons. Firstly, it wasn't something that was particularly focussed on in the campaign. Secondly, [most Americans support a wealth tax](https://www.excessivewealth.org/tax-polling-report), which is just another term for the unrealised gains tax. So here, we see that not only do 63% of Americans support this tax, but even 51% of Republicans support this tax. So I don't see how a policy that even Republicans support would cause them to lose the campaign.Now, you talk about bipartisanship on the BBB bill, but again this was very popular, with [above 60% of Americans consistently supporting the bill](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/12/15/majority-of-voters-support-the-build-back-better-act-and-reject-republican-talking-points). Again, on the filibuster change, [over 70% of Americans say that getting rid of the filibuster rule would help fix the current political system](https://navigatorresearch.org/three-in-four-americans-feel-getting-rid-of-the-filibuster-would-have-a-positive-impact/), including 64% of Republicans.Here's the gist. Left-wing economic policies are popular. That's why [almost all ballot measures to raise the minimum wage have passed over time](https://ballotpedia.org/Minimum_wage_on_the_ballot), even in deep red states. So I don't see the evidence of why these few points hurt the campaign.","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"Thanks for highlighting my point.","title":"CMV: when Kamala Harris claims mens bodies are already respected and there are no laws regulating mens bodies she is absolutely wrong"},{"text":"Exploration makes more sense with slower paced characters who won't fling themselves into spikes for using their whole shtick of \\"gotta go fast.\\"That said Frontiers does handle it well enough.

That takes five seconds for him to do. the issue is that once he does, Canada will slap the US with a 25% tariff. Canada pretty much has to do this, because if they don't then their market will get fucked.As a result, both sides will have tariffs and it will require bilateral talks to reduce them. When Trump left office he had just started the \\"Phase One\\" commitments with China to bring the tariffs down. Unfortunately, China has not kept up its part of the pledge, in part because Covid 19 threw a wrench in everything.Biden can't pull the tariffs down unilaterally without fucking our economy.There is also the economic reality that the main reason to cut tariffs is to lower the cost of goods, this takes a while to factor in, while the tax revenue loss is immediate. The latter looks bad on the budget sheet and there is a real concern that while it *should* put downward prices on goods, companies might not really budge in terms of prices making it a lose lose, especially if inflation is already a thing.tl;dr - Putting tariffs in place is easy, bringing them down is hard and companies are less inclined to lower prices than they are to raise them.Also, I'm not really sure you *get* how 'center' works. Center isn't its own position, it is as it says, the midpoint between positions. People on the left think tariffs are stupid, people on the right think they're great (because they are stupid).The 'centrist' position is essentially the opposite of your party. If you're a democrat and you want to be 'centrist' you probably want some tariffs. If you're a republican and you want to be center, you oppose them. It isn't a mythical third option, it is a lean toward the belief of the other party and the supposed 'center' between them.","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"Dumbshits","title":"Anti Harris Palestinians regret vote for Trump: Those who said, were going teach Democrats a lesson, or maybe Trumps better in a second term, well, theyre already getting their reckoning, and hes not even started this term."},{"text":"Never heard of this dude till now and I think I like him","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 7, 2024"},{"text":"Bibis numbers are ticking up because the war has gone well, especially in Lebanon.

The two-state solution has no support left. Things would have to change dramatically with the Palestinians, and it is hard to see it happening.I think the opposite is true for Jewish Israelis views about Israeli Arabs.  We were worried on October 7 they would turn on us, attack us, riot, join with Hamas but none of that happened. Instead they have stepped up with us, volunteered for the army, protested for the hostages. Even more than a year later you can still feel the difference. I think October 7 changed them too.

It is the exact opposite.No, because you've argued that a majority of people are having this problemThe majority have a problem does not mean it isn't still an *individual* problem.We live in a society, that society exists to share resources and work toward a common good.This is an opinion.Another common opinion is people who live in a society have an obligation to provide for their own needs.Yet another is that people aren't entitled to the fruits of other people labors. The fact is, this is an individual problem. It could be solved by forcing these people to buy zero deductible insurance but of course then they would complain *even more* about the cost. What you're describing is a system in which more than half the people who go to use their healthcare can't fucking use it because of cost issues. You absolutely can **if you manage your money**. That is the problem here. You are defending people who aren't proactively preparing for their own needs. Its not like it is something people aren't told. They just don't prioritize it and choose to take the risk instead. People will say things like 'I shouldn't have to sacrifice my quality of life' or such things.

It is frankly *not applicable*. People know you could need medical care and they know they have a deductible they have to pay. Dude, a majority of americans live paycheck to paycheck. That isn't an issue of personal responsibility, it is a problem with arithmetic.

You must either pay it yourself as an individual, or go without the prescribed treatment.

You have an ethical choice to run a company that takes money for coverage and then denies it when it's time for them to help you. What I am saying is that the companies actions to derive profit are ethically wrong and by extension, their existence is as well. This is a very common feeling in my country and we do have insurers but they aren't involved in any procedure decision making and can't really deny claims unless there is some kind of fraud.The average adjuster might simply be doing their job, and helping to compound the problem, but the CEOs responsibility as the head of the company and rolling out programs such as their Ai bot that denied 90% of claims, is definitely ethically wrong and most likely if they derive enjoyment from their position and status, evil.","title":"CMV: UHC CEO Shooting Will Result in Less Overall Suffering Than If it never happened."},{"text":"Who?

To the contrary.  She and the others did it for vanity and control reasons, and because it was a legal loophole around government records procedures.  She, unlike some Republicans, never used her separate email system in a corrupt or criminal way.  And contrary to Comeys grandstanding, she wasnt careless either.When certain email records were requested, she produced everything that matched the criteria.  When given the release to do so, her servers were wiped per normal practices.  Later, when corrupt republicans forced a revisit and demand for ALL records, she produced everything possible, plus servers that had been legally and correctly formatted.  By reassembling those records, investigators found that she had been honest in turning over the subset of records originally requested.  They also found zero evidence of malfeasance in the records that had been held back.  Anyone who wants can read the tens of thousands of emails.  Their mundane things like questions and arrangements for her daughters wedding.  She hid nothing incriminating.A read of all her emails, both the original subset and the GOP witch hunt compendium showed her to be a boring, diligent, hard working Secretary.  Thats it.As for the supposedly missing emails, that, like almost everything, stemmed from projected GOP guilt-as-accusation, then given life thanks to thousands of repetitions by hisotrys biggest liar (Donald Trump) and our lazy and complicit media.Investigators recovered over 99% of the data from HRCs formatted mail servers.  This is the data set we have.  The unrecovered &lt;1% amount to a certain byte size that wasnt retrieved, which is normal for data recovery.  You cant really equate that byte size to a set number of emails.  It could be many short text emails, or it could be a small number of large ones with attachments,or anything in between.  Most crucially, it would be virtually impossible for HRC to selectively steer which portion would be within that tiny unrecoverable data portion.Prior to this whole chapter, Bush had defied direct court orders demanding retention and disclosure of emails, numbering around 30 million. These emails almost certainly contained inculpatory criminal evidence.  Bushs people illegally destroyed these.This is where Trump came up with his hoax, slightly modifying the number from 30 million to 30 thousand.Thats where this entire HRC email hoax comes from.Sadly, through his cultish repetition of lies and our medias adulation for him and their lack of rigor, most reporters today still act like Hillary actually got away with doing something wrong.And worse, that same lazy media has been listless and silent about how Trump and his criminal family have broadly and brazenly broken laws about phone communications and record retention.","title":"Hunter Biden Was Unfairly Prosecuted"},{"text":"Well its an opportunity for everyone to step back and take stock of a new world in which Palestinians are eliminated from the planet.","title":"Anti Harris Palestinians regret vote for Trump: Those who said, were going teach Democrats a lesson, or maybe Trumps better in a second term, well, theyre already getting their reckoning, and hes not even started this term."},{"text":"There is a reason why masters fully supported laws forbidding the education of slaves.","title":"Top Democrat Issues Warning Over Trump Plot to 'Steal' From Federal Programs"},{"text":"And I don't want to hear a damned thing from their whiney mouths.

The German Greens in particular have been responsible for terrible energy policy blunders in the coalition parties they've been involved with since Schroder. If we compare Germany's attempt to decarbonization to most of it's peers in the Eurozone/EAA (UK, France, The Netherlands, basically all of Scandinavia, etc.) Germany's performance has been worse than all of them while their policies led to higher energy costs than their peers as an additional consequence.That Germany pretty much went from a perception of a powerhouse while Merkel was in power to basket case the moment she left shows how much her policies actually failed to put the country in the right direction in multiple policy areas.","title":"Merkel-worship was liberalism at its worst"},{"text":"You are not right, but not exactly wrong either.What Democrats need to do, if they want to win, is create an election strategy that is appealling to enough voters in enough states to win.

It cannot be too extreme less you lose your pathway- It needs to be flexible for down ballot races.

[Patrick Bet David doing a must-see interview with Anneke Lucas](https://youtu.be/nuui0zfMzpU?si=UayaznRu-V21DY2e) 14 minutes video (the last 3 minutes is PBD promoting his novel). To me Anneke is completely credible and authentic. I initially wanted to uphold some reservation, since of course making stuff like this up, apart from being disadvisable and dangerous, can be projected to be quite profitable, but 1) there is targeted bad mouthing of her being spread on the interwebs, which actually serves as a knighting, and 2) and even more importantly I got fully smitten. Anneke credibly testifies that she was raised as a sex slave and as a property to pedophile and eugenicist and allegedly back in his days second most powerful man in the world David Rockefeller (alleged by those who should know to boot), which (sex slave) roles final form and specifics had to be sniffed, scrutinized, authorized and given a final blessing by (surprisingly in turn *his* overlord) Evelyn de Rothschild. David Rockefeller was apparently experiencing JOY! with capital letters off the prospect of her earning him some extra millions (never mind that still must have meant only petty cash to him), both directly and by her collecting kompromat that would expose Davids targets to efforts of his at blackmail and extortion. She also describes receiving mind control training as a 9-year old, consisting mainly of being subjected to sadistic torture, from former Nazi Hans Harmsen, who under or rather among the Nazis had gained and possibly single-handedly created the responsibility for approving eugenic sterilizations performed on the disabled (Ill never hear the mockery Hans! the same). Harmsen in turn had been extorted and subjugated by David Rockefeller, and through him by berboss Evelyn de Rothschild, to work for the both of them and help build their network of slaves. Another demonstration of Zionists embracing and adopting every horrific practice and perverse technique and tactic that they possibly could extract, extort, rip off, duplicate, and take from the Nazis. Also: Lets not forget that Bill Gates is a Rothschild. I would not be surprised if he is the current *capo dei capi*. As a footnote here is https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vanden_Boeynants, who was also named by Anneke. And here is a text based on the interview:https://cairnsnews.org/2024/12/03/rockefeller-rothschild-sex-slave-taught-mind-control-by-nazi-doctor/Here is https://annekelucas.com/ (Im new to this and so far have only seen this one interview that I opened this comment with. Im not aware whether anyone else already posted something on this sub about her. I just checked. There have been posts on her as old as 5 years, mostly on the conspiracy sub.

You agree that there are systematic aspects of society that hurt men. You agree that those aspects of society should be changed. I suspect you even agree that women often do some things to enforce these systems. This disagreement is either about definitions, maybe systematic misandry by your definition would require that that men are oppressed or disadvantaged in society on net, or about responsibility, aka maybe when someone uses the term systematic misandry it is blaming women for these aspects of society and you want to push back on that part.\\nI think its totally true that systematically women are disadvantaged in society, but I think it is productive to call out the parts of the system that do hurt men.?My short list:* Men arent allowed to show emotion\\n* Men are distrusted in caring professionsSo then since I suspect the we both agree these are problems the question is how do we deal with it?\\nPersonally I have a complicated history with gender. Im a AMAB non binary person, and its absolutely true that the vast majority of the scary situations Ive been in have been caused by men, but also I dont know what to call the systemic belief in society that men arent to be trusted other than misandry?Like I think to say something else youd need a different definition for what misandry is? I think calling these tendencies misandry or at least acknowledging that it comes from a set of stereotypes while overall damaging to women still sometimes are individually negative towards men should be embraced. We dont say that men shouldnt be elementary teachers because of some negatively weve ascribed to women, we say it because we dont trust men not to be predatory.Obviously there are more reasons men dont end up as elementary teachers and we should call them out too. It isnt a respected profession because its considered womens work and we dont respect women for just one example, but we arent going to tear down gender essentialism if we insist that men arent hurt by more than just the shrapnel of the negative stereotypes weve put on women","title":"CMV: Ive never seen a good argument for the existence of systemic misandry, probably because its not real."},{"text":"LBJ conducted meetings on the can because he was constantly multitasking and getting things done.

Only one-in-four women said the same. Men were also a bit more likely than women to say a major reason they dont have a four-year degree was that they didnt need more education for the job they wanted: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/08/whats-behind-the-growing-gap-between-men-and-women-in-college-completion/ another aspect that makes somewhat hesitant to call this misandry is the fact that while more women are graduating from college but the power dynamics of higher education still dont represent women, a big factor in discrimination is the sovereignty mostly not being anyone who looks like you, most academics are men. But research suggest that this problem starts long before college, with teachers being more disciplinary towards boys, but I also wonder does that translate into a tangible shift in power for boys and girls futures, some child psychologists also link boys tracking behind girls in school to gender norms ((byproducts of patriarchy)) https://www.phillyvoice.com/gender-education-gaps-boys-health-role-models/amp/ https://news.fullerton.edu/2023/06/child-development-expert-why-boys-are-falling-behind-in-education/this is an interesting point, but idk if its reflects misandry.","title":"CMV: Ive never seen a good argument for the existence of systemic misandry, probably because its not real."},{"text":"viveks ancestors def cozied up to the british during their rule.

Because it's the pressured unification of the global moral geopolitical voice, and whatever you think of that the public good of resisting that seems to be debatable.FWIW I am not a traditional liberal nor do I see the UN as an unalloyed good. I see it's purpose, though, and I'd argue as a vehicle for ensuring as much peace as possible occurs, along the lines of the post-ww2 rules-based system and principles of human rights, as possible - it's done pretty well. The general assembly is the component of it which expresses global governmental opinion and the reason to listen to that is pretty practically obvious.","title":"CMV: UN General Assembly doesn't hold any moral credit and it is completely fine to defy it"},{"text":"yeah thats not the same.

There is no reason that a society that privileges men can't hate them at the same time. It's extremely common for people to hate the powerful. The public reaction to the recent assassination of the UHC CEO is a striking example of this phenomenon. More to your point, in discussions of the male suicide rate, it's very common to see explanation in the vein of, \\"It's because men are inherently violent, so they choose violent methods of suicide that have a higher success rate,\\" or \\"It's because men are selfish, so they don't consider the pain that their deaths will cause their loved ones.\\" Look at any news report about a boy who was sexually abused by a young teacher, and you'll find a plethora of comments dismissing the abuse on the grounds that he must have wanted it. Discussions of male mental health routinely draw choruses of \\"Man up!\\" and \\"Don't be a pussy!\\" The dismissal and outright denial of the emotional lives of men and boys is obvious and ubiquitous. Yes, these phenomenon are a product of patriarchy, but that doesn't preclude their systemic nature. Millions of people routinely sharing the same opinion and chanting the same slogans aren't a coincidence. It's a systemic phenomenon. The natural conclusion is not that misandry can't be systemic under patriarchy, but rather that systemic misandry is a component of patriarchy.

This idea came about in the aftermath of the 30 Years war in Europe, via the treaty of Westphalia. The 30 Years war was the most destructive and violent war on the European continent within recorded history (at least at the time). The sovereigns came together and decided that the situation as it was, competing claims for rule over lands and people that were decided by armed conflict, was unacceptable. This is where the modern conception of state sovereignty largely comes from (this is a simplification, but its good enough for now). State sovereignty means that if a governing body can claim territorial integrity, the ability to levy taxes, and a monopoly of force within that territory, it can claim legitimacy as the ruling government (sovereign) within that territory. The fundamental rights of state sovereignty are the right to non-interference and the right to be equal in status with their peers (ie other sovereigns). The form of government is irrelevant, all that matters is that a government that meets the above criteria exists. If other states recognise the sovereign claim, then that is enough (an example of this is the CCP claiming sovereignty over the Peoples Republic of China, while the Kuo Min Tang claimed to be the sovereign in exile from Taiwan). In a system where everyone is equal and no one has the right to cross borders without provocation (in self defence), there are two ways to resolve disputes: armed conflict or a global forum. Prior to the World Wars of the 20th century, a network of shifting alliances ensured some measure of peace (a breach of the peace could have catastrophic consequences), or there was Pax Britannia - the UK was the single most powerful naval and military presence in the world and was able to maintain a measure of peace for about 100 years leading up to WW1. When that collapsed with the weakening of the British Empire, the world again saw, in close succession, the two most destructive conflicts in human history where the full violent potential of the Industrial Revolution was realised, culminating in the single most powerful weapon ever created: nukes. The UN was established as a forum for states to gather and debate issues and make resolutions that showed their position on things in a somewhat official capacity. The states that are signatories (192 of 196 recognised states), have agreed to abide by the UN Charter, a tenet of which is the avoidance and peaceful resolution of global conflict. The UN itself has no moral authority other than that which each member state ascribes to it. Rogue states often ignore UN resolutions, but the US also often ignores UN resolutions because it is the most powerful state, whos going to stop them? Finally, the UN is more than the Security Council and the General Assembly; it has reporting bodies, arbitration tribunals and courts of international law that, through the consent of the member states, mimic the processes of legal administration within a state, and the Rule of Law to allow for processes of dispute resolution that at least have the appearance of fairness and consistency to encourage states to abide by the decisions reached (though they can and do often ignore it - eg China and the Phillipines dispute in the South China Sea). So to change your view: No, the UN doesnt have moral authority. But states should abide by UN resolutions because for the majority to ignore them wholesale is to allow the return to a world where the best means of resolving disputes is to line up on either side of the pacific with all your friends and warships and have at it. Modern warfare is incalculably destructive and peaceful resolution is preferable to most states most of the time. The UN is the best system we have to achieve that at this stage.","title":"CMV: UN General Assembly doesn't hold any moral credit and it is completely fine to defy it"},{"text":"What Democrats do you think are \\"at the top\\" ?","title":"After a month of grieving, Democratic leaders are torn between anger and exhaustion"},{"text":"I'm not talking about the convention.

In that time the US had the most liberal government it ever had, the most liberal policies, the most liberal banking regulations. It built the largest most prosperous, most upwardly mobile, best educated middle class in history. Those liberal governments, from FDR to Truman to Eisenhower to Kennedy to Johnson also helped Americans survive the depression and dustbowl, starved the seeds of domestic communism, defeated  fascism in both hemispheres simultaneously, rebuilt the economies of our allies and our enemies after the war, faced down communism abroad, built the finest infrastructure, roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and military the world had ever seen. They did it so well, so successfully, America was so prosperous and successful under their leadership that conservatives couldn't get back into the white house for 36 years. Thirty. Six. Years.Those administrations were far to the left of the current Democratic party. The Democratic party began losing elections when it was taken over by Moderates and Neoliberals. People who, like conservatives, believe that the government works for the wealthy.Since Neoliberals and radical conservatives have gotten back into leadership positions the infrastructure of the United States is falling apart, the middle class has been hollowed out, wages and worker protections have eroded, teachers can't afford to work in the profession anymore, Social Security has been raided to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy and instead of a prosperous, healthy, upwardly mobile working class we have 700 billionaires whose net worth grew by 88% since the pandemic, by directly exploiting the pandemic for profit, while the rest of us are struggling. A billionaire was murdered in the streets this week and many of us, on both the Right and the Left, seem to be cheering. All of this is to say that the exact opposite of your thesis is true. The Democrats need to move back to the left, back to policies that worked, back to making the wealthy pay their share of taxes, back to a rule of law that applies to the wealthy just as much as to the rest of us, back to protecting and preserving democracy.","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"Democrats are now more liberal on social issues and social welfare spending, where is the data that shows they have become more conservative?","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"No, he broke the law.

Tens of thousands of Americans lie on a gun form every year, and not only are they not charged, but they also don't become the target of relentless, partisan investigations and inquiries, media smear campaigns, political scrutiny and public harassment over the course of five years. They're also not dragged through the mud and excoriated by Congress, special counsels and the DOJ, efforts that amounted to a waste of time and resources.This inquisition was part of a broader and lengthy partisan investigation into Joe Biden, and a recent report authored by Republicans and judiciary chair Jim Jordan, was riddled with conjecture, debunked talking points, and contained no direct evidence of impeachable conduct.What's more, even though Hunter Biden paid off his tax liability years ago, Republicans still continued their investigation and prosecuted Hunter Biden for not paying his taxes. Legal authorities have also called this highly unusual due to how difficult it would to convince a jury to convict someone for not paying their taxes, after they've paid their taxes...If Donald Trump were charged with lying on a gun form, conservatives would be having a collective conniption fit, crying \\"shall not be infringed\\" while claiming that this is just another example of how *Democrats* have \\"weaponized the justice system against Trump.\\"And we all know where Trump and his supporters stand on tax evasion, because Donald Trump has made a career out of evading paying his taxes while amassing unsustainable debts.The hypocrisy here is baffling. Consider also the fact that Donald Trump commuted the sentencing of Roger Stone, his former campaign manager, on seven felony crimes. Stone was set to serve a 40-month period in federal prison. Trump also pardoned Lil Wayne, who was found guilty of felony gun possession. This was after Wayne had a meeting with Trump at one of his golf clubs, and later endorsed Trump during his re-election campaign. But that's not all, Donald Trump has pardoned many formerly convicted staff members, corrupt allies, and co-conspirators, some of which he's welcomed back into his inner circle. There's a demonstrative double standard here considering all the hysteria from Trump and his supporters in response to Hunter's pardon.Not only that, but the MAGA crowd now claims that this pardon justifies even broader immunities for Trump, despite the glaring differences between the two.There is a massive difference between targeting the president's son in such a brazen manner and investigating a series of crimes committed by a former president and now president elect, who is a serial fraud and known notoriously for his criminal misconduct and abuse of the justice system. And crimes that are all far more grievous and damning than anything Republicans could even fantasize about implicating Hunter Biden for.Additionally, and by comparison, Trump has committed more crimes and subsequent investigations were backed by clearer and more incriminating evidence.Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, whether ethically questionable or not, also protects Hunter from future punitive efforts and political scrutiny from a Republican party that will consolidate power with the intention to abuse it come next term. If you compare the situations of Hunter Biden and Donald Trump side by side, you should be able to conclude that the differences are extensive. Thinking that Hunter's pardon justifies even more immunities for Trump is absurd.Prior to this pardon, I wasn't trying to justify it by pointing to the rampant cronyism and favoritism that Trump legitimized after he pardoned multiple convicted accomplices, and pardons that the MAGA community cheered. Additionally, Hunter isn't being offered a pardon/impunity as a former president, nor as a president elect who can now feel exempt from the law and more comfortable knowing that he will likely not be held accountable for any future corruption and misconduct.Biden argued that raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice\\"But Trump uses this exact same language to describe the countless indictments, investigations, and lawsuits against *him*. All of which were warranted to some degree. Donald Trump has not only been exploiting his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system throughout his entire life, while evading accountability for his crimes and misconduct, but even as president, he used his executive privilege to avoid being incriminated for his blatant and frequent attempts to obstruct justice.Since then, he has been granted broad immunities by a kowtowing group of loyalists, immunities and privileges he has used to obstruct and delay the legal process.Trump has also made a number of unconstitutional threats against his political opponents and adversaries, warning them that he intends to abuse his power as president to seek retribution against them. Trump has literally been charged with \\"defrauding the United States,\\" with conspiring to overturn an election, with disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans, with intimidating election officials into manipulating the vote for him, with attempting to install loyalists into positions of power within agencies like the DOJ, where they can help *him* steal the election. All of which Trump has been able to avoid convictions for due to his recent election win and his exploitation of the justice system. By contrast, Hunter didn't have the same privilege while he was being publicly skewered by every avenue of the justice system. And despite all this, when Joe Biden offers his son a pardon, after he was maligned for years, humiliated and scandalized, investigated by Congress, special counsel, and by the DOJ... after he became the target of relentless partisan inquiries and committee hearings, after the public harassment, the political scrutiny, the Media smear campaigns, all of which amounted to a waste of time, but eventually ended in him being prosecuted for a crime that most Americans get away with every year, a prosecution that even authorities on the matter have called highly unusual, after all of this, Donald Trump should be granted yet another immunity claim? Should be held to an even lower standard? Face less accountability?This is just like what happened during Harris's campaign. Because Donald Trump is a notorious and serial shitstirrer, because his absurdity has magically rendered him benign, because corruption, malfeasance, cronyism, obstruction of justice, violent rhetoric and unconstitutional threats are just another day for Donald Trump, we've practically sane washed and normalized his misconduct.So the bar for Trump remains perpetually low, while his opponents are held to such a high standard that they're expected to be irreproachable by comparison.","title":"Hunter Biden Was Unfairly Prosecuted"},{"text":"The stuff about body positivity?

But first, its noteworthy to state that almost every country that held elections saw incumbent parties lose vote share, from places like Britain, Austria, India, etc. Worldwide, voters were sick of high inflation and punished the parties in power. As for some examples, I remember in 2004 when pundits said that Democrats needed to win over values voters or those who supported Democrats economic ideas but did not support abortion rights or same sex marriage. Obama won them over in 2008 as the economy took a crap. In 2012, the Republicans famously published an autopsy report that said they needed to reach out to minorities and rid themselves of racial biases, and they won in 2016 with Trump, who absolutely played to racial prejudice. Point is, its hard to predict the future. If trumps tariffs lead to massive inflation, democrats will clean up the next couple of cycles.

You are asserting as a presupposition that there *is* this patriarchy. Thus if you believe that society is a patriarchy, then it kind of follows definitionally that any large scale discrimination or hatred of men is either not real or more likely not \\"systemic\\". Systemic ends up being a weasel word that you can selectively invoke when it suits your preconceived beliefs.I don't think there's any reasonable evidence there *is* patriarchy in the west in 2024. Patriarchy means men have the power and women are excluded. The last of anything resembling discrimination in law was erased in the 1970's. Women go to school and graduate at higher rates, are in poverty less, and are ubounded in taking positions of power.Just about the only evidence of patriarchy is that that women hold closer to 30% of seats of Congress - but those are directly voted on *by* women, who cast the ever so slight majority of ballots. Meanwhile the cabient is 48% woman, and the supreme court 45%.If you're going to use a much more liberal and softer definition of \\"patriarchy\\" that is basically a synonym for gender roles and societal expectations, then discourse in the media is *entirely* relevant. \\"Mean jokes on the internet\\" cannot simultaneously be irrelevant when against men, but also the primary evidence of patriarchy against women. So maybes theres some great argument for the systemic oppression of men that Im just not seeing due to conformation biasThis is also the wrong way of thinking about it. No one is sitting here saying men are systemiclly oppressed in a such way that results in less aggregate power in society.The basic belief is that we have largely achived equal-opprotunity / fair treatment by institutions, such that people are generally unbounded from doing the things and living their life the way they want to.The remaining inequities are much more behavioral, but they're widly complicated.What's fundamentally *misandrist* is the implicit assertion that resulting behavioral / social expectation issues are *entirely* the fault of men, with women having basically *zero* accountability and agency in fixing them. That is the utter frustration. It's this basic idea that women can have their cake and eat it too, it's all men's fault, is misandrist in nature.Pick any feminist grievance, I'm happy to go in the weeds.Participation in STEM? The feminist idea that men are boxing out women in those fields is pretty sus. The real issues is women continue to make only up 20% of graduating STEM classes after going through an education system that is dominated by female educators. So wheres the proof?So again, it's more your basic thinking about the issue is a little bit off.But if you'd like some examples of *systemic* injustices along gender lines, here's a few* The [justic system is widly biased against men vs women](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/overwhelming-evidence-reports-gender-bias-courts#:~:text=Gender%20bias%20in%20the%20courts%20denies%20women%20equal%20justice%2C%20equal,alimony%20or%20child%20support%20decrees.) - buy the DOJ's very own assesment.\\n* Women are the [primary beneficiaries of DEI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelleking/2023/05/16/who-benefits-from-diversity-and-inclusion-efforts/) that tends to get into qota / manipulation of admissions by identities\\n* Women [get better marks in K-12 schooling](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/mark-womans-record-gender-and-academic-performance-hiring#:~:text=Throughout%20high%20school%20and%20college,and%20complete%20higher%20education%20degrees.), while [77% of educators are women](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/24/key-facts-about-public-school-teachers-in-the-u-s/#:~:text=Most%20K%2D12%20public%20school,the%20U.S.%20noninstitutionalized%20civilian%20population.).

Do you think the misandry must necessarily be entrenched in political power, or is simple social prevelance enough to consider something 'systemic'?

Both the owner and the inspector, though they didnt go around stabbing someone, and the effects of their actions didnt kill everyone only those who didnt go to the doctor on time, still have blood on their hands, correct? Because they created conditions for their own benefit knowing fully well that they were causing the death of a certain amount of people.Id say thats murder, or if you wanna be pedantic at least murder adjacent.

But the actual story is the very opposite of nepotism: Hunter Biden was treated worse than an ordinary citizen because of his family connections. Its good for the country when the president acts against injustice; President Biden rightly condemned the injustice of his sons prosecution. His pardon was necessary to prevent Donald Trumps Justice Department from targeting Hunter for years to come. [https://theatln.tc/rC0BgXXL](https://theatln.tc/rC0BgXXL)I worked as a federal criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York for 12 years, during which time I supervised and prosecuted many gun and tax cases. President Biden argues that the gun and tax charges Hunter was convicted of should never have been brought. I agree. When I served as deputy chief for the Southern District of New Yorks Criminal Division, my job was to approve charging and non-prosecution decisions on gun and tax cases. I would not have approved the felony gun and tax charges brought against Hunter Biden; such charges are rarelyif everbrought in similar circumstances.... If there were reason to believe that Hunter had committed any of the more serious crimes that reportedly were under investigationbribery, money laundering, or illegal foreign lobbying, I would be far less sympathetic to the presidents pardon. But Hunter was never charged with these more serious offenses. Weiss investigated Hunter for six years; thats an unusually long time for a criminal investigation focused on one individual. If after six years Weiss still does not have a real case against Hunter, then it doesnt exist.... The absence of a credible case against Hunter does not mean that a Trump DOJ wouldnt bring bogus charges against him. During his campaign, Trump vowed that, if elected, he would appoint a special prosecutor to go after the Biden crime family. In nominating Pam Bondi for attorney general and Kash Patel for FBI director, Trump has further signaled how serious he is about using the DOJ as an instrument of personal revenge. At the 2020 Republican convention, Bondi argued that President Biden and his son were corrupt. Recently, Patel proposed using the law criminally or civilly against Trumps political rivals. When he announced the pardon, President Biden stated, In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break meand theres no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. Hes right.Now is not the time to cling to norms that Trump is poised to shatter. Political prosecutions are coming, and I fear that our democratic institutions will not withstand them.

Germany stopped investing into nuclear with Chernobyl, and phase-out was a constant source of discussion that was solidified in 2003 or so.

Palestinians in Kuwait side with Saddam Hussein and try to overthrow Kuwait, were later ejected.* 1993, 1994: Oslo accords, Peace with Jordan.* 2000: Oslo accords break down, mostly because Arafat demanded \\"right of return\\" - which is ultimately asking for Israeli citizenship for millions to destabilize the state - as opposed to working within the '67 lines.* 2007: After not really knowing how to proceed, Israel unilaterally turns over Palestine to the Palestinian Authority (removing all presence there). This begins the experiment of an effective Palestinian state... and a/b test of nearly full autonomy there (vs continued occupation in the west bank)* 2014: Obama promises a more \\"balanced\\" approach its relationship with Palestine while simultaneously trying to reach out to Iran. The end result is Iran &amp; Palestine feeling emboldened to test this new perspective - and it instigates the 2014 Gaza war by shooting rockets and kidnapping citizens. Social media/video is new, and Gazans begin a campaign of plastering social media with images of Israeli rockets (devoid of context) and is pleasantly surprised the efficacy.* 2014-2023: The era of state-level astroturfing from Russia &amp; Iran in full force. This coincides with changing in progressive political politics in the west. Rather than looking at things from absolute/moral positions, they begin to focus on power dynamics only - assuming the smaller entity has near-zero accountability and the more powerful one all accountability.* 2024: October 7th is launched, largely due to the observations of the above two steps.Long and short, Palestine has been a horrific international actor since day zero. It's a radicalized aspiring state, that has tried to topple every surrounding nation that accepts people from it.It has no interest in peace, has built nothing positive.It also begs the question of \\"what does a successful Palestinian state even look like?\\". The surrounding nations of Jordan, Syria, west Iraq, and east Egypt are probably the starting points as they're shared culture through history until 1948.Best case for Palestine is probably Jordan - which is an international welfare state (20% of it's economy is like IMF / international donations) that's stable just due to an aristocratic ruler... but it's political / economic freedoms are still abysmal. More probable case? Maybe it's more like Syria, a failed state unable to govern itself with warning factions.Why we don't evaluate the failures within adjacent states as relevant to Palestine is *beyond me*. This idea that mean old Jews are the problem for these people is demonstrably false by even the most basic look at history, state of surrounding countries, and Israeli outreach and peace deals with other states.It's awful. They've demonstrated no ability to govern themselves, no desire to have human rights among their people comparable to any of the more developed parts of the world.We can all agree that Palestine needs a lot of help, but to be on their side is *effing crazy*.The best example I can think of is like looking at gang-ridden Oakland or LA. You can say that it's a difficult situation to be born into, and at times the police are way too heavy handed. But what you're doing is analogous to like siding with the Bloods &amp; Crips.","title":"CMV: The only way the Israel/Palestine conflict can be solved is a 2 state solution and money from the UN"},{"text":"I think the next nominee needs to pretend to blow a microphone, thats what went wrong.","title":"New progressive chair: Democrats must refocus on workers and wages to combat Trump's culture wars | Rep.

Look at what happened with Russia - they repeatedly defied UN resolutions in the 2000s, and now we have the Ukraine war. If powerful nations just do whatever they want, we're back to might-makes-right international relations.Also, your argument about \\"not caring about what Eritrea thinks\\" misses the point.

Jews moved to the area rather legally. The areas they settled on were *purchased* from the Arab owners. The bought what was basically depleted farmland with nothing on it, and created Tel Aviv.The majority of Israel's the land area is the Negev desert, so your \\"55% of land\\" is a bit silly. Furthermore, the British Mandate was 44.5 thousand square miles. Modern day Israel is 8 thousand square miles. Israel got *17%* of the land, and of that 17% they got *60%* is desert.Jews were forbidden from purchasing land in the rest of the mandate east, of the Jordan. The rest of the mandate would be Jordan, Syria, the territories. Prior to Israeli independence, Palestinian nationalism just wasn't a thing. It didn't become a mainstream idea of the people there until after 1967 when Israel begain to occupy the territories - prior to that time Gaza was run by Egypt and the west bank by Jordan.Also, noting that 800,000 Palestinians fled in *the war the Arabs initiated* while kind of ignoring the fact that 900,000 Jews were ejected from the countries of the Arab leauge is really silly. It's a bidirectional movement.If you're supporting this idea that Palestinians have a legitimate claim to the entirety of Israel, then it seems you don't *actually* believe in a two state solution.The 1967 lines are the internationally agreed uppon boundaries, for rather good reason. You have to drop the line of Palestinian claim to Israel's side. the last elections in Gaza were in 2006, when most of the population now werent even old enough to voteThat doesn't matter. The majority of Palestinian citizens support Hamas, and it's really up to them to replace their government if they don't like it.If the Palestinains were being oppressed by local tyrants and screaming for help, Israel or the rest of the world would be happy to assist in policing. But that's just not the reality.In no other context to we say being anything less than perfect representative democracy means the people of a nation are unaccountabile for their behavior. That's silly. We treat Russia as accontable for its actions, despite it pretty clearly not being a perfect democracy.  however the US has a lot of influence in the UN, and the US supports Israel. And rightly so. Israel is democracy and a rational actor. It's produtive and supports women and LGBT rights. It's a democracy. The US also funds IsraelNot really. The Israeli GDP is 508 billion dollars. US aid to Israel is 3 billion dollars. It's primarily military surplus, which is functionally an exchange of old hardware for intel in the region. That's 0.5% of Israeli GDP, it's not like the stat is subsidized by the US.Meanwhile the Palestinian territories (along with Jordan, for that mater) is an international welfare state.In 2008 27% of Palestine's GDP was international donations. They produce nothing of value and live off of international goodwill. International donations to Palestine dropped dramatically over the past 20 years because *an effing terror network* took over Gaza and made it the worlds biggest terror base. Quality of life is bad there not because Israel is mean, it's because no one wants to fund these people shooting missiles. Except Iran. while Iran does fund Hamas, Israel also gets money from the USThe US's objective is regional stability and support of democracy.
