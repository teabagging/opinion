If they could get the political capital to really deliver to the working and middle classes, theyd be set. But theyre trapped, they get neither.So the super rich saw at the end of covid that inflation was going to set in, they let Biden win.

The more people educate themselves, the better people will start taking the red pill over the blue pill and wake up to reality.I came from a different background with Trump. I grew up in the 80s and 90s. I started knowing about Trump around 1990-1991 around age 10-11. I heard he was this rich guy and he owned hotels. Stayed in Trump Taj Mahal in Nov. 1991. I never connected the Biff Tannen alternate 1985 to Trump until around 2016 when Zemeckis or Gale said that Biff was inspired by Trump. And I did see him in Home Alone 2 and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air way before The Apprentice became a phenomenon and people started saying, Youre fired.By 2016 leading up to the election, I kept reading he was racist. I started to believe it. But then I thought, how could he be racist? Wasnt he just friends with the people calling him that prior to when he ran for office? Then I kept seeing everyone from the media with the exception of Fox News keep slandering him. By 2017, I realized it was all bullshit.Lets go back to 2011. Obama roasts Trump because Trump kept questioning where Obama was born. Then Seth Meyers mocks Trump which pisses him off. Said that Trump was a running joke or something like that. The reason the war on Trump happened waged by the Left and biased media was they all mocked him and said he would never be President. They cant accept being wrong. Its out there. Obama goes on Kimmel saying at least he was a POTUS.During Trumps first term, there was no war. The only war happened between the lying Lefts media vs. him. Over 90% negative coverage. They cant accept after mocking him all those years that he would never become President, that he actually became the President (and twice now). The lunatic Left are a narcissistic bunch. Hence, all the lies to vilify this man because he proved everyone wrong.I hope there are more people like the OP and they wake up. Recognize the liberal bias and your sides lies. Stop being dense. We know Trump isnt perfect. Hes no boy scout. But for every lie hes made, the Left does it a 1000x more. In 30 years, Trumps legacy is going to age like fine wine. While someone like Obamas or Bidens legacy will quickly be forgotten. Trump is too much of a revolutionary and paradigm shifter for most people to understand. It will take years for some libs to look back and appreciate him.https://preview.redd.it/0l0kriuhzszd1.jpeg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8250f12d01ee505b743d6b0b83246b8eb098aa3bIts about policy, not emotion.

Biden's tariffs on China were illegal by the WTO but they largely only targeted very few industries, so their impact was minor, China still traded mostly the same amount (only a 20% reduction) as it did before And in the industries that the US did hit, such as EVs and Green tech the US started to fall behind, mate, do you realise that the US has less EV penetration than ASEAN?? Do you realise that Pakistan now has half as much solar installation as you do and that India is almost at your level despite their economy being 5 times smaller?Like, the Biden tariffs have delayed US green tech A LOT and you call not making progrss ON THE BIGGEST PROBLEM EVER (climate change) a success? The economy has been a success DESPITE the tariffs They did even when America had very low trade as a share of GDP, which is British portfolio investment was disproportionately American prior to WWI and not Holland where trade to GDP exceeded 100%.The global trade used to be MUCH smaller back then, currently trade intensity of the world is 65%, the US's trade intensity is 3 times lower than it wasIn 1920 the US trade intensity was 10% but the global trade intensity was 22%, in an era we largely regard as isolationist, the US had more relative trade intensity than it does today And look up the countries with the largest share of geriatrics. It's filled with large European countries like Germany, Italy etc. Hell France with a (slightly) higher TFR than America, still has a noticeably higher proportion of geriatrics (21.42 vs 18.73)Do you know how France can have a higher TFR than the US but have a larger share of old people? Because the US life expectancy is 5 years lower than the French onehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy?wprov=sfla1Being proud that you have a lower life expectancy and so you have less old people is NOT a flex It mostly doesLiterally gdp growth rates are measured on the local currency adjusted by inflation, which is the same ratio as the PPP number, and completely divorced from nominal numbers that change a lot I dislike the flawed, inaccurate and borderline self hating arguments American liberals succs have perpetuatedThis sub has an idea of America, an America that trades with the world, sharing its ideas and importing the best from everyone, an America that is engaged in global affairs that you want to disengage, an America that supports free trade and open borders, an America that uphold the ideals of the statue of liberty, an America that does not look at its lower life expectancy and sees an asset of less old people, an America that pushed forward and is a GLOBAL AmericaThe America you are supposed to be is an international, liberal America You want to destroy literally what makes America great, if you get your way, America would stop being America Saying that this America will suffer under Trump and might very well die is not self hating, accepting that America will become an autarky would be self hating because it goes against everything America is supposed to be","title":"The US is one of the least trade-oriented countries in the world C despite laying the groundwork for todays globalized system."},{"text":"Tbh it would be kinda nice for Europe to do something like that since it's mainly their security that the Ukraine conflict is threatening.

So, you have women who want desperately to give birth, but end up needing an abortion to save their own lives. There are also genetic disorders and conditions that can lead to a full term pregnancy and inevitable fetal demise following birth. This is why infant mortality has been increasing in states that have enacted abortion restrictions.Again, you may find this hard to believe but these tragic and preventable loses of life are playing out before us.I mean think of this: a pregnant person in a blue state and a pregnant person in a red state with the same complication. One lives, one dies. Does that seem right to you?There are multiple women in my life who have miscarried multiple times. And this is been the agenda of the so called pro life movement for decades.

We were late to the inmigration game, but from now on, if we continue to take as many migrants or more, we shouldn't slip behind the US in demographicsYour migrants are a net drain as the *Economist* has shown, unlike the case in America. Why? It's because you've a lavish and universal welfare system. *Not* to mention your TFR as I've told you before, is much lower across the board. So even the migrants adapt similar if not lower TFR in places like Denmark. And look up the countries with the largest share of geriatrics. It's filled with large European countries like Germany, Italy etc. Hell France with a (slightly) higher TFR than America, still has a noticeably higher proportion of geriatrics (21.42 vs 18.73): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_age_structure#ListBesides, while trade is not the only important thing on global influence It's the main thing on global influence, that's literally what the Nominal gdp measuresGlobal influence isn't measured by that unless you seriously believe China is more influential than the European Union. Lemme know that in mandarin. \\nNominal gdp doesn't measure the real economy,It mostly does, before Sterling or the Dollar you had bullion. Countries with the most bullion total or per capita dominated those with lower or no bullion (cowrie shells/barter).  but it does measure the influence your economy has to shape international markets, which the US's is particularly strong onThe US influences global markets not by trade otherwise given the paltry share of trade in American GDP. The dollar is used because people have confidence in America. They did even when America had very low trade as a share of GDP, which is British portfolio investment was disproportionately American prior to WWI and not Holland where trade to GDP exceeded 100%.Even if the dollar was dropped? Americans still had one of the highest if not the highest standard of living when Sterling reigned supreme.This also assumes people will buy oil using anything else given that even China's struggling with Russian roubles and that it will sooner explode before loosening credit controls or God forbid import more than it exports. But still if they did, see the point above.reversing the US demographic advantage back to Europe who will continue to take people inI'll repeat what I said, American born TFR is higher than the European one. You also assume the most extreme of scenarios and ignore that some Europeans aren't all that hot about immigration either. Sweden is now a net emigrant country for the first time, France has restricted migration and even Germany's not looking hot what with the gains made by AfD particularly amongst the youth and the new infighting engulfing Scholz's government. Sara's party is leftist but also not keen on migration. Lastly, between 1890 and the 1970s migrant stock as a % of the American population **declined**. Did American \\"influence\\" or what have you did too?You seemingly support the opposite and I do think you will achieve it, but be careful with your wishes, they may come trueI don't support it, I dislike the flawed, inaccurate and borderline self hating arguments American ~~liberals~~ succs have perpetuated. Especially since it contradicts the main message that Biden's economy wasn't a disaster, quite the opposite but he did keep up tariffs against China!

Yes, the D party sucks in many ways. And at the same time, the only way to stop the Repubs is the elect the Dem. So being finished with the Dems means what exactly? This statement by Michael Kinnucan is appropriate in these conversations:Sometimes people talk as though there were a national organization called The Democratic Party that was tasked with winning races against Republicans and either was out there doing that (so the rest of us can go do other things) or is to be criticized for not doing that effectively. But this organization just does not exist, there is not The Democratic Party. There are a bunch of politicians of varying levels of talent and ambition and their constellation of donors and staffers and consultants who spend most of their time jockeying for power internally or plotting out their next career move or whatever. And sure, sometimes the ambitions of that big loose group of people overlap enough with the project of beating Republicans in general elections that if you squint you can sort of see something like a generalized effort to win elections happening for a few months, and other times... well, we all saw the debate.People on the left sometimes summarize this situation as \\"the Democrats don't even want to win,\\" and that certainly captures something, but we have to be very precise. There are millions of people across the country who identify strongly with the Democratic Party and who may not share our politics in every respect but who are absolutely desperate to protect abortion, civil rights, labor rights, the climate, etc. by beating Trump. Those people really do desperately want to win. But those people don't have a political organization through which they can pursue that desire to win; all they have is the Democratic Party, i.e. a ballot line monopoly plus a vague brand plus a constellation of dumb ambitions currently dominated by a vain old man who just doesn't want to retire.","title":"I am officially done with the Democratic party"},{"text":"Hope you grow all your own foods, dug your own well that you pump yourself, and provide your own power.

This included the use of social media disinformation campaigns and alleged cyberattacks targeting the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and other political organizations.The interference led to extensive investigations, including the Special Counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller, which examined Russian interference and any possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Muellers report did not conclude there was collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia but did confirm that Russian operatives had attempted to sway public opinion.Claims of widespread domestic voter fraud, however, were not substantiated.

Attempted assassination of the political leadership of the US is 100% an act of war. And I think that if they have hard evidence, they'd be absolutely well within rights to launch strikes against Iran to retaliate and show them this sort of action has real consequences.If it were me, I'd probably be looking at hitting Iranian oil refineries, major oil pumping sites, and their nuclear research sites with drones and cruise missiles. I'd also hit any dual use ports. All perfectly legal targets as they're state owned and providing funding into their acts of war.This would cripple them for a year or two and would force a massive refocus and recalibration for them. It is unlikely they would be taking any overt hostile action for a long, long time.--Edit--To put this into perspective, this would cost the US $600million - $1 Billion using cruise missiles and drones to reduce the risk to US personnel at the cost of more expensive munitions and it would cover significant overlap strikes to cover malfunctions, losses to air defenses, and target hardening.The cost to Iran would be massive. 10-20% GDP drop in year one. Total damage and economic impact in the $100 - $150 Billion range over five years. Collapse of their government would be very possible in those conditions.","title":"3 charged in Iran-linked plot to assassinate Donald Trump as revenge for killing Qassem Soleimani: DOJ"},{"text":"I dont think you get it, Democracy is gone!

When there is no conversation, when policy is completely top-down, when it is dictated by a leader, well...you should be able to figure out what that is. It isn't democracy.I do think pressuring officials and committing elections fraud is wrong.

That act in itself is a gross abuse of power. The fact that he urged them to not certify vote totals, to commit voter fraud, is very clearly undemocratic. He also called the Secretary of State of Georgia and pressured him to again to commit voter fraud based on zero evidence. Raffensperger repeatedly had to present Trump with actual evidence that the vote tallies were correct. Trump just asserted with no evidence that he had to have won Georgia, invoking conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines that even at the time had been debunked.

Well I guess I should say, the women driving the aggression are all liberals, so as to not generalize all liberal women.So, (in general, not all) if you are an older conservative man, you are either settled with a conservative woman, or you are single and likely get more offended by the rhetoric against men, and pushed further right.Then, if you are a young man (especially if you are white) who isn't committed to either party yet, and definitely if you are already a liberal young men, you are faced with a scenario where conservative women will not give you the time of day as a liberal and value conservative traits so you can't be too much of a centrist.  \\n  \\nThen, the liberal women (not all, I know) who are supposed to be your people, your team, your partners- also won't give you the time of day unless you admit that you are inherently a misogynist, an oppressor, a second class person, a pig, ugly, a racist, a fool, and only seem to have any interest in a 6'0 prince charming with an overflowing bank account, or think that any shred of masculinity you have is a poison.. (not at all at once, but these are the common things I see online)And that's how you end up with the gen z savior generation's men flocking to conservative candidates and values- because they look across the aisle and see women who are allies, who are okay with being beautiful and having someone tell them as much, who want children and the happy little postcard families they grew up thinking they would have...And all they have to do to have aaaalll that, is fill in the other little box on the ballot, go to trade school and \\"man up\\"...   \\n  \\nFUCK- If I was 24 and didn't have my wonderful fiancee I woulda voted for Trump too.

In other words, either we control it and crazy stuff doesn't get through the House, or they narrowly control it and are too dysfunctional to get much through. Can't pass laws without both the House and the Senate, so just killing the filibuster doesn't do much if the House is either Dem controlled or can't get their shit together.So, yes, they can kill the filibuster. But given how the House is looking, it won't do much good. And judicial appointments are already simple majority.---Now, volunteering: Sounds like postcards are a great fit for you!

They claim it would be beneficial if Democrats adopted some anti-trans policies that could appeal to moderates and social conservatives, and some \\"moderate\\" anti-trans policies would be a way for Democrats to distance themselves from the left.The current Democratic platform is to continue with the status quo for trans rights. The GOP is pushing to restrict trans civil rights, and the Democrats have opposed those changes.You're right in that the GOP's anti-trans push at the federal level has been mostly rhetoric, like Trump promising to \\"end the transgender insanity\\". However, Trump has a history of issuing anti-trans executive orders, including suspending anti-discrimination policies in public schools, banning transgender people from serving in the military, banning trans students from using the school bathroom that matches their gender, allowing health care workers to refuse to treat transgender patients if they have a religious objection, etc. All of those were challenged in court and caught up in the legal process, so they never went into effect, but it's likely that Trump will try again in 2025.Personally, I get my health insurance through a federal job, and Trump promised on the campaign trail that he will issue an executive order that removes federal employee insurance coverage for trans-related health care. Trump wants to redefine gender at the federal level to always match the birth sex, which would impact things like passports. Trump also promised to bar public schools from affirming the gender of trans students and employees, which would include pronouns and bathroom use, at the threat of losing federal funding.There's also very likely to be federal anti-trans legislation given the GOP trifecta. The GOP [introduced 53 federal anti-trans bills in the 2023 legislative session](https://translegislation.com/bills/2023/US). Trump said \\"The left-wing gender insanity being pushed on our children is an act of child abuse,\\" and GOP legislators have said they want to criminalize the parents of trans minors as child abusers. They want to ban any hospital or clinic that accepts Medicaid or Medicare dollars from offering trans-related health care, which would be catastrophic for trans health care access. Some want to end discrimination protections in employment and housing.Who knows how much of that comes to fruition, but it's likely to be bad news.","title":"4,000 word post about r slash neoliberal needs to abandon trans people"},{"text":"Luv vivek.

I think the Democrats must engage in something I'm calling \\"realpedagogic\\". They have to pepper their language with actual pedagogy that teaches, in situ, how to think. You can get the information to the cherry pickers, but you can't make them read or process it. They are, above all, cherry pickers. Therefore, the pedagogic \\"moment\\" or thing that has to be in the language of the Left all over the place is raising concerns specifically about cherry picking.This might sound like it's not feasible. But Obama did such a pedagogic thing when he talked about \\"false choices\\", saying the Republicans were putting up a \\"false choice\\" about health care coverage and other things. To introduce the idea of the false choice as such is not something specific to health care; it's about decision making, choices and thinking. And he used it, a lot. It was sufficiently abbreviated, and sufficiently simple, to float right in the flow of his discourse to the people. Likewise, someone like Harris could have peppered her language with a lot of talk about cherry picking. Others could do so. There should be an anti-cherry picking movement. It should start to be everywhere, just like cherry picking is everywhere on the Right, in the Q rabbit holes and pasted on the walls of mass shooters' basements. There is no way around it; cherry picking is an irreducible thing that must be named as such. It involves saying the words *cherry picking*, and pointing out where and how it is happening. It is possible to teach people how to think, and like it or not, it is absolutely necessary.It is possible to enter into dialogue with people on the Right without announcing your alignment/tribe. Rather, you can just say that you are upset at how much cherry picking is going on. They will likely agree. The conversation can then proceed. Focusing on cherry picking rather than camp frees people up to meet in a different way and can open the door to getting them on board with what the Democrats really are about, because...they Democrats are, a bottom, the anti-cherry picking party.","title":"We need podcasts, streamers, and multiple reliable news outlets that can combat the right wing propaganda bubble"},{"text":"They were def not making fun of the economic anxiety thing man lol.","title":"After Trump wins the influencer election, why some Democrats want to create their own Joe Rogan"},{"text":"He also solved California's drought problems.They'll be drowning in leftist tears for years.","title":"Migrant caravans turn back around after Trump wins election."},{"text":"Nobody better pull a Sinema","title":"'We'll Fight to the Death': Democratic Governors Plan War Against Trump"},{"text":"Accepted into what?

Theres no other way to read it.\\nAnd even if that isnt enough for you:Life before death:-More than 40% of transgender folks in the us have attempted suicide. With access to gender affirming care, trans people are 73% percent less likely to attempt suicide. \\n-Trans people are 4 times more likely to be victims of violent crimes including murder, assault, SA etc than cis people (320 murdered in 2023, Strength before weakness:-trans people represent ~1.14% of the population of US which should equate to about 7-8 congress people, but weve only just elected the first one ever this week.  Supporting trans folks is taking care of those without the power to represent themselves, definitely Dalinar behavior.

Other Fed research found that uncertainty about trade policy may have lowered aggregate U.S. investment by more than 1% in 2018 as firms waited for clarity before committing to new projects.In 2018, Trump became the first president in modern times to systematically threaten and impose tariffs to try and reshape the flow of trade. Trumps stated purpose for new and higher tariffs? Shrink the 2017 U.S. trade deficit of $514 billion, boost U.S. production and increase manufacturing jobs. However, the U.S. trade gap has gotten larger, rising to $577 billion in 2019.E; 1992/94 versus 2024.may wanna take a more modern Econ course in how corps &amp; countries react to tariffs.

My guess would be the first few would be \\"they died in detention from suicide, when it clearly wasn't. Enough to give plausible deniability until the base gets around it, then they will eventually be more open about it. Yes pure speculation on my part, and I really hope I am wrong on hell all of this, I just don't see it right now. The norms are out the window. Can we at least agree that the norms, are out of the window? They are gone and do not govern or have any direct impact on trump or his people. By all means we should be prepared for what may comeCompletely agree. But we should also not get complacent and think the rule of law and norms are coming to save us. but acting like it's going to be the third reich or like Putin's Russia day one is over-the-top and isn't really useful, doom and gloom does not help much.Not doom and gloom, it's a very possible reality, and again, where did I say on day one? Shit like this doesn't happen on day one, it takes a lot of relatively small things here and there to let slip that eventually leads to the more extremes. I very well expect day one to be mostly uneventful as in actual actions taking place against people but a bit of policy here and there right out of the 2025 playbook. You can't deport how many ever people in a day, hell you can't even start it on day one. It would take at least a few weeks to get something in place. The article... I agree with some points but overall it doesn't really apply here. The SC as it is... Is enough to capture the judiciary. Hell they made him king. He's completely immune so long as he can do something under the guise of being an official act which isn't that high of a bar. With that he can do a hell of a lot of damage. If he says no elections in 2026... Who is there to stop it? If he says \\"We have really good perfect the best intelligence that china has taken over the voting machines and we can't have the election right now\\", It would very quickly make it to the supreme court and they will declare him immune and find some rationality of it being lawful. And if enough people go against him, he can take them out because they were an enemy of the people, and get to appoint someone who will be loyal. There are all kinds of possibilities when you remove the norms. And again can we agree the norms are gone? I will say again, I really hope I am wrong and the economy does great everyone is successful and he was just joking about the mass deportations, etc, etc. Hell I want him or anyone to succeed in making all American lives better. I just do not see any path that does that with what is known about his intentions and those around him. The playbook to be a dictator is already out there. Can trump follow it and enact it on his own brilliance all by himself? Fuck no. But those around him, can they put him into position? Can they do all the leg work like project 2025 and enact as much of it as they can asap? Yes, yes they can. Will that happen? I have no clue, my crystal ball is in the shop. I hope it doesn't but it is very well possible, and if some of his people get their way, it's a lot more likely to happen. Will all of this happen on Jan 20, or 21? No, hell no. But can you say you are absolutely certain there will be an election an actual election with actual legitimate results in 2026 and 2028? 2026? I can see that happening, I give it a 50/50 chance, with 2028 20/80. The danger of trump in 2016 was very real, but due to his ineptness and just overall incompetence he wasn't able to get much done. Especially with people around him that told him no, that's illegal and threatened to resign. He will not have that any longer. He will fire career non political people if they are not loyal to him. 2016 trump was a very real and present danger. 2024 trump is going to be something on another level. Again, not day one, or two or three, again, hope it doesn't happen and I will gladly admit I am wrong if I am. I just do not see anything good coming out of this. Again, if norms were followed and people held themselves to the unwritten rules, then I'd agree with a lot of what you say. When the norms go away, all bets are off.","title":"Trump tears into Newsom over special legislative session"},{"text":"Couch fucker","title":"J.D. Vance Was a Poster Boy for Yale Law School.

Fundamental rights are specified by the Constitution (\\"C\\"), and can only be changed by amendments to it. For example, the right to drink alcohol was removed by one amendment, and restored by another. Presidents can rail one way or another, but they can't actually change your rights. B - One of the unfortunate growths in government has been Executive Orders. All Presidents use them, and Trump and Biden were not exceptions. Kamala would have used them too. There are limits to what can be asked, but I am not too sure what they are. C - No it hasn't changed but courts have increasingly empowered other agencies to enact \\"regulations\\" which have the same force as law but aren't subject to the same scrutiny. You could look up \\"Chevron deference\\" for more on this matter. D - Neither could change abortion law if they wanted to. The Supreme Court has correctly applied the Tenth Amendment, and referred the matter back to the \\"several states\\".  Since abortion is not mentioned in the C, there is no 'right' to it at the federal level. It is up to each state to decide what its limits on abortion are.

But there's a ton of work that the new Trump administration will have to get done to turn the US into a dicatorship, and i doubt it will happen within 2 years. With that said, your current concerns should absolutely be about which states your in, if it's republican led. Trump will give them free reign to supress their residents to whatever degree they wish. Any federal protections will likely be repealed. What will likely happen is that the federal government will now work with the states to enact terrible things upon the populations. States who are friendly to conservative ideals will absolutely pounce on any opportunity they're given to strip rights from citizens and denaturalize who they deem as their enemies. Democratic states will have to deal with the attempt of the federal government to infringe on states rights. If you're in a republican state. Now's the time to leave if you can, try to get to a democratic state if you can't outright leave the country. You'll fare better in one of those states. Remember, our system of government is comprised of a large federal government, 50 state governments, and of course we've got places like Peurto Rico who fall under US protections but aren't states and their systems of governance. Trumps presidency represents the beginning of a very large push that will likely result in even more rights being stripped away from every single american. This is going to be far worse than his first term. But our government is so widly complex with so many positions that are not beholden to the executive branch that he may not be able to enact Project 2025 in 2 years at best. We're currently 3 steps into a facist take over of America, but they've got a few more steps to make, and a whole lot of obsticles to over come if they want to control all of America.

Even when we gain power there's so much obstruction that we can't really get enough done, and as soon as we lose power we go further backwards than we can go forward when we are in power.How many decades do we need to wait to accomplish anything? With the supreme court will it ever happen? We can keep saying we'll get the job done next time, but 4 years is a long time for a shot on goal and unless things change drastically we'll be old or dead sitting around waiting to get enough power to do the things we want.Maybe we actually are just too divided to make the federal government work and we should accept that states should do their own thing. Blue states can enact the social programs we want and Red states can fuck themselves over.I have zero confidence that things like universal healthcare would be enacted federally in my lifetime, so being able to get it done better in blue states would be better than nothing. It's not like we need to have it at a federal scale for it to be successful. Sweden only has a population of 10 million. If they can accomplish great social programs at that scale, states can get it done themselves if they have more control over tax dollars. US basically becomes the EU. Shared currency, free trade, freedom of movement, but the rest is up to states.Of course I have zero trust that they would actually give up power for state rights so we'd have to make sure they follow through.","title":"They wanted States Rights!?!---Let's see how this goes: Gov.

While SCOTUS didn't hold one way or the other on their factfinding or legal conclusions (apart from the foundational one that they had the authority to entertain the case in the first place,) it's substantive legal work that you can review for yourself. I'd say it lays out a pretty damning case for why Trump is in fact an oathbreaking insurrectionist.","title":"Congress could try barring Trump from office under 14th Amendment, but it likely wont"},{"text":"Of course they'd issue a shit ruling.

Are liberals really the minority?"},{"text":"I've heard from people actually in the military that them obeying unlawful orders is highly unlikely to happen.I know a few that feel that way as well, but I have seen plenty that would almost certainly follow an unlawful order. Hell some of them may not know it's unlawful until maybe after the fact. As for the piece?I'll go down the list of 20 and pick out ones that I can add something to. If I don't add some it's not that I agree.  One... The problem here isn't diversity, it's a conservative mindset. People who lean that way tend to be more fearful, have larger amygdala's, etc. That fear is easily exploitable. I would also point out that there is an abundance of ignorance to spread around. That's easily exploitable. Hell look at latinos voting for trump? Trump can say everything he has said and they still are like yep, he will make the economy better(he wont) and deport the bad ones -- not me. Two... The rule of law and norms doesn't really matter now. There have been tons of precedent that have been overturned, and if it's useful to them, they will overturn more. Three... Some states may fight back, but not all, and they may or may not win legally even though with precedent, they should. Five... This just says nothing. Former presidents have no power, no say, nothing. This only matters if norms are followed and all people involved are rational law abiding people. Six... Okay? Again, only really matters if norms are norms. We are outside of the playbook here. Well financed? Okay if they see that as a threat, then IRS audits, or seizing assets, civil forfeiture on steroids. It could very easily happen, and do you really think the SC will do anything about it in favor of anyone but trump?Eight... Only matters if people actually pay attention and know what is going on and have the ability to know that it's wrong. With that tech... The NSA under trumps orders could use it to break up any kind of organization. Tech hits both ways. Nine... I agree, but the playbook is already there. Hell I think jd might actually get trump taken out  and be a lot more efficient than trump. Also it's not trump really running things anyway. He's just there to sign shit and as long as he can sign shit and say stupid shit, his fan base will be fine with it. Ten... But not less conservative. You can be conservative but not religious. Fear... is the primary tool used to control people with a conservative mindset. You play into their fear and give them an other to blame for any and all of their problems and they will eat that shit up. Eleven... I agree project 2025 and trump are going to royally fuck the economy, and really hurt his supporters. But as long as they can create a few soundbites that the base will eat up, they will ignore it and blame it on the left. Even if they see shit with their own eyes, as long as they have an out, a scape goat... they'll use it. This is their team. Their team can do no wrong. If their team does something wrong... their team does no wrong. Twelve... You can't prepare for every eventuality. Maybe some things will get held up and slowed down? But with capturing the SC? It's pretty much over at that point. Hell I can easily see a law brought up and the senate breaks the rules and says it passed when it didn't. The house says it passes and didn't. Then trump signs it. Whos there to stop them? What mechanism is going to say, hey wait a minute? That first one, will probably take a few months to get to the SC but once they set that precedent that they didn't do anything wrong, there goes the flood gates. Thirteen... Uhh, he wanted to shoot protesters last time. If he jails or kills a celebrity that goes against him? What's going to happen? The only thing the people can do is protest. Protesting only matters if those in power give a shit about it. Fourteen... I agree somewhat here, but people around him, people he chose to have around him, helping with policies... Can you say the same for them? Can you say if they bring something to him that he will be against it? If they can phrase it or make it in a way that it flatters him, he will definitely sign off on it.Fifteen... That's a very blanket statement that doesn't apply to everyone. There are some smart people on the right. Denying reality doesn't really constrain you. Especially if they are denying reality in name only. Like they know the truth, but deny it. Not all are true believers and they can easily use trump and true believers to get their way. Also dumb people can fail upward, and can fail in ways that are beneficial to them, but not others. Look at elon and trump as prime examples. Sixteen... And how many will be jailed or killed if trump n co deems it? Who is going to stop them?Seventeen... I disagree here. I don't think he will be the head for very long, if he doesn't play ball, but if he does, he can definitely play the figurehead. Hell he's the one that started the eating the pets bullshit, and the right ate that up. As long as he can play into their fears, I doubt he will lose a single trump supporter. If he starts going against it, that's when someone new will step in. Eighteen... The military is made up of normal every day people. They are no better, no worse than anyone else. They are supposed to be apolitical and the norms are that they are. But can you say for certain that there are no die hard trump fans? I'd say easily 20% of the military would follow an order they knew came from trump even if they knew it was unlawful. Probably another 10% or so that didn't know it was lawful or not and just assumed it was. As for the rank and file being nonwhite? Enlisted skews a little bit from the general population, but not by that much. Also as pointed out earlier, you don't have to be white to be a trump supporter. What you are really relying on here is the commissioned side, and what do you think the racial breakdown for that is? If a CO tells you to do something, It is to be presumed to be lawful and must be obeyed by the subordinate.  If you do not obey, that's a dishonorable discharge, maybe 5 years in confinement and forfeiture of pay and allowances. So any order given unless you know 100% it's unlawful, you are probably going to go along with it and obey that unlawful order. Again I do think some will say no, I just don't think everyone will say no and disobey that order. Nineteen... It doesn't matter as long as there is an other. Fear is the driver. Fear of a rival country, fear of your neighbor, fear of someone that you will never meet or have any negative impact on you at all... it does not matter where the fear comes from, just that you can use that fear to control. Some people believe trump is good for the economy, they are very wrong, but fear that Kamala would hurt the economy and hurt their family is very real even though it's a complete and utter lie, it was used to control, and for some it was very effective. Facts are very hard to prove and lies are very easy to believe when fear is a primary motivator. Twenty... Direct odds? Yeah, and? If that mattered at all, he'd be sitting in a cell right now and not in the position he is in. His supporters do not care. They are being controlled by fear and in a fearful state rational and critical thinking goes out the window. He could claim to be the next George Washington, the next Lincoln, etc, and his supporters will be like... yep. As for it being worth reading? It's a feelgood piece designed to stop doom and gloom. It's not based in reality. Well it's based on a reality that has long passed. A reality for norms of a decade or more ago. If this was 2000, I'd agree with just about everything there. Well that and no mention or knowledge of project 2025, and he didn't have all the help he does now. Yes he's very incompetent, but he has people around him now that are a lot more competent. I am open to being wrong on any and everything I said here. I just highly doubt it. I think there are ways to fight back and hopefully outlast trump and maybe get things back to some semblance of normality? I am hoping that rich people will actually fight back when their profits are taking a hit? But could very well just sit back wait til it all collapses and get even richer buying up assets for penny's on the dollar.  There are a lot of possibilities out there where trump goes away in a few years and we get someone in that can hopefully fix some of the mess. But there is also a very real possibility that this was the last presidential election we will see in our lifetime. Will that happen? No clue, but acting like it's not possible is not helping.","title":"Trump tears into Newsom over special legislative session"},{"text":"Appreciate it!","title":"This is why I voted for Trump!"},{"text":"Biden should turn over all the nukes in California to the state.
