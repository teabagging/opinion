They are very cutting with their words, mainly because they had to become good at it after years of getting bullied for stuff they couldn't control about themselves. They said they look out for themselves and the people they care about. They're respectful to me because I treat them the same exact way I treat my parents, and in general, I do that to most people. However, after the election, my other friends who are conservative really wanted to rub it in our progressive friends' faces, and that was more or less a word bloodbath that I saw in the couple of days online along with in real life verbal confrontations. A lot of the progressive friends that I have tend to keep to themselves since 2016, but the ones who are outspoken and have said they aren't nice went out of their way to dig into really old wounds that my conservative friends had, and twist the knife in the wound. Was it mean? Absolutely, but again, my progressive friends who have repeatedly said they aren't nice have years of emotional damage as ammo on our conservative friends and are *very* eager to use it against them now. I really want to reiterate that they have said they aren't nice people, they just want to look out for themselves and the people they care about.  A few of my conservative friends have confided in me that they were so surprised and hurt that the progressive friends we have would open up old wounds that they know really get at them (e.g. grandma died of cancer painfully levels of trauma. Not actually one example, but a similar level of pain), and they were asking me why they weren't being mean to me. I just told them that I didn't rub the election results in their faces, and that I taught myself over time when to socially listen rather than speak when it comes to stuff like this. I don't condone my progressive friends using emotional damage as a weapon against my friends who are conservative and rubbing the election results in their face, but I'm also not going to take a side in it because I don't have a horse in the race for it. I'm a third party in this and I'd prefer to remain that way because I already have other issues in my life that I'm focusing on that directly affect my family and I.For the most part, my friends know I'm really good at avoiding and shutting down political topics because they know that I'd rather use my free time to be stress-free, and politics is the boundary I always tell them that it's a line they should never cross with me. My friends know who I voted for this time around, and none of them have crossed the boundary with me. I'm firm and fair with my stance on that since politics stresses me out and I'd rather not be stressed out in my free time.","title":"Letter: Civility gets us nowhere.

Putin, he reminded Austin, had sent the same number of troops to their border in the spring. And what did Putin get? Reznikov said. He got two phone calls with Biden and a personal meeting in Geneva. The Ukrainian defense minister was convinced Putin was merely trying to get more attention and concessions from Biden and NATO._________Thank you for your information, Zelensky said. But **please stop going out publicly and saying this because its hurting my economy.**__________ Zelensky remained doubtful that Russia could be planning a full takeover of a country of 44 million people. The U.S. was focused in on the most aggressive and least likely option, Zelensky said. **European leaders had told him the American forecasts were exaggerated and that Putin had insisted in private conversations with them and publicly that he wasnt invading.**______**What can I do for you? How can I be of help? Biden asked Zelensky. Gather the leaders of the world, Zelensky said. Ask them to support Ukraine.** Sullivan and Finer, who were listening in, could tell Zelensky was frightened. The Ukrainian presidents usual cowboy rhetoric on phone calls with Biden was gone.____________The only thing they differed on in this early hours was Zelensky wanted a no-fly zone, which Biden declined.- From Woodward's _War_, mainly Chapter 26 and environs.And that's the short version.

If what the republicans are doing is consistently getting them marginal victories - which it is - it's more rational to stick with that than to try and get a bigger margin. That risks losing their voter base if it fails, and doesn't give them anything better than they currently have if it succeeds. So why bother?The way to change this is to change the voting system but, under the current voting system, yes.

The USSR example you bring up is only different from European nomenclature in scale - if the left and the right of the Bolshevik party were more moderate, transposed to any European country they would still be left and right, whereas in the US this scale doesn't apply at all. You say that Europe is insignificant in terms of population and thus you should not follow European intellectual tradition in that regard. I'm not gonna discuss with this (admittedly silly) line of reasoning, but I sympathise with the idea - create your own phraseology that would best apply to the US and use it instead, because sure as hell the \\nDemocratic party should not be called \\"left\\", or \\"left\\" be equated to \\"liberals\\" for what I can tell.

More importantly, what Social Dem/Liberal/Equal Rights/Whatever candidate is going to give them that message/validation with a straight face?I personally think the only hope is going to be that things are so bad that Dems will sweep in 2028, and we need someone like FDR who has a vision and will do everything to get it done and fk the norms. Its hard to say it, but it seems the best way to win consistently is make things so good that everyday blue-collar people disengage from politics and focus on their lives instead.Either way, for anything major like student loan forgiveness, or Medicare for all to happen, Federal Judge impeachments are going to have to be on the table for all levels, and that is going to take a big change in the Dem party the next 4 years.","title":"Letter: Civility gets us nowhere.

French diplomats in Brussels have voiced support for a proposal that would allow for up to 35 per cent of EU budget-financed cash incentives to be spent on defence products from outside the 27-member bloc, according to five people briefed on technical discussions last week. That follows around a year of opposition from Paris to allowing defence companies from countries such as the US, UK, Israel and Turkey from participating in the EUs proposed European Defence Investment Plan (EDIP), on the grounds that it should only promote homegrown companies amid a push for European strategic autonomy. But that position had shifted this month, two of the officials said, adding that it would be difficult for the EU to simultaneously lobby incoming US president Donald Trump not to reduce US military support to Europe, while excluding US companies from efforts to build up the European defence industry. Everyone is thinking a bit smarter since [the US election], said one of the officials. Countries such as Sweden that have strong links to the UK defence industry had been opposed to Frances previous position, arguing that it could exclude their defence contractors that had British shareholders or relied on UK-sourced components. The 65/35 proposal was drawn up by the Hungarian rotating presidency of the EU and involved inputs from France, Germany, Italy and Spain, three of the officials said. Negotiations on the proposal were set to take place in the coming weeks and it could change before it is presented to parliament in early 2025, they added. The proposal also includes a clause banning the participation of countries deemed to contravene the blocs security and the principle of good relations. France viewed the proposal as a good basis for compromise, another of the officials said. The French representation to the EU declined to comment.\\nEDIP, which was first proposed last February and must be agreed by both the EUs 27 capitals and the European parliament in order to come into force, would pump cash into joint production and procurement of European weapons. The initiative seeks to stimulate investment in the continents underfunded arms industry and encourage capitals to buy weapons together, to promote interoperability and bring down prices. The EDIPs aims include increasing the availability and supply of key defence products and addressing bottlenecks in critical supply chains supporting the European arms industry, and involving Ukrainian manufacturers. The project is only earmarked for a 1.5bn cash pot under the existing EU budget to 2027, but many capitals are pushing for it to grow significantly in the future. Officials also say that its spending rules would probably provide a long-term framework for similar EU defence initiatives. A drive to increase European defence self-sufficiency began with Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and is expected to only increase under Trump, who has vowed to end the generations-old US military protection to European countries who dont spend enough on their own defence. Even before Trumps election, Brussels has been attempting to encourage better co-ordinated and more effective defence procurement as EU capitals increase national defence budgets. Many observers fear the US shifting its security focus away from Europe towards Asia.!ping EUROPE&amp;FOREIGN-POLICY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Its shocked me how quickly that kind of rhetoric has been normalized and accepted Im 30 and its worse than any of the sexism I remember from the 2000s.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Its widely believed here in Canada (where the accident took place) that Kevin was the one driving the boat, had been drinking at the time and had his wife take the fall because of it.

He ended the Glass-Steagall act which directly lead to the 2008 financial crisis with millions of Americans losing their jobs, suffering bankruptcies, and evictions when their homes foreclosed. Bill also signed NAFTA which destroyed the middle class in this country. Unions couldn't compete with cheaper labor in Mexico or China and lost bargaining power for benefits and jobs. People remember when a good union job in a factory meant they could afford a middle class house, trade in their truck every couple years for a new one, send their kids to college and afford the tuition, they had sick days, go on vacation with the family a week or two each summer, the entire family had fantastic health insurance, and when he retired, the company had a generous pension. People weren't rich, but they didn't have to work two or three jobs to get by or stress about money. My students today can't even imagine a time like this, but the older generation remembers. I don't think it's not an accident that the swing states are the rust belt states. They voted for Bush thinking their lives would improve. It didn't. They voted for Obama's hope &amp; change. Obama didn't bring back the good, union manufacturing jobs. So they voted for Trump who \\"told it like it is\\" that the middle class got hosed. He was an outsider, not an established, traditional politician. He promised to bring back factories, good paying jobs, and restore their dignity. Trump didn't.

It also caused a (predictable) barrage of hostile reactions from both their allies and opponents, as well as a rejection of their stated motivation of \\"defending freedom of speech\\", since they advocated for repealing the single offense that is causing them trouble with the law due to their apologia of Hamas and downplaying of October 7, while ignoring other infractions restricting freedom of speech, like racially motivated insults or incitation to hatredLe Monde just released an op-ed backing the spirit of the bill but denouncing LFI for botching it so badly that a reform of the infraction might be buried for years. I'm joining them in that frustration, because I believe that the infractions restricting freedom of speech are both too ineffective in their stated goal of reducing public expressions of hatred and vague enough that it stifles freedom of speech without discernable benefits. I'd also bet that between the leftists mad about being investigated for terrorism apologia, the right-wingers mad about being investigated for racial slurs and the handful of surviving liberals who have an opposition of principle to the existence of speech-related infractions, there should be a majority to repeal themBut since owning the establishment on X is more important than actually working to pass legislation, it's dead and buried for a while.

One of the best analysis relevant to what you are wondering is to look at how the death rate of persons in a particular country change. Here is the finding:1. The death rates decreased FOR ALL cohorts (that is, persons who are vaccinated, partially vaccinated, or not vaccinated) when the vaccines were introduced.2. The death rates decreased THE MOST for those who are fully vaccinated and THE LEAST for those who are unvaccinated. But the death rate did not reach zero for any.This relation was found in several countries (e.g. USA, Switzerland, Chile). See this site for data and extended argument: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination)Here is how you can reconcile this: infectious disease moves from one infected person to another uninfected person. When some number of people in the population become immune or partially immune thanks to vaccine or natural immunity after recovery from an infection, then there are fewer people who can transmit the disease. Hence, everyone benefits. Those who take the vaccine help themselves and their fellow citizens.Your view states the vaccines were not necessary to lift lockdowns. In a strict sense, this is true. After a sufficient number of people have been infected (and the weakest perished), then natural immunity will happen. The COVID pandemic was not the first pandemic and back when the Spanish Flu happened, there were no vaccines to talk of. So the choice we had was how to return to normal. The rapid development and deployment of vaccines to a majority of the population had benefits in that it meant fewer deaths, and fewer people having to be put on a ventilator, which is unpleasant. Nowadays lockdowns are rarely if ever needed because a sufficient number of people are immune to covid (and indirectly, the virus has mutated to become less lethal).You point to other countries that did not have the option to use advanced vaccines. As others have noted many of these countries have younger populations. Young people were far less affected by COVID. Also, hot countries where most labour and social activities take place outdoors are less affected because the virus spreads more easily indoors. I think your view should be changed to: Vaccination against COVID-19 of a large enough group of persons in a society, especially one that skews towards older persons, was the preferable way to return to mostly normal social and economic activities.A final note: our ability to attribute what social issues were a direct effect of COVID, the virus, and what effects arose from our actions (e.g. lockdown, government handouts, school closures) are going to be hard to disentangle. I think we can be critical of aspects of what happened during the pandemic. Some countries are worse off after the pandemic than others. But it is far more likely to be a consequence of other acts taken. The vaccines reduced population death rates, which is very helpful.","title":"cmv: The COVID19 vaccine was not necessary to lift lockdowns and still not necessary today."},{"text":"The solution is giving them citizenship.

I can just as well give examples of negative externalities, namely signaling but also people fighting over culture war nonsense, union rent-seeking and the simple fact that government run schools obviously are much more expensive.And this is anyways an issue of regulating what schools are allowed to/must teach, not regulating who is allowed to run them or parents ability to choose which school their kid goes to. So just forbid religious teaching at school. But I think that's stupid too, why is schooling and teaching religion separately(different time and location) ok, but combining them is wrong? Is the issue that money meant for education is going to religion? Even setting aside the fact that as long as how much the parents intended to spend on education is greater than what the voucher is this literally doesn't matter, then the solution would be to get rid of vouchers as well and just give (poor) families money directly(AND regulating how much education they must give their children; how many years, hours/day, what to teach etc etc)There may be positive and negative externalities to various foods, that doesn't mean the farming/food processing/grocery stores should be nationalized.

The arrangement that perhaps comes closest to being justified [...] at least for primary and secondary education  is a mixed one under which governments would continue to administer some schools but parents who chose to send their children to other schools would be paid a sum equal to the estimated cost of educating a child in a government school, provided that at least this sum was spent on education in an approved school. This arrangement would meet the valid features of the natural monopoly argument, while at the same time it would permit competition to develop where it could. It would meet the just complaints of parents that if they send their children to private nonsubsidized schools they are required to pay twice for education  once in the form of general taxes and once directly  and in this way stimulate the development and improvement of such schools. The interjection of competition would do much to promote a healthy variety of schools. It would do much, also, to introduce flexibility into school systems. Not least of its benefits would be to make the salaries of school teachers responsive to market forces. It would thereby give governmental educational authorities an independent standard against which to judge salary scales and promote a more rapid adjustment to changes in conditions of demand or supply.The adoption of such arrangements would make for more effective competition among various types of schools and for a more efficient utilization of their resources. It would eliminate the pressure for direct government assistance to private colleges and universities and thus preserve their full independence and diversity at the same time that it enabled them to grow relatively to State institutions. It might also have the ancillary advantage of causing a closer scrutiny of the purposes for which subsidies are granted. The subsidization of institutions rather than of people has led to an indiscriminate subsidization of whatever activities it is appropriate for such institutions to undertake, rather than of the activities it is appropriate for the state to subsidize. Even cursory examination suggests that while the two classes of activities overlap, they are far from identical.","title":"Republicans push plans to dramatically expand education vouchers  despite voter resistance."},{"text":"The ballot measure repealing the same sex marriage ban in Hawaii getting only 56% support feels like a canary in the coal mine.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"black woman broke themIf this is what brokenness feels like, sign me up for more.","title":"Kamala Harris video goes viral, raises eyebrows"},{"text":"because the virus was easily transferred by anal sex.","title":"Why was there an AIDS epidemic for gay men?"},{"text":"Some of our columnists(MattY) and media allies seem to think the below somehow means the tariffs are fakehttps://preview.redd.it/pd17jfk5wm3e1.jpeg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1af1f38f9729888bc3474dfb87ce954b36d058f3","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Well?

However, that war could have been avoided, along with the refugee problem, had the Arab side accepted territorial compromise from the outset, in the form of the 1947 UN partition plan. At the end of the war, although many local Arabs had fled, many also remained. Those that remained became full citizens of Israel. By contrast, no Jews remained in any of the areas of Mandatory Palestine conquered by neighboring Arab countries like Jordan and Egypt. They either were expelled or killed. Moreover, the conflict also created hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees who were forced to leave their homes in Arab countries. Unlike the Palestinians, these Jews moved on and settled in other countries and are no longer refugees.Having lost the territorial war, Arab leaders began to view the refugees as another weapon in their war to eliminate the State of Israel, as documented in?*The War of Return*, the authoritative new book by Dr. Einat Wilf and Adi Schwartz. In the words of Egyptian Foreign Minister Muhammad Salah al-Din in October 1949, It is well known and understood that the Arabs, in demanding the return of the refugees to Palestine, mean their return as masters of the Homeland and not as its slaves. With greater clarity, they mean the liquidation of the State of Israel.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://unwatch.org/item-7/claim/claim-5-palestinian-refugees-have-a-right-of-return/#_ftn2)?Thus, the refugee issue has always been political rather than legal. Indeed, recognizing that this is a political issue which can only be resolved through negotiations, the Palestinians agreed in the Oslo Accords that it would be dealt with in final status negotiations.[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://unwatch.org/item-7/claim/claim-5-palestinian-refugees-have-a-right-of-return/#_ftn3)The Palestinians base their claim to a legal right of return into the sovereign State of Israel on Paragraph 11 of General Assembly Resolution 194(III) of December 11, 1948 titled?*Palestine C Progress report of the United Nations Mediator*. That resolution established a conciliation commission to mediate a resolution to the conflict. In that context, it included provisions concerning negotiating a final settlement (Para 6), Holy Places (Para 7), Jerusalem (Paras 8-9), facilitating economic development of the area (para 10) and refugees (para 11).","title":"CMV: Netanyahu should be blamed for a lot of things, but he is not the reason we don't have a 2-State solution."},{"text":"Just someone please tell me, what in here is a Neoliberal policy?

The US has a strong history of both right wing thought extending to fascism (a lot of which is currently being diluted and accepted into the presidential wing of the GOP while the rest of the party looks on reluctantly - see congress) and socialism (the right of which has been clinging, unwelcome and dessicated, to the left wing of the democratic party for decades).?The german-american bund, the know-nothings, and of course the political power of the klan, are history of past overt fascism, and the modern American far right is in many ways indebted to (and comparable to) those pasts, while being it's own distinct force. as an aside which speaks to the usefulness of international references,?usefully the modern American far right is more similar in some ways to aspects of classical fascism than historic American racial politics - the focus on victory and focus on social Darwinism at every level, but is more circumspect about racial aspects. fasicsm is less usefully regarded with Nazism as it's origin than Mussolini.The CPUSA and the past of the IWW, as well as parts of the history of the AFL-CIO and worker movements in places like Virginia before the new deal (which neutered radical union organisation) are examples of a radical leftist past, and today leftism is alive in disorganised young people and their few supportive democratic left wingers who are forced to moderate into the party line.In all (I guess, afaik?) cases American radical forces have been either sidelined as intended by the electoral college or, rarely, the army or fbi (Blair mountain, bleeding Kansas, the panthers.. the civil war, reconstruction). Except of course when they integrate themselves into a party... which nationalists and fascists are much better at doing. Today American electoral politics being the litmus test for what is left and right in American politics wholesale.. is just as much a lie as it always was.So my thesis here is A) American political strands and schools are not actually that different from European or western politics - different issues appear and different choices are made, sometimes, but we've not changed what \\"left\\", \\"right\\", or any other political ideologies mean, literally, no matter how woefully inaccurately things are used by media anywhere. Socialism, liberalism, nationalism and fascism have histories shared internationally and the US has not diverged in any - for every sanders, obama and trump there is a Corbyn, macron and orban, who differ in policy, and not entire political frame of reference, and talk broadly the same political language. And B) American politics does and always has spanned the entire political left-right spectrum, is far more diverse than generally discussed or allowed (legally and socially) to participate, and parties nominally existing as left-right doesn't factually make them equally distant from the \\"centre\\".To me, the only factually useful definition of a centre is \\"the centre point of all significant ideologies in a political framework's history\\" not \\"relative to who is succeeding\\". If you examine US politics from the latter perspective, you get and always get \\"US electoral politics is both somewhere left and right of centre - left of the democrats being far left, right of the republicans being far right\\" - and ALWAYS WILL. A useless, reference-free descriptor and one of the problems with the US political landscape (and everywhere else to some extent). If you examine it from the former, you get \\"US electoral Politics sits from slightly left of centre in the extreme, to modern, fasicst-leaning in the extreme, with the preponderance being economically centre-left to centre-right and various kinds of socially liberal, to economically centre-right and various kinds of socially conservative.I think the latter is far, far more useful - especially given that it's highly debatable. Please, I'm attempting to give an honest assessment of US political leanings and I feel that is a meaningful thing to do, but my point is not that these descriptors are correct, absolute and universal but that they are useful and the exercise is useful.I agree that this conception is becoming outdated everywhere, partly because we've recently neglected economic positions in the consideration,? mainly because I think there is a far greater level of dissent between economic establishment and economic radical though than there is within left-right thought, in the public, and insufficient exploration of what various economic objections and policy alternatives entail, and whose ideology they actually fit within. This is true of the rest of the west just as much as it is of America, which is why I feel we should read our current political standings with reference to our collective history, not with essentially always neutral reference to our individual present. If we're changing our conception, I'd say we should all prioritise trying to consider more the economic alternatives and impacts from our ideologies' history, together, rather than any of us ceasing to use western ideologies in general as a reference for the \\"left right\\" aspects of our current politics.","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"Its not misinformation.

Thus you're correct; the political orientations in the country were confined to \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" wing, and \\"centre\\" factions internal to the CPSU, and throughout it's history politics existed as some form of controlling establishment, opposition establishment (however overtime), and dissident.?America is different; the north American, European and other \\"western liberal democratic\\" systems are, by degree, much more comparable, and all pretty much (in terms of the use of the right-left descriptors, if not lineage) descended from that revolutionary french assembly's arrangement. This is particularly true of English speaking democracies, but not substantially different for western Europe; far right/fascist in the US refers literally to the same broad grouping as it does in France and Italy, as does communist/socialist, as does social liberal, as does social conservative, as does classical liberal, as does social democratic, and so forth. All of these countries have their specific forms of the various parties involved, with their idiosyncrasies, but broadly they fit on the same axis.Take for a counter example the politics of ECOWAS countries in west Africa today; there is indeed a catalogue of pretty closely mirrored western-style ideologies which existed into the like, 2010s, social democrats and centrists and conservatives, as well as a few socialists and so forth, but recently theres been a line of military coups. These forces called back to old socialist or dictatorial icons like Thomas sankara, or positioned themselves as centrists or technocrats - interim military governors but still western democrats. Id argue however, that the former group, broadly, can be more usefully seen as \\"pro-western-liberal-democratic\\" (like?Ke?ta's \\"rally for Mali\\" a \\"centre-left\\" party which integrated Mali into western international structures and allies to increase democracy and reduce poverty)?while the latter (like the junta that deposed him) can be seen as opposed to this. They draw on socialist ideas and nationalist/authoritarian ones, are motivated highly by opposition to Islamist insurgencies and militarism, and talk the talk of interim government and coming elections. Add to all the above the ethnic allegiances of the various parties involved, where opposition to colonialism is meant to sit in western thought whereas where it dominantly sits in west African thought, and the ideological contradictions of the new allies of the juntas (Russia)...My point is neither the previous (\\"western centrist\\") democratic governments, nor the juntas, are best described through western conceptions of left-right or our ideological descriptors, except if you're talking specific policy; as a whole, the spectrum looks different there (and maybe is EVEN less usefully looked at as a linear spectrum). There is no such conceptual divide between the US, UK EU, Canada or AUS/NZ, or probably India and various others.The counter would be \\"but sure, the two (three) major (!)

That does not make your view accurate or the most logical conclusion. It makes it a correlation equals causation conclusion. Thirdly, COVID isn't a super deadly disease. It really only a serious threat to the elderly, most of whom will survive an infection, but the rate of death will be higher. Or the immune compromised or very young.

You can't sanction them into a different position here.Your strategy would absolutely work if the Israelis insisted on staying in the west bank for purely ideological reasons. That's why they are unaffected by all the UN resolutions, ICC/ICJ statements and accusations, international backlash, BDS campaign, etc. None of it matters when at the end of the day, they see their military occupation of the Palestinian territories as a necessary thing that keeps them alive.You now have the urge to convince me why it's illogical for the Israelis to feel this way. That the Palestinians wouldn't be so upset at them and wouldn't want them dead if they were nicer to them. But there are two things that Israelis know that you, a westerner, doesn't:1 - they experienced the second intifada. At a time when Israeli willingness to give over the west bank was at an apex, when they had just offered essentially the entire thing over with a full withdrawal, east Jerusalem as a capital, etc., they were targeted by not one, not 5, not 26, not 79, but 130 terrorist attacks each killing one to dozens of people, targetting buses filled with children, cafes, underage bars, pizza shops, etc. They experienced the Gaza withdrawal. After reluctantly but unilaterally pulling out of Gaza down to every last Jew, to create a judenrein territory to meet the Palestinian demand (the same demand that currently stands in regards to the west bank), they watched Hamas take over in a coup and start flooding Israel with terrorist attacks and rockets.2 - they understand Arabic better than you. They know that when Hamas, the most popular Palestinian government, and the one who would undoubtedly take over the West Bank given an Israeli withdrawal says \\"occupation\\", they aren't talking about the actual military occupation, they're talking about the entire state of Israel. They know that the Palestinians wouldn't start accepting Israel if it just did the right things, palestinians hate Israel for what it is - a Jewish state, a malignant and temporary anomaly on what is intrinsically Arab land. \\"Sea\\" and \\"free\\" doesn't rhyme in Arabic. In the original version, Palestine *is* Arab from water to water.Until the average Israeli (who is non religious and doesn't actually care about the ancient Jewish connection to Judea &amp; Samaria) feels that their security concerns are invalid or miscalculated, they simply are not going to vote for someone who wants to give any territory away.By the way I'm not even arguing that any of the Israelis are correct for thinking this way. I'm just saying it's true. That they *do* think this way. And if you want to influence them in any direction, you have to understand this basic ethos, and why things like sanctions won't do a damn thing.You can call them stupid or evil or any combination of those things. But none of this changes until you address that fundamental Israeli concern.","title":"CMV: Netanyahu should be blamed for a lot of things, but he is not the reason we don't have a 2-State solution."},{"text":"The money to Hamas started after 2018 because then the world would have said that Israel is starving Gaza","title":"CMV: Netanyahu should be blamed for a lot of things, but he is not the reason we don't have a 2-State solution."},{"text":"Camp David and Taba.

Yes, voting is one of the most powerful tools a US citizen holds. But even that power is limited when it comes to institutions, corporations, the establishment, or whatever you want to call them, getting involved. My point is that the 99%, the working class, your average person is screaming what they want help with or what they want to see happen. People are either on one side of fence with extreme conservatism, or on the other side with extreme liberalism or socialist policies. Trump was the answer for the right. His extremist views appeals to his base, and eventually the Republican party capitulated to him. Youve heard it numerous times about how much they despise the man, but when the time comes, they cave in to his every demands. In 2016, and to an extent again in 2020, Bernie Sanders was the answer for the left, but monied interests and the Powers that Be, chose to work against the one who truly appealed to the demographics the Democrats so desperately wantI dont think left wing extremism is the problem. Woke-ism didnt fail the Democrats this election. Liberal beliefs didnt fail Harris this election. I believe Neoliberalism / moderate Democrats are the problem. It failed us in just the wrong way in 2016. It barely paved the way for victory in 2020. And it absolutely destroyed us in 2024. \\nPlease dont get me wrong. If there were another election between Harris and Trump, I would absolutely vote for Harris over and over again.  But the big problem is that in deep red states, like mine, having the support of people like Liz Cheney is meaningless around here. Around here, there are no moderate Republicans. This is Trump country through and through. I wanted to believe that there are moderate Republicans out there in my neighborhood, but the margin of victory for Republicans was astronomical. Appealing to a demographic that isnt there, while abandoning one that is screaming for your attention was a fools mission.As much as I hate to admit it, Trump saw this weakness, and he took full advantage of it. He fed them solutions, albeit cruel, evil, and inhumane ones, but someone was listening to them. He is the last person on earth that should relate to the common folk, but he did his work, and it paid off for him. In some absurd way, people saw themselves in Trump, whether it was as a felon, a fast food worker, or the little guy against the big machine.

Hell, at least two separate Palestinian peacemakers/moderates were murdered by their own people when they tried to advocate against bloody war. Its clear to me that no Palestinian has the power to create peace, and that any who try would likely be harmed by Hamas/PLF before he got too far, and stonewalled by Israel even if he somehow survived Hamas and the PLF.I could, however, name a single Israeli who had the power to change the status quo. Netyanhu is the head of state of Israel, which has an economy that is over 1000x the size of Gaza + West bank put together. His military is 10x their size, far better equipped, far better trained, with fully functional air superiority at all times and tons of artillery.Furthermore, Netyanhu has been in power for two decades. If Netyanhu wanted a two-state solution, he could have easily pushed one through. If he wanted a  one-state solution, he also could have easily pushed it through. My only conclusion is that he wants an extended conflict where both sides take grievous casualties on a regular basis (with the Palestinians taking 100x more). He wants terrorists to randomly blow up Israeli citizens, as every time one of those attacks happens his party gets tens of thousands more votes at the polls.Because Netyanhu is the only person in the region who decisively had the power to stop these attacks - whether through a one state solution or a two state solution - and he still has not bothered to try.","title":"CMV: Netanyahu should be blamed for a lot of things, but he is not the reason we don't have a 2-State solution."},{"text":"People forget so quickly what Biden actually did, which was a lot.

The heir to the throne represented conservative, feudal Austria. Franz Ferdinand kept up an emphatically aristocratic lifestyle, as expressed in his love of hunting. A typically Habsburg passion, in him the thrill of the chase took on an almost pathological character: Franz Ferdinand was the most trigger-happy of the Habsburgs, as attested by his meticulously kept hunting ledgers which record a total of 274,511 kills. The walls of his palaces were decorated with dense displays of hunting trophies.\\nHis favourite country estate at Konopi?t in Bohemia became a symbol of his pro-Slav political plans. Although very popular in Bohemia, the archduke had little support at the Viennese Court, being seen as ambitious, difficult, irascible and lacking in diplomacy.\\nThe archdukes conservative attitudes also manifested themselves in his taste in art: Franz Ferdinand was a pronounced opponent of the early Viennese Modern movement, today regarded as the trademark of the Viennese art scene around 1900. Franz Ferdinand successfully blocked projects designed by Otto Wagner, for example the new War Ministry on Stubenring, where today an ornate neo-Baroque edifice by Ludwig Baumann, an architect much favoured by the archduke, faces Wagners iconic Post Office Savings Bank. In the field of art Franz Ferdinand was the figure who wielded the most influence in the dynasty, since Franz Joseph scrupulously avoided taking a position. The elderly emperor eventually delegated the completion of the Neue Burg wing of the Hofburg to his successor, which resulted in a number of changes to the designs. This mammoth project was to remain uncompleted.\\nFranz Ferdinand was also an enthusiastic collector of art, buying large quantities of antiques. However, he possessed little expertise and was often taken in by forgeries. He spent large sums of money on historicizing restorations of his private residences, furnishing them with a plethora of objets dart. As heir to the Italian Habsburg-d'Este line, Franz Ferdinand was also the owner of the valuable Este art collection which was among the most important in Europe. Like many aristocrats of his time, the archdukes tastes were firmly rooted in the late Historicist aesthetic, while progressive groups within the middle classes favoured modern artistic currents.\\nFranz Ferdinands official residence in Vienna was the Upper Belvedere Palace, which he had extensively restored and furnished in the neo-Baroque style. His promotion of this style was a deliberate expression of his extremely conservative political views. It also corresponded to his love of the Baroque, an era that in the historiography of the time was regarded as Austrias heroic age and which the archduke saw as the classic Austrian Habsburg style.\\nThe Belvedere also became a byword for the archdukes shadow government, as it was here that he gathered political stalwarts around him in preparation for assuming the reins of power when the elderly emperor died, in opposition to the established forces at Court, referred to in the political scene of the time as Sch?nbrunn.?\\nMartin Mutschlechner\\"\\nThis is from the Sch?nbrunn group.?\\nHis dealings with the serbs and slovens were a political maneuver to basically take power away from the the Hungarians, whom he hated.?","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"It's bad faith because it's literal cherry picking.

After all, we know what our beliefs are and we know that we came to those beliefs through rational thoughts and decision making. Let's just go with the assumption that the average person is legitimately reasonable and capable of thinking rationally. Republicans think they are reasonable too. If you ask the average Republican \\"Do you think poor people should have reliable access to healthcare?\\" They would probably reply that they do. It's just the mechanism for providing that access that Democrats and Republicans tend to disagree on. The average Republican truly believes that healthcare wouldn't be so expensive, and thus inaccessible, if the healthcare industry was deregulated and hospitals were allowed to compete with each other like other businesses. They aren't thinking \\"I want poor people to die, so I'm gonna make healthcare more expensive, MUAHAHA!\\", they are acknowledging the problem and thinking of solutions.Similarly with immigration, the vast majority of Republicans acknowledge that immigration is a good thing for our economy, when it's legal. If it's illegal, they'd say it could be helpful, it could also be hurting us. To a Republican, our country is safer and better off if we simply know who's coming in, and turning away all the ne'er-do-wells. Again, most Republicans would admit that we are in need of immigration reform to make it easier, cheaper, and faster to legally immigrate, but that we still need strong borders to keep illegal drugs, human traffickers, gang members, etc, out.So to summarize, it's not that Republicans are evil, it's that you need to understand that they are simply seeking alternate solutions to the same problems Democrats are","title":"CMV: It would benefit Republcians to just... stop being evil."},{"text":"??it's still vastly more valuable to have sex with a human than with a robot that feels like a human.\\nWhy?

In that context it is Liberal, however if I asked you to describe Russia I am almost certain you would describe it as Authoritarian - because compared to your US liberal perspective it is much less liberal.A fixed internal comparison is almost useless as it gives you no real perspective - for example restricting slavery to just indentured slaves is both radical/moderate and Conservative/Liberal in certain context.You need to compare against something, and an external comparison against a country in a similar context seems entirely reasonable to me. Why not India, China, or the Middle EastI think most times this Western Europe comparison is used is because the person wants to compare to Western Develop Countries of which both Western Europe and the US are a part of. Its much more challenging to compare policy between developing and developing countries- eg universal free healthcare is practically impossible to deliver if you have very limited resources.

Ukraine requested ATACMS in mid 2022, they were only delivered at the end of 2023 and only just this month, were they allowed to actually make use of their range. Whether stated or not, this was the goal of the administration. They did not want Ukraine to win. They wanted a stalemate so as not to anger Russia.

The program will keep doing that until you are satisfied.You either have to adjust the pre-written message or remove characters or a combination of both until the problem is solved ..Once satisfied, the program algorithm that matched the numbers is your key??..You can then go out - show the cipher and run the program in reverse with the key ?? , it is actually coding, but you tell everyone that you are decoding and they will believe you, because they dont know that the process is running in reverse.. how would they?Thats how he did it. But he had a problem. He had too many characters.. So, he randomly eliminated characters from the top right of the cipher and said, The Zodiac made a mistake but I corrected it That in my professional opinion is what went down ..Note: The process I just described is how the British cracked the enigma code..He gave himself up trying to pretend he was really smart about cryptology ..Its amazing how, in my opinion, crooks always confess, during the moment they are bragging about how they got away with something- pretending to be talking about something else ..It never fails ..Note 2: people always ask, if the key ?? he came up with for the z340 works, why doesnt it work on the z408..They are created the same.. The reason it does not work on both is because its an encryption key - not a decryption key ??..And since everyone thinks Don &amp; Betty already cracked the Zodiac z408, his key would have to produce their result or people would be asking questions.If he defended a new result, he would have more eyes on him and more questions .. He probably figures, I got away with it once, why push my luck.. Im famous and thats all I wanted ..So he didnt get greedy and just said, the ciphers were created differently, even when he knows they were not ..","title":"A Los Angeles Investigation feels, after a conversation with David Oranchak, that his z340 cipher solution is a total fraud and so many people fell for it!"},{"text":"Hard to argue you're the anti fascist candidate when you have fascist lite Cheney's endorsing you","title":"Hot Ones Turned Down Kamala Harris as Guest Because Show Didnt Want to Delve Into Politics, Campaign Staffer Says"},{"text":"AI was going to be regulated for obvious reasons but instead we get anarchy AI where 100 companies all have the capacity to create a monsters beyond our control fuck up the planet if anything goes wrong (which will, Murphy's Law).","title":"Marc Andreessen Describes \\"Alarming\\" Meeting With Biden Admin That Prompted His Trump Endorsement"},{"text":"Sure, I'm not against a low tax environment.

Friedman and other real NLs actually hate subsidies unless they are absolutely necessary, because they are economically distortionary.Public schools are not an inferior product if they are well funded and ran by good administrators.

American society is currently failing because of its current anti-intellectual binge that it's hooked on right now, and alot of that has to do with the fact that people want to wage a war on public education to basically turn everyone into a bunch of rubes. Conservatives being against teaching macroeconomics (which is no longer a required course in high school in Texas) is a pretty good example of this. Everyone benefits from a more educated populace.I'm also not against means tested vouchers if your child has a learning disability or if you are a person that does not come from a wealthy background.

The media for starting non-stop coverage on how tariffs will cause massive inflation and havoc to the economy only after the horse left the barn. Those are the two things that make me angriest about the election. Anything Harris did or her selection process is peanuts in comparison to those two things.In the last week every time I turn on the radio or see a news websites there's long pieces on tariffs and how bad they'll make things. Before the election there was near zero actual pieces on the consequences of those economic policies. Voters were angry about inflation... and the press for some reason didn't think they would be interested in reading how trump's big economic plan was going to bring inflation back with a vengeance.Inflation and tariffs should have been covered in the same way Biden's age was immediately following the debate, they were equivalently disqualifying topics. Instead trump's plan for guaranteed economic suicide was covered as if it were a normal proposal and nothing to be concerned about. And because of that many people voted for him because they thought he was better for the economy. Now only after the election, there's so many articles on how bad for the economy his keynote plans are....

The events of WWI were indeed a tangled web of alliances and conflicts, but the argument that no one was good or bad overlooks some critical nuances about Germanys role and intentions.Germany's actions before and during WWI show it wasn't merely defending an ally (Austria-Hungary) but also pursuing expansionist aims. The infamous Schlieffen Plan exemplifies thisit was a preemptive strategy to invade neutral Belgium to quickly defeat France, which brought Britain into the war. This wasn't just about alliance obligations but about Germany asserting dominance in Europe.Additionally, Germanys leadership, particularly Kaiser Wilhelm II, embraced a militaristic and imperialist worldview, which contributed to the wars escalation. The war aims discussed within German political circles often revolved around territorial acquisitions in both Western and Eastern Europe. Even as the war dragged on and hope of victory faded, Germany pushed for aggressive terms rather than negotiated peace, reflecting ambitions beyond mere defense.Yes, atrocities like the Herero genocide were not unique to Germany, as other European colonial powers committed similar acts. However, this doesnt absolve Germany of responsibilityit just highlights a broader issue of European imperialism. Moreover, during WWI itself, the German military committed documented war crimes, such as the atrocities in Belgium, including massacres and destruction of cultural sites, which fueled the image of Germany as a belligerent aggressor.The web of alliances undoubtedly played a role in turning a localized conflict into a global war, but this doesnt absolve individual nations of accountability. Germany gave Austria-Hungary a blank check of unconditional support, knowing it could provoke a wider conflict. While Russia and France also acted to support their allies, Germanys strategic decisions escalated the conflict significantly.Your point that no nation was entirely good or evil in WWI is crucialwars of this scale involve shared responsibilities and tragedies. However, dismissing Germanys specific contributions to the wars escalation and conduct overlooks key historical realities. A balanced view acknowledges that Germany played a central role in turning a diplomatic crisis into a global catastrophe.Rather than focusing on absolving Germany or demonizing it, understanding its motivations, mistakes, and ambitions within the broader context is key to appreciating the complexity of WWI. This approach doesnt excuse anyone but gives a fuller picture of how such a devastating conflict unfolded. Would you agree that recognizing Germanys role in context is more constructive than viewing it as either blameless or entirely villainous?","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"A lot of white liberals are completely ignorant of this issue and would probably speak positively of things like affirmative action, having no idea how much of a 3rd rail it is in certain communities.","title":"Steel concedes so Dems have officially flipped CA45."},{"text":"The one that worked themselves to exhaustion trying to get Europe united, Putin deterred and Ukraine armed when their intelligence was blinking red and _nobody_ believed them?

But overall, the Russians still abided by the ideals of keeping the balance of power in tact.  Germany was the odd one out. They hated the idea of a balance of power, viewing themselves as naturally 'dominant' and that they should be the rulers of Europe as a continental superpower. They were the only real power in Europe in WW1 to actually have imperialistic goals on a truly large scale. The concept that Germans had some kind of 'destiny' to rule Europe and break the balance of power is what basically caused WW1. That same ultranationalism that fueled WW1 eventually metastasized into Nazism. A lot of people tend to think of WW1 and WW2 Germany as very ideologically different, but they weren't that different. They had effectively the same ideology of German supremacism/dominance. Nazism just took it to a zealous, religious, almost occultist level of extremism.

This law doesnt just expose marginalized students to harmit creates an environment where any student could become a target of abuse, privacy violations, and humiliation.Rep. Adam Bird, the sponsor of this legislation, has glibly stated that enforcement will be left up to schools. In practice, this means schools are now responsible for managing the chaos and harm this law will unleash. Students who are suspected of using the wrong bathroom will be reported, scrutinized, and, inevitably, harassed. What lawmakers fail to graspor perhaps choose to ignoreis that this law places a dangerous tool in the hands of students.In todays world, nearly every student carries a smartphone. Whats to stop a teenager from taking this law into their own hands by recording or photographing someone they suspect is in the wrong bathroom? Under the guise of enforcing this rule, students could use their phones to invade the most private, vulnerable moments of their peerspeering under stalls, capturing explicit images, and claiming it as evidence of a violation. These acts wouldnt just traumatize the victim; they would cross into criminal territory, creating and distributing child pornography.The reality is chilling. This law essentially grants students a license to harass and humiliate each other. It provides cover for the worst kinds of behaviorsurveillance, bullying, and voyeurismall while claiming to protect safety. What safety is there in a school where any student can be subjected to this level of invasion?\\nEven more horrifying, this law doesnt just target transgender students. A cisgender girl with short hair, a boy with softer features, or anyone who doesnt conform to rigid gender stereotypes could be accused of violating the rule. They could face verbal abuse, threats, or even physical evidence-gathering attempts by their peers. This legislation has turned our schools into battlegrounds, where privacy is obliterated, and no one feels safe in spaces meant to protect them.Ohios leaders have opened a Pandoras box of harm. The trauma inflicted on students targeted under this law will be profound and lasting. For those whose privacy is violated, the scars will not heal easily. And for those emboldened to act as enforcersfilming and photographing their peers in private spacesthe legal and moral consequences will be devastating.This law is not about safety. It is about control, fear, and punishment. It doesnt protect studentsit places them in harms way. Lawmakers have made it clear that their priority is ideological posturing, not the well-being of Ohios children. Their negligence will cost students their dignity, their privacy, and, for some, their futures.We must reject this dangerous, hateful legislation and hold accountable those who pushed it through. Ohios students deserve better than to have their humanity debated and their safety sacrificed on the altar of discrimination.","title":"Emboldened by the Election, Ohio GOPers Push Through a Trans Bathroom Ban.

In voting, more polling places, allowing communities to collect ballots and turn them in, and allowing groups to help people register to vote all benefit Democrats and Republicans, but benefit Democrats a bit more. Restrictions have historically been passed in ways that make it harder for political independents and Democratic voters especially Black American voters to vote., Since 2020 voting has become less accessible in 26 states, more accessible in 20, and unchanged in four. 25 out of 26 states were Republican. That was since 2022. More voter restrictions have been passed since then. Republicans drew 191 districts versus 75 by Democrats for this election. My state Governor drew the map himself. Even some Republicans voted against this because it was unconstitutional. People tried taking him to court over this but he has a lot of powerful and rich men backing him. From what I have read Democrats followed the rules for the most part. I definitely don't think the Democrats are the good guys. They are just the less evil guys.

But to answer your question about a good VP, you're damn right I know a good VP.Biden was an excellent VP to Obama.  Early in his administration, Obama met Putin, and he (Obama) was completely outmatched by Putin.  You can say what you want about Putin, but he's not an idiot.  Obama simply didn't know how to handle Putin.  Biden, on the other hand, was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.  Biden was the Cold War warrior and went to Obama and basically told Obama to relax that he would handle the dictator for him.And boy, did he (Biden) do that.Here is a link to a fascinating documentary from Frontline about Putin's relationship with various US presidents.   Obama enters the scene at minute 21 if you want to fast forward.  Or better yet, watch it from the beginning.https://youtu.be/o17DNwmVxx8?si=n7akO0MH61-YpTAeThroughout Obama's presidency, Obama counted on Biden to handle the tough slog in foreign relations and Putin in particular.  Harris would not have even known where to start with Putin.  But yeah, she was great at breaking ties in the Senate. Woof.The one job Biden did give her was to handle the southern border issue.  Secure the damn border.  That was a real job.  Not walking into the Senate in her nice new pantsuit.   And she failed miserably.  I don't even think she visited the site in person to lay eyes on it.

It's a useful tactic because it causes your opponent to stop talking about what they want voters to focus on and start talking about what the word means and how it doesn't fit them.Bernie though was too smart to let that happen to him. When he was asked about being a socialist he would use it as an opening to talk about the issues he wanted to highlight. If fighting for affordable housing is being a socialist then I'm a socialist. Stuff like that. He doesn't let himself get bogged down talking about what the word means but it doesn't fit him any more than fits any other progressive politician in America.

However a human would have to absolutely read over the whole thing to make sure ChatGPT didn't mess things up and that any additions makes actual sense.The big risk i can see here is ChatGPT making random, subtle alterations and omissions. Imagine that ChatGPT was copying an important section and just moved the commas around or reworded things subtly. Or less subtle mistakes by omitting entire lines or clauses.So that's the big risk. While you might pick up where ChatGPT added something new and then check that it makes sense, it would be superhuman to detect every instance where it made a mistake of omission, added or removed commas, or made very subtle wording changes - and on top of that, you'd need to be a constitutional expert to understand what difference it actually makes.","title":"North Carolina Gov.

All of Europe's higher income taxes, bureaucracy, and social safety net make it so that labor is way less competitive there, therefore incomes are lower all else held equal. Look at European unemployment rates over time versus the US and Europe is consistently higher throughout modern history. \\\\The US healthcare system is already more expensive than most other countries, so I don't think that's accurate.not if you factor in the deadweight loss caused by the tax system and how it crowds out consumption in pretty much every other area...of course when something is \\"free\\" the explicit costs are lower, but because of it being free, you have large implicit costs in that taxes are higher, so people are less productive (keep a lower share of their income) as well as getting that for free means you need to produce less income for your own consumption, so again less productivity...basically the idea that \\"somebody\\" else will pay for it, so people end up being less productive/hard working and society as a whole is worse off. \\\\People in Europe work less hours on average than in the US. They already make that tradeoff. Hell I know plenty of people who would make that tradeoff if it was possible in my country. However contracts that aren't 37,5h or 40h a week aren't still that common, though they're slowly becoming more common.and part of that is the taxation system and it has led to far lower incomes and far lower real growth rates in income...the reality is that even in developed West European countries, people are generally far poorer/lower incomes/worse off than in the US. Again, in the US you can absolutely work less if you want to (and some people do), but because you get to retain so much of your income/consume more due to the lower tax structure, there is a far larger incentive to work/be productive, especially at the higher income ranges where in Europe our usually losing 60%+ of your marginal income to taxes...there is a massive deadweight loss effect on economic production at this high of marginal tax rates.","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"No kidding.

If your suggestion safeguards against this, then thats great. If not my suggestion on the taxation of billionaires is as follows:  billionaires by and large dont have billions sitting in their banks.  Obviously some may, and they do likely have considerable liquid cash, but the majority of their net worth is tied to investments and stocks/bonds/etc.  Most billionaires fund their day-to-day and their lavish lifestyles by taking their proof of net worth to the bank and getting massive loans.  They use the loan money to fund their lifestyle, and as income flows in from all their various sources, they pay off the loans.  My suggestion would be for any one time personal loan backed by stock related wealth as collateral, of over 500,000 that isnt being used to buy a primary residence, it triggers a tax event.  And you can also add in, say, any total yearly loan amount over something like 5 million backed by stock related wealth as collateral.  You can institute this without even touching the tax code, you just have to change banking regulations.  Not that it would be exceptionally easy either, but its a way to make billionaires pay their fair share.  They essentially use rented money to fund their lifestyle.  If they want to live like kings, thats fine.  Pay taxes on the rented money, **OR** make them sell off some of their investment related wealth (which currently does trigger a tax event).

Why, exactly, do you think that chain of alliances was made? Why do you think all of Europe militarized leading up to the war. This wasn't some conflict fought for no reason, no conflict is. Its baffling that this narrative is repeated on Reddit so much. I'll try to explain. WW1 is a bit more nuanced than this, just to be clear, but to sum it up... Germany was rapidly rising, both in terms of its industrial capacity and military strength. It was also increasingly ultranationalist, with [open goals to annex parts of Eastern Europe and install puppet states throughout Europe.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F9qi2ijvtqax81.png) It *wanted to upset the balance of power* and become the dominant european continental force. In that sense, those alliances were made largely with two ideas in mind. You're either trying to stop Germany from dominating Europe, or you wanted to side with Germany, believing them to be the future of Europe. So yes, Germany was bad. Their goals were quite similar to WW2, in that they believed themselves to be the dominant, destined rulers of Europe. They were arguably the only real nation with actual imperialistic goals in WW1. The allies goal was... to stop Germany.A lot of people point to the fact that the Kaiser tried to stop the war in 1914. This is a bit misleading. He was not extremely jingoistic, but his generals and chancellor and general leadership all were. There was also the belief that 1914 was 'too early' and that Germany still needed more years to build up their military force before going to war. Germany also desperetly did not want to be the country to start the war, they wanted the allies to declare war first.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"Math is hard for people who dont like losing.","title":"So...

In essence, he was the opposite to the growing conservative extremism. Dont get me wrong. Im still a Democrat and will continue to vote Democrat, but it is tough living in the Deep South where conservatism is becoming more extreme.  Especially when it affects my job as a teacher. I think there was an analogy earlier about fighting a wildfire with a garden hose. Its just not going not work. We tried to ease into our more liberal agendas or appeal to moderates in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 elections. It failed in two elections and the 2020 election was barely won by the Democrats. Maybe Im still hurting from the election, but I truly believe the only path forward is to fight fire with fire. The only way to defeat extremism on the right is through extremism on the left. The Democrats know people are suffering. They know what types of legislation are popular in these circles. They know what platforms to campaign on. But, especially in this election, they chose to ignore our pleas and even blame us for the loss. They took the gamble on moderates and Haley supporters.

Trump got demolished by Biden in 2020 and people try to act like it was no big deal.  He lost by 7 million votes with a 306 to 232 and a 4.5% less electorate share.  I remember when Obama demolished McCain, people claimed the Republican party was dead and it resurrected itself.  Mark my words...in 2028, after Trump destroys the economy and international relations, the country will swing back left.  Again, a 1.5% higher vote share and 150,000 extra votes across the swing states is not a blowout.  A 3% or higher win, I would consider a blowout.With that said, Kamala was a poor choice due to the economy.  Anyone directly connected to the Biden administration would have lost.  They should have chose Andy Bashear.  Personally, I think any moderate Dem with a decent approval rating would have destroyed Trump (Roy Cooper, Bashear, maybe even Tim Waltz).

An excerpt:But at the outset of the campaign  during and immediately after the Democratic National Convention (DNC)  Harris appeared to be heading in the right direction. Progressive Democrats were pushing Harris to emphasize a bold economic vision, and as the campaign began to take shape, Harris chose her [issues](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/27/politics/economy-harris-trump-proposals-taxes/index.html): cracking down on price gouging, an expanded child tax credit, and subsidies for homebuyers and small business owners. In August, Harris even [hinted at](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/08/26/how-kamala-harriss-support-for-price-controls-could-impact-inflation/) support for price controls, a wealth tax, and higher taxes on corporations and capital gains. In these early weeks, Harris was able to give something to everyone, without committing herself to concrete policies.But after the initial euphoria surrounding the DNC had faded by mid-September, the national Democratic Party took a back seat to the group of advisors who had gathered around Harriss campaign. The looming fear of a second Trump presidency prompted party members to get in line and focus on their roles as surrogates and in get-out-the-vote efforts  keeping any criticisms of the campaign to themselves and giving Harriss team more freedom to act independently. According to reports from the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/us/politics/harris-inner-circle-advisers.html)?and [*Sludge*](https://readsludge.com/2024/11/18/the-corporate-consultants-behind-harris-for-president/), this team was built around a core group of former Uber executives and corporate PR managers.Typical left-wing economic agenda items like living wage, affordable housing, paid family leave, or union jobs dropped out of Harriss vocabulary in the weeks after Labor Day. Tracking the use of more neutral terms relating to the economy  like wages, jobs, and workers  we see a trend line that slopes upward into early September before declining over the following weeks. By October, Harris was spending less of her time campaigning with Shawn Fain and Bernie Sanders than she was with Republican Liz Cheney and billionaire Mark Cuban, unlikely candidates to push any kind of progressive economic message, let alone a populist one. Cuban was gleeful enough [to declare](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/business/harris-economic-plan-wall-street.html) that the progressive principles . . . of the Democratic Party . . . are gone. Its Kamala Harriss party now.This pivot wasnt merely rhetorical: donors, consultants, and business-connected campaign staff pushed Harris to [clarify](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/business/harris-economic-plan-wall-street.html) or de-emphasize previous statements indicating support for a slate of popular policies on price controls; capital gains, corporate, and wealth taxes; and a host of other issues. Harriss vague suggestions that she would engage in price controls to bring down inflation were watered down into a policy that already exists in most states that prevents businesses from profiteering on natural disasters. Her gestures toward taxing the wealthy became a capital gains tax proposal of 28 percent, far lower than the Biden administrations proposed 40 percent; and she never took a position on Bidens proposal to tax unrealized capital gains. And as time went on, the candidate spoke less and less frequently about her watered-down price-gouging proposal or her commitment to taxing the rich.These are accompanied by graphs, with the sources for those graphs' data included elsewhere in the article. \\"Nuh uh\\" is not an argument, and denying reality is just gonna make the Dems lose again next time.","title":"Analysis: Kamala Harris Turned Away From Economic Populism"},{"text":"Because that wouldn't make Fouci and the pharmaceutical companies that have him in their pockets money like the vaccines will.","title":"Why did the FDA try to block the study and use of Ivermectin for Covid?"},{"text":"The problem is that they don't respect or recognize our rights, and nobody seems to want to bother to hold them accountable when they commit crimes.","title":"Letter: Civility gets us nowhere.

Of course,  Marxists and liberals don't agree because of the history of both in aligning for interests. For Marxists,  they can bring people of various movements together such as Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party aligning people on class lines over racial divisions given by imperialists. Doesn't mean you don't try to work with conservatives or libertarians if you can find common ground such as being anti-war.[One of the big reasons I can recommend Rainier Shea is that he puts this dichotomy into perspective] (https://newswiththeory.com/communists-can-overcome-the-states-attacks-by-allying-with-illiberal-military-elements-preparing-to-defend-from-the-counter-gangs/) in his writing: The organized lefts investment in liberal identity politics has long kept what we call Marxism in America isolated, and separated from the class struggle. But the communists who refuse to embrace this dead-end mode of practice now have the momentum required for rebuilding what the USAs workers struggle has lost. If things keep going as they are now, were going to have a comparable amount of numbers and institutional power to that of communists in places like Russia. As Christopher Helali said amid his participation in ACPs [American Communist Party] launch: We have lots of work, but its okay. Work is good, struggle is good. Some of us will last long in the struggle, and some of us will not. Some of us will be persecuted, others might not. Whatever happens, united forwards, backwards never.And yes,  I've been heavily pushing for class struggle but would say there's so much propaganda about leaders of socialism that you have to relearn without the propaganda influencing you. People lied about [Gaddafi by calling him a dictator] (https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/14ywkv0/gaddafi_turned_libya_from_the_poorest_country_in/) so how can you know that what's said about [Stalin, ](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/1fjhyz8/stalin_starved_his_population/) [Castro] (https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/11df4pk/anticastro_propaganda_in_usa/), [Kim Jong Un](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/ev27p8/north_korea_kim_jonguns_aunt_appears_alive_after/), and many others.

I could be wrong, but my sense is that when these states aren't faced with what they see as an outside enemy imposing it's morality on them, they will moderate internally. I think abortion access, even if it's not all the way to viability or natural birth, is going to be a big concern in state level elections and I think being too immoderate will hurt Republican candidates over the medium term. Arizona for example which is quite a conservative state just made it a ballot issue to expand elective abortion from 15-24 weeks and enshrine it into the state's constitution. The ballot measure was successful. Colorado, Montana, Maryland and Nevada also passed ballot measure expanding abortion access. I think this trend will continue and probably end up with nearly all states allowing elective abortion up to 15-24 weeks and then medically necessary abortions beyond that timeframe.?","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"That is definitely not true lmao.

I've talked to public journalists about this, I've seen the markets, the polls, this was shocking to each and everyone. The Telegram coordinated attacks, and the way they had the method to abuse the TikTok algorithm were fraudulent. No other candidate was forcefully pushed in this way.

Getting back to Georgescu, I don't understand why we should be so lenient to someone who took a shot at our democracy. He is a Russian asset and self-proclaimed supporter of Vladimir Putin, and then he was backed by an army of TikTok bots, he organized a fraudulent Telegram attack through his own groups and, as said before, had *someone's* support and use of unethical tactics to get elected.

This parallels investigative reporting, which finds that the last weeks of the campaign were increasingly directed by the very same corporate interests that she abstained from criticizing. Over the course of the whole campaign, Harris spoke less about economic issues and progressive economic policy priorities than Joe Biden had in 2020, and far less than Sanders had in the Democratic primaries that year. In this cycle, Trump addressed perhaps the most important issue for voters  prices and the cost of living  more than twice as often as Harris.This feels so basic. Voters concerned about the economy?

The half of Modesto in 13 is the more working-class, Latino half. All of Ceres, half of Turlock and all of Merced are also in the district. These are all very working-class, Latino areas which helps to lean the votes more in the Democrats' favor. However, there are still large swaths of rural areas in the district and these cities aren't Democrat strongholds. It's a very 50/50 area. This is something you'll see a lot throughout the Central Valley districts where the population is more spread out unlike SoCal and the Bay Area. The Republican strongholds will be anywhere in the regions north of Sacramento where practically no one lives.","title":"Democrat Derek Tran now 581 votes ahead of California GOP Rep.

Trump has a cult of personality appeal that isn't easily transferred to other Republicans. Even ones who try to imitate him and bang the MAGA drum. MAGA isn't an ideology or a movement.

It takes a more politically engaged than average person to vote in midterms or special elections and we've known that since forever. And that midterm electorate tilts more dem. Basically your average high school grad worker probably won't bother to show up in a midterm but college yuppies will. Yes there are lots of highly politically engaged people who scroll right wing tik tok and flood Facebook but they're not really that big of the electorate compared to the normies.

If you are wondering, it is one of those partisan Democratic think tanks.If you don't believe, even many Western sources are forced to admit this.

Ukraine lacked the resources to maintain the nearly 1,700 Soviet nuclear weapons on its soil, many of them on intercontinental ballistic missiles that were nearing the end of their service lives. (My own reporting from several years ago, not reflected in these documents, indicates that Moscow retained command and control over the ICBMs, though Ukrainian officers could have fired the shorter-range nuclear missiles on their soil.)\\n \\n ? Kravchuk and almost all Ukrainian politicians were eager to dispose of the weapons, fearing that their nuclear cores might melt down in a manner reminiscent of the Chernobyl power-plant disaster, which had occurred in Ukraine just eight years earlier. \\n Now that being said, I disagree with this passage and this is where you can see the clear Western bias.Putin clearly violated this pledge when he annexed Crimea 20 years later, in 2014, and then invaded all of Ukraine eight years hence. Russian was trying to negotiate a deal to keep Ukraine neutral and the ethnic Russian speakers in Ukraine safe.The Ukrainians were rearing to attack the ethnic Russians after the Western backed Maidan Coup, which means the Ukrainians themselves had already violated the Minsk agreement. Ultimately, the issue is the West is the clear bad guy and the Liberals desperately want to lie their way out of this.The bottom line is, Ukraine never had the ability to maintain a nuclear arsenal nor the ability to launch USSR nuclear weapons. Ukraine was giving up something it never had the ability to use that was stored on its soil.","title":"Medvedev: American politicians and journalists are seriously discussing the implications of transferring nuclear weapons to Kiev.
