In practice the opposite happens b/c freight rail trains are often to big to use the siding (theres no law mandating trains be able to fit in the sidings) so Amtrak, being many multiples smaller uses it by necessity. Theres little enforcement of any theoretical fines for such behavior. The surface transportation board was only giving the power to investigate freight delaying Amtrak in 2021. Amtrak also cant cut routes for the same reason congress refuses to cut defense spending. B/c the service runs thru their district so it would look bad if the service/revenue stopped rolling in on their watch. Regulate freight rail sizes. Or mandate that sidings be enlarged to fit current industry average train sizes. Then Amtrak will do better and its trains wont be delayed all the time.

However, from personal experience with chemical manufacturers/biopharmaceutical suppliers, there's a gray area when it comes to proprietary knowledge or trade secrets. This is often used to justify the patent exclusivity farming that pharmaceutical conglomerates do, as it entails small shifts in the formulation of things like vaccines so that the companies maintain business. The polio vaccine is step one-something that has been around for decades and is regarded as generally benign. On top of the mountain are the more recent vaccines that make use of untested mechanisms, such as the covid vaccines using mRNA delivery, which falls under the definition of gene therapy. There was a case where one of the manufacturers was petitioning to have the safety data sealed for something like 75 years in order to maintain non-liability, or something like that. And on the other hand, the American Heart Association published a study showing that the mRNA fragments from the vaccine lingered in the body for far longer than those of a natural covid infection. This resulted in more widespread cell infection, especially in cardiac cells, and presented as myocarditis in otherwise healthy individuals who would have recovered from covid normally.","title":"Trump's 'Climate Threats' Have Demoralized the Eco-Scam Crowd (for Good Reason!) ??"},{"text":"Not really.

They don't require you to close to arm's reach with a potentially physically superior attacker (necessary for disabled persons, elderly, smaller stature, or women).

If the assailant is within that distance, it makes little difference to your mortality whether you're armed with a gun or a knife.Firearms are WAY more effective at self-defense than knives...Blade injuries are also seldom instantly incapacitating...Which reinforces my point that guns are a greater public safety hazard than alternative defense weapons.

A knife requires you to be within arm's reach of an attackerThe left's issue with guns, which I am in agreement with, has more to do with public safety and their higher potential for collateral damage. At the end of the day, \\"knives\\" were only an example. Pretty much *any* weapon would be better than guns from a public safety standpoint.Your training comparison also misses the mark. Those gun safety rules are basic common sense that can be learned in a 30-minute video.\\"Easily learned\\" =/= \\"common sense.\\" Common sense refers to things that you should be able to figure out from basic logic and survival instincts. For example, it's common sense not to touch a sharp edge, because your survival instincts should tell you that sharp things hurt. It's *not* common sense to avoid pointing your gun at the sky, or to turn the safety on when you're not using it, or to keep it clean, etc. etc., because nothing about those things are obvious to someone who knows little about guns and could not be deduced from basic logic or survival instincts.The \\"well regulated\\" part historically meant \\"in good working order,\\" not government regulation.I know, I said as much. \\"Well regulated\\" historically referred to training and military exercises.This suggests you're approaching it backwards - looking for ways to restrict rights rather than protecting them. The 2A exists precisely because self-defense is a fundamental human right that shouldn't be subject to government permission.I addressed that already. I agree that self-defense is a fundamental human right. I disagree that self-defense *with firearms* is a fundamental human right. The right to self-defense does not automatically extend to possible tools for that endeavor.Look at crime stats in places with strict gun control like Chicago, DC, or California. Their gun laws haven't made anyone safer.Because guns are still available illegally, yes. These stats also can't prove that arming the \\"good guys\\" in Chicago, DC, or LA would lower the crime stats. For all we know, that might just make things worse.Meanwhile, constitutional carry states generally have lower violent crime rates. More guns in law-abiding hands = less crime.As the old saying goes: \\"There are lies, damn lies, and [statistics](https://www.thetrace.org/2024/08/permitless-concealed-carry-gun-super-bowl/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20studies%2C%20which,rates%2010%20years%20after%20adoption).\\"Your \\"Wild West\\" example actually proves my point.

But this assumes equal footing of the assailant and defendant. What if a 65 260lb man punches a 52 100lb woman? Is she really only allowed to punch back? I just want to point out that punching a person can be considered lethal force. Fights are not like the movies where people can get hit and get right back up. There is a concept called 'beaten to death' after all.A person punched and knocked to the ground (likely) with the attacker continuing to attack is likely a lethal threat and could justify the use of lethal force.Self defense is about stopping the attack, not 'proportional response'. If a person punches you and stops, you cannot hit them back. Also, the force used to stop the attack must be reasonable, but that is not the same as 'proportional'. The standard for lethal force is credible fear of your life or serious bodily harm.

By this logic the government could become authoritarian, fascist, a dictatorship, or any of the above and severely limit our ability to overthrow them.

If a authoritarian government wanted to make a full scale revolution against them nearly impossible without removing the 2A they could just make it so you could only own tiny 22 caliber weapons with limited magazine sizes and fire rate. Its essentially taking away the right we have without actually removing the 2A.

To paraphrase: If you get slapped, you can slap back but can't punch back. If you get punched, you can punch back but can't stab backThis is categorically false. The laws of self defense dictate that you can't use deadly force unless you fear for your own life, but there is no requirement of proportional force for that to be true. A 5'2\\" 110lb woman has every right to shoot  dead a 6'3\\" 240lb man who keeps punching her in the face. She doesn't have to wait for him to pull a weapon to do so. The law will be on her side.Secondly, your claim that in the wild West days shootouts were common is also not true. Gunfights like the OK Corall arent just famous because they're sensational, they're famous because they were rare. Gun violence was more common outside of established settlements for all the same reasons they're common today: people break into someones home to take their stuff or harm the occupants, and get ventilated for their efforts.The whole point of guns is that they're *incredibly* easy to use. You need a whole lot less training to effectively use a firearm than  pretty much any other weapon type, and your personal fitness doesn't really factor into your ability to shoot effectively (note I said *effectively*, not *well*). Military firearms training lasts about A week or two for basic rank-and-file, while specialists get maybe an extra 2-4 weeks of firearms training based on their designation. Police receive even less training, averaging anywhere between a few days to a week before they're considered \\"qualified\\". If you go to the range for a grand total of 8 hours every month, and a refresher safety course every 6 months, you're getting more weapons training than military and law enforcement do in the same 12 month period.The 2nd amendment does need an amendment, but to clean up the existing language, not to add new requirements. Every single barrier we place in front of public firearms access is another way by which those of limited economic means can be prevented from invoking their constitutional rights making them more vulnerable to corrupt and predatory actors. Unless you're advocating for taxpayer funded training classes freely available to the public, We should not want to live in a world where your capacity to defend yourself is based on your ability to afford a seat in a class.","title":"CMV: The Second Amendment needs an amendment."},{"text":"Under US law everyone in the world has the right to come to the United States and request asylum if they think they meet the requirements.

They don't require you to close to arm's reach with a potentially physically superior attacker (necessary for disabled persons, elderly, smaller stature, or women). Even a height difference of 3 inches and a weight difference of 20 lbs can be a massive advantage without extensive martial arts training.Blade injuries are also seldom instantly incapacitating, as those vulnerable areas need training and practice to reliably hit. It takes FAR less training to effectively use a gun in defensive situations than a blade. The gun's penetration can simply damage organs or cause severe bleeding regardless of physical strength. I'll have maybe one fatal stabbing a year that ends at the scene, versus many with guns. The incapacitation disparity is simply that high.A gun is also much more reliable against multiple assailants.

A knife requires you to be within arm's reach of an attacker - that's extremely dangerous, especially for women, elderly, or disabled people facing stronger attackers. A gun is the only true equalizer.Your training comparison also misses the mark. Those gun safety rules are basic common sense that can be learned in a 30-minute video. The hard part of knife defense is actually being skilled enough to use it effectively without getting killed. Most knife \\"self-defense\\" ends with both people getting seriously cut.The \\"well regulated\\" part historically meant \\"in good working order,\\" not government regulation. The whole point was to prevent government from disarming citizens. The Founders had just fought a revolution against tyranny - they wouldn't immediately give the new government power to disarm people.The only reason I don't currently support gun control legislation is because the Constitution forbids itThis suggests you're approaching it backwards - looking for ways to restrict rights rather than protecting them. The 2A exists precisely because self-defense is a fundamental human right that shouldn't be subject to government permission.Look at crime stats in places with strict gun control like Chicago, DC, or California. Their gun laws haven't made anyone safer. Meanwhile, constitutional carry states generally have lower violent crime rates. More guns in law-abiding hands = less crime. Your \\"Wild West\\" example actually proves my point. Those shootouts were rare and mostly happened in places where carrying guns was banned.

So lets go through an example then where trump survives a bloody civil war with a whole bunch of powers that includes the above mentioned loss of habeus corpus and loss of first amendment rights. Add in whatever other powers you think would fit for flavor.At the end of the conflict there are going to be a few different factions that trump is going to need on his side to stay in power. (Im going to assume that there are an equal number of ideological/loyal zealots on both sides who cancel each other out).1. Congress\\n2. Military\\n3. Wealthy elites\\n4. Expat wealthy elites who want to return to the US after escapingIm not going to include the people in this but we'll see shortly that that doesnt matter. Each faction wants for a stable society for their own reasons (congress doesnt want to spend money or have their rule challenged, the military doesnt want to die, and the wealthy want to be rich in safety and not have to hire big private militias to stay safe).If trump has not given up power by the time the next election rolls around he is going to have all three of those factions want a return to the way things were. These are all college educated individuals, many of whom have experience working in government and know how things work in politics much better than you or I.Right now they have all of that (maybe not the military but those cases are the exception, not the rule). So they want a return to this lifestyle and America as it is right now. Congress wants power and the Trump having whatever emergency powers he was given is a threat to that. So it would not be a serious stretch of the imagination that they would immediately revoke his emergency powers as soon as possible. The Military has just gone through hell and they dont want to fight again. So they are going to go with the flow and support whoever promises peace. If Trump is openly defying congress to retain power then he will be against the military. He could destroy all legitimacy and promise the military untold power, but they can see what he is doing right now and can figure out that the only path to peace is either total capitulation and the establishment of a trump monarchy or a return to congressional rule and taking away trumps power. In a trump monarchy how long do you think they will survive? The generals and admirals have seen dictatorships come to power. They know that the literal first thing that a dictator has to do is a purge of any non loyalist. A few of these generals and admirals and white house staff have already written scathing books about him. They are the first on the chopping block and so they are going to fight back because they will be literally fighting for their lives.For the wealthy elites they, again, want peace to be able to be rich. They can do that in a world where trump is president but this is literally changing the system to benefit him. What benefits will they gain by having a trump presidency. They are already rich. Maybe a modern day class of nobility? but they already have their Fiefdoms within their companies and now they will have to buy private militias and can no longer rely on anonymity to protect them from the average American. Maybe their wealth destroyed or inaccessible? At that point they arent the wealthy elites anymore.","title":"CMV: The most effective way to install Trump as a dictator is to revolt against the rich."},{"text":"About what?

Many families also rely on hunting to feed their families or to make a living. One quote Ive heard to argue against anti 2A arguments was from a Chinese immigrant who escaped China. She said Can you guarantee that the government will NEVER become corrupt or authoritarian or anything along those lines obviously the answer is no. The people who support the 2A but with intense and strict regulation are forgetting the true purpose of the amendment. Its not the governments place to hamper our ability to fight back if the population deems it necessary. Another issue is people who want a ban on assault weapons. The problem with this is that its not a real classification but a buzz word to scare ignorant people. An AR-15 is not used by the military and is no more dangerous than many hunting rifles that look less scary. Im fairly certain that the reason the AR-15 is such a popular choice among mass shooters is because the media says theyre more dangerous. Making them an attractive choice for a crazy and ignorant would he mass shooter. Simply put, its not the governments place to decide how its population can overthrow it.

Sure, life is hard when youre young. Newsflash: its hard for everyone. Youre broke, inexperienced, and trying to figure out if ramen three nights a week is technically a balanced diet. Thats the deal. Its called being 22. You dont have money, a great job, or a clue, but what you do have is the resilience to learn and grow. Or at least you should.Now, lets add some context. Young men today are missing the social glue that held prior generations together. Bonds built on hanging out in person, working on real-life skills, and navigating life with a crew. Instead, theyre glued to screensplaying games, binge-watching YouTube podcasts, and listening to Tate lecture them on \\"hustling\\" while looking like they just pulled a gaming all-nighter. Ironically, this isolation is the real source of their strugglenot some societal conspiracy to keep them down.And lets talk about relationships. Women arent lining up for the guy who parrots Andrew Tates \\"alpha\\" lines while living on Mountain Dew and Hot Pockets. Why? Because confidence isnt about being loud; its about having something real to offer. You cant fast-track maturity, and you sure as hell cant buy it with a 10-step guide to \\"dominating your lane.\\"So, what do young men need? Not more pep talks from pseudo-mentors who keep them stuck in their heads. They need to step out into the world. Build real relationships. Screw up a few times. Learn that confidence doesnt come from podcastsit comes from showing up, working hard, and making peace with the fact that life is unfair and youre not special. Thats not oppression; thats growth.Its like Bill Burr says: Nobody cares about your dream. Work hard and be grateful anyones even listening. Drop the victim narrative, log off, and start living your life. Youll be amazed how much better it gets when you stop blaming the world and just show up.","title":"Why Do Young Men Worship Trump?"},{"text":"Theyre getting off easy.

Jean Carroll.According to settlement documents made public Saturday, ABC will also post a note on its website expressing regret over the claim in a March 10 segment on Stephanopoulos This Week program and pay $1 million in legal fees to Trumps lawyer.In a statement, ABC News said: We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing.Trump sued Stephanopoulos and ABC for defamation days after the anchor claimed during an interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., that Trump had been found liable for rape, which misstated the verdicts in Carrolls two lawsuits against him.Last year, Trump was found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll and was ordered to pay her $5 million. In January, he was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million. Trump is appealing both verdicts.Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.The judge in both cases, Lewis Kaplan, has said that the jurys conclusion was that Carroll had failed to prove that Trump raped her within the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.Kaplan noted that the definition of rape was far narrower than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll failed to prove that Mr. Trump raped her as many people commonly understand the word rape.

People need to consider the reward of revolution to be great enough that it outweighs the risk. Additionally, dictatorships arise when fewer keys of power are required.   \\n  \\nIn the US for example, our economy is based on value added services which makes having only a few keys as a dictator nigh impossible. For an example of what Im talking about consider a metal bar that comes into a factory and is then turned into a table. That factory added value to that metal bar by using their expertise and machinery to shape it. In a revolution that factory will be under attack and at best will not produce during the civil war but can be restarted later. In a broader context, the majority of the GDP comes from people applying their expertise whether that is in education, engineering, manufacturing, or as investors of capital into those products and ideas. In this context a person can be viewed as a factory. Killing a person can be considered akin to destroying a factory. It will take a long time to replace and rebuild those \\"factories\\". Not to mention the cost of rebuilding.Now, how does this contribute to the discussion. Think about the classic example of the french revolution. The french peasants were literally unable to afford the basic necessities like food. The dichotomy of rich vs poor, and nobility vs peasants was not the problem. The problem was that the risk of failure was very low and with the centralization of power the rewards were very high. If they won they could direct france towards a better future (even a bloody one in the short term). If they failed then nothing was really going to change.Likewise, lets consider the communist regime of stalin. People were incredibly miserable, in some cases as miserable as with the french, but the risks were much higher with the secret police and frequent purges. People also had a memory of what it was like under the Tsars and the russian civil war. They also had bread lines yes, but they had bread. If they had revolted they would have lost everything. And what would they have gotten in return? They would have lost their safety and security under the red army, they would have lost their bread, and they probably would have lost their lives as well. Simple violence against a wealthy elite will not invoke a revolution. People need to feel like the alternative is worse. So, lets say that a band of rebels break out in the US and try to overthrow Trump and sieze the wealth of these individuals. What incentive do I have to join them? Even providing aid Im risking my life. Better healthcare? Through my emplyer I pay $50 a month for health insurance. Without my employer that would be $150 a month. Would you risk your life and the lives of everyone around you for $150? Going back to trump. Lets say, horror against horrors, that the US does descend into a bloody and violent revolution that is brutally put down. What keys to power does trump have control over? Even if he's hailed as imperator after defeating the rebel scum he's still presiding over a bombed out country. The infrastructure is gone. The wealthy have fled out of fear for their safety taking as much money as possible with them. Sure I could live in an NYC penthouse (if any are still standing) but now there is less food, medicine, and we are living under martial law. What keys to power will remain afterwards? He will be incredibly weak and he will lack the support of troops who will remember the better times when there was a peaceful transition of power between two political groups.","title":"CMV: The most effective way to install Trump as a dictator is to revolt against the rich."},{"text":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/george-stephanopoulos-abc-apologize-trump-forced-pay-15-million-settle-defamation-suitHa!","title":"Trump ordered to sit for deposition next week in his defamation case against ABC News"},{"text":"Trump is an adjudicated rapisthttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll_v._Donald_J._TrumpIn July 2023, Judge Kaplan said that the jury had found that Trump had raped Carroll according to the common definition of the word which did not require the alleged penile penetration.In August 2023, Kaplan dismissed a countersuit and wrote that Carroll's accusation of \\"rape\\" is \\"substantially true\\".\\"There was no libel or slander","title":"ABC agrees to give $15 million to Donald Trump's presidential library to settle defamation lawsuit"},{"text":"So my concern about the fact that Trump was friends with Diddy, Epstein and Maxwell is TDS?

Perhaps people are most eager to take a stand, BECAUSE the opposition have consolidated power.  Clearly, not taking action hasn't generated the intended results.  The Trump Administration appears to be the wealthiest administration in history (~400B in net worth between the people involved) so many people likely feel their efforts to effect change have been fruitless.  Thus, a new strategy is needed.  \\n2. If you are trying to overhaul the system and the public is rising up, you don't really care about who is in power.  Afterall, if someone in power cracks down, it will likely lead to a wider response.  All previous overhauls of society have initially been met with repression of a smaller movement before that crackdown spawned a much larger response (Russian revolution, French revolution, American revolution).  \\n3. Before the French revolution, the people didn't have freedom, they had a monarchy.  After the French revolution, the people lived under Napoleon, HOWEVER, they had a stronger constitution and a lot more liberal rights.  Napoleon legitimately expanded the rights of the people and was beloved in France for that during his time.

But in our system the President of the United States can only really effect a lot of change when their party has massive majorities in the House and Senate, when the Supreme Court is mostly made up of justices aligning with the President's views, when the Governors and State legislatures are mostly their party, etc. The moment even one of those things is not true, it makes it that much harder for transformative change to happen.

Authoritarians dont sit around waiting for convenient excuses to consolidate power. They simply create them. If Trump wanted to declare emergency powers or crack down on dissent, he wouldnt need a class revolt as a justification. History proves this. Hitler didnt wait for opposition to hand him a perfect crisis. He manufactured his own with the Reichstag fire. Trump has already shown a willingness to claim fraud, incite fear and hatred, and manipulate public perception. If he wanted to justify a power grab, hed find a way, whether people are revolting or not.The idea that holding off resistance will somehow stop authoritarianism is dangerously naive. Every day that opposition hesitates is another day for power to be consolidated. Authoritarianism thrives not because resistance rises up but because too many people sit back, rationalizing why \\"now isnt the time.\\" That kind of passivity hands them the game.Trumps whole schtick is pretending to be a populist while championing policies that benefit the ultra-wealthy. A movement challenging wealth inequality disrupts his base and shows his hypocrisy. Waiting for inequality to deepen only makes future uprisings more difficult.The biggest flaw in your argument is thinking that doing nothing is safer than acting now. Its not. Authoritarianism grows from inaction, not resistance. Every time an authoritarian leader gets away with a power grab because no one fights back, it sets the stage for the next one. I mean just look at how we got here. Even imperfect resistance forces them to justify their actions and keeps the public engaged. Sitting back and waiting just normalizes the behavior we should be fighting against. Each new insane thing that happens is more insane than the last. But it's become our new normal. The best time to start was years ago. The second best time is today.Simply put, Trump doesnt need a revolt to consolidate power, but hell sure as hell use your hesitation to do it anyway.","title":"CMV: The most effective way to install Trump as a dictator is to revolt against the rich."},{"text":"They'll all comply in advance, it's a non-issue.","title":"Trump wants his daughter-in-law in the Senate.

Read the book *The Hamilton Scheme* about Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton was smart, and had a very good grasp of economics before it was an actual science. He had a vision, like many of the Revolutionary War actors, of a country encompassing the 13 colonies and the interior, with a strong central government. But he was also son-in-law of oneof a group of very rich merchants, and aspired to be one of them. As a major player in the new American government, he saw the flaws of the original Articles of Confederation. The main one was they had no taxing powers and were dependednt on the states for any revenue. Everyone was broke after the revolution, so the states rarely gave anything. A strong government needed its own revenue. OTOH, his mentors the rich merchants or Boston, NYC and Philly, had bought up - for pennies on the dollar -  all the IOU's that the revolutionary army and government had handed out to pay soldiers, pay for supplies, atc.  He finagled congress into adopting the new constitution which among other things, gave the federal government authority to tax, then maneuvered congress to ensure all those IOU's were paid in full, with interest.  His opponents were the landed gentry of the South, like Washington and Jefferson, farmers who were less interested in trade and prefferred not to have the imports they needed taxed on arrival in the USA. Finally, he maneuvered the Whiskey Tax, which essentially set the cost of running a still so high that only full-time large distillers could make a profit. The small-time distillers who made whiskey because it was more lucrative than hauling their grain to market - were squeezed out in favour of his big business friends.

Trump is going to have the resources of the entire government to bankrupt these folks.Trump's fascism is a bit different from Mussolini's or Hitler's in that he's going to use financial violence, not physical violence.  He knows none of his targets will go to jail, but that's not his goal. He wins if their careers are ruined and they are denied a proper retirement.  So, by accepting a pardon, these folks avoid the legal fees and get to retire in comfort.  That's a plus.On the negative side, when someone accepts a pardon they essentially admit guilt.  Unlike Hunter, none of the folks Trump wants to go after have done anything wrong.  It would be far better to put the burden on Trump.  What laws does he think they have broken?  What evidence does he have that they broke these laws?In 4 years, I would like a nation that sees Trump as the one at fault.

He started the civil war in Syria by funding questionable groups, many of which were known terrorists.

Overall a classic neo-liberal war mongering similar to Clinton.\\nIn his books, and his actions, he paints his Republican colleagues as the only thing holding him back from accomplishing change. In reality, he was just interested in solidifying a good legacy and Republicans made for a great excuse for him not to followup on his promises and act in the way he protested himself to be. There was a good chunk of time where Obama had the house AND the Senate.\\nRepublicans also don't really control his executive powers which include dictating how the dept of Treasury handles the bailout and what how the US spends it's time money and resources intervening in wars we have no business being a part of.?\\nOverall, he promised change but offered more of the same, making him a huge disappointment.

I'm all for looking into it, but I'm not sure it's caused by vaccines, and I REALLY don't want to believe that it is. I have 3 children, and 2 are autistic. One is high functioning, and she's a beautifully talented artist at age 13, and one is low functioning, non verbal, and will never be able to live on his own. To think that the vaccines could have done that to him makes me feel sick, like it could have been prevented. His autism is severe and has been devastating to our family. He's only 10 and I had to resort to medical marijuana for him, as it was the only thing to curb and eventually stop his self harming. He had previously spent a week in the psych ward at 9 years old (last Christmas) due to repeatedly punching himself in the head and later I took him to have an MRI.. nothing abnormal showed up thank goodness, but he was BADLY bruised all over his forehead and temples during this self harming period that lasted under a year and I had him wearing a soft helmet because he would NOT stop and lessening the impact/damage was all I could do. Medical marijuana was a BLESSING during this time. I'm just saying all of this to reiterate, I would be devastated to find out that this could have been prevented. That being said, my youngest child is not autistic and has a different father than my other two, so my belief is that it is more likely something genetic that they are just born with. All of my kids have had the basic childhood vaccines. No flu shots, no covid shots, no hpv shots etc. If there were proof the vaccines caused it, well I would have to accept it, but I think the difference between now and the past is that autism awareness and acceptance wasn't really much of a thing back then. I think my son would have been labeled differently in the past. Doesn't mean autism was non existent, just means they didn't call it that. That was a wordy comment, but I like to share my son's story. A lot of people see autism as quirky, maybe kind of socially awkward, but can make a person brilliant (ie my daughter and her wonderful artistic skills, who would be considered to have Asperger's) A lot of people don't realize what severe autism looks like. It's meltdowns, eloping, no danger awareness, self harming.

Amazon pays USPS to handle deliveries for them.Amazon still doesn't do (and probably wouldn't want to do) customer shipping of arbitrary items.

You don't see any of this as a problem, because you're a left-leaning person.So maybe you need to get out of your right-wing bubble, and see what the Democratic party is actually about? They didn't lose because of  social issues -- the culture war is fodder to excite the base of voters that Trump already has, and Democrats never will. Rather, Democrats lost because of inflation, and because they still resemble the establishment of the last 40 years, whereas Trump has remade the GOP, not to necessarily something better, but at least something *different.* A slightly larger share of voters favored the chaos agent, because the government as they see it has not done anything good for them anyway, so they may as well shake things up. This also means millions of voters stayed home, because they didn't think their vote would change anything anyway. Both factors are far more crucial for the Democrats' loss than any social issue. In exit polling, the only social issue that actually mobilized any voters was abortion/women's right to bodily autonomy, and even then, it fell in rank behind the economy.","title":"I'm Anthony Fisher, senior editor at MSNBC Digital.

It is, just as likely, that there are ways to make rural delivery cost effective to private companies, but companies do not have an incentive to figure it out because they have always had USPS to fall back on a subsidized service. I personally don't believe any company wouldn't jump into an open market, at least to try. Would costs rise? Sure, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

However they are more sympathetic to more recent leadership that ushered in free markets and modernization.

She was in total disbelief, and could not believe her government could have precipitated such an act of violence against the people.

A true conservative believes that some people at the bottom are fundamentally flawed and need to be cared for. Its a parental responsibility belief. This is  different than what Reagan Republicans believe and completely opposite the to Trump and the MAGAs. They are definitely right wing but more in a 1930s fascist mode aligning the disenfranchised have-nots with the wealthy corporations. Study Hugo Boss, Volkswagen and even IBM in Europe if you want to get a clearer view of how that works.This is why it is concerning as to how young people are drifting towards Trump.

Twelve of the guns were purchased personally by Union commanders and used in the trenches during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia (June 1864April 1865). Eight other Gatling guns were fitted on gunboats. The gun was not accepted by the American Army until 1866 when a sales representative of the manufacturing company demonstrated it in combat.\\" - [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_gun)\\n\\"New military technology combined with old-fashioned tactical doctrine to produce a scale of battle casualties unprecedented in American history. More American soldiers became casualties at the Battle of Gettysburg than in the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 combined\\" - [The American Battlefield Trust](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-casualties)\\n\\"Most casualties and deaths in the Civil War were the result of non-combat-related disease. For every three soldiers killed in battle, five more died of disease. The primitive nature of Civil War medicine, both in its intellectual underpinnings and in its practice in the armies, meant that many wounds and illnesses were unnecessarily fatal.\\" - [The American Battlefield Trust](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-casualties)","title":"CMV: Racism is what holding Americas progress back."},{"text":"Donald Trump literally tried to take over the United States with an illegal attempt to circumvent democracy.
