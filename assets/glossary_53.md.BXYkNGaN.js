Theres no proof of that and theres certainly better ways for one of the most powerful countries in the world than to target some unhinged individualsThere is documented evidence of China interfering in the elections of other democratic countries like [Taiwan](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/taiwans-election-prc-interference-and-its-implications-for-the-2024-election-landscape/) and [Canada](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68931295). Yet your proposition is that the Chinese government has no interest in trying to use TikTok, which gives them direct access to the information diets of millions of Americans for their own gain? The example I gave about targeting extremists is just one example of how Beijing might subtly manipulate TikTok to their benefit and the detriment of America. The whole point is to illustrate that the problem is going to be harder to detect than \\"China is pushing boldfaced propaganda onto American youth.\\" I don't need to lay out every possible way that TikTok might be misused to believe that, on net, the risks outweigh the benefits. B) that, without TikTok, they would be unable to reach those individuals to begin with. Do you seriously believe if theyre so openly hostile they dont have bots on reddit, Facebook. Instagram already achieving that goal of spreading propaganda? (Which, by the way, is what the comment I was responding to asserted)Using bots to spread information on American controlled platforms, where Facebook or Instagram have an interested in stopping them, is not the same thing as leveraging a platform they control directly.

Given that Nauta and De Oliveira are still facing charges, they at least have a legitimate reason to contest the public release of information that they can show would prejudice a jury.Given a lot of details about the case are already public knowledge (including the indictment that of course directly accuses them of crimes), I don't see how they could argue the entire volume of the report must be withheld, but Smith does likely have to take their complaints seriously.Unfortunately the case is before Cannon (who ruled that Smith wasn't lawfully appointed) so it would take an order from the 11th circuit that she was wrong to lift her hold on the report. Per the article, it isn't clear whether she has authority to actually block the report.

The notion of \\"chimeras\\" was particularly horrifying to H.G. Wells, author of \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau.\\" But over the past two years, the subject has quietly made its way into scientific journals. Unbeknownst to most Americans, today the creation of human-animal chimeras represents a valuable experimental tool that could revolutionize science and medicine.However, the creation of these hybrid organisms also raises ethical questions: What rights should these organisms possess? Great Britain has already begun to take up the question; an official government report released last month backed the creation of human-animal hybrid embryos). US policymakers, however, are far from acting.One of the main forces driving research in this area is the widespread interest in human embryonic stem cells. In vitro experiments suggest that these cells can differentiate into any cell type in the body, but whether they would retain that potential if implanted in an actual human body is not yet clear. Answering this question could well require experiments that would require the destruction of a developing human being at a point beyond what is acceptable to most people.Yet the creation of a human-animal embryonic chimera offers a potential solution: Instead of using a developing human blastocyst, scientists can instead transplant and subsequently observe the human embryonic stem cells in a developing animal blastocyst. Last year Rockefeller University scientist Ali Brivanlou created an embryonic chimera by engrafting human embryonic stem cells into a mouse blastocyst and subsequently implanting the resultant embryo into a live mouse uterus. Experiments of this type offer the opportunity to study the human embryonic stem cells in a living system.This is just the beginning. The most revolutionary advances from research on human-animal chimeras are likely to emerge in neuroscience. Scientists at Stanford have already created a mouse with a brain partially composed of human cells; further, they have publicly declared their intent to engineer a mouse whose brain would be entirely human.From an ethical perspective, these human-mouse neural chimeras might seem benign when compared to recent scientific efforts to create monkeys with partly human brains. Researchers could perform useful experiments on these human-monkey hybrids -- so-called \\"humanzees\\" -- in ways that would avoid performing ethically objectionable brain experiments on live humans. Over time these experiments could result in a quantum leap of discoveries on diseases ranging from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's.If the creation of these new organisms bothers us as a society, we must ask ourselves why. We cannot merely dismiss human-animal chimeras as \\"unnatural,\\" or else we would have just as easily dismissed recombinant DNA technology or any other scientific improvement upon nature. Nor can we merely accept that creating chimeras is ethical because of the potential medical advances; to do so begs the larger question of when ethical considerations should trump scientific inquiry.Instead, policymakers should use the following simple principle as a guide: one should treat a recipient of transferred humanity with the same level of respect as an organism with inborn humanity -- in other words, a human being. Even if an organism does not appear to be fully human in biological terms, it nonetheless deserves the moral value of a human being, as long as it possesses the qualities that our society has deemed worthy of human respect.There is no societal consensus on what qualities merit such respect. But nearly everyone agrees that the capacities for language, consciousness, or rationality are probably among them. If a human-animal chimera (such as a monkey with a human-like brain) comes to possess any of these qualities, then it would be morally objectionable to create that organism. Meanwhile, certain chimeras, such as a mouse with human skin grafts or human muscle cells, pose no serious ethical risk.In cases where there is a reasonable possibility of transferring quintessentially human capacities to a chimera, scientists must stop short of actually creating it. Unfortunately, the most scientifically useful experiments -- namely, those involving embryonic stem cells or the human brain -- are precisely the ones that should not be performed.Undoubtedly, the scientists who pursue research involving human-animal chimeras today do not intentionally seek to violate human dignity, but instead seek to affirm it by curing human diseases. Yet without a fuller and richer public debate on this issue, we as a society may blindly allow our scientists to perform experiments that demean the very human life we all so zealously seek to strengthen.","title":"Vivek Ramswamy, A Geroge Soros scholarship recipient who suddenly became a billionaire, presidential candidate and now political appointee in Trump's administration"},{"text":"Monroe Doctrine exception applies, we can do whatever we want in *our* hemisphere, no foreign wars here!!\\n(/s, obviously)","title":"Trump refuses to rule out use of military force to take control of Greenland and the Panama Canal"},{"text":"Plus they might be too incompetent to pass anything on P25","title":"The Right needs to take notes"},{"text":"If you don't have policies to protect trans prisoners, that does *not* mean they will be treated like all other prisoners.

Trans women in this situation are sometimes made to dance, present, or masturbate at the correctional officers' discretion.[122] A 2021 California study found that 69% of trans women prisoners reported being forced to perform sexual acts against their will, 58.5% reported being violently sexually assaulted, and 88% overall reported being made to take part in a \\"marriage-like relationship\\".[123] Trans women who physically resist the advances of other prisoners are often criminally charged with assault and placed in solitary confinement, the assault charge then being used to extend the woman's prison stay and deny her parole.[124]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_people_in_prison#V-codingIf you have policies denying necessary medical care to trans prisoners, or to any other selected group of prisoners, that does no mean they will be treated like all other prisoners.

Im a Conservative, not an arsonist, she told her furious colleagues. Many Tory Eurosceptics have not forgiven her for it.\\n \\n Although Badenoch voted to leave the EU in 2016, some on the Tory right suspect she is not a true believer. I left because Kemi became leader, says Andrea Jenkyns, a former Tory MP now standing as Reform UKs candidate to become mayor of Lincolnshire. She is very much the status quo.\\n \\n Badenoch is at her most zealous on the issue of shrinking the state and has spoken of her admiration for Javier Milei in Argentina and his chainsaw approach to bureaucracy. Badenoch told the Spectator: It will be interesting to see what the Donald Trump-Elon Musk partnership is going to deliver with government efficiency.\\n \\n Shortly after these flattering comments about Musk, the X tycoon held talks with Farage in Mar-a-Lago about the possibility of him funding Reform UK. We are in negotiations about whether he can help, Farage said after the meeting. But, having heaped praised on the Reform leader in the past, over the weekend Musk called for Farage to be replaced, saying he lacks what it takes.\\n \\n Badenoch is also extremely animated on transgender issues, including her defence of single-sex toilets. Some believed she was elevating the issue in an attempt to appeal to rightwing Tory activists, but those close to her say that is not the case.\\n \\n One Tory insider says this focus has dismayed some of the partys deep-pocketed backers. Several donors assumed her anti-woke obsession was clever tactics  that it was about values alignment with the party membership in order to win the contest. But they received a rude shock to find that behind closed doors shes exactly the same, the person adds.\\n \\n She is the first black leader of a UK-wide party, but says she looks forward to a time when that is not the subject of comment. Badenoch told the FT earlier this year she had not faced racism in any meaningful sense.\\n \\n She explained then: So what I just call bad behaviour  rude behaviour, unpleasant  other people add the skin colour on top of it and say its racism. So my threshold for racism is quite high.\\n \\n Badenochs allies say that she will start to outline policies on issues such as the economy and healthcare in due course, guided by her belief in classical liberalism.\\n \\n But some Tory MPs wonder when Badenoch will start setting out her vision, not least because it is now six months since the partys electoral trouncing. They are especially worried about her apparent aversion to communicating with voters via the media.\\n \\n Guto Harri, former communications chief for Johnson, says, A politician who doesnt do media is like being a rugby player who doesnt tackle. In opposition, you can only express yourself through what you say, not what you do.\\n \\n She has strong, distinct views, which is a great strength. She should have the confidence to be challenged on those views and articulate them at every opportunity.\\n \\n When Badenoch does do broadcast interviews, she often becomes tetchy. She feels a lot of interviewers act in bad faith and are trying to trip her up, says one colleague. She often says, Im not here to provide content.\\n \\n During the Tory autumn conference, Badenoch appeared to lose control of her own message, each media appearance creating more problems. She said the UKs minimum wage was one of the regulations overburdening business and that maternity pay had gone too far.\\n \\n She has claimed that some cultures are less valid than others, but became frustrated when pressed on what cultures she had in mind in a BBC interview in September. You want me to say Muslims when it isnt all Muslims, so Im not going to do that, she said.\\n \\n The day after becoming Tory leader, Badenoch delighted Starmer by claiming that the Partygate scandal that helped bring down Johnson was overblown and that she wanted to draw a line under criticism of Liz Trusss disastrous mini Budget.\\n \\n Id have given our entire campaign budget for those quotes, jokes one Starmer strategist, claiming Badenoch should have disowned both episodes.\\n \\n The next general election may not be until 2029, but the path back to power for the Conservatives could be even longer, if recent experience is anything to go by.\\n \\n Badenoch is at the helm of a diminished party. The last time the Tories suffered such a crushing loss  in 1997  it took 13 years and four different leaders to return to power.\\n \\n She is now having to fend off suggestions that the Conservatives, the party of Churchill and Disraeli, should form an electoral pact or merge with Reform.\\n \\n I havent been elected as leader of the Conservative party to do a deal with Nigel Farage, Badenoch told the rightwing broadcast network GB News in December, acknowledging that such an accord would further alienate moderate Tory voters. But when she name checks influential foreign leaders  Milei, Trump or Italys Giorgia Meloni  it is clear she is being drawn into the orbit of the populist right.\\n \\n Starmer has many problems, but for now Badenoch is not one of them. It doesnt matter in some ways that Keir is substandard, because Kemi is so weak, says one Labour minister.\\n \\n But Badenoch is unlikely to face the challenges of 2025 on the defensive. People want to take a swing at you and they want you to shut up, she told the FT last year. Thats not me.!ping UK","title":"Can Kemi Badenoch unite the right in Britain?"},{"text":"That press conference was absolute insanity","title":"Trump refuses to rule out use of military force to take control of Greenland and the Panama Canal"},{"text":" Kemi Badenoch, the new leader of Britains Conservatives, enters 2025 with what should be a tempting target in her sights: Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, whose poll ratings have fallen faster than those of any premier in recent memory since his election triumph last July.\\n \\n Instead, Badenoch is facing a painful question: do the Tories have even further to fall? After collapsing to the worst election defeat in the partys history, the Conservatives  supposedly the most successful political party in the world  are now fighting to defend their status as Britains main opposition.\\n \\n Bookmakers reckon that Nigel Farage, leader of the populist, rightwing Reform UK party, has more chance of succeeding Starmer as prime minister than Badenoch. The leader of the opposition spent Boxing Day contesting Reforms membership numbers, which the partys tracker claims now exceeds the Conservatives. In response, Farage threatened to channel resources into unseating her at the next general election.\\n \\n Both appear to be attempting to curry favour with US billionaire Elon Musk, who has taken a growing interest in British politics  and has the finances and platform to shape public opinion. Badenoch and Farage have both called for a public inquiry into the historic grooming scandal that Musk has become preoccupied with. In the first half of 2025, the Tories face a daunting set of local elections that could see them suffer another round of heavy defeats. It will look really bad, admits one Badenoch ally. It will be really tough.\\n \\n The media-averse Badenoch has yet to land significant blows on an underperforming Starmer or have an impact against Farage, a natural political performer who has become a TikTok celebrity, despite the fact that his own party has just five MPs. An ally concedes: We are struggling to be heard and everyone is fascinated by Farage. The next few months are going to be squeaky bum time for Kemi, says one leading Tory MP.\\n \\n Even Badenochs own MPs seem to have their doubts about whether she can turn this around. Out of a parliamentary rump of 121 Tory MPs, only 42 backed her for the top job, which she won on November 2 in a ballot of party members.\\n \\n Despite a campaign in which she refused to set out specific policies, Badenochs enthusiasm for principles such as a small state, lower taxes, net zero scepticism and antipathy to woke causes chimed with the views of Tory activists.\\n \\n But even as she closed in on victory, some MPs were not convinced. Maybe the party needs to elect Kemi, get the madness out of its system early on and then have someone else, said one senior Tory in October, before accepting a job in Badenochs shadow cabinet.\\n \\n In the weeks following her election, she has made little effort to introduce herself to the British public, conducting only a handful of big broadcast interviews  although an interview with the Spectator magazine, her former employer, drew some attention after she announced that she does not believe sandwiches are a real food, she declared. Its what you have for breakfast.\\n \\n Badenoch remains an enigma to many voters. But the Tory leaders supporters say she is biding her time and that in 2025 she will come out swinging. That at least will come as little surprise at Westminster, where Badenoch is known for her abrasive style. As she told the Financial Times last year, I dont look for confrontation. However if people bring it, Im not going to run away.\\n \\n Badenoch, born in London in 1980 to middle-class Nigerian parents, became Tory leader in the ashes of Rishi Sunaks calamitous election defeat in July, after a protracted leadership competition that lasted four months.\\n \\n The 45-year-old was elected MP to the traditionally solid Tory seat of Saffron Walden in 2017, quickly carving out a career as a minister and ultimately business and trade secretary.\\n \\n She sets great store by the fact that she is an engineer  she studied computer systems engineering at Sussex university  who likes to understand a problem before setting out solutions. Yet it is still far from clear how she intends to pull the party out of its predicament.\\n \\n She wants to take her time, to think hard about how she wants to do things, says one ally. She wont be rushed into anything. You have to earn the right to be heard again. That will take some time.\\n \\n But as previous Conservative leaders have discovered, time is a precious commodity. The partys taste for regicide may also be unsated: since David Cameron quit in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016, the party has had five leaders. Even Badenochs closest team members admit she needs to start making her mark soon.\\n \\n On the face of it, Badenoch should have been helped by the dire start made by Starmer, whose poll ratings have collapsed while taxes have risen by 40bn and the economy has stagnated. But in their weekly exchanges in the House of Commons, it is the prime minister who often has the upper hand. One Labour minister says: Number 10 is a bit fearful that if Kemi goes, somebody else comes in and it wont be such an easy ride.\\n \\n But Badenochs bigger challenge in 2025 will be to tackle the threat on her right flank. Having finally become an MP, Farage has succeeded in winning over Tory donors and some previous Conservative supporters. He is eyeing the local elections in May as a chance to show that Reform UK  which has virtually no presence in UK town halls  can become a serious force.\\n \\n Badenochs problem is that the last time these elections were fought in 2021, then prime minister Boris Johnson was enjoying a vaccine bounce at the end of the pandemic and riding high in the polls. On that occasion, the Tories won 2,345 seats while Farages party secured a grand total of two. Even allowing for Tory expectation management, it is easy to see how things might play out in May. Recent surveys have shown Farage snapping at the heels of the two main parties. A Techne UK poll in December put Labour on 27 points, the Tories on 26 and Reform on 21.\\n \\n Farage has said that building a local government base is an essential staging post in achieving his ultimate goal: running the country. Farage has made his intentions clear, naming his party after the Canadian Reform party that usurped the Progressive Conservatives in the 1990s. They are the model, he said before this years election. Thats the plan.\\n \\n Badenoch has signalled that dealing with the Reform UK threat is her first priority. Her only press conference, in November, focused on migration, in a sign that she is prepared to fight Farage on his own terrain. I, as the new leader, accept responsibility and say truthfully, We got it wrong, Badenoch said then.\\n \\n It is a high-risk strategy, but Tory strategists argue she has no choice. Matt Warman, a former Tory MP who lost his Boston and Skegness seat to Reform in July, says, You have to unite the right to win elections. Doing that before Reform gets even greater momentum is an important part of where we are in the cycle. A Badenoch ally agrees. Kemi is not going to walk away from the tough stuff and leave the ground for Farage.\\n \\n Badenochs problem is that Farage does not have a record to defend on immigration, while the Tories own history on the issue is disastrous. The day after that press conference, official data was released that showed net migration to the UK topped 900,000 in the year ending June 2023  part of the period Sunak was in Number 10. In the year ending June 2016, the month that Britain voted for Brexit and control over its borders, the equivalent figure was 335,000.\\n \\n And Badenochs own history in this area is far from straightforward. In 2018, she gave a speech in parliament supporting looser immigration controls. Tory rightwingers unconvinced about her credentials have shared clips of it on WhatsApp message groups.\\n \\n Badenoch now says she wants to impose a cap on migration numbers  though she will not say where it will be set  and hints at a revival of a scheme like the Rwanda policy, Sunaks flagship deterrent which saw only four volunteers flown to the African state before Julys election. One member of Badenochs team says she had little choice but to trash the Sunak governments record: Shes not here to praise the last Tory government, shes here to bury it.\\n \\n Badenochs response to the immigration question goes to the heart of her political dilemma. Tory MPs admit she can never out-Farage Farage on the issue. Meanwhile, centrist Conservatives fear that if she fights on Farages terrain she is likely to see a further loss of moderate Tory support, notably to the resurgent Liberal Democrats, who in July marched through former Conservative seats in wealthy areas of southern England.\\n \\n She is thus caught in the middle. Robert Jenrick, who lost to Badenoch in the final round of the leadership contest, wanted to go further and withdraw Britain from the European Convention on Human Rights, a move which Badenoch argued would not fix the problem of soaring immigration. Leaving the ECHR would also have split her party, with more liberal centrists peeling off.\\n \\n On other issues, too, Badenoch has shown a practical streak which has alienated those on the right and potentially leaves her exposed to Reform UK.","title":"Can Kemi Badenoch unite the right in Britain?"},{"text":"Surely President Trump will be against the prolonged invasion of the sovereign territory of Gaza and will fix it better than Harris.

After that the crown needed to enforced taxes to help pay back what they spent on defending the colonies, and the colonies basically barely paid any taxes if at all. They were already most free system of people on the entire planet at that point. George tried to tax us and we were like Nnnnnno! And he was like okay what if we tax this thats fair right? Nnnnno! Okay what if we tax the tea? Nnnnnno! Okay okay. We wont tax ANYTHING except for the tea because its TWICE IMPORTED. From Asia to Britain from Britain to America. We will lose money if we dont tax it. Nnnnnnno! Then we started throwing stones at soldiers and shit and attacking them so they shot a protestor and the war popped off. All the while George is dealing with his own other shit and his shithead son and heir getting drunk in public and fighting and womanizing and dealing with the French and all this other stuff and he loses his marbles over it.

The co-defendants said releasing the report would unfairly prejudice them. Their motion cited a letter from Trumps attorneys which also argued that the release of Smiths findings was not in the public interest and would interfere with his presidency and his presidential transition.Earlier Tuesday, Smiths office told the court that Garland might not make the classified documents part of the report public. The report is two volumes. One volume details prosecutors findings in the classified documents case, and the other focuses on the investigation into Trumps efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.Read more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/07/jack-smith-trump-special-counsel-report-garland/?utm\\\\_campaign=wp\\\\_main&amp;utm\\\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/07/jack-smith-trump-special-counsel-report-garland/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit.com)","title":"Cannon temporarily blocks report on Trump classified-documents probe"},{"text":"If thats actually what you got from this then you need some help?? ig youd rather call people that disagree w you trump supporters and disregard what they say rather than actually think about what is being said looks like you dont have the cognitive ability to deal with reality.

The former is based in China, the latter the USA.  Are these apples to apples?  Also, Europe sees what China is doing and how America is responding.  It is only a matter of time before Europe, which relies on American intelligence and military assets, adopts the American POV, to wit:China's actions are those of a belligerent in war: cutting undersea internet cables; hacking critical government agencies and communications infrastructure; widespread IP extortion / theft; bio-warfare, from COVID (see Wuhan TBD) to food chain adulteration; supporting Russia's war in Ukraine and arms to Iran; widespread propaganda via CCP social media (I mean TikTok) and psychological warfare to undermine democratic norms and pit Americans against each other; and the list can go on and on. So why do we give them beneficial trade terms?  (They don't give them to the USA...)As China pushes forward with its aggression and belligerence, the United States military apparatus (Pentagon, DoD, FBI) and civil agencies (FCC, Dept. Commerce, Treasury), is quickly losing its ability to manage the situation using what political scientists call \\"Soft Power\\" (indirect influence).  While many Americans are aloof (or suckered in a pro-China TikTok or Reddit echo chamber), the fact is the USA is shifting to \\"Hard Power\\" (from carrots to sticks), and our military is starting to change the narrative, both in terms of geopolitical strategy, media communications, and trade strategy.  Here are some recent examples:[https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-fbi-and-cisa-peoples-republic-china-prc-targeting-commercial-telecommunications](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-fbi-and-cisa-peoples-republic-china-prc-targeting-commercial-telecommunications)[https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/the-china-threat](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/the-china-threat)[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-oil-major-top-shipping-021253132.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-oil-major-top-shipping-021253132.html)[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tencent-catl-blacklisted-department-defense-155913512.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tencent-catl-blacklisted-department-defense-155913512.html)The long term benefits of decoupling from the CCP/PLA (I mean Chinese business firms), far outweigh short term marginal economic benefits, and not just from an environmental and local business POV, rather an existential POV.  There is no pain, without gain; the USA must insulate itself from China's predatory and harmful trade and espionage practices for National Security purposes and the long term health of the Country.","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"His agenda is to stay out of prison.

This meant that both the stockbrokers and their customers had to dump their stocks on the stock-market to cover their loans, irrespective of what price they had to sell them for.As a result of this the stock-market crashed, a day that would go down in history as, Black Thursday. In his book, The Great Crash 1929, John Kenneth Gailbraith makes the following shocking statement, At the height of the selling frenzy Bernard Baruch brought Winston Churchill into the visitors gallery of the New York Stock Exchange to witness the panic and impress him with his power over the wild events on the floor.The Synagogue of Satan book.","title":"Save all the money you can, the big depression  is coming"},{"text":"What does President Musk think about these complaints First Lady Donald making?","title":"Trump reportedly complaining about Elon in private  and hates President Musk joke"},{"text":"Thats a good thing, now the truth wont be stifled by the leftright?","title":"'Ending that completely': Facebook gets rid of fact-checkers in wake of Trump's election"},{"text":"So is Karmala","title":"Republican ERUPTED After Kamala Harris Called The 2024 Electoral Vote Fo..."},{"text":"Please, someone, explain - is he planning to invade us (in Canada), or perhaps make an offer with a downpayment and mortgage he will never pay?

Although Trump had never held elected office, he was well known for his frequent comments on public affairs and business exploits as head of The Trump Organization. He had previously considered a presidential run in 1988 as a Republican, but chose not to run. For 2000, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura persuaded Trump to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party, which was fracturing despite achieving ballot access and qualifying for matching funds as a result of businessman Ross Perot's 1996 presidential campaign on the party's ticket.","title":"Trump says \\"the people of Greenland are MAGA\\", insists it will become part of the US"},{"text":"I thought anti christ meant instead of yashuea (jesus) Christ and that it would still be the same soul just a different body and time","title":"Trump and Elon ain't the devil"},{"text":"But what does President Musk say?","title":"Trump reportedly complaining about Elon in private  and hates President Musk joke"},{"text":"So does that mean someone breaking down his family homes front door would be just visiting?","title":"GOP rep describes Jan. 6 riot as a self-guided ... tour of the Capitol | \\nDescribing the Jan. 6 attack, one House Republican wrote, \\"Some individuals entered the Capitol, took photos, and explored the building before leaving.\\""},{"text":"That's like $30k net, or $2.5k/month.

I don't know about the owners of other major social media such as YouTube or Reddit, but I do not trust any of these people.Youtube is owned by Google, which is very left-leaning compared to most companies. Reddit is also very left leaning. Really, the only popular right-wing owned social media platform is Twitter, which is relatively small compared to other social media platforms. Your argument essentially rests on all American social media companies being like Twitter, which they objectively aren't. \\n all the arguments I have heard about Chinese social media also apply to American social media. From my perspective as a European, the USA is a foreign power led by a dangerously unpredictable right-wing extremist. If Chinese-owned social media are dangerous, then American-owned social media are just as dangerousYour post doesn't really consider the fact that the USA is the EU's most powerful and closest ally. Driving a wedge between the US and Europe by banning US social media would only serve to worsen relations, which would not be to the benefit of either the EU or the US. On the contrary, it directly empowers other nations like China and Russia who would be eager to fill in any vacuum that the US left, and those nations are absolutely not going to be more beneficial for the EU than the US is.While this may not have been your intention, the message of this post fits exactly in line with Russian and Chinese interests: urging countries to break ties with the US.

Nobody is benevolent. While I am cautiously rooting for musk and vivek, this form of governing is actually fairly dangerous. Most Americans wouldnt read a 10 page bill, and are more likely to call their representative based on a tweet from musk or vivek. While recent examples show promising results, it is embarrassingly easy to see this kind of power be abused. As musk and vivek are unpaid, and humans are incentive driven creatures, it leads me to wonder what incentives they will or hope to receive. history shows deregulation is achievable when approached methodically. This is especially true when you give the insiders the right incentives.The author just beats around the bush, saying that DOGE will need to incentivize congress without giving any details or examples. Then he links to his research where he says if the US economy was less regulated, less money would be lost to regulationReally sad that this is what people are pushing, it reads like it was written by a high schooler","title":"Dont bet against the Department of Government Efficiency on deregulation"},{"text":"Trump told his team to send a specialist to Greenland to get the job done.

How will we as a society support those 1,000,000 children you advocate for?While I appreciate the audacity of the left using one thing they want to justify another thing they want, this is one of the easiest debate points to argue against.Let me answer your question with a few questions, if I may.1. If we polled poor mothers (below the poverty line) who chose to have babies because they wanted children, and asked them if they feel that babies are better off in poverty, or dead, what do you think their responses would be ?  Do they hold that opinion just to justify wanting to have a baby, or do you think it is common sense that being poor is better than being dead ?\\n2. If we polled poor adults (below the poverty line) and asked them if they would rather remain poor, or be dead, what do you think their response would be ?\\n3. If a mother had a live baby, and didn't want to take care of it, could she simply refuse to take care of it because she said that it was impacting her lifestyle, would that be in any way legal (or in any way, moral) ?  Why is that ?The point of these question is to make it clear that what we're talking about here is an abdication of responsibility for a life, and that the left uses one thing it wants, i.e. .. government provided services and subsidies, to justify the reasoning behind another thing that they want, which is for mothers to have the freedom to kill their own unborn babies.The irony of all of this is that as soon as the baby is born of its mother's womb, these people on the left claim that they are the only political movement that cares about the baby, and want to provide for it, when they also argue that if it hadn't been born yet, they'd be happy to let the mother and an abortionist kill it.","title":"What people get wrong about Christian women who voted for Trump"},{"text":"I hope these Lawyers get remembered as people who deliberately and without remorse, did all they could to pervert Justice and the corrupt the meaning of truth.

However, its absurd to argue that there is a developing consensus from the medical community that sex and group-based sex differences have become such an elusively Byzantine concept that cant meaningfully be captured in an amended Title IX provision.  This whole thread is alienating. I wasnt even defending legislation or the GOP. I was pointing out that the headline was embellished. Republicans suck and their motivation is rooted in bigotry and cynical political expediency. It doesnt matter though because as I attempted to explain previously, Trump will say sex doesnt include gender identity, and the Supreme Court will uphold lower court decisions that key Title IX provisions dont apply to gender identity, adding that if Congress wants it to, they are free to amend the legislation. Its pointless to comment on articles about this topic in Reddit. I received a deluge of downvotes, two nasty DMs, and the exchanges with you are going nowhere.

European economies have not had any productivity growth since 2007, c.f. the recent Draghi report. The changes necessary for productivity growth are simply not politically feasible; similarly to Japan, the EU has consistently chosen the path of steady decline rather than short term pain, long term gain.Point 2: Whether Democratic or Republican, the US administration has shown a great willingness to protect its top tech companies. This is partly due to lobbying from those companies, and partly to protect their stock valuations. Examples include warning countries against implementing digital services taxes, and the USMCA trade agreement including liability protections for social media companies.Conclusion: If such a ban of social media companies would be implemented in Europe, at the very least you would see retaliatory tariffs on Europe, and President Trump has shown a willingness to renege on NATO agreements due to economic disputes. During an active war in Ukraine and only just after an inflationary period, this would be disastrous for both Europes economy and security. Many countries in the EU, most obviously Germany, are woefully unprepared for an American exit from Europe.

Germany famously has very strict laws around displaying the swastika. USA and certain European countries have free speech laws that allow the public display of the swastika. [Germany requires Facebook](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-confusing-rules-on-swastikas-and-nazi-symbols/a-45063547) and others to enforce that restriction, such that posts that are legal in USA, for example, but illegal in Germany, are not shown. Other such cases exists.So the point is that there is a middle ground between a total ban and allowing all forms of US media and content be shown. Even disliking the turn of some American social media doesn't mean it has to be dealt with through a ban.So how is Tik-Tok different? The argument about banning Tik-Tok, not just restricting legal content, is based on the risk of future geopolitical conflict between USA and China. Sure, some like the ban to be because of other reasons, but the laws that are debated and litigated presently are tied to geopolitical conflict. The risk scenario is, for example, a major conflict involving China and USA (presumably through a proxy) and that with detailed data and the ability of the CCP to command Tik-Tok to show certain content, that China has an ability to thwart, delay or blunt an American response.You may disagree with this reasoning. You may think it assumes too much about how disinformation works. You may think a ban is disproportionate to the threat. However, this is the reasoning that motivates the current ban.This is not the threat American social media poses to Europe. That is true for a few reasons:1. USA and Europe are unlikely to enter into military conflict. For all of Trump's craziness, even his ambition to acquire Greenland is through a purchase, his contempt for German and UK governments are framed as questions of money. The prospect of China-USA war is far greater.\\n2. Many Europeans are aligned with the Trumpian ideology, even governments, such as Hungary, Slovakia and to some extent Italy. Suggesting this is because Europeans have been brainwashed by Trumpian misinformation is a too rosy view. Our continent has its fair share of homegrown hatemongers. So a ban on grounds that American social media is becoming Trumpian would only fuel hatred of governing elites. The problem we face in Europe is harder.\\n3. The USA remains a democracy with checks and balances. A sizeable number of Americans did not vote for Trump and there are limits to what a Trumpian government can force social media companies to do. And even if Musk goes along with it, he does so only by reducing the market share of Twitter even further. CCP is a full-blown authoritarian institution. When Jack Ma got a bit too independent, despite his billions, he was brought to heel. Chinese oligarchs are rounded up, and occasionally murdered, when needed. Even if we look at Trump with despair, we must be sufficiently level-headed to see that the USA is not overnight on January 20th going to become a Chinese-style dictatorship.For these reasons, a ban of American social media in Europe is not proportionate, nor is its reasoning congruent with the debated Tik-Tok ban. Specific concerns can be addressed through targeted laws about content or through alternative channels and counter-messaging. The fact that we are discussing this on American social media is in itself informative. I would love for Europe to grow its own social media and tech industry, but that has more to do with European laws that make that difficult. Most of our problems are created by conflicts native to the European continent.","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"Stop making up historical events with funny names.","title":"GOP rep describes Jan. 6 riot as a self-guided ... tour of the Capitol | \\nDescribing the Jan. 6 attack, one House Republican wrote, \\"Some individuals entered the Capitol, took photos, and explored the building before leaving.\\""},{"text":"Nah gen z male trash are just as bigoted","title":"House Republicans Reveal their Top Legislative Priority: Attacking Transgender Rights"},{"text":"Even the conservative sub is losing support.

Writers from the area in the time period considered these same populations German, including the Kaiser. After Napoleon destroyed the Holy Roman Empire during his conquest of Europe, its replacement was called the German Confederation and just about every state which was a part of the late stage HRE was a part of it, all had German speaking components. The whole rivalry between Austria and Prussia in the 19th century was over who would hold sway over the little German states/German Confederation, Prussia being victorious shortly after created the unified Germany. The initial Austrian state after the collapse of the empire was called the Republic of German-Austria, and they voted over 90% in favor of annexation in 1938. There were of course dissenters, antifascists, and so forth who were opposed to it, but to say it was an unpopular notion is untrue.

This refers to attempts by the Chinese authorities, either directly or via proxies, to get criminal suspects C or dissidents C to return to China. Relatives in China of wanted people are sometimes pressured in these campaigns. In 2022 a minister from Chinas ministry of public security said 210,000 people had been persuaded to return in 2021, primarily relating to cases of suspected telecoms fraud. But Laura Harth, the campaigns director at Safeguard Defenders, says the stations are only the tip of the iceberg in much wider transnational repression campaigns. The Chinese Communist party has a range of tools at its fingertips for harassing dissidents overseas. On Monday, the US justice department announced charges against 40 officers from Chinas ministry of public security, and four other officials, for allegedly running an internet troll operation against dissidents. In other cases people wanted by the Chinese government have simply disappeared from overseas locations, only to turn up in Chinese custody. Such operations often require the cooperation of third countries. Harth concludes: Police stations or no police stations, this is happening everywhere.","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"It's sad that you assume I said that.?","title":"Trump-appointed judge allows transgender-rights restrictions in Florida prisons to take effect"},{"text":"Fuck it.

It must logically be then, that the current situation regarding the EU and the US is different from that of the US and China - thus, the same reasoning cannot be applied, since that reasoning centered around the matter of China being a hostile nation with undue control over corporations from China.The reasoning was not that social media companies might do damage to public discourse, the reasoning was that this particular social media company is weak to be influenced by China, the state, and would thus allow China, the nation, influence in the U.S.","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"David Kelly was an obvious one in the UK","title":"The CIA murdered Anne Heche"},{"text":"Checkbook?","title":"Trump Is Already Caving on Tariffs"},{"text":"Let's show the violent psychos a well produced video extolling the virtues of kindness.

We can point at the various American media and their ideological stances, pushing ideologies from the US into Europe. And social media are far from being innocent. Just the way they determine what kind of language or topics can be used or not can be taken as illustration on how they subtly push for certain views.\\nFor example, reddit is perfectly fine with hatred directed at men and white people, though they ban instantly hatred directed at women or non white people. They openly say it. This is a kind of propaganda subtly pushed by a social media platform, deciding what kind of things can and can't be pushed, what kind of issues can and can't be addressed. Same things can be said about other social media platforms.?\\nDo you believe Facebook or twitter held a neutral position regarding some elections in Europe??

Ultimately this isn't about whether people get spied on or not, it's about who's doing the spying. And it does tend to be the dictators and fascists that Especially want to be the ones doing the spying.Banning, say, Facebook would just come off as a means of controlling people's freedom to communicate where they want. You're just forcing them to use an alternative that, even if it has all the exact same features, may very well just be limiting who they can keep in touch with. You're forcing a monopoly where people's choices become 'use a VPN to watch youtube/read reddit posts/go on instagram/etc.' or 'have no more access to some of their favourite content or potentially sources of news that they like to watch because they simply have not moved to the new platform'.At least that's my personal perspective. It's a means of countries and politics wrestling power from or over each other, and then citizens just get caught in the cross fire, and lose access to information and entertainment for the sake of the government's interests.

Dems and GOP has been tilting the table their way year in and year out. Tilts of less than 45 degrees and the other players dont lose everything. Trumps first term took us past 45 and maybe Biden got the GOP advantage back under 45 degrees. But now all bets are off.

The US has no similar system; while it can force companies to disclose consumer data with a warrant, it cannot compel them to physically track people.\\n2. TikTok is pretty explicitly a tool of manipulation. Its Chinese equivalent is educational, with none of the shortform brainrot that plagues American TikTok, which has been strongly linked to mental illness and decreasing attention spans.
