You should at least address some of the arguments made. You quoted https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/birthright-citizenship-fundamental-misunderstanding-the-14th-amendmentBut didn't address the main point of the article. The 14th Amendment doesnt say that all persons born in the U.S. are citizens. It says that [a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens. That second, critical, conditional phrase is conveniently ignored or misinterpreted by advocates of birthright citizenship.Critics erroneously believe that anyone present in the United States has subjected himself to the jurisdiction of the United States, which would extend citizenship to the children of tourists, diplomats, and illegal aliens alike.But that is not what that qualifying phrase means. Its original meaning refers to the political allegiance of an individual and the jurisdiction that a foreign government has over that individual.The fact that a tourist or illegal alien is subject to our laws and our courts if they violate our laws does not place them within the political jurisdiction of the United States as that phrase was defined by the framers of the 14th Amendment.This amendments language was derived from the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which provided that [a]ll persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power would be considered citizens.Sen. Lyman Trumbull, a key figure in the adoption of the 14th Amendment, said that subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. included not owing allegiance to any other country.As John Eastman, former dean of the Chapman School of Law, has said, many do not seem to understand the distinction between partial, territorial jurisdiction, which subjects all who are present within the territory of a sovereign to the jurisdiction of that sovereigns laws, and complete political jurisdiction, which requires allegiance to the sovereign as well.In the famous Slaughter-House cases of 1872, the Supreme Court stated that this qualifying phrase was intended to exclude children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States. This was confirmed in 1884 in another case, Elk vs. Wilkins, when citizenship was denied to an American Indian because he owed immediate allegiance to his tribe and not the United States.American Indians and their children did not become citizens until Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. There would have been no need to pass such legislation if the 14th Amendment extended citizenship to every person born in America, no matter what the circumstances of their birth, and no matter who their parents are.Even in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, the 1898 case most often cited by birthright supporters due to its overbroad language, the court only held that a child born of lawful, permanent residents was a U.S. citizen. That is a far cry from saying that a child born of individuals who are here illegally must be considered a U.S. citizen.Furthermore, you dismiss as a \\"moot point\\" the one regarding invasion. Yet it seems that Trump intends to call it exactly that on day one and proclaim a state of emergency. I don't think you can just dismiss it out of hand. At least make an argument.","title":"You Are NEVER Going to Repeal Birthright Citizenship"},{"text":"This is for the MAGA folks in the back:HE DOESN'T FUCKING CARE ABOUT YOUAT ALL.","title":"John Thune Voted New Senate Majority Leader  Despite MAGAs Opposition"},{"text":"I mean bar snoop non of the others were really gangsta rap and snoop was more gfunk than anything else....right I'm off to go put in some warren g!

There is a reason the Soviet Union had to repeatedly crush rebellions in Eastern Europe and had to build a military that could flood hundreds of thousands into a country to do so.  The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe's economies were tied together in a complicated system of interdependent networks, with differing parts specialized to do differing things.  Once the Eastern European countries were able to break away, the Soviet Union itself was finished, because the economic system was finished.What Trump 2 and to some extent Biden do not realize is that the United States is maintaining its own economic system due to running its own version of an \\"economic Warsaw Pact\\".  Every decade or so, the restless inhabitants of the economic Warsaw Pact have to be crushed, such as Japan in the 1980s, the Asian Financial Crisis late 1990s, and the 2007-2009 Great Recession.If the blundering of Trump 2 ever alienates Western Europe to make emergency plans, possibly with Japan and South Korea, to work together with China and the rest of the BRICS, then the economic Warsaw Pact will come tumbling down, and with it the US economic system. The analogy to Trump 2 should be the fall of the Soviet Union.  Because that is one of the more plausible options, and it will happen relatively fast, maybe within a year, or even a season.  Various triggers could be an all-out trade war with Europe and a default on the US debt.","title":"Voters elected Hitler because they liked his fascist promise.

Trump is a lot more like Chavez and Maduro, whose regime was elected on a populist authoritarian/revolutionary platform to fight back against elites, and used that mandate to make Venezuela increasingly authoritarian while collapsing its economy. In addition to the self-declared Bolivarians of Venezuela, he also has a lot in common with Peron in Argentina, and MAGA shares a lot in common with the 20th century Mexican PRI or the Zimbabwean ZANU-PF: Populist, nationalist, rhetorically revolutionary and \\"anti-elitist\\" parties that created new, corrupt elites, eroded democracy, rule of law and consequently the economy in each of their countries - sometimes beyond repair. And of course, all of these regimes have had considerable and disturbing human rights abuses and murders of dissidents and people in the way of their corruption. Honestly, I don't think Trump is on a Hitler trajectory - he's unlikely to try to conquer Canada and Mexico. He's more on a Maduro/Mugabe/Canel-Diaz/Peron trajectory.

Heres a synopsis for the West - Americas:Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke Afro-American racists to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements C extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.Dugin is a far right political philosopher in Russia and apparently Putin utilizes a lot of what is in that book.Edit: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_GeopoliticsLink for anyone interested in reading about the book and its contents.Edit 2: Thank you for the awards. I believe this should be more widespread and not looked at as a crazy conspiracy theory. There are concepts written in there that have been, and are actively, being used around the globe.

All the tech companies will raise their prices on their products so consumers can put all the blame on Trump's tarrifs. Every company who went woke in 2020 will raise prices for everything to put all the blame on Trump. Then another Democrat will win the election in 2028 and promise to rescue the economy. But that person wouldn't need to do a damn thing. The companies will simply lower prices regardless of tariffs because they simply wanted Trump to look bad..It will always be rigged against Trump.

Several democratically-elected leaders have dismantled the very systems that brought them to power (e.g. Chavez in Venezuela and Fujimori in Peru).Here is a quote from the introduction:This is how we tend to think of democracies dying: at the hands of men with guns. During the Cold War, coups dtat accounted for nearly three out of every four democratic breakdowns. Democracies in Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Thailand, Turkey, and Uruguay all died this way. More recently, military coups toppled Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi in 2013 and Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. In all these cases, democracy dissolved in spectacular fashion, through military power and coercion.But there is another way to break a democracy. It is less dramatic but equally destructive. Democracies may die at the hands not of generals but of elected leaderspresidents or prime ministers who subvert the very process that brought them to power. Some of these leaders dismantle democracy quickly, as Hitler did in the wake of the 1933 Reichstag fire in Germany. More often, though, democracies erode slowly, in barely visible steps.","title":"Democratic Governors Form Coalition to Safeguard Democracy Ahead of Trump Term"},{"text":"This case doesnt even exist yet...

How many more seats the Republicans will win depends on the outcome of a few contests, in California and elsewhere, where ballots are still being counted. But the GOPs final margin is likely to be similar to the four-seat advantage it held for most of the past two years, when internal division and leadership battles prevented the party from accomplishing much of anything.Such a slim majority means that the legislation most prized on the right and feared by the lefta national abortion ban, dramatic cuts to federal spending, the repeal of Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act and Joe Bidens largest domestic-policy achievementsis unlikely to pass Congress. I dont think theyre even going to try on any of those things, Brendan Buck, who served as a top aide to former Speaker Paul Ryan during Trumps first term, told Berman.Trumps biggest opportunity for a legacy-defining law may be extending his 2017 tax cuts, which are due to expire next year and wont need to overcome a Senate filibuster to pass. He could also find bipartisan support for new immigration restrictions, including funding for his promised southern wall, after an election in which voters rewarded candidates with a more hawkish stance on the border.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/VvVDbPQP](https://theatln.tc/VvVDbPQP)?","title":"What Trump Can (And Probably Cant) Do With His Trifecta"},{"text":"He will have the most furrowed brow of the bunch.","title":"In Thune, Senate Republicans Picked The Most Anti-MAGA Option as Leader"},{"text":"But Matt, she was only 17","title":"Trump taps Rep.

This crowd sees \\"higher taxes and tariffs everwhere\\" and think \\"things will be cheaper for me.\\"I don't think pandering is the answer. Just like I don't think Clinton's laughing about putting coal miners out of work was the answer. I think coming up with a bold, specific, tailored plan to actually make things right with all the people of the Rust Belt and Appalachia who've been hurt by decades of globalization and free trade is a start. And that begins with an acknowledgement. An open, honest acknowledgement of the pain these people are feeling and WHY. Donald Trump says a lot of nonsense, but he's absolutely 100% right when he says to those people that they've been getting screwed by both sides for decades. They absolutely have. And while Trump is almost certainly not going to be helpful to them, he's the first to come out and say what all of those people already know: both major parties have screwed them, their families, their towns, their entire way of life.We need to get better at taking a nuanced topic and chunk it into more accessible pieces than the \\"low tax always keep more money\\" that cons always yell to the masses.I think there needs to be a more authentic message. One that focuses on kitchen table issues that matter to the vast majority of voters. Identity politics is a loser. You can enact the policies you believe are right once you're in office, but engaging in a fight over bathrooms and CRT in schools and book bans and the like while people are losing their jobs, losing their homes, struggling to feed their children? It's a loser, every time.","title":"After Trumps election, women are swearing off sex with men. This has been a long time coming"},{"text":"lol, lmao, even.Dredd Scott? Plessy v.

This gives them a blind faith in the continuation of the United States as a democratic republic. They still think it's improper to undermine the power of the next office. They still think elections will be possible going forward. They can conceptualize the damage promised, they *cannot believe* that it will be or is intended to be comprehensive and permanent.\\nThis isn't to say they get any of the above, or other ideals like ethics, correct all the time. The ideology blinds them in those regards too. But it is why they don't seem to push back the way you think.\\nWe also can't forget that party power has not been absolute in a very long time. The last supermajority was under Obama and lasted something like 72 days. Even then I believe there were right-wing DINOs that prevented the supermajority from truly being such.?\\nRepublicans are experts at undermining political processes because they have the exact opposite ideological preference regarding ethics and decorum and it is much easier to obstruct and destroy than it is to coalesce and build. Democrats clearly feel like their policies must be perfectly executed in accordance with precedence (legal and institutional) to succeed in the face of Republican obstruction.\\nThis continues with another challenge going forward: Dems will not obstruct Republican actions nearly as effectively as Rs could if the roles were 100% reversed. Whether the Dems can or cannot is not important. Inevitably they meter their responses because their ideology demands it. Some of it is for fear of establishing a dangerous precedent that might be used against Dems and citizens in the future... but they were again blind to the fact that they did not need to set the example for Republicans to dive headfirst into that mentality.\\nWe saw this with Merrick Garland. The ONE seat in the federal government that could have freed us from Trumpism was given to a person sympathetic to it in the name of... you guessed it... decorum and blind trust in the persistsnce of America. The threat was absolutely clear and these Neo-Confederates should have been shut down for good. There was no question the AG should have been instructed to be relentless and our FBI act on all the foreign agents in the Republican party.\\nNone of this should be a surprise to anyone.","title":"Jack Smith Plans to Step Down as Special Counsel Before Trump Takes Office"},{"text":"Director of 1 billion dollars plz","title":"Trump names former House Democrat Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence"},{"text":"Please tell me this is satire.","title":"Matt Gaetz Is Trumps Pick for Attorney General (free to read at NYT)"},{"text":"Youve gotta love the republican strategy blow up the economy every time youre in charge, and after some lag, by the time Americans feel the pain pretend you will fix the very same problem you created only to make things worse.

I had always felt different, in early childhood I was always better friends with the girls, and in my early teenage years I still remember a particular day. This was almost 25 years ago now, I had taken some of my mother's nail polish and damn did I get chewed out for it. I remember the takeaway I had from that conversation was that I was *abnormal* and *wrong* for feeling that way. So I did what you are talking about and tried to hide it away. Everything was an excuse I told myself, the very same ones republicans will use, \\"A phase\\", \\"Everyone thinks about if they had been born a girl\\", \\"A fetish\\", everything. I was numb, life sucked. The feelings never went away, and then when I was like 19 I started drinking. I drank heavily, I was a barely functional alcoholic - I managed to show up to work through my 20s, but I wouldn't say much else past that. People coming over to my apartment was just a reason to drink more. Because at least when i got drunk, the pain went away for a bit. During those years, I contemplated ending it all more times then I can count. Thankfully, I was too much of a coward to go through with it. In 2017 or so, I remember being in such bad spot that my ex told me to stop talking to her and go see a damn therapist with how suicidal I was. In 2018 I ugly cried to my one trans friend that I had no idea who I was, while completely shit faced of course. And then two years after that right before 2020, during my normal PTO during xmas/ny season I finally admitted it to myself. I stopped drinking outside of the occasional glass of wine or cocktail at a fancy dinner, and have been otherwise sober for 4 years. I still would not go on to meaningfully do anything about it until earlier this year when I finally started HRT - though I did see a therapist early on in 2020. The worst part of this all has been figuring out myself. To use a metaphor, it was like if I had been carefully weaving in little half truths and lies to a glass structure my entire life. Things society expected of me, things I was expected to do. And admitting this was taking a hammer to the entire thing, then sifting through the pieces left behind to try and figure out what's *real*. And despite all of this, despite all of the pain and what I did to my body with alcohol, I'm lucky. I'm *alive.*","title":"Trump pledged to roll back protections for transgender students.

Trump is descending into incoherence, and his policy proposals are both (a) diametrically opposed to a lot of Republican orthodoxy (destroy NATO, kill trade, explode the deficit) and (b) likely to be unpopular.  It doesn't help that half the Republican caucus quietly hates him.They're going to be desperate to make peace with him, because they know he commands the party base. But I don't think they want to cede total power to him (because they definitely don't), and I think they're nervous about what he'll try to do.  They also know Rick Scott is a cretin.Now that Trump's picked Gaetz, the Senate GOP will be forced into a showdown it badly wanted to avoid.

The operative clause, on the other hand, is the actionable part of the amendment (the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed).Well regulated does NOT mean government oversight. You must look at the definition at the time of ratification.The following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:1709: \\"If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations.\\"1714: \\"The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world.\\"1812: \\"The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial.\\"1848: \\"A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor.\\"1862: \\"It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding.\\"1894: \\"The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city.\\"The phrase \\"well-regulated\\" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it. This is confirmed by the Supreme Court.1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2C53.(a) The Amendments prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clauses text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2C22.(b) The prefatory clause comports with the Courts interpretation of the operative clause. The militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens militia would be preserved. Pp. 22C28.(c) The Courts interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28C30.(d) The Second Amendments drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30C32.(e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Courts conclusion. Pp. 32C47.assume the founders wanted individuals to have access to modern killing machines when the law was written around a militia of musketeers?That was the intent.\\"The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed.\\"\\n- Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Cartwright, 5 June 1824\\"The Constitution shall never be construed to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.\\"\\n- Samuel Adams, Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, 1788\\"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\\"\\n- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Constitution, Draft 1, 1776We have court cases going all the way back to 1822 with Bliss vs Commonwealth reaffirming our individual right to keep and bear arms.Here's an excerpt from that decision.If, therefore, the act in question imposes any restraint on the right, immaterial what appellation may be given to the act, whether it be an act regulating the manner of bearing arms or any other, the consequence, in reference to the constitution, is precisely the same, and its collision with that instrument equally obvious.And can there be entertained a reasonable doubt but the provisions of the act import a restraint on the right of the citizens to bear arms? The court apprehends not. **The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it**, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.Nunn v. Georgia (1846)The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!","title":"Trump-Appointed Judge Overturns Illinois Assault Weapons Ban"},{"text":" Specifically, from NY Dem Ritchie Torres who said, while his office did not receive any threatening calls, he was: \\"deeply troubled by reports of young people calling Congress, threatening to commit suicide or otherwise harm themselves\\"And it should be noted, Torres is probably one of the most pro-Israel politicians in government, to an absurd and unreasonable degree (one of those, \\"Israel can do no wrong, putting any conditions on them is wrong.\\")","title":"Trump expected to try to halt TikTok ban, allies say"},{"text":"Donald Trump got more and that doesn't count the massive amount of free advertising he got.

Real ID is technically required in 2025 for flying within the US or entering a federal building.  To get Real ID (government issued through the BMV with picture ) You must meet requirements that can be daunting for American citizens, birth or naturalized.  You must prove legal status in this country with birth certificate or passport.  \\nIdentity if your birth certificate or passport is not the same as your current legal name due to marriage divorce or adoption you must provide certified copies of marriage license divorce degree adoption papers. \\nSocial security card:  You must show a SSI card in the same name as your present name.  So if you got your SSI card as a child for example but want your photo ID in your married name you must take all the above listed documents to SSI  in person and get a new card issued.  \\nI did all this in 2006 so I know.  THEN you can go to the BMV for your official picture REAL ID. \\nGender:  If you were born a male but are now a female (or the opposite )medical records detailing the transition process must be presented to get REAL ID.  Only two genders. M/F. \\nResidency:  This is typically not as big a deal for most people, but it requires that you received official mail to the address you list as your residence for the previous three year period, Or your name on the lease or deed.  This might be a significant issue for younger people or persons who for financial or health reasons live with \\nfor relatives.Some people dont have easy access to a certified  copy of their original birth certificate for a variety of common reasons.  They were born in Idaho and now live in New Mexico.  \\nThe REAL ID requirements are particularly problematic for women who were born Jane Doe then got married and became Jane Smith or Jane Doe-Smith.  And trans people who will be required to produce medical records to some BMV counter worker at their license branch in bum fuck Egypt. In a RED state. A persons citizenship status will be on the Real ID or gold star ID.  Non citizens here in the US legally on temporary work permits/ visas or in the process of naturalization can get picture ID at the license branches as well if they have their INS documentation.  The Republicans (Trump) wanted to enact a rush bill to require proof of citizenship at the polls for this election.  It was defeated. It will definitely be in place by the midterms.  If states with abortion bans enact statutes criminalizing assisting a woman to travel to states without bans, stopping and or detaining persons and requiring photo identification could become legal even if no traffic laws were violated. But my guess is that stopping Black and Brown persons suspected of being deportable or detaining  non citizens will keep law enforcement busy.  Depending on how deportation plans are implemented, American citizens and non citizens here in the country legally at present at least will be caught up in the wide net without the proper documentation.  Most states require drivers to have their license with them at all times when driving and some states require that everyone carry some form of picture ID in public. Profiling by law enforcement will increase exponentially if mass deportations are carried out.  Its one thing to get a citation and your car impounded and possibly searched if you let your license expire or you dont have it on your person.  Its quite another to end up in a detention facility because you cant prove you are in the country legally.  It has already happened. It will continue to happen. It will have to happen to some Trump voters who obviously look American, to make anyone give a damn.","title":"Trump's Proposed 'Border Czar' Is A Little Too Psyched About Mass Deportation"},{"text":"Maybe we should storm the capital?","title":"Democratic Governors Form Coalition to Safeguard Democracy Ahead of Trump Term"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],j={key:0},W={key:1};function P(t,a,e,c,s,r){const m=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 public opinion 🥳")])],-1)),n("div",C,[(o(!0),i(b,null,T(r.visiblePoems,(l,p)=>(o(),k(m,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...l)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...l))},[s.isLoading?(o(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",j,"See more"))],8,N)):v("",!0)])}const F=u(H,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-bf05958f"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/64.md","filePath":"library/64.md"}'),B={name:"library/64.md"},J=Object.assign(B,{setup(t){return(a,e)=>(o(),i("div",null,[d(F)]))}});export{O as __pageData,J as default};
