Its easy for this message to ring true, and to join in demonizing these groups if you arent personally, emotionally close to any such people. If youre part of such a group and you cut that person out of your life, not only have you cut an emotional link that could be used to remind them of the very real human beings that are going to suffer, but youve also reinforced Trumps message (see, they hate you because you love America!) and driven them that much deeper into the echo chamber.

I feel like this is one of those moments in history where the iron is hot and now's a good time to try and reshape our politics, so good faith is in order.The biggest stumbling block liberals have in talking material policy to their base is their idea of 'the economy'.There is no 'economy'. There is AN economy for international capital markets, national capital markets, small bourgeois petite capitalist, and of course the workers. There are a lot of little discrete 'economies' that come directly at each other's expense. Propping up this monolithic misconception that there is one big 'economy' is disastrously blinding. Biden ripped his own base to shreds with his own messaging because it was 'the economy is great! Look at these graphs' while the people he was talking to were suffering under neoliberal austerity worse than ever.High rent is GREAT for 'the economy' because everyone who invests in real estate gets paid. It's radicalizingly bad for the worker's economy. Same for high corporate earnings, and all the other typical signs that clueless liberals bandy about as signs of a 'good economy'. The workers are dying out there, sometimes literally. And the single biggest contradiction in the Democrats messaging is that 'the economy is great actually' which, when it hits the ears of these workers, reads as 'your suffering is intentional, the system is working as we want it to, stop whining'.This is why American liberals need to move left or else. You NEED this sort of class conscious analysis to be able to read the moment. The bourgeois economy is doing fantastic, which means the proletarian economy is absolutely languishing. Working two jobs to support one kid while renting. It's not good, and as long as that's the case the Democrats will be eating shit.","title":"Maybe Joe Biden was right: he could've beaten Donald Trump"},{"text":"He is not the same person today as he was years ago.

Or most of these things are trumped up(heh) to try to assassinate his character which is a common democrat technique using the MSM.Unfortunately for them they lost to probably the only person who won't lose to that particular technique, it's honestly kind of funny how the democrats have managed to self sabotage themselves twice putting up the only candidates that trump can actually win against.They reamed Bernie in 2016 with the DNC and they lied to the people for 4 years with Biden until it was too late.Long story short there are things people value more than whatever it is you value and the democrats lost because they've lost their way.","title":"CMV: Cutting off family/friends over who they voted for is valid"},{"text":"What do they call it,  copium?","title":"Maybe Joe Biden was right: he could've beaten Donald Trump"},{"text":"This\\\\^  \\nNow that they know the punishment is coming, they want peace, how ironic.

Keep in mind, this is one of the biggest drawbacks of the US political system, the fact that you only have two main parties to vote for.In countries like mine, the Netherlands, we've got many parties running for office.

So many of you are reaching for explanations that somehow blames the wrong people. Why not blame the ones that actually made Trump win? How the fuck could I have done something different to change people from voting for fascism or not voting at all? Have you tried? Cause you didnt succeed. People have a drive for bad things. Ive been talking to people around me for decades about how were getting dangerously close to fascism. Some of them ended up voting for fascism anyway. They got scared of terrorists or simply just did their homework on sites we previously had laughed about.Ive tried all kinds of discussions - none worked. The rise of Neo fascism has been a global movement since internet. Historically were just reliving what German anti-fascists experienced as people started rooting for Hitler. Society changed in front of our eyes, our arguments was dismissed and here we are in the fucking zombie apocalypse, version 2, global try out. 90 years later.Why is it so hard for you (and others that blame the way democrats behave/talk/live) to understand that even stupid, lazy, evil and cowardly people got agency? Why do you feel the urge to blame people who do all in their power to *stop* fascism from spreading? Why is it so hard for you to get that people needed to stop fascism with their vote, and why did I/we need to explain and serve them properly?Sometimes, a lot of people want fascism. Now we got it almost everywhere on the planet, and the US is the main character. Ill fight it, but I wont fucking take any sort of responsibility for it. So fuck off.","title":"Democrats chose backing a genocide over defeating Trump"},{"text":"I wouldnt call it political views this time around, i call it morals.

And \\"almost starting a war\\" is a nothing burger statement.Crimea happened in 2014 and he took office in 2016. At the time the Crimean conflict was frozen there was no further will from Europe, NATO, or UN to try poking a \\"dormant conflict\\". You won't find a international law/political scientist giving their seal of approval to 100% that the independence referendum was faked because it's impossible to verify due to Russia distrust of international organizations to make sure the voting was done fairly. NATO reinforced the defence to the east of the alliance with the Forward Presence initiative but that wasn't enough due to the unwillingness of members to contribute significantly in terms of defence spending, as well as countries in the Northern Europe and Southern Europe having other more important issues at the time such as attacks on their soil and illegal immigration from the south.I think Donald Trump aided indirectly Ukraine by calling out NATO members not meeting the 2% defence spending. He wasn't the first to call out the members (Obama did) but he was the first to actually make it a public issue internationally and nationally constantly talking about it in rallies or speeches.NATO and Europe had genuine concerns when Trump threatened them to pull out from NATO if \\"members dont pay their share\\". Trump placed this issue on their minds 2-3 years before Russia full scale invasion. When Russia invasion happened we've seen a massive surge in defence spending and more countries now meet the 2% (albeit 1/3 of them still don't). This is a massive win for Trump and the secretary general of NATO Jens Stoltenberg pointed it out that he's glad these talks were in before the invasion actually occured or else the mobilization wouldn't of been so rapid and Europe so united. Europe realized how dependent they are on US for defence. They want to create their own defence iniatiative. And that is good for everyone specially for Europe since they have the largest and strongest alliance on earth. Trump shook the international order in a good way for Ukraine. And not many people give him credit. To assume that the president of United States has a duty to prevent Ukraine conflict in 2014 is a naive point of view considering the entire Europe including the international organisations did not want to go in a direct conflict with Russia. And here we are again 2 years later still dragging onto the war because no-one wants to participate in a hot war with Russia and we'd rather fund a proxy war when all the Western stockpiles are declining rapidly and weakening the West to other potential future issues like Taiwan for example.","title":"Trump is going to be a dictator"},{"text":"Both partys hold this view.

The reason most people who support abortion for women do so, is because we accept that the interests of the mother may actually override the interests of the child. Because of that, we accept the rights of women to have that choice (even if we recognise how difficult and unpleasant that choice may be), and we do so regardless of the circumstances.For men though, that is the opposite. We expect men to ALWAYS pay support the child (for the interests of the child). That is also regardless of the circumstances.That is the contradiction in how we the outcomes for men and women are treated differently, and that is what I was trying to get to. But, as I said, that post I linked to, addresses that for me but putting the rights in a hierarchy, and putting property (money) below all the other concerns (rather than putting maintenance lower because it typically men who pay it).Or allow a man/the state to force an abortion?That is an interesting one.

Gen X on the other hand voted exactly like I expected them to, which aligns with my personal observations interacting with them at work and in general. Many of them seem to have a difficult time with the current media landscape and are basically unable to recognize truth from fiction.\\nMillennials unfortunately aren't much better either. I'm sure many voted because of the financial struggles and inflation, but I still expected better of my generation to do more critical thinking. We voted the same way as boomers. Gen Z isn't far behind either, a lot of young people bought into the con. This is the most right that any young generation has voted in my memory.\\nWe are a very stupid nation, and I am slowly coming to accept that. My thinking is shifting towards how to best support my family and being here for them, rather than expect any kind of improvement out of my fellow Americans. I have the skills to move to most desirable places in the world if I choose to, and I am researching and keeping my options open.

Just and efficient structures that would genuinely replace this without merely becoming the same thing cannot flourish until the capital-nanny-state complex is abolished. The formation of an alliance that is ruthlessly, manifestly and narrowly focused on ending the capital-nanny-state alliance is the goal.  The ruthlessness required will be shocking, and we cannot afford to miss historically contingent targets of opportunity. Example: The police are about to be automated out of existence, but they have extraordinary labor power at this moment. If (and its a big if) their leadership can be trusted to merely act in their own strategic self interest, they can be enticed to join with the rest of whats left of labor and the state would lose the ability to stop sit-down strikes.  That's end-game level stuff. There was an attempt to do this in 1911, and the capital-nanny-state complex saw it for the threat it was and stamped it out harder than you can believe. But that would not be possible today because the police actually have power. It's a real opportunity, but overcoming the collective action barriers, like short term self interest, is almost insurmountable.

The current accessibility of mifepristone is not an intended application of the current abortion bans, theyre legal loopholes. As I stated, you can get mifepristone mailed, but you must do so from states where abortion is legal. Should abortion be illegal in the whole country, mifepristone would no longer be accessible in the states. Additionally, I have seen no one with any power in the matter suggest that theres a moral difference between mifepristone and surgical abortions. They are, broadly, upset about this loophole. Finally, mifepristone (as far as Im aware) works early in a pregnancy, but not after ten weeks. Should a pregnancy be no longer viable at that point, a surgical abortion is absolutely necessary, but current laws have led to the deaths of women who need this care.You are the only person Ive seen suggest that theres a moral distinction between mifepristone and surgical abortions.

We arent teams. Marriages failing everywhere. Media changing and Dems arent participating in the rise of internet mediums.I do have a controversial opinion about the immigrants we have let in these last 20 years and given citizenship to. Many of them come from authoritarian and deeply conservative countries. They came here solely for economic reasons, not for freedom. They came here with their concerns for Gaza and other conflicts, but they dont believe women are equal, LGBTQ people are sinners, and they lived under one authoritarian regime, at least in America they know they can be quiet while making money. They dont care about our institutions the way Americans used to because they dont truly appreciate our ancestors sacrifices to maintain these rules and customs. They think we are a weak people who dont appreciate what even we have in terms of standard of living. Why do we care so much about gay rights when we should be happy we can buy so much food? Why do we support abortion when it is a grave sin where they come from? Many of them are deeply religious and realistic. Theyre just hard working people who fucking LOVE family.

The TV show The Boys depicted a more extreme version of this literally 5 years ago [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZVAFPPMZY4)This shift has been subtly going on for years and we didn't know. Everyone thought Trump was wasting his time appealing to the PodBro audience, and that they are low-propensity voters, but the manosphere machine has been spending years priming them for action and this was the big show. Now we have multiple Limbaughs, Becks etc on various social media delivery platforms and it's honestly so frightening. I don't think it's too late to do something about it though. And yeah, you're absolutely right. Youtube (with History or Not) is a cesspool, and an efficient delivery mechanism for this kind of content.

People are having a HORRIBLE time finding help to do building and remodeling on their homes, and they are being price gouged really bad. So, I do a metric shit ton of work on older-folks homes who can't afford it. For instance, I met a couple today who got a quote for $1100 to do gutter cleaning on their home.. I'm going over there with 1 helper tomorrow and we are doing the whole thing for $500... We will both make $250 for the afternoon minus some gas and taxes. Who tf needs to make more than that off a little old couple for a few hrs work? I also do a lot of free work and write the materials off as donations when I am legally able. I do what I can, but I really want to get more involved with local groups. My dream is to build multifamily residential buildings and sell them for $50,000 personal profit per home, putting all proceeds over $200,000 a year into a non-profit to build homes for poor families for free.God that is all I want to do with my life. But the financial hurdles are soo fkin great.I wish you the best my friend.","title":"Joe Should Have Remained the 1 Term President He Ran As- With a real candidate from day 1, Trump would not have stood a chance.

In CA-13, John Duarte leads by 3200 votes and 52% reporting and in CA-47 Scott Baugh leads by 1200 votes and 73% reporting.\\nWe also should take a look at Alaska, where Mary Peltola trails by 10000 votes and 76% reporting.

Control over Federal Agencies and Media: Project 2025 proposes to dismantle or drastically alter the editorial independence of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. By seeking control over these independent media platforms, critics suggest that the project aims to transform them into government propaganda tools, which would eliminate their role in providing unbiased news both domestically and internationally. The plan to cut funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is also seen as an attempt to silence media that may critique government actions, resembling efforts in authoritarian states to suppress press freedom?.\\n2. Judicial System Influence: Project 2025 outlines efforts to reshape the federal judiciary to reflect conservative ideology. This approach is controversial because it would seek to entrench certain interpretations of law that may restrict civil liberties, such as reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ protections. For example, Project 2025 advocates for measures that could enable a national abortion ban, and push \\"personhood\\" language that would restrict abortion rights and some forms of contraception, echoing similar authoritarian approaches seen in countries like Poland??.\\n3. Expansion of Executive Power: The project aims to centralize more power within the executive branch, reducing the checks and balances that Congress and the judiciary typically provide.

But your point still stands. Tulsi was a fricken war heroes, congresswoman, person of color. She's insanely smart and demolished kamala. Yet as soon as she ran a threat to the DNC's chosen kamala, Hillary Clinton came out of the woodwork to label tulsi a fricken putin agent, just like her BS russiagate. Immediately the left turned on her and completely ostracized her from the party.?\\nTulsi was a rising star that was honestly the best shot for a female president. She's someone who deserved it. An American patriot corporal. A medic. A truly strong woman. A representative. A religious and ethnic minority. She's a true leader and the left completely eviscerated her for performing well. That's what's so gross, they try to force kamala as an empty suit for the dnc, under the guise of being for a woman of color, while they colure against the woman of color voters actually wanted by creating a disgusting hoax. All to circumvent the will of their own voters, having so little respect as to brainwash them against a fellow Democrat.\\nAnd overnight once given the memo left wing reddit turned on her so fast. The so called anti war party, massacring their rising stars reputation, labeling her a Russian agent, for daring to do nothing but not want a fucking war with Syria. A combat medic didn't want to see her brothers die for a foreign war and she was turned a pariah for it. Only because she dared to perform well.?\\nThey too thought they could gaslight their own voters on kamala Harris after installing her. Reddit hated her in 2020, and constantly hated on her as VP. Then boom she's the best thing ever. And they get deluded by their own propaganda where most thought she sucked for years, labeling her a DEI hire and a horrible VP that fails upwards, yet now have the audacity to assume over half the country is mysognist and racist for not voting her president.?I used to be a bleeding heart dem until the party clouded against bernie. Then what they did to tulsi and bernie again proved they didn't even respect the will of their own voter. Between that and the insane gaslighting they've done through the media and bots, I am now proudly on the right.? They've literally installed the primary winner of the past 3 elections with proven collusion for Hillary, collusion against bernie to get all of the party to back biden, and now kamala's coronation. As they scream that they're the party of democracy.?\\nPoliticians have always lied and overpromised stuff. What's truly terrifying about the modern left is that it doesn't just embelish shit, instead they ran their entire campaign on fucking gaslighting. I honestly feel they made tons of redditors trump voters with how they annihilated every apolitical sub with propaganda. They genuinely thought they could just gaslight their way to the youth vote via bots and the most pathetically pretentious smug hateful astroturfers. Hell eogan chose to officially endorse trump specifically because of seeing Obama continue to gaslight the fine people hoax.?\\nLike look at the whole identity politics platform. Look at all these lbgt, female, and minority left wing redditors genuinely believing they will be genocided having mental breakdowns. They're not freaking out because of any specific thing the right has done to hurt them, they're freaking out because the left wing apparatus has continuously brainwashed them nonstop that trump will genocide them. All their terror and fear, it's all because the left wing chose to divide America amongst race and gender, while terrorizing each group that the other will genocide them. So many well meaning emotional people who only care about everyone being kind to each other, have been radicalized into absolute hateful lunatics out of this belief they're stopping facism.\\nI honestly believe this past decade or so will be looked back at as an extreme hysteric era on par with mccarthyism, but lead by the left through the media. The astrotufing, the bots, the hysteria, the hate, the emotional extremism. This election was a tipping point, where now the mainstream left wing media echochamber is completely falling apart, and so many people are seeing the propaganda for what it is.\\nAll this division. All this hatred. All this fear. All this hysteria. All of this negative energy was intentionally created, harnessed, and multiplied, by the modern left, just for votes. I hope the lefties on reddit wake up, because they are the biggest victims here, sure it sucks to be a conservative on reddit, but atleast I have free will and am not brainwashed into this constant state of a hateful panic attack. Just because they were told to by Hilary Clinton, suddenly the whole left turned into Salem accusing tulsi of being a witch, even though they loved her the day before. That's terrifying, the behavior of the modern left is the one thing that got me to to truly understand and see how so many hateful and horrible historical movements were able to brainwash the masses into insanity and hatred they believed virtuous.?\\nThe lefts entire platform for the past 4 years has been dividing Americans and gaslighting them, and is why they've alienated any sensible adult that's not a left wing tribalist.

That means that about 80 million Americans are registered but with no party affiliation.A total of around 140.5 million votes were cast. So, non party affiliated voters swung this race. So technically, more voters chose Harris than are registered as Democrats. But, more voters, by about 3 and a half million over Harris, voted for Trump. Trump therefore got about 33.5 million non registered voters compared to Harris who got about 19 million non Dem registered votes.The swing voters, those fickle independents, are what swung the race. In 2020 everything that was going on was fresh and in the minds of those voters....4 years of stability and inflationary economic forces from the post pandemic snap leeched concern from the non aligned voters.It will probably result in a House switch to Dem, but that isn't going to do shit in the Senate.
