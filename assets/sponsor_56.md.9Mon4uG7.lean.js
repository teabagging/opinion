It's also useful to note that many people who report themselves as \\"undecided\\" are lying and already fully understand who they are going to vote for in a presidential election and are very unlikely to change on a whim.  \\n  \\nWhat is far more important in modern elections is voter turnout. \\nHere is why. Polls vary, but most polls show the candidates as having less than 100% combined. The number varies, but lets look at a reputable poll with the most options I could find (https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_ycklxBQ.pdf)  \\n  \\nAccording to that poll, ~5% are undecided. Now, there is no way that you are going to win ALL of those votes, so you'd be lucky to get 80% of the undecided, right? Thats a 4% increase in your votes. Sounds great? Maybe. Thats 6 million extra potential voters. With a 50% turnout, thats 3 million extra votes.  But that means that Trump gets the other 20% or 750k votes. So you really only got an edge of ~2.3 million votes \\n  \\nBut you know an easier way to get 3 million extra votes? Get higher turnout. If only 50% of voters turnout, do you know how much easier it is to get an additional 3 million people to show up? Stupid easy. These people already want to vote for you! You just need to convince them to show up at the polling place and spend an hour of their day voting. Thats ALL.  \\n   \\nedit: https://time.com/7086121/undecided-swing-voters-polls/\\nHere is a great article that points out that the whole idea of undecided voters is mostly bullshit\\nDon't believe me?  \\nIn the highly contentious 2000 Presidential election, 54% of eligible people voted. In 2020, it was 66.8%. Both the Democrats and the Republicans have figured out it is WAY easier to get higher turnout than to swing independents. That means that both parties gained nearly 13%. Do you know how hard it would be to get 6.5%(15.5 million votes) of voters to change from Republican to Democrat or Democrat to Republican? That would be EPIC. So instead, they just get higher turnout.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"This guy's lip reading is so good that his work is admissible in court.

People should be more concerned on how to win and make progress and not why they think they are right and others are wrong in politics. Also, I agree that the elitest attitude and dismissal of working class people is toxic lacking in fundamental principals for someone who believes themselves to be \\"liberal\\" or \\"progressive.\\" If you believe in left principals, you should believe in programs that support people with political views you object to. Regardless of race, class, or political views. Where I disagree:I think one key piece of context to that post is that in 2016, polling suggest a lot of undecided and swing voters avoided showing support for Trump in polling and publicly. Trump is a generally odius person who politically appeals to a lot of Americans so people support him privately. That is part of the joke with the meme that should be expressed even if you are generally right about swing voters.Also, people have been conditioned by the media to vote against one candidate instead of supporting a candidate. The whole \\"lesser of two evils\\" argument if you will. That is what the post you linked is doing and that is what the comments are doing. This is why conservative politicians base their campaigns on calling democrats communists. Both sides generally focus on misinformation or ad-hominem attacks in political campaigns in America and in both cases I think it is how the ruling class prevents any movements based on specific demands from our government. It's a \\"you get what you get from our party\\" policy on both sides that could only be broken by a massive grass roots organizing effort. My point here is that because of this dynamic in American politics, I don't think a meme like that will ultimately swing people either way. Uninformed voters will ultimately vote on personality, or a single issue, or against one candidate. Yes there are contrarians that may see that post and get turned off but I think at the end of the day, contrarians are probably most likely to just not vote. Maybe Harris loses votes that way but I doubt it would ever be enough to off set the apathy caused by Trump.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Alot of people don't understand that the dems absolutely need Philadelphia to turn out to win the state.

It is Trump's first lead in the model since September 19.The slight edge in the Electoral College probability means that in more simulations, Trump is winning enough battleground states to secure a majority of electoral votes, even though Harris may win the popular vote or a narrow majority of electoral votes in other simulations.A scenario in which no candidate reaches a majority in the Electoral College is also a slim possibility, with a 0.3 percent chance. The numbers are based on 40,000 simulations run by the model, reflecting a highly competitive race.The updated forecast shows momentum shifting in Trump's favor after several strong polling weeks in swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. These states, which were pivotal in Trump's 2016 victory and his loss to Joe Biden in 2020, are once again proving to be crucial in determining the outcome of the election.Yet, Silver cautions that the lead will continue to shift, likening it to a \\"110-109 basketball game in the final minutes of the fourth quarter.\\"Silver's model shows that Trump has gained 1.6 percentage points in Wisconsin, 0.9 points in Michigan and 0.4 points in Pennsylvania over the past week. While these changes may seem modest, Silver's analysis suggests they could be a positive sign for Trump as he seeks to close the gap with Harris.?Also, states like Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina remain highly competitive, according to Silver's model, with Trump leading by slim margins. Georgia and Arizona are leaning slightly toward Trump, while North Carolina is seen as a critical state that could swing in either direction?.Silver, known for his work with the poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight before launching the Silver Bulletin on Substack, called the race between Harris and Trump a \\"toss-up\\" in August. This came just weeks after he predicted in the same newsletter that Trump was certain to win against then-presumptive Democratic nominee President Joe Biden.Silver's popular vote forecast has shown Harris leading Trump by 1-2.5 percentage points for most of their campaign until now. In his presidential race model, Silver runs simulations using state-by-state polling data, factoring in the inherent uncertainty and variability of the polls.","title":"Donald Trump Surges Ahead of Kamala Harris in Nate Silver's Forecast"},{"text":"Everybody can see thru the trap questions that Bret asks.

Which is what you took offense with.I didn't take offense to anything. You were just wrong. FFS, you didn't even read your own links.Even in your justification you agree that you only highlighted a singular reason for the firing.I highlighted multiple reasons. If you were fired for no doing your job and sexual harassment, you were still fired for not doing your job. There are conflicting accounts and additional incentives at play that you're neglecting to highlight.Nothing further is necessary to highlight. Shokin wasn't fired because of anything to do with Biden's son because Shokin wasn't even investigating anything having to do with Hunter Biden's time at Burisma. He was threatening or firing anyone who tried to bring the case against Burisma. His office was taking bribes and harassing the anti-corruption agencies investigating his transgressions. I will add further context I didnt highlight previously: The entire Biden conspiracy resulted from misinformation and journalistic malpractice from The Hill, which led to the founder's resignation. Republicans and Russian propaganda amplified a multitude of falsehoods on the matter and, after years of investigating, Biden's political opponents came right out and said they have no evidence of wrongdoing. The firing of Viktor Shokin was universally popular among Democrats and Republicans at the time. The only people who opposed it were pro-Russian elements in Ukraine - probably because they approved of Shokin giving them cover to murder Ukrainians.Investigating a period of time before Hunter Biden joined the board of a company paying him 50k a month does have an implicit incentive in that the 50k goes away if they go under. That's best possible case.And the only person who cares about that is Hunter Biden, who doesn't need the money and is otherwise independently wealthy from partnering at multiple law firms and running two multinational hedge funds. There is no evidence anyone was ever concerned about Hunter losing that job, his father even advised him against taking it and probably wanted him out of there.Worst case - Burisma, knowing that Joe Biden handled Ukraine, paid Hunter Biden 50k a month as a way of influencing his father's actions. Biden then went on to get Shokin fired after he'd seized assets from Burisma's founder.Which has as much merit as unicorns existing. This is one of the most scrutinized issues of Bidens career and no one can find a drop of evidence to support it.","title":"CMV: The administration pressuring isreal to not attack iran so not to effect the election is eerily similar to what trump was first impeached for"},{"text":"Psst.

They don't have to take a blow to their ego to get this point if they are not directly interacting with someone in that moment.

Harris is actively courting reluctant voters, as is her campaign. She is hosting events like \\"Republicans for Harris\\", has celebrated endorsements from Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney, and other notable Republicans. Said she would have a Republican in her cabinet, and just went to Fox News for an interview. The Harris campaign is lazer focused on winning over undecided voters, but you can't expect them to be able to control how random people on the internet talk about politics. More to the central point, I don't think random internet posts are going to matter anymore than Trump literally saying \\"\\"[How Stupid are the people of Iowa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRUc11fPAwk)\\" and it didn't seem to cost him any votes in Iowa in 2016.

It can be assumed a significant portion of their non-white populations vote for the Democratic candidate. This is to say nothing of the fact that Republicans typically get ~90% of their vote from white voters in most elections anywhere in the country.Weve seen studies that the 41 GOP Senators it takes to sustain a filibuster come from states that represent just 17% of the population.

I have two daughters, and abortion bans matter.I am retired, and being able to get health care and pay for my drugs matters.  Trump and Vance are going after Obama  care and they also want to stop Medicare from being able to negotiate drug prices with drug companies, becasue they get huge campaign donations from the pharma industry.  Because of changes made by Biden, I now qualify for Medicare Extra help, and one prescription that was 400.00 pre month is now 12.50 for a two month supply.  Next year, drugs costs for everyone will be capped at 2000.00 per year, and up until last year I was paying far more than that.  EDIT this intervention saves Medicare literally  They expect to save 6 Billion dollars in 2026 when the whole thing goes into effect.  The current system is price gouging of the elderly and Medicare to the benefit of big pharma)Under Trump, the cost of living is going to go up because his economic policies are going to be pretty disasterous.  His tarriff is nothing other than a national sales tax, which is by far the least fair method of taxation, since everyone pays regardless of means.Additionally I am elderly, and I caregive for an elderly spouse, although I am ill myself I have managed reasonably well until about a year ago, when I began to hire home health aides, and get some assistance from the local department of aging.  I have also done a Medicaide spend down and have applied for a Medicaide waiver, so that medicaide with help with what appear to be almost insurmoutable upcoming expenses as Memory Care is really expensive, and no one can actually afford it.  Getting a medicaide waiver for most people is virtually impossible because it takes an attorney or at least someone with a colldge degree and good health to get though the application, which is set up so that only middle class educated people can get the benefit and poor uneducated people are excluded.Harris has proposed a home health Medicare benefit, which will make a huge difference for people who aren't as fortunate in managing their lives as I have been.  I can't begin to describe the situations I have run into in caregiver groups, it's hard to believe that in a wealthy propserous society we expect elderly isolated people who don't know how to use a computer to jump through the hoops that are required to get financial help.And not to mention what deporting people who are here on green cards will do to finding someone to work for me.  Both of the women that I have primarily depended on for help with my husband have green cards, one is from Nigeria, (oh and she's muslim) the other from Honduras.  It's hard enough to find someone to work in home health, and so far the only US citizens I have found willing to do so are pretty shady.This is without going into what will happen in my neighborhood, which is mixed honduran and working class white if mass deportations begins.Not to mention what Trumps suggestion that we should go to crypto will do to the USD.  And to you. if you live here, look at what happened in England when the pound crashed, and you better stock up on candles if Trump gets elected because pretty soon you won't be able pay your electric bill.I wasn't finished, this is just stopping the bull crap that Trump as proposed.What will happen with a 50K tax break for start up small business is that it will unleash the amazing potential of American entreprenuership, we will end up with start up's all over the place.  With the business I ran, if I had had that advantage it would have been generaltional wealth building, not just a Mom and Pop.  With more housing Yay, less homeless desperate people, lower crime.  With a crack down on fentynyl importation, which Trump has opposed by killing the bill, fewer overdose deaths and broken hearts.With a reasonable border policy, we can let in the people we want, and keep out the ones we don't want in.With a stable economy, and not a dude who plays fast and loose with his own bills, and the countries bills as well, we will be able to grow more, do more, acheive more, literally a coming golden age.  Just not quite as golden for the billionaires, who have plenty in the bank anyhow.For once, this isn't a vote for harm reduction, it's an open door!  It's ovbiously not going to be business as usual.  We need a new direction, and Kamala is pointing to one that's going to be better for everyone, not just D.

The only difference between an M1 Garand and an AR-15 is that one of them holds less rounds and fires a larger bullet.

Meanwhile handguns account for more than 50% of all murders by gun each year.Why would you want to ban something that would only reduce the death count by that little?

If those numbers hold up, another MP said they do not believe he can stay on.\\\\[...\\\\]The Prime Ministers Office is skeptical that the number of dissenting MPs has broken 20. A senior government official said they believe that only about a handful of MPs will come forward and, of that number, they said a few have already decided not to run for re-election. However, a second official said they believe that the total number of dissenters is more uncertain.The first official said they think the overwhelming majority of caucus does not feel that the public dissent aired in the past week has been helpful.Since Friday, The Globe has spoken with 26 Liberals, including 20 MPs. The vast majority of them denied any involvement in the campaign against the Prime Minister. However, skepticism about the credibility of this revolt has waned since the weekend. Just three days ago, the majority of Liberals who spoke to The Globe questioned whether this campaign would come to fruition when others have not.A significant number of the MPs told The Globe that they wish their colleagues had not aired their grievances in public because they believe it only helps the Conservatives and makes it look like the minority Liberals are in disarray. Several said they want Mr. Trudeau to stay at the top and that the public dissent has made them more determined that he remain.\\\\[...\\\\]However, \\\\[Sean Casey's\\\\] caucus colleague, Ontario MP Chandra Arya e-mailed Liberal MPs urging them to end the public dissent and saying that he believes a leadership race at this juncture would be disastrous.Unlike the Democrats south of the border, he noted, in the e-mail obtained by The Globe, that there is no natural successor waiting in the wings and foresees a vicious battle for leadership that will fracture the fragile party structure.He asked Liberals for more patience, arguing that positive economic indicators will leave Canadians more receptive to the Liberal message in the next election.Mr. Arya ended his e-mail reminding his colleagues of the story of the miner who quit when he was just three feet from gold and said if they give up now they will be handing the gold to the Conservatives.!ping Can","title":"Liberal MPs will present official demand for Trudeau to resign in coming days, sources say"},{"text":"Im fairness Obama also was a charasmatic bulldozer who WILL get to his point.Kamala is too.Joe could get distracted and change subject","title":"Bret Baier Describes Kamala Harris as Tough to Redirect like Obama"},{"text":"He has been able to do this his whole life and somehow fail upwards","title":"It's incredibly frustrating that one of the biggest threats to democracy in the last 100 years is a man who appears to be a buffoon in almost every conceivable way."},{"text":"How am I supposed to know if my precinct has Republican poll watchers?","title":"Fox Interview Did to Harris What the Debate Did to Biden"},{"text":"The said the same about Biden and the debate, at least on tv and online, until enough people said the truth","title":"Fox Interview Did to Harris What the Debate Did to Biden"},{"text":"Its alright you cant vote in PR anyway","title":"Kamala Harris pledges break from Biden presidency in testy Fox News interview"},{"text":"They will have this disaster completely turned around by March 1 2024. /s","title":"Voters wont thank Kamala Harris for the state of the economy | Why voters are down on Americas remarkable economy"},{"text":"Part of me hopes he did actually say this so I can say I agreed with him on something.

I love learning and healthy debates and these are great questions1. Students are not taking these debts on willingly. Its amazing banks wont provide them housing loans, but will provide them these! If i had to bet, im pretty sure most people wouldnt go to college if they could get a loan for a house right out of high school.  Those would be loans taken willingly.  Most would find a job and opportunity cost between school and working right after school would be closer. But alas, they dont hand out those home loans. Most people need school to get a decent paying job to then get a home loan.  2.  Ur ferrari doesnt provide anything to society.  Whereas i will get a doctor out of college.  We could get a biochemist to cure cancer.  Id rather my taxes pay for free school (public education anyone?) than ur personal credit cards and spending sprees.  College isnt fun its moving society forward.  Drs, lawyers, teachers, international diplomats, chemists, botanists, economists etc come from college. Not ur credit card.  These Loans are taken to assist people to eliminate the economic barrier college imposed. Its no longer for the elite / classist.  Now anyone with a drive for higher education can go.  Which is how3.  Thats equitable for everyone.  We all benefit with smarter people in society.  Instead of idiots going out into the world who need to be Bailed out and PPP loans (free money!) we are producing people who are smarter and have less chances of causing us financial issues. Like 2008 fiasco we dont want repeated.  Or engineers who will help get us better ferraris. School should be free.  We should all want free school.  We should all want educated people in our society.  People that paid should be happy; I mean my grandparents died from polio, u dont see me not taking the vaccine and the older generations mad because they didnt have it. When cancer cure comes out, im sure people who had loved ones die from it arent going to be upset.In todays society, and we can see this, they are actively even making public school become something paid for.  The movie idiocracy is enough to want people smart.  School lunch should be free.  Anything that makes society better we should all want to pay for.  I would gladly pay $10 more in taxes for clean water / lead to be removed, which helps society as a whole, even tho i can afford bottled. But the smarter people are, the less they can be controlled.  Hence why the working class is fighting over something that should be free.  They have the working class fighting amongst themselves, instead of rightfully the people causing the distress.Ur taxes cover it, they have just been misappropriated quite frankly.","title":"Biden Has Now Canceled Student Debt for Over 1 Million Borrowers"},{"text":"The liberal would prefer to whine about injustices and get mad that not everyone inherently agrees with them than actually provide workable solutions that helps them win elections","title":"Democrats are nervous  and Kamala Harris may be OK with that"},{"text":"RIP Ukraine if Trump wins.

These roles range from tutors, mentors, student success coaches, postsecondary transition coaches, and wraparound/integrated student support coordinators. As of the end of the 2023-2024 school year, an additional 320,000 adults have stepped into these roles in schools, exceeding the Presidents goal and doing so a year early.  \\n...  \\nToday, researchers from the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University released a report analyzing RAND survey data that shows that during the 2023-24 school year, 136,000 adults stepped up to provide tutoring, mentoring, college and career advising, student success coaching in school settings. This finding builds on the 187,000 adults who stepped into these roles in the 2022-2023 school year. Over the past two years, schools, institutions of higher education, youth-serving organizations, and other community groups have worked together to successfully meet and exceed the Administration's challenge well before the summer 2025 deadline. NPSS is a public private partnership between the Department, AmeriCorps and the Everyone Graduates Center at the Johns Hopkins University, and was launched in 2022 to meet the Presidents goal and respond to his 2022 State of the Union call to action for more Americans to step into these critical roles to support students recovery from the impacts of the pandemic. In support of this goal, the NPSS organized a national network of more than 200 youth-serving and education government and non-profit organizations, 200 school districts, and 50 institutions of higher education that support students in school and during out of school time and work together to enable more adults to provide NPSS-aligned evidence-based student supports. Todays announcement marks a key milestone in supporting students overall wellbeing, academic recovery, and transition into postsecondary education through evidence-based, high-impact student supports. To continue this momentum, the NPSS is announcing additional efforts by the NPSS Support Hub and its technical assistance providers:* With support from the Leon Lowenstein Foundation, the NPSS Support Hub at the Johns Hopkins Everyone Graduates Center is announcing today a third community collaboration challenge microgrant cycle to support youth-serving nonprofits, districts, state and local government, and intermediaries to bring more people-powered and evidence-based support to children and youth in their communities. These $5,000 to $10,000 grants will support the creation, scale, and piloting of evidence-based and people-powered student supports in communities across the country. Applications are now open and are due Nov. 15. \\n* The National Student Support Accelerator launched a new tool today that school districts can use to evaluate their own tutoring programs for alignment with evidence-based practice and build internal plans for improvement with support from expert technical assistance. \\n* City Year recently published a Student Success Coaching Playbook for school districts and youth-serving organizations looking to implement success coaching models beyond the City Year context. \\n* The NPSS Support Hub will also publish a training resource library with resources to support training of people in evidence-based student support roles, including new training materials developed by MENTOR....Statement from Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden:Since Day One, President Biden and Vice President Harris have been laser focused on ensuring the academic success of every student, said Tanden. Thats why C after passing the American Rescue Plan, the largest one-time investment in public education in history C in his 2022 State of the Union Address, President Biden issued a call to action for 250,000 Americans to step forward and support students as tutors, mentors, coaches and support staff to accelerate the academic achievement for every child in school. Were proud that hundreds of thousands of Americans have answered President Bidens call C exceeding our goal and on a faster timeline. Now as a result, more than 320,000 new tutors, mentors, coaches and support staff are directly making a positive impact in our communities and closing academic recovery gaps. President Bidens National Partnership for Student Success represents the very best of what the American people can do, when we work with each other, for each other.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Exceeds Goal of Recruiting 250,000 New Tutors, Mentors, and Student Success and Postsecondary Transition Coaches Across the Country"},{"text":"Well, skip it then, it actually deals with Harris like she's a credible candidate, not just someone who's there to be blown off.

Its based on absolutely nothing valid, and they could read an entire book written by a guy trump hired to find fraud that explains how there was no fraud. But it just doesnt matter. Its so aggravating to know that the majority of the country has rejected this too. Trump has lost both his elections, and will lose this one, in terms of popular vote. He has never had an approval rating above 49 percent. But the way the system is set up allows for this slight minority to have control. Its all so damn discouraging. Its also really pretty lame.

I remember reading about propaganda in history class. Its not that I didnt think I could potentially witness it in my country, but I just couldnt imagine it would look like this.

Shokin was furious that he was being scrutinized by anti-corruption agencies and retaliated. Shokin's office [was found](https://web.archive.org/web/20191003135343/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/world/europe/political-stability-in-the-balance-as-ukraine-ousts-top-prosecutor.html) with troves of diamonds, cash and other valuables they had no business having.From the same NYT article:But the case became bogged down, with no reasons given. When a department in Mr. Shokins office tried to bring it to trial, the prosecutors were fired or resigned. The perpetrators seemed destined to get off with claims that the stones were not worth very much.Shokin literally fired the people trying to take the Burisma case to trial. It continues:Since his appointment a year ago, Mr. Shokin had been criticized for not prosecuting officials, businessmen and members of Parliament for their roles in corrupt schemes during the government of former President Viktor F. Yanukovych. He also did not press cases for sniping by the police and opposition activists during the street protests in 2014 that killed more than 100 people and wounded about 1,000.Shokin was literally defending the murder of protestors by pro-Russian forces.Either way - Funding was tied to specific actions being taken. That's the literal definition of quid pro quo which would be the same standard used for Trump's first impeachment.That wasn't the standard, that was the buzzword the MSM broadcast to you and you didn't give it another thought.The problems with Trump's acts were twofold:1. He demanded a foreign government aid his political campaign by making fake announcements about his opponent on CNN.2. He broke the law by withholding Congressional appropriations to obtain election assistance from a foreign government.It is both unlawful to solicit campaign assistance from foreign governments and to withhold funds held by congress without a waiver under the ICA.Me buying a sandwich is a Quid Pro Quo. That isn't unlawful. Nothing Biden did was unlawful. He ordered a sandwich. He was exercising US foreign policy. Trump was not.

I'm going to ignore it, because it's an appeal to remember propaganda.\\n I oppose the Trail of Tears, but I do not call for the dissolution of the United States\\nLet's dig into this.\\nIs it *only* the Trail of Tears, specifically, that you oppose? Was everything else done to displace Native Americans at the time, okay? For example, the dehumanization (treating \\"Indians\\" as a natural threat like wild animals), repeated broken treaties, use of Native American body parts in jewelry and the like - all okay? And just the trail of tears was bad?\\nIf so - that's honestly pretty messed up, and there's not much I can do to convince you.\\nIf not, and you think those things were bad too - these were traits *fundamental* to the founding of the nation. A \\"United States\\" *COULD NOT EXIST**, by its defining traits, if this dispossession did not happen.\\nThe question therefore becomes:\\nIf you were alive during Native American dispossession, would you have supported the existence of the US? You can't really be \\"not against the US, but against it's actions\\", because the formation of a British colony, and subsequent American expansion, was only enabled by conquest.\\nIf you would be okay with the US genociding native Americans - are you *really* opposed to the Trail of Tears? If you wouldn't - are you *really* okay with the US existing??\\nNow that hundreds of years have passed - it is easy to see the injustice, but accept the unjust status quo, where Native Americans are treated awfully, out of sight. But, if you had the chance, in that moment in time, what would you do?\\nThe same applies to Israel. By specifically being, from its inception, a colonial endeavor designed for *one specific kind of people*, it's existence, as a state, necessitates violent displacement of the Palestinians, because otherwise it's desired ethic majority could not be maintained. Its own founders haven't been quiet about this either.\\n*Most* people who call for the end of the state of Israel don't literally want to murder every Israeli. They want a single nation, that does not specifically legislate in favor of Jews, and does not enact policies specifically to maintain an ethnic majority.?\\nThey acknowledge that these traits are defining to Israel, and therefore, if they're enacted, Israel cannot exist.?\\nJust like how Native American conquest was key to the formation of the US - where it could not be disentangled from the US's defining traits, Palestinian conquest cannot be disentangled from Israel's defining traits.\\nPeople see the Trail of Tears happening, right now. Instead of the skulls of Native Americans, they see soldiers waltzing around with Palestinian women's lingerie. Instead of being called wild animals, they see Palestinians being called \\"children of darkness\\".?\\nYou can't have it both ways. Either:\\n1) You meaningfully WOULD oppose the Trail of Tears, and therefore would oppose the formation of the US. Its therefore consistent to be against Israel's existence as an ethnostate for Jews.\\n2) You would NOT oppose the Trail of Tears, in any sort of meaningful way. Therefore, a modern repetition is okay.\\nBut, pretending you are would be against the trail of tears, without opposing fundamental principles of the US is naive at best, and deceptive, at worst.","title":"CMV: If you oppose Israel's right to exist, you are indirectly supporting the Axis of Iran-Russia-China-North Korea"},{"text":"Theres a great German movie called Look Whos Back.

For Democrats trying to sell Americas economic success, the temptation must be strong. As our special report explains, the countrys economy is one of the strongest in the world. Americans are richer than at the start of President Joe Bidens term. Yet they struggle to believe it: in weekly polling conducted by YouGov since mid-2021, almost twice as many say the economy is getting worse as say its getting better.\\nIt is hard to judge what this will mean come November 5th. Historical examples do not shed light on the divergence between economic perceptions and reality, nor on the unique circumstance of a former president running for re-election while the incumbent is sidelined. Vice-President Kamala Harris is leading in national polls despite poor ratings on the economy. But if grumbling is the new normal, the economy could yet cost her the election.\\nDuring the covid-19 pandemic, economic optimism came untied from the macroeconomic indicators which reliably predicted it in preceding decades. The University of Michigan recorded its lowest-ever index of consumer sentimenta long-running measure of how consumers feel about the economyin June 2022, despite the economy looking healthy by most objective measures. The vibecession left economists and politicians scratching their heads.\\nAlthough sentiment has improved since then, Americans still underestimate the strength of their economy. This month, YouGov found that 39% of respondents incorrectly believed the country was in recession (only 36% said it was not). The media, which increasingly emphasise negative economic news, deserve some blame for this. But although Democrats can correctly say voters are wrong about Mr Bidens economic record, it is cold comfort for Ms Harris: a recent poll by Ipsos found that Donald Trump had an eight-percentage-point lead over her on the question of whom voters would trust more to handle the economy.\\nA more optimistic pointer for Democrats is the partisan divide in consumer sentiment (see chart). While both parties supporters tend to feel more positive when they control the White House, Republicans cheer louder and boo louder, in the words of Ryan Cummings and Neale Mahoney, two economists. They find that this asymmetry explains around 30% of the gap between expected and observed consumer sentiment since Mr Biden took office. If economic negativity is partly confined to Republican partisans, the electoral cost could be smaller than it appears.\\nMs Harris is also somewhat insulated by running as a non-incumbent. Despite her role in Mr Bidens administration, the vice-presidents campaign has cast her as an advocate of change, not continuity. In the fundamentals model that underpins The Economists presidential forecast, we find that economic indicators predict the election chances of incumbent presidents but not other candidates from the incumbent party. When Mr Biden dropped out of the election, the economy also dropped out of our forecast.\\nThese factors could explain why Ms Harris is outperforming historical incumbent-party candidates with similar economic conditions. Lenny Bronner, a data scientist at the Washington Post, found that this years employment growth points to a two-percentage-point popular-vote victory. John Sides, a political scientist, found the same for gdp growth. In our polling average, Ms Harris leads by 3.2 points. Voters march to the beat of their own drum. And so it is that many spend more than everand say they will vote for Ms Harriswhile professing deep economic pessimism.","title":"Voters wont thank Kamala Harris for the state of the economy | Why voters are down on Americas remarkable economy"},{"text":"I wonder how much 08 and 12 was just Obamas insane charisma and effectiveness stemming the tide of a trend that was already well underway.","title":"The Democrats pro-union strategy has been a bust"},{"text":"And then getting the T Ball stand, and after that giving Trump the answers that he refuses to read because a woman gave it to him.","title":"Bret Baier Describes Kamala Harris as Tough to Redirect like Obama"},{"text":"Of course a Jeff Bezos flair would say this.","title":"The Democrats pro-union strategy has been a bust"},{"text":"Yea, the suburban and urban gold mine is what brought Biden/Harris to the dance.","title":"Philly officials criticize Kamala Harris campaign for overlooking their role in winning Pennsylvania: Theyll blame us if we lose"},{"text":"They believe that fascism will be to their benefit.

The other side is the side who's against genocide.  Neither the Democratic party nor the Republican party are against genocide.  Thus voters are looking for a way to get the other side, the side against genocide, more power in our government.Sometimes the only way to do that is by changing an existing party's power structure.  Sometimes that necessitates those in power in that party lose, forcing changes in the party if they wish to win in the future.It's weird that consistent voting for the \\"best version of the world we can\\"... aka status quo voting... has lead us into our \\"liberal\\" party supporting a genocide, don't you think?Remember, this is the same party that pulled some incredibly reprehensible and unethical tactics out against Bernie Sanders....twice!  Turns out, Democrats didn't fear the Republicans all that much... but they were absolutely terrified of a Progressive winning the White House.And that makes a lot of sense.  Outside of a few social policies, where exactly do we see major differences between Republicans and Democrats?  They often spout rhetoric about taxes and who should be taxed... but every single term, regardless of who is in power, it seems more power and wealth goes to those who already have the most power and wealth.Remember when the Democrats were against Citizens United and SuperPACs?  That was until the SuperPACs started funding their campaigns to a far higher degree than they funded Republicans.  Now you'll almost never hear Democrats talking about Citizens United.  They took the money.  They accepted the influence of the lobbyists.Tell me... if this is a Democratic administration, the good guys... so set on world peace... why are we up near a record military budget?Universal healthcare as the Democrats call it, or the ACA (Obamacare), essentially just means everyone has to buy overpriced insurance.  Limits on how much money insurance companies can profit and how much must go to healthcare sounds like a reasonable policy, until the insurance/healthcare companies realize they can simply increase service and drug prices.

Why do we need Fox to push her on immigration when it's basically the one topic even the democrat media has pushed her on already? The value of a Fox interview in the so called \\"lions den\\" is to push back against other issues the anti-Trump media won't touch... the biggest and most obvious of those is TRUMP himself and their entire fake narrative around him.

If I were a betting man, I'd say that there are more Harris-leaning independents than Trump-leaning independents. Being a Trumper and being a Republican also seem to be more of an identity thing than being a Democrat or being a Harris supporter is, so there might be a cultural/identity part of registering as an R compared to registering as a D/independent.Regardless, Dems seem to have been winning Bucks in most statewide races recently anyway, so I'm not particularly worried about losing Bucks.

Union PACs remain the only PAC money that rivals corporate PACs which overwhelmingly donate to Republican candidates, and those dollars are coming from voluntary contributions from the members, not any dues money from the unions.  I live in Maryland, but my kids and I are spending this weekend in Pennsylvania knocking on doors of union households because my union is pretty involved politically, and the unions in Pennsylvania (and all of the swing states) tend to have the most reliable and largest volunteer network of canvassers (who arent always just focused on other union households, thats just the strategy for where Ill be this weekend). Whether its at the door or on the phones, when I lead with how Kamala Harris helped save my retirement, its gotten a great response from voters (especially union voters). In conclusion, I know this sub doesnt like unions, and union members arent necessarily immune to some awful societal forces at play (xenophobia, racism, homophobia, etc.). But the labor movement is growing and its growing among a more diverse group of workers who are naturally more aligned with liberal democratic goals.  I get just as frustrated with the unions who oppose modernization and free trade, but even those unions are trying to expand healthcare access and raise the living standards for their communities, not just their members.  Im looking forward to being with dozens of my fellow union members knocking on doors in the most important swing state, and our unions are helping to make it possible.","title":"The Democrats pro-union strategy has been a bust"},{"text":"It was just gotcha journalism by Faux News.

They thought only others would suffer.  And they were wrong.Im not happy that Roe fell.  But the damage could have been worse, and without the political awakening that Dobbs had caused.  Im not going to kid myself and think its a total epiphany- too many feminists still eat at chick-fil-a.  Their ability to think outside their own immediate interests has its limits.

It was shocking to see wild eyed hosts ranting and raving about democrats and anyone who wasnt a very specific type of American. I also remember Laura Ingraham blatantly lying about something, which just blew my mind. To top it all off a lot of republicans now think fox is too liberal or controlled opposition. This is because their news division was honest about the election results as they rolled in in 2020. Specifically with Arizona. So theyve moved on to newsmax and OAN.

When Trump entered office, they immediately reneged on the deal.By contrast, when Trump struck a deal with the Taliban for a withdrawal from Afghanistan by X date, individual Democrats griped about how dumb it was, but there was no \\"This deal won't be honored\\" threat.

I fully agree with the part that she's let Trump set the narrative instead of setting her own course.

When some polls showed her weak with Black men, she almost the next day touted loans for them, basically just offering them money. When some polls showed they wanted her to break from Biden, she sort of did it in the Fox News interview, again just days later. It might seem responsive, but it also comes off as insincere, like she'll flip her rhetoric again based on the next poll. She doesn't have a clear, defined direction for her campaign. In the meantime, she doesn't dispel or push back on GOP narratives enough, such as on immigrants or inflation.Yes, she's basically geared her entire campaign toward never-Trump Republicans. It's disappointing if you're a Democrat, and I don't think it's as necessary as she thinks. Weaknesses with Latinos or Black voters signal that shoring up the Democratic base is still important.

Nothing that Trump didn't get in 2020 or now.I guess people got so used to the light interviews she was given before that they can't recognize it.Your position is that the Harris team should have bent over backwards to give Fox News more than what they were asking for. Why does Trump get the benefit of the doubt when he says he's too busy campaigning to sit down for interviews, but Harris has to give them everything they want and more?I'm not giving any credit to Trump. If Harris wants the benefit of a decent interview, which yesterday wasn't, then alloting the right amount of time is important.

That's the deciding point here.Again, this sounds like a failure by the interview. Do you expect Harris to interview herself? Do you expect her to be interviewed by the nagging voice in your head?

Ask Bill Clinton.She's stated her positions many many times across plenty of interviews since she's become the candidate.

Israel is important for the millions of jews that were exiled from the middle east to exist in, because where else are arabic speaking jews supposed to live? Certainly not in Egypt or Syria anymore.Its worth mentioning here the the expulsion of Jews from these countries was a response to Zionism. But whats even more relevant is that the Palestinian people were not responsible for this either and its not reasonable to expect them to give up their land because of it. The stakes are different for Israel and Palestine. Worst comes to worst and Palestinians get ethnically cleansed, palestinian arabs can live in the rest of the 99.8% of the middle east.

It isnt like US troops will be manning the missiles. This is purely just more Russian propaganda, there is no actual line amongst the world where if you give missiles over a certain range then its war.Most of those tax dollars go to US companies to build new equipment to replace the older weapons we give Ukraine, and its done at a profit as the military was going to replace most of the aging ammunition and equipment anyways and it cost money to dispose of ordinance.

While monetary contributions are a part of the military aid packages, a lot of the aid we provide is in the form of soon to be expiring munitions.When we purchase missiles and arms from our contractors like Raytheon and Lockheed, they come with an expiration date. If they are not used by that date, they need to be disposed of, which costs us money. We also have a minimum requirement for quantity of arms that the US needs to maintain at all times. So we cant just throw them out without buying new ones so when they expire, we have to pay to get rid of them and also buy new ones.When we provide Ukraine these munitions, we are not having to pay to dispose of them, we get real world data on how our weapons perform, and we are also creating space for us to buy the latest and greatest tech from our military contractors which stimulates the economy.If we were to give this kind of aid to FEMA, wed be giving the people of North Carolina expiring missiles, and I dont think that would be much help.","title":"Biden announces additional 425 million in military aid to Ukraine."},{"text":"Not pump them full of weapons, for starters.

You concoct a straw man argument, which is a logical fallacy, wherein you attribute a claim to me which I never made, which is that I supposedly base my assessment of extremism on a single data point. Let me simplify for you what I just said: you're a liar. Now, you're welcome to browse my subreddit where I've written an article about MAGA and extremism, so no, while releated anecdotal evidence such as this is bad enough, the data is also damning.On top of that, Trump himself is a fascist, his ideology is fascist, which makes the entire MAGA movement fascist. Leading academic experts on fascism such as Robert Paxton, who were initially wary of labeling Trump as such have changed their minds after J6. Even Paxton now concedes Trump is fascist and MAGA is a fascist movement. this is representative of an infintismal [sic] portion of his voter base. False. Already debunked 10 times, with credible sources, in my subreddit. Not even going to attempt to link it, because all subreddits remove links to other subreddits these days anyway.

This **entire thread** is choc full of comments claiming these are \\"feds\\" and \\"antifascist\\" like a bunch of brainwashed lemmings. To condemn these people requires condemning them on moral and ideological grounds. Not waving it off by pretending they are \\"antifascist\\" (contradictio in terminis) or \\"federal agents\\".

It's impossible to summarize all the valid reasons for opposing the partition plan in a reddit post, so here's the general outline:?\\n- The plan allocated not just a disproportionately high area of land to the proposed jewish state, but also the most fertile and economically most important areas. An entire section of the plan was dedicated to solving the problem that the proposed Arab state wouldn't have been \\"viable\\" without economic aid from the outside?\\n- The proposed jewish state would have had a population that was almost 50% Palestinian Arab, and the plan left loopholes for dispossession (allowing the state to dispossess people if the land would be used for \\"public\\" purposes), making the Nakba a plausible?fear from day 1?\\n- IMO most importantly, there were two main proposals coming from the population: Palestinians, near-universally, advocated for one state in the area. The yishuv was split between a larger group wanting partition and a big minority aiming for a binational state. The UNSCOP then came up with two possible plans: The federation plan (so, a compromise between those who wanted one state and those who wanted two), and the partition plan (so, an uncompromising agreement to a position that was so deeply unpopular in a majority of the population that it was never going to be realized without the use of brute force).?\\nI'm shocked every time that only 22% voted for the former?\\n Israel, and Jews in general, have faced historical opposition that predates current conflicts.??\\nAnd those who opposed the latter were some of the strongest advocates for the state of Israel, so it seems weird conflating the two. Take Balfour, who advocated for a jewish state so he could finally send british jews away?\\n Here's the bottom line: Israel, whether you like it or not, agree with its policies or not, is still a liberal democracy.\\n?Counterpoint: Israel currently rules over a territory where 15.3 million people live. 9.9 million of those are citizens of Israel and eligible to vote. 5.4 million others are denied that possibility due to geography (e.g. Palestinians in Israel have citizenship and can vote, Palestinians in the WB can't) and ethnicity (e.g. Jewish settlers in the WB are citizens and can vote, Palestinians in the same territory can't). This can't be explained away by the idea that people in occupied or annexed territory can't vote because they might some day live in some other state (that explanation wouldn't fly for officially annexed territory anyway), because settlers in those areas *can* vote.?\\nFact is: Israel rules over 15.3 million people. 65% of those people are citizens and can vote; Over a third?can't, largely due to ethnicity. Call me unimaginative, but I'm having difficulty characterizing that as a \\"liberal democracy\\" without some serious mental gymnastics?\\n I can criticize policies without denying a nation's right to exist [...] See the difference??\\nYes; the events you cite were already so successful at eliminating the native that you can, today, imagine a world in which the colonizer country could have existed peacefully alongside the colonized. At least, as long as you don't think too hard about it.?\\nNeither the US nor Canada would exist today if they hadn't destroyed the societies that were there before them; whether through genocide, cultural genocide, or expulsion. At the time, you really *couldn't* have \\"opposed [actions like] the Trail of Tears without [opposing] the USA\\", because the USA wouldn't exist without events like that.

During Trumps term, Betsy DeVos allowed the EDMC (parent company of the Art Institutes), to sell some of their schools to a company that owned a Mega Church with ZERO experience in the for profit school sector. This church tried to acquire ITT during the Obama admin, but was shut down due to having no experience. The Trump admin saw no issue with this. Flash forward about 2 years later and the school falls into a receivership and was taken over. They robbed students from their stipends by not issuing them out, they lost accreditation to some of the schools and did not disclose this and illegally collected Student loans (Title IV AKA student loan funding states the school MUST be accredited to receive loans). During this time some of those students graduated, but without that accreditation their degree is literally worthless. Needless to day the forced closure of the school also caused many students to be unable to complete their degree's and due to the issues with all that was happening, 99% of their credits cannot transfer to other colleges, so they had to start out all over again at square one and requesting even more loans.At the end of the day, there was many students, former students stuck left paying for college loans for a college that does not even exist anymore and some of those students with worthless degrees. It's not like when a school gets closed down for running a scam, the victims are automatically forgiven, they are expected to still pay on the loans. When Biden forgave that loan, it did not come out of the tax payers pockets to pay off the loans. These are federal loans that were already sent to the school that already came out of our taxes (who knows what that school did with that). Biden simply eliminated the debt itself. TLDR: Trump and DeVos allowed a for profit school to be taken over by a church, who proceeded to rob the students of their money that during the Biden administration was finally forgiven.","title":"Biden Has Now Canceled Student Debt for Over 1 Million Borrowers"},{"text":"Why does Dear Leader not debate, go on MSNBC for an interview, or sit for a 60 Minutes interview?
