Womp womp! ??"},{"text":"While you are right that liberalism is open to constant, easy assault from illiberal ideologies, it yet persists in many forms across many nations, and even resurges after periods of suppression.  Just looking at immigration as one topic, nativism has risen and fallen in the US many times over the years, with the first big wave being the Know Nothing Party in the 1850s responding to Irish Catholic immigrants.  Then in the 1890s, the American Protective Association (partially composed of recent Protestant immigrants) opposed various European Catholic immigrants.  Of course there was also the anti-Chinese and anti-Japanese immigration laws of 1882 and 1913 (in California) respectively.  And between these waves have been resurgences of liberalism to varying degrees.  \\n  \\nThough my knowledge of French history is limited, as I understand it liberalism went through many rapid waves in French history from the French Revolution of 1789 to a republic, then empire, then monarchy, then republic, then empire, then republic, then ww 1+2, then republic once again.My theory in response to your well-considered idea is that we might consider political ideology as an heightmap of ideas/ideologies and the relative power it grants each person.  I'll simplify it down to two persons, the liberal, and the autocrat, just a pair of 2-dimensional surface in 3-dimensions, or a series of peaks, trenches and plains.If the autocrat started at the (ideological neutral) origin and looked out across the plane of ideas, they might see several sharp peaks, several deep troughs, and some softly curving hills and plains.  When the liberal looks across the same \\"landscape\\" they might see no peak quite as high; the liberal rejects raw strength as you put it.  They might see no trough quite as deep, since the liberal remains flexible to new ideas that might arise from unexpected depths.  However, where the autocrat saw a sharp peak, the liberal would see a trough since the autocrat's power comes at the expense of liberalism.It would seem that a power-maximizing agent would lead a society to those high peaks since the lower peaks of liberalism could not compete with the much higher peaks of autocracy.  But when you combine the graphs of the entire society, all liberals, autocrats, and those in-between together, then the solution becomes trickier.  It seems like it should mostly depend on the degree of autocrat's maxima, the liberal's local trough negative value, and the numbers of each kind of agent.  But lets throw in one more detail that brings us back to a more realistic example.  In mathematics, if you see a high peak, that doesn't mean it's the highest peak available.  The \\"local maxima\\" isn't necessarily the \\"global maxima.\\"  Lets take those \\"inbetweeners\\" and say that they perceive the same high peak as the autocrat; the ideas that the autocrat proposes seem very promising.  What they don't realize is that just like a volcano's crater, that high mountain peak is actually hollow and that the center point that the autocrat is pulling them toward is actually a local minima.  But by the time they realize it, their local maxima has been summitted, and the pressures from other autocrats and other inbetweeners on the other side of the \\"volcano\\" are pulling them toward the center.  This is how an autocratic idea that is objectively bad for the majority of the population can become popular.But all is not lost!  Once the autocrat has successfully managed their coup, their own power is maximized, and much of the population's power is minimized.  The liberals look around them and see the ideas surrounding them are superior both from their perspective and from the \\"inbetweeners\\".  Together, they should have the power to shift society away from the hole/\\"autocrat-peak\\" they find themselves in, but there is no consensus as to which direction to pull in.  But there is a restlessness and an instability that will break soon.Ultimately, the reason why liberalism does not self-destruct is that while a particular instance of liberalism might be unstable, the \\"field\\" of liberalism is \\"metastable\\", and will find a new equilibrium.  A charismatic leader like MLK or Ghandi, or an atrocity committed by an autocrat, or a random ecological or environmental event will tip the unstable autocracy and back to some form of liberalism.","title":"CMV: Liberalism is inherently self-defeating"},{"text":"If we start seeing an actual hot civil war in this country, its on the GOP?","title":"Speaker Mike Johnson Says Hell Probe Bidens Pardons But Trump Freeing Jan 6.

Please Google the massive amounts of studies on this very topic. These marginalized groups want nothing more than to take down the rich and abusive, and to do the abusing themselves.

It's simply a matter of perspective. The problem with an intolerant (i.e. authoritarian) society is that it's completely incapable of tolerance. It generally creates a set of values and a shared identity and it teaches people to exclude and persecute those who don't fit it. The issue is that there are very rigid ideas about the identity, and most people don't confirm to it. The second one target is even slightly attacked, there are others. Once the hate train has left the station, it's very hard to get those brakes working. It tends towards brutal oppression and it doesn't give many opportunities for anything to exist that doesn't conform to the authoritarian position.The benefit of liberalism is that there are so many different steps that can be taken.For starters, the fact that society doesn't have one value system means that everyone can find their own ideal and deal with that accordingly. The authoritarian ideas tend not to survive very well under those conditions because society is encouraged to embrace that there are other things and that no one values system is more justified. This is why religion tends to have liberalised in the West. Then you have community. If someone starts saying weird shit, you make it difficult to say that shit. If someone starts being really intolerant, you don't tolerate it.Then you have rule of law. Protect everyone's rights, and prevent others from violating them. If they don't follow the law, you can take action. Obviously, it's very difficult to deal with these people sometimes. Then you've got the extra-legal. The surveillance state. They are watching for bad behaviour and they can remove people when necessary. It's a bit dystopian, but these people are supposed to act in the shadows, precisely because there is a potential need to deal with bad actors, while exerting minimal force. So, instead of an open policy of targeting specific groups of people, they target individuals who want to do terrorism, and then put them through a legal process (at least generally). Even when there is disorder in the streets, there does not need to be brutal suppression. This means that most of the anger in a democracy gets discharged and fizzles out, rather than violent revolutions taking place. Brutal suppression is a sign of a failed state. It is the thing that has to happen because the state has no legitimacy without violence. You can tell that, because it cannot simply ask people to calm themselves down. A liberal state has the same force available to it if it so chooses to deploy it. It doesn't ever have to deploy it.Also, lack of imposed values is a stronger force than imposed values. Atheism wins because it doesn't require anything of anyone, most of the time. Liberalism wins out over communism or fascism or conservatism because it can survive in any society. The others tend to die because they need to impose themselves on others.Despite the concerns about the radicalism of certain groups, the things that mark them out is that they're populated by mentally ill losers who are isolated from the rest of society and given some sense of community and purpose by extremism. The terrorism basically comes from people who take even that way too fer.","title":"CMV: Liberalism is inherently self-defeating"},{"text":"Most people streamed it, I am guessing, and that doesn't count towards cable rating.","title":"Corporate Media Argues Trumps Inauguration Received Fewer Viewers Than BidensTheres Just One Problem"},{"text":"I want to laugh at this but at the same time it absolutely should not be happening.","title":"Is Instagram Currently Suppressing Hashtags or Terms from the Left?"},{"text":"okay.. let me get this right..

When people make a accusation, they may get facts wrong without intending to. For instance if someone is drunk off their ass to the point of severe memory loss, but notice signs of having had sex, their brain may make some leaps in logic and convince themselves they know who the perpetrator is while being completely wrong. Human brains are fantastic and telling itself a narrative it's more comfortable with than being uneasy from the unknown, or even may form false memories. Accusations can also be made against someone else because they feel pressure to give up a name while also too scared to name the actual abuser, or to admit they don't know. Often assuming the accused person won't have their life fall apart, and symontanously get the needed cathartic release from discussing their abuse. In cases like the above, the accuser absolutely does need social support and care. They often aren't acting with malice, despite the outcome from false accusations can be horrific socially and economically. Saying benefit of doubt implies to me that the accuser is either 100% truthful or acting out of some sort of greed. Trust but verify acknowledges the accusations more often than not are true, can be spoken from a morally gay area, and we should support them regardless if actions can be taken against the accused.  Harsh reality is too, sometimes the dragons win.

You don't get the massive industrial capabilities without a State that is willing to use men with guns to defend it, rather than take it from you (Fascist or Communist here).Liberalism, across history, has had no qualms taking up arms to defend itself and stamp out competition.

I know some who can bring up good prediction's about Austrian economics just like I know those who can have equally reasonable predictions about Keynesian economics. None of the predictions are more \\"unbiased\\" than the other and no one desires to sit through experts debating economics.

Many things that people get wrong about economics and political science aren't due to ideological blindspots, it's because phenomena don't work in aggregate as they do on smaller scales.  This leads to a very large amount of \\"common sense\\" ideas about both to be dramatically incorrect.Additionally, people's observations are also commonly incorrect, this is largely because they do not have the requisite knowledge base to even draw accurate conclusions about what they observe.  The average person does not know how statistics work, nor are they versed in the rules-based reasoning of logic that is better suited to generalized arguments compared to the typical heuristic forward thinking more commonly employed. I trust crowdsourcing reality through a worldwide shared experience + some expert opinions, more than subordinating my logic to a few possibly corrupt specialists.   There is no such thing as a \\"worldwide shared experience\\".In other words, in a system where ALL people could share their real-life knowledge, decisions would be less ideologically manipulated and more based on facts.   Which facts?  When it comes to things that are not directly physically verifiable, there is more than one set of facts.  Most \\"ideologies\\" form around sets of facts, and further beliefs are extrapolated from those facts.  As a result of confirmation bias, it is less common that people will absorb facts that run counter to the facts that form their worldview.

If the government only had to make one decision per year, that would be fine, but if everyone had to vote on ten different things every day, most people would simply choose not to, and if you forced them to, they may just vote at random or not in good faith. If no conpulsion occurred, a small number of politically active people could hijack the system.It gets worse: the fact that so many decisions have to be made creates the need for a coherent plan to string decisions together and make them work with each other, which is another insurmountable problem.\\nWith no human being at the helm but sinply a mathematical algorithm of the sum total of popular opinion is that there is no reason to assume that this system will behave rationally. In fact, this system mimicks unconsciousness - it is literally impossible to have rationality intrinsic to a system that is just being buffetted by the winds of the collective emotions of the masses.The third issue with your argument is the idea that people will put their best selves forward when it comes to making these decisions. While I do agree with you that it's our responsibility to others that makes us behave responsibly, there is an oppposing phenomenon, which is that the worst of all human behaviours and impulses tend to be expressed when people have the anonymity, and the LACK of personal responsibility when part of a crowd.  In other words, where is an incentive on politicians to make decisions that at least aren't so catestrophic that they'd result in the loss of reputation, there is no such incentive whatsoever on the average voter in a referendum.Finally, the issue of expertise. I really don't think you're accounting for the complexities of economics and foreign policy. The average person simply does not understand these things.Yes politicians are narcissistic, self-righteous arseholes, but unfortunately so are most people. The average person is willing to compromise pretty heavily on their principles if it gets them what they want, so I don't think we should be surprised that politicians speak deceptively, smear opponents and scratch each other's backs. Yes it's shit and yes it's everything that's wrong with the world, but it's not the fault of the political system. It's the problem of human evil, and the solution to that problem, if there is one, is definitely not the \\"wisdom of the masses\\", which is absolutely not a thing in amy case.","title":"CMV: Direct Democracy is the governing solution for equality, ecological survival and prosperity"},{"text":"Just illegals?

So I guess my question is: a) How do you expect the courts to handle this; will the supreme court even agree to hear the case or leave it to lower courts? b) What sorts of potential legal arguments are there around this executive order, and how likely is it for the current supreme court to rule partially or totally in favor of this executive order (especially in context / in comparison to other controversial cases like Dobbs where I also heard a lot of people say Roe was totally settled and not going to get overturned until it did)Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA.","title":"Reddit AMA"},{"text":"Damn\\nThe Hebrew one straight up says \\"go outside, filthy parasite\\".Thanks for voting y'all, no, really, outstanding maneuver, play of the century.","title":"So it begins"},{"text":"So he sanctioned a tiny fraction of people enabled by the IDF that we supply billions in aid to.

Participation meaning: jury duty, being members of committees, holding office, etc.  **This is on top of their normal jobs.**In other words, rather than delegate power to just a few people, Athenians decided to _distribute power as widely as possible_.Athens was able to do this because its population was wealthy and productive.

If somebody has spent a decade getting their PhD in medicine, I trust them to do surgery more than even my smartest friend. Similarly, somebody who has read a hundred news articles will make more informed decisions than somebody who has just shown up on voting day.Subject matter expertise. Basically the specific version of the above point. If we are discussing a vaccine mandate, I think those in the medical field should have more influence than even the smartest lawyer. However, a direct democracy weighs the 99.5% lay voters over the .5% experts in that field.Long term thinking. In the US, Trumps tax cuts and deficit spending helped the economy short term, eventually rewarding him, while Bidens infrastructure spending takes a long time to pay dividends, punishing him (and potentially rewarding Trump). With a direct democracy, there isnt even a party who might have long term interests, which would only perpetuate this problem. In contrast, we have seen how leaders like Xi are better able to take short term costs for long term prosperity.To clarify, I generally do believe that DD is better than our current system, and is maybe the best achievable solution.

Switzerland's population is also less than 9 million.By contrast, direct democracy in places like California (cf. how every election has major ballot initiatives) has been a mess. In practice, you see voters constantly vote for higher spending and lower taxes, creating all kinds of long-term fiscal and social problems. The housing/homelessness crisis in California is directly a consequence of Proposition 13, which Californians voted for in 1978.Sometimes, you really need more technocratically minded people making decisions on behalf of constituents rather than the constituents themselves.","title":"CMV: Direct Democracy is the governing solution for equality, ecological survival and prosperity"},{"text":"She's Episcopalian.

Like they werent even trying a little bit to hide it anymore.

AOC and Bernie have basically been incredibly consistent in their criticisms of Trump, Oligarchy, etc. There's no other lane for them. Pritzker is loaded and no longer at the helm of a company that can be squashed by targeted government efforts.Given the way campaigns are financed, it's hard to see a path forward for the left outside of an independently wealthy class traitor like FDR. Basically, \\"billionaire savior\\" is the most viable path forward given the Democrats addiction to corporate funding (if corporations would still fund dems in this climate) and elevating candidates based primarily on their ability to fund raise (which is another way of saying... not piss off the corporate donors).For the rest of the Democrats, hopefully they are taking a different path this time. They had some direct power in Trump's first term which the wielded ineffectively, supported by the media with daily 'bombshells' on Trump's latest \\\\[*insert bullshit here*\\\\]. They \\"resisted\\" and got nowhere. This time, they have no direct power. The lost the presidency, the senate, the house, and the judicial branch. The leaves them with two choices:1/The Fetterman: AKA, accept the reality of the situation and try to position themselves to where they have as much influence as possible. If they can make it to the table, then Policy X might be slightly less shitty as a result. Something like... \\"give us this one thing and I can get you 10 Democratic votes so it looks to be somewhat bipartisan\\".2/The Schiff: Position themselves as the resistor-in-chief, clutch pearls and vocally attack every policy that comes out of this administration. These people will not be at the table, so Policy X is going to be the exact version Republicans propose. In short, shittier.Given these two choices, I think option 1 is the most reasonable path forward given Dems have no power. We've seen the results of 4 years of pointless squawking once before. The cynical perspective goes a step further and says that anyone taking option 2 basically has given up on governance and it just trying to create sound bites that can be used on the campaign trail.Sidenote: I think the oligarchs are a similar situation to Fetterman. Corporations have been writing public policy since the 1980's. Given how financing works, they indirectly owned the government. They too see that the Government now has the upper hand and can choke them out with the snap of their fingers. Better to sidle up and try to have some influence than to preach to the choir by endorsing the opposition, watch that half-baked candidate flame out, and then find yourself in the immediate crosshairs. While we all wanted to the government to start regulating corporations, I don't think we wanted it to happen this way.Bring on the billionaire saviors.","title":"Anyone else find it creepy how the majority of the Democrats have gone complete radio silent?"},{"text":"Why do we care how many people watched the inauguration.

He doesnt believe there should be compensation for past injustices or for the stereotyping and discrimination faced by Black and Brown people.When Lyndon Johnson signed executive orders aimed at equalizing opportunities, they led to affirmative action and opened doors for many people to access jobs and education. However, Trump has repealed those orders, sending a clear message that he wants to undo those efforts.The great irony is that while we see nepotism and privilege benefiting the wealthy and well-connected in society, many disadvantaged kids are left behind. Trumps actions resonate with his base, who see this rollback as red meata fulfillment of their desire to return to a past they idealize.KK - With the UK, unless this sparks a broader shift across Europewhere people feel we've gone too far in levelling the playing field and helping those whove historically been disadvantagedthe impact might remain limited. However, if Americans take this approach, it could influence trends worldwide, particularly if corporations follow suit.This executive order primarily targets government agencies, but if multinational corporations begin rolling back their diversity initiatives, such as efforts to diversify leadership, it could have a significant global impact. Thats how I see it potentially affecting the UK and beyond.","title":"Hi r/politics! We're Anthony Scaramucci and Katty Kay, the hosts of The Rest Is Politics: US podcast.

President Tusk of Poland, for example, has already stated that this is not a time for Europe to skimp on its own security. Some of the Baltic states have also expressed agreement with Trump, suggesting that the current two percent defense spending target is insufficient and that it should increase to five percent.There is a growing sentiment in Europe that the continent needs to take greater responsibility for its own security and move away from relying on the U.S. as a \\"9-1-1\\" backup. This belief extends beyond Trumps presidency, with the realization that future U.S. presidents may also expect Europe to shoulder more of the burden.However, this perspective is not universally accepted. Some European politicians argue that increasing defense spending to five percent of GDP would strain already tight budgets. They warn that such a move could lead to cuts in essential social services like healthcare and education, undermining the social contract that many European countries rely on.These cuts, they argue, could provoke widespread discontent among citizens and result in far-right populist governments gaining power across Europe.

Everyone remembers when we lowered the defense spending target to two percent and allowed some leniency around it.Why did we do that? The Pentagon believed that less military spending from both allies and adversaries would actually benefit America, ensuring a stronger military for the U.S. on a relative basis.Now, however, were moving away from that approach.

Ive watched the video several times, and while its initially shocking, it seems more like a moment of exuberance. His hand is slightly off to the side, not directly in front of him, and he doesnt say anything resembling a Nazi phrase. It comes across as a spontaneous gesturean arm thrown out while feeling expansive, especially since hed just been talking about going to Mars.Twitteror Xdefended Musk by sharing numerous images of celebrities, including Taylor Swift and AOC, making similar hand gestures in the past. However, reactions were mixed. In Israel, Haaretz referred to it as a Nazi salute, while the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in the U.S., which defends Jewish rights, took a more measured stance. They called it \\"unfortunate\\" but didnt believe it was an intentional Nazi salute and were willing to give Musk the benefit of the doubt.Ive reviewed the footage multiple times, and I dont think he deliberately meant it as a Nazi salute. Some may disagree, and I might catch flak for saying thisespecially from the leftbut I believe Musk can plausibly argue that this wasnt his intent.AS - I agree with you, and it seems Im not alone. Jon Stewart, from The Daily Show, spoofed the whole situation but ultimately gave Elon the benefit of the doubt. He joked that Musk was probably just trying to share his heart when he snapped his shoulder and forearm.In his humor, I dont think Stewartor anyone watching closelybelieved Elon was genuinely trying to emulate a Nazi gesture in that moment.KK - I think this is another instance where opposition to Donald Trumpor, in this case, Elon Muskgets overly worked up.

Unless someone like Don Jr. or Ivanka steps in, the personality cult associated with Trump wont be a factor in the next election. This gives Democrats an opportunity to shift the narrative away from Trumps influence.That said, lets not forget that Trump didnt win a mandate. His victory came from a narrow margina slim electoral outcome, with just one additional House member, a few more senators, and 50.5% of the vote. His success hinged on a few hundred thousand votes in swing states. While he did win those contested states, it doesnt equate to broad support.A savvy Democratic politician could capitalize on this. For example, Ro Khanna, a Democrat from Silicon Valley with a compelling backstory and policy vision, could be an intriguing option. So, its far too early to write off the Democrats.One more point about the American electorate: they often gravitate toward what they feel theyre missing. After the bombastic and unpredictable Trump presidency, they opted for the seasoned, stable \\"grandfather\\" figure during COVID. But as that figure has faded, theyve returned to the \\"crazy uncle.\\"However, the electorate may eventually tire of the chaos and look for something new. That shift could open up significant opportunities for Democrats moving forward.KK - One thing the Democrats have mentioned to me a few times is the significance of 2026. Theyre feeling confident about their chances of taking back the House in two years, especially given what you just said, Anthony. If Donald Trump overreaches, the polling suggests an interesting dynamic: while many Americans support his policies, they prefer a \\"MAGA-lite\\" version, not the extreme \\"ultra-MAGA.\\"Democrats are focused on 2026 but are also doing a lot of soul-searching. One Democratic congresswoman I spoke to this week was very candid. She said theyve had extensive discussions and presentations about understanding where they went wrongwho they failed to reach, how they didnt communicate effectively, and where they didnt listen.However, she admitted they havent yet adequately addressed how to counter Trump. That said, the Democrats are more unified than the Republicans, which could work to their advantage.We havent heard much from the Democrats recently, but itll be interesting to see how they frame their strategy as developments unfold in the Trump administration.","title":"Hi r/politics!

They both voted for Trump this year and were actually at the polling location before I got there. Saw them in line. My precinct in Queens, New York City this year was firmly red. It was the highest turnout Id seen since I started voting 20 years ago. Its right across my parents building and I saw the lines almost all day.

It's weird how conservatives insist liberals must be their friends or how they'll even lie in order to get liberal friends. It's like they want to insult someone yet the man that person still be their friend.It's weird to me that they would be so confused on why liberals would cut them off. Politics showcases their morals, ethics, values, and character. Some people don't compromise on the ethics they have.For as much as conservatives want to shit on liberals: There's a reason why it's usually conservative lying about their political beliefs in order to have friendships than liberals lying about it. There's a reason why it's usually conservatives who are complaining about liberals not wanting to be their friends to the point of calling them narrow-minded, close-minded, whatever. There's a reason why conservative only dating platforms have bombed tremendously.Conservatives apparently desperately want liberals as their friends.

We know from Steve Bannon's approach during Trump's first termflooding the zone with news stories and outrage to shock and overwhelm people. This tactic throws opponents off balance, leaving them unsure of what to focus on. I think we're seeing some of that again this time around.However, I also believe theres a more deliberate and thoughtful approach this time. They've spent more time carefully considering the policies they want to implement early on and strategizing how to advance his agenda quickly. These executive orders are, in a sense, a way to get a head start.Trump understands he has only two years to make significant progress, so hes moving fast. Hes also more aware now, compared to his first term, that the machinery of American government moves slowly, which makes this early push all the more critical.AS - You know, I think theres a bit of a shell game going on here. In addition to confounding his adversaries in the media, Trump enjoys doing the same with his staff. He often pits one person against another, saying one thing to one person and something entirely different to another. Then, he sits back, snickering as he watches them argue.The resulting infighting distracts from their productivity, but in his mind, it somehow elevates him. For Trump, theres only ever one star on the stage, one spotlightand thats him. So yes, I do think theres a level of premeditation in all of this.","title":"Hi r/politics!

ONLY a problem for men. Women experience loneliness as well. Why do women not fall down the rabbit hole of radicalism as easy as men? Perhaps that's the bigger issue. Women aren't the gatekeepers of male loneliness, and the argument often tends to get into murky waters of women having \\"too high of standards\\" with dating, women \\"not giving some men a chance and hurting their feelings/their self esteem\\", and can veer into \\"women are cold sluts\\" pretty quickly. Women tend to get blamed for this problem, and I think we're just tired of it. Male loneliness isn't a legal problem for me. Women are currently dealing with legal issues that literally take away their rights, diminish their equality with men, and often devalue them as people if they aren't producing babies. It's so hard to have empathy for \\"lonely men\\" when my state's government made up entirely of men, has made it illegal for me, as a woman, to get life saving health care. It's hard to care about Joe being sad about not having a date when women are bleeding out on hospital tables because a doctor is too worried about getting sued by the government for doing his job. Those legally binding problems that women are currently dealing with, were almost exclusively created by men. Men's loneliness is not created by women, and it certainly isn't state sanctioned by women. I obviously don't want anyone to feel lonely, but I'm also an adult and I have been lonely before and not gone down a rabbit hole where I've become a radicalized psychopath who wants to own slaves, kill people I hate, and watch other people suffer because I feel lonely. Conservatives and men's rights activists often go hand in hand, and often like to talk about how we are all singularly responsible for our own lives and our own actions.

The same authors of project 2025, that confirm it is not happening (not at a significant rate).Keep your personal attacks to yourself.  I'll keep this on facts.\\"A close review of the cases in Heritages database reveal that the organization has documented just 68 total cases of noncitizen voting going **back to the earliest cases documented in the 1980s**. Thats less than 5% of the cases in their database, total. The remaining cases all involve U.S. citizens.What do those 68 cases tell us? First, it demonstrates that proven cases of noncitizen voting are incredibly rare. Even an organization engaged in a major effort to document voter fraud produced fewer than 70 proven cases of noncitizens who voted in elections in the last 40 years. Given that over one billion votes have been cast over that period in thousands of elections, the incidence of proven noncitizen voting is below 0.0001%.\\"Yes, 68 total cases, since the 1980s.

The ones they trust pander to their pain.To change them, you influence their authority figures to subtly shift their values. For dissidents, discredit them, dig up dirt, fabricate accusations, destroy their credibility. Now, is this immoral? Absofuckinglutely.

Hey Anthony! I have two questions for you - Anthony - you continue to express admiration for Elon Musk. Do you still have the same admiration for him following his nazi salutes, which essentially provided the proverbial cherry on top of the fascist cake that's just been baked?Katty K - I really enjoy the podcast, but I've started to become unnerved by the nature of the analysis. Your discussions with Anthony regarding  the transition and this new administration increasingly seem divorced from the reality of the oligarchical fascist takeover of the US that is occurring. Have you both considered how to avoid sane washing this madness? Because continuing to approach commentary on this Administration as if it's in any way normal strikes me as enabling it, particularly given the oligarchical ownership of the US media landscape. I really enjoy the podcast, by the way, but I will stop listening if it starts calling a fascist a spade.","title":"Hi r/politics!

Its now full on the Gilded Age 2 but this time the government has also turned to fascism. Anyone who speaks out against the ruling class is at risk of retaliation or gods forbid even worse if we do end up going full Nazi State.Unlike the Guilded Age, we just may well be looking at the official death of democracy. There may never be another vote to attempt to bring in a progressive president. That will eventually leave us only one choice. Once 95% of people are suffering, and can longer hide behind social media, TV brain numbness. Sports addiction and all the other little self-centered distractions people use to ignore politics and the evil things going on around them;  and it becomes obvious that the current state of corruption and greed is leading to the direct deaths of more than 10% of the population, the people will finally be shaken from their apathy and our only option will be civil revolution and or rebellion.It will require solidarity in a way this country has never really known. We could end the oligarchy today if people learned to be selfless for the short term in  exchange for the greater good down the road, but Americans dont think that way. American culture is about the Me and What can I get for the Me. It would require scores or even hundreds of millions of people to stand up and strike across the board. Shut down the nation. Force the oligarchys investments to tank. Destroy their businesses from lack of labor, lack of sales, lack of logistics. If even half of Americans could work together in a unified general strike we could bring the oligarchs to their knees and force the redistribution of wealth.A step beyond that is true outright civil war. The rise of a rebellion meant to destroy the assets of the wealthy. The eat the rich movement. For when it really comes down to it, the only way to hurt rich people is to make them poor.","title":"Anyone else find it creepy how the majority of the Democrats have gone complete radio silent?"},{"text":"This is why the Democratic party's stance doesn't make any sense.

If you feel that way regardless of the genders involved it's not exactly misogyny.That said, statistically, men commit 99% of sexual assaults. Victims can be male or female, but the person committing the crime is almost guaranteed to be a man. So, to amend the above, it still is to some degree misogynistic because it defaults to believing men over, most commonly, women.Here's why you shouldn't:\\nI'm sure someone else will rattle off the statistics so I'll skip that in my explanation.You have a duty to ensure safety before anything else. Investigate. Please do. The guilty should face consequences and the innocent deserve to have their innocence proven. Sadly, most sexual assaults aren't even investigated. Cue states on unprocessed grape kits.But, in the meantime, the victim/survivor/accuser (and other potential victims) need to be safe. This doesn't mean making a public spectacle of the accused, rather putting some temporary, logical restrictions on the accused, such as a restraining order, or (if the victim is a minor) the accused can't be around children unsupervised. It's inconvenient, but it's better than allowing them the chance to further victimize others.Once the investigation concludes, either charges are laid or the temporary restrictions lift.Keeping everyone safe should be the priority. To do that, you must put a pause on potential harm while you investigate. And every instance should be fully investigated, clearing or convicting as necessary.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Ya its sad they hate themselves and america they will never be in charge of this country again","title":"FYI There is brigading of outraged libtards on here"},{"text":"How about no, you crazy nazi PoS?","title":"Trump Demands Bishop Apologize for Asking for Mercy for the Marginalized"},{"text":"Can no one rid me of this troublesome preacher?","title":"Trump Demands Bishop Apologize for Asking for Mercy for the Marginalized"},{"text":"Impossible!

I'm responding because I think maybe I can shed some more light on this than most other commenters on this sub. **I'm not really interested in a political debate (so don't bother trying to start one), but just to shed a bit of light as to why this might be happening. I'm not saying any of this is right or wrong, I'm just saying what's happening and what some people are like.**Some people see politics as an extension of values. e.g. they might think that if you vote for a particular person that you share the values that they believe that person is espousing. And I think most people see a person's values as a core part of a person's identity. Politics in the US has gotten to the point where this is just a blanket assumption now made on both sides. If a blue state progressive leftie finds out someone in their personal life voted for Trump, to them that can mean that they have very very fundamental disagreements on not just politics but also core values that are central to one's identity as a person. The same in reverse can be true if a blood red evangelical Christian encounters an atheist. I think most people want to make friends with people who share similar values.You might have voted for him for reasons that you don't think have anything to do with your values (maybe you just thought he'd be way better for the economy for example), but to some people it's going to be enough that he didn't repulse you. If you want to maintain your friendships with these people, you need to understand that they might not think that you agree with them on what they might consider (unfairly or not) 'the basics', they might think you fundamentally disagree on extremely core values and that might make them uncomfortable with you. You'll need them to feel like you share the same values that they do and you'll also need them to feel like you've genuinely thought things through in making your choice at the election. You might not ever be able to convince them to be honest and if that's what happens you might need to find new friends that are more similar in thinking to you. I'm not saying this is fair or unfair, I'm just saying that if you're committed to trying to maintain these friendships, that's what you will have to do. You have every right to just not do it and cut them loose instead.I think the era of politically disagreeing while remaining friends (in the US) is coming to a close unfortunately. The left and right are increasingly not just disagreeing on how to solve problems, but even what is and isn't a problem. They are not just disagreeing on what to do with the facts that they are given, they are disagreeing on what the basic facts are.","title":"Feeling Judged by Friends After Voting for Trump"},{"text":"99.99875 % easily","title":"How liberal is reddit?"},{"text":"Trump is not a Nazi, he is simply too egotistical to identify with an ideology he didnt invent hence MAGA which is naziism but solely for personal gain - Hitler was an awful human but its pretty clear he did what he did for reasons other than solely personal gain.

He made politics, values and identity one and the same. You vote according to your identity and your identity shapes your values. When you hear Joe Biden, Harris, Clinton say things in their speeches like thats who we are, thats what we do, whats what we believe in. This is like a spell. The Obama doctrine. The audience sees or more appropriately, IMAGINES themselves in the politicians they are listening to. These statements are so vague, people will hear what they want to hear, and see what they want to see. No one wants to believe that they are the bad guys. Theyre the good guys in their eyes. Its emotional and psychological manipulation. Their speeches serenades the audiences minds like Yes, I like you, you are like me, we have the same identity, we think the same, you must be the good guy, and those who disagree must be the forces of evil.Trump breaks this spell. Hes not trying to be like you, nor telling you what your values should be politically. He doesnt pretend to be someone whos not. He is who he is. What you see is what you get. Hes braggadocios, trolling, disruptive, and litigious. Hes never ask you to see yourself in him to vote for him. Either you like him or you dont, literally asking what have you got to lose?This is why they hate Trump and all of MAGA. They believe the MAGA voters see themselves in Trump and vice versa including the far right. They have no idea thats not how it works with Trump. We like him precisely because he is not like us nor is he one of the establishment. He is not part of the norm.

Whenever I visit he'll hijack me the second I walk in the door, showing me all his new toys and telling me every new story he has. Watching his face light up and hearing the excitement in his voice as he describes all the new Funko pops he's seen or all new basketball cards he's gotten brings me feelings of joy I can't even describe. In those moments I'm the center of his universe, and I do everything I can to show him I feel the same way.

It sounds like youre frustrated because, despite all the posts pointing out the wrongs of Trump and his administration, they dont seem to actually sway anyones opinion. It looks like youre feeling that these posts may just be feeding the divide, rather than making real change. And I hear thatit can feel like nothing is moving forward when were just pointing out the same things over and over again.But, if I may, it seems like there's a different way to look at it.1. Outrage Posts Arent Just About Changing MindsIt sounds like youre thinking that these posts should directly change peoples minds, especially those who support him or his policies. But, maybe its not just about convincing them. I get that it might seem like people who already support him arent listening to these posts. And you're right, they likely wontat least not right away. However, these posts do something else: they offer solidarity to others who feel the same way. It feels like these posts create a sense of shared purpose, reminding people that theyre not alone in their outrage. That feeling of unity can be powerfulit keeps people engaged and ready to keep fighting for change, even when it seems like progress is slow.2. They Build Momentum Over TimeI can see why it might feel like these posts dont change anything in the immediate moment, but maybe its not about instant results. It seems like theres a bigger picture here. Every post, every comment, adds to the conversation. It looks like, while one post alone might not change someones mind, over time, they build a broader awareness. It feels like these posts contribute to the larger movement, raising important issues and keeping them in the public eye, even when things feel overwhelming. Perhaps the power isnt in one post, but in the collective impact of many.3. Change Takes TimeI understand why you might feel that these posts are just venting frustration without seeing immediate change. It sounds like you're frustrated because it feels like its not making a difference, especially when everything is happening so quickly. But the thing is, political change often takes timesometimes a lot of time. Its hard to see that in the moment. Im sure it can be disheartening when the posts dont seem to lead to immediate results. But, in the grand scheme of things, these posts help keep the conversation alive and contribute to the long-term momentum that eventually leads to change. Its not about seeing a quick win; its about consistent effort over time.4. The Bigger PictureI know it might feel like these posts are just pointing out flaws, and it could seem like thats not enough to actually fight back. I can see how it might feel like all this outrage just fuels the divide, making things worse rather than better. And you might even feel like some people on the other side are enjoying the outrageliberal tears and all that. Its frustrating when it feels like its just a game to them. But heres the thing: these posts arent just about ventingtheyre part of something much bigger. Theyre a way to speak out, stay engaged, and keep pushing for change. It feels like these posts are just one part of a larger strategy. Theyre not the end goal, but part of the necessary steps toward shifting the narrative and building momentum for real change.In ConclusionI hear that youre questioning the value of these posts, especially when it seems like theyre not changing the immediate outcome. It can feel like its just an endless cycle of outrage that doesnt lead anywhere. But what if these posts are laying the groundwork for something bigger? Change doesnt happen overnight. It takes time, effort, and consistency. And even though it doesnt seem like much now, these posts are part of a long-term strategy to raise awareness, mobilize people, and shift the narrative. The real value might not be in the immediate results, but in the collective effort over time.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"Yeah I'm not even a believer in the Abrahamic religions but the parallels are striking especially after his miraculous head wound thing it's just like WTF too much I didn't expect the AntiChrist to be so *crappy*","title":"Donald Trump Demands Apology From Bishop Who Hurt His Feelings"},{"text":"so everythings been on fire cuz of some mythical bird symbology and how convenient birds can fly if things begin to flood","title":"Is Leave The World Behind: (2023) Signaling A Major Geo-Physical Event Such as EMPCOE/Shift?"},{"text":" None of the establishment media is pro Dem.I'll read the rest of that post once I manage to stop laughing.On  edit.

This is not a conservative movement and I can see why your friends may be perturbed by that.I am not doubting that there are hive mentalities at play here, in a vacuum such as Reddit. I am a center-left independent and voted for the greater good of everyone in the nation - I thought the problematic rhetoric and lofty stumping points that Trump was talking about all election were quite obviously unhinged and unattainable without seriously undermining our nation's future as a nation of strength.  Your friends may find it a bit astounding that you were fine with the dismantling of important services, the xenophobic agenda, and the unhinged chaos that's ensuing right now.I hope your friendships remain and I hope you benefit from your vote.

They should have just allowed Palestinian-American GA State Representative (who had ties to the uncommitted movement) Ruwa Romman to speak at the DNC - Romman literally planned to go on stage and say (directly from the speech) \\"*Lets commit to each other, to electing Vice President Harris and defeating Donald Trump who uses my identity as a Palestinian as a slur*.\\" She even said she was open to the DNC totally altering her speech. That easily could have saved votes.There was very little outreach by big DNC operatives to the Muslim community, especially in places like Michigan. Instead, they sent Ritchie Torres to Michigan to assuage Jewish voters that Harris was going to toe Biden's line on Israel. This is of course ignoring the ample polling that shows that Jewish voters overwhelmingly were in favor of a U.S. policy shift towards Israel - 62 percent said they were in favor of cutting off Israel's access to offensive weapons. 71 percent said they wanted to see increased aid to Palestinians. There was very little indication that Jewish American voters were going to leave the Democratic Party over a policy shift on Israel.I have a feeling Harris was actually more pro-Palestinian privately than what was displayed. Her step-daughter (who she is apparently close to) is extremely pro-Palestinian - having shown up at protests and had a donation link on her Instagram page.","title":"Did Democrats support for Gaza genocide cost Harris the election?"},{"text":"Id include you in the group we cant fix, to be honest, if you support this law.\\nI dont care about winning the Latino vote anymore than any other group.

This System purportedly unites various institutions, ideologies, and states under a single agenda, manipulating crises such as pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, and social upheavals to steer humanity toward a New World Order.  Central to this hypothesis is the belief in cyclical geophysical phenomena, specifically pole shifts, which K?hlert suggests are the primary drivers behind these transformative processes. He references Charles Hapgoods theory of Earths shifting crust, supported by Albert Einstein, to argue that abrupt displacements of Earths crust have occurred in the past and could happen again, leading to significant climate and environmental changes.  K?hlert also incorporates insights from various seers and prophets, asserting that numerous documented European seers have envisioned similar future timelines involving cataclysmic events followed by a spiritual renaissance. He interprets these visions as indicative of an impending birthing process for humanity, resulting in a new golden age of peace and brotherhood.  In summary, the Phoenix Hypothesis presents a comprehensive theory that combines alternative interpretations of global crises, geophysical theories, and prophetic visions to suggest that humanity is on the brink of a profound transformation orchestrated by a central controlling System.","title":"Is Leave The World Behind: (2023) Signaling A Major Geo-Physical Event Such as EMPCOE/Shift?"},{"text":"Yeah and thats the worry I have lol.

I find them the majority of them to be extremely close minded and unwilling to hear anything outside of their bubble. They are so hostile, almost like a cult. Just check out some of the main subreddits like r/pics and others, you will be immediately banned, disliked to oblivion or heckled like crazy if you visit and comment.

It was part of the her loss, but I doubt winning back that one segment of voters would have swung the election to Harris. As the results came in, you could see her numbers were slightly down everywhere. That wasn't due to Gaza.You could make the same argument with other groups like Black men, young voters, etc. I wouldn't say any single group led to her loss, but all of them combined probably did.Her campaign started from behind because of Biden and also because Harris wasn't a great candidate in general. She wasn't a \\"terrible\\" candidate, but we needed a great candidate to dig us out of the Biden hole and win with only ~100 days to campaign. Then layer on top of that her underperforming with multiple segments of voters and I think it was simply too much for her to overcome.Part of her loss can also be contributed to being linked so closely to Biden. You can't distance yourself from inflation or Gaza when you go out of your way to present yourself as Biden's \\"partner\\" and a key decision maker. Most voters rightly or wrongly blame/credit the president for the state of the country and Harris tied herself to Biden.Considering everything working against Harris, it is kind of impressive how well she did. Trump had a very narrow victory. It makes you wonder how a better candidate would have done.

All criminal accusations are subject to this problem regardless of gender or nature of crime. So while I agree that it is OK to not believe a female accuser, I'm going to argue that we are all barking up the wrong tree with this CMV.The fact that men have largely been in charge of criminal justice and as a result a toxic culture among law enforcement personnel has given the general public reason to believe that women's rights will be abused if we do not abuse the rights of those accused of abusing women. On the other side of the same coin we also see a significant portion of that same populace fearing false accusations at the hands of dishonest accusers. We have been divided to distract us from the fact that we are entitled to a transparent and accountable justice system.To be objective here we cannot take sides, and corruption within the criminal justice system is the only thing we should want to address or we will be consenting to kangaroo courts of one kind or another.People allegedly voted a rapist into office, and as far as I can tell, it was because they feared the strawman dystopia of giving women power to accuse without being questioned, giving POC power to defend themselves against prosecution using a \\"race card\\" and giving immigrants the right to be treated in a civil manner based on constitutional law. They argue that observance of civil rights leads to future of crime and corruption while the victims of corruption who have already had their civil rights violated are being painted as a threat by way of straw man fallacy.We need to stop making this about men vs women or white vs POC, because it has always simply been about the abuse of power by those who have it against those who do not. Giving any previously abused demographic unchecked power is not the solution, nor have those of us who champion equality suggested it was. Words are being put in our mouths by fallacious campaigns to preserve the imbalance of power.All we need is criminal justice reform with a focus on equality under the law, meanwhile the elected officials who try to deliver are being undermined whenever they try to do anything. I would recommend we do the following.1. Forensic analysis of evidence and corroboration should always outweigh hearsay, and we need to hold our public servants to a very high standard regarding how evidence is handled.2. Favoritism within the justice system is absolutely unacceptable whether we are talking qualified immunity or secret handshake shit among criminal justice personnel.3. Society needs to come to terms with the fact that a justice system which aims to harm/cancel rather than rehabilitate/correct criminal offenders is no better than lawlessness because all humans are imperfect and will take sides based on their own subjectivity, family, financial interests, etc... The only reason giving our government a monopoly on violence could be worthwhile is due to the fact that letting citizens settle beef the old fashioned way leads to feuds a la Hatfield's and McCoy's. We are currently seeing a feud between the criminal justice system and disadvantaged citizens who are largely POC and female. If we are going to have genuine justice, there is no place in government for bias of any kind, and transparency and accountability is a must. Believing verbal accusations in the absence of supporting evidence is not a solution to bias within the criminal justice system.Furthermore, we live in a surveillance state, if we are going to consent to mass surveillance, we need to ensure that it works in an unbiased manner to protect all citizens equally.Go on and hate if you like, but I'm personally not convinced Andrew Cuomo is a real titty grabber.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"I hate when people say this because it removes the Church's responsibility to do anything about the bad actors in their congregations' pews. If someone claims to represent an idea, organization, etc.; yet their behavior is antithetical to whatever that thing is, it is the responsibility of that body to condemn it and educate its members on *why* it is antithetical to their teachings, mission, etc.If an individual church is teaching what is antithetical to their Church's broader teachings, synod/denominational leadership can remove the church from their larger body.

While I see that this is a talking point from a lot of manosphere speakers, I am actually struggling to see people losing a job/home/family at a concerning rate. On the other hand I see a lot of proven rapists excelling in their careers while their victims lose their jobs/home/family. Not necessarily because they are ostracized for being a victim but because they cannot longer function due to trauma. Though I can think of more victims who have been attacked for speaking out. So please, if you have knowledge of some statistics or a lot of examples of this actually happening I am interested. To the point of the \\"certainty\\": What would make you certain that something happened? I hear this a lot but usually it is very subjective and how much sympathy the person has for either the victim or the perpetrator. I also see this often used against victims who are in bad circumstances like SW, drugs or mentally ill. I think this is especially concerning because those people are more likely to be victimized, but they are also more likely to be accused of \\"changing their mind\\". If for you \\"certainty\\" is based on numbers who came forward, does that mean you need a perpetrator to victimize more people to make it believable? \\nDo you expect a victim to be open and vocal about their traumatic experience to you, even if you might not be close to them to share such a vulnerable experience? \\nWhat is your threshold for making an accusation believable? \\nI am asking all this because you initially used the legal term, but you seem to have your own subjective threshold which makes it enough proof. So the post isn't really about \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" but \\"innocent until you are satisfied with the proof\\". But you can see how everybody has their own subjective idea when there is enough proof, so it is kinda hard to determine your actual stance because it sounds like you are doing what everyone is doing already, just that your threshold is higher than others.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Colored female percieved as weak.weak. weak for america that people did not turn out to vote for may have something to do with it.

Never reigned in by subsequent Congresses even when it was clear the power was being misused.\\n- National Emergencies Act (1976) - granted the Executive various emergency powers that allow them to redirect budget, use the military, ignore certain laws and oversight if they declare an 'emergency', used by various Presidents to achieve their policy goals instead of passing legislation. Never reigned in by subsequent Congresses even when it was clear the power was being misused.\\n- PATRIOT Act (2001) - gave the Executive the power to conduct warrantless wiretaps with no accountability, powers that Congress has struggled to rein in since.\\n- Authorization for Use of Military Force (2001) - gave the President overly broad authority to take the 'war on terror' wherever they wanted, rather than Congress authorising wars as it's supposed to in the Constitution. \\n- Affordable Care Act (2010) - gave substantial authority to HHS to determine the detail, including subsidies and grants to states for Medicaid, enabling successive Presidents to mess with the ACA to try and stop it functioning correctly and create significant uncertainty for people trying to maintain health insurance.\\n- CARES Act (2020) - delegated vast spending authority to the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to stabilize the economy during the pandemic, which resulted in billions of dollars being handed out in business loans and contracts on very questionable grounds. Again, Congress has failed to rein in these powers now they've been granted, even though the coronavirus emergency is over.\\n- Inflation Reduction Act / Green New Deal (2022) - hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and grants for renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other green initiatives, but all under the administration of Department of Energy which can decide whether to award them or indeed grant them at all, meaning Trump can stop the provisions working properly at the stroke of his pen.
