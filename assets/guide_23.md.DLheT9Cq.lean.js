Both are also susceptible to social pressure from their respective communities and equally egregious when it comes o spreading propaganda. Republicans are able to do more because the way the constitution is set up makes it a lot easier to dismantle progress at the federal level than to achieve it.This is because our country was never meant to make the federal side all powerful like Democrats want. Reading the essays and letters of the Founding Fathers, the power dynamic in the United States is Constitution at the top, followed by the Individual, followed by State, then the Federal level. Democratic \\"Progress\\" isn't always allowed by the Constitution, but then again neither is Republican \\"Progress\\" (I'm using the definition of moving forward with an ideal). As an example, Republicans try to push laws that allow Christian teachings in public schools while campaigning against other religions doing the same (Unconstitutional): Democrats try creating equity laws that institutionalize that a person's physical makeup can be an advantage for them (Unconstitutional).The problem in modern times is people are either convinced the only people who can interpret the Constitution is either a politician or lawyer (weird considering the Constitution limits the power of politicians), when in reality it was written, with purposeful vagueness, to be read and understood by the average citizen.

(I am not asserting he did or did not, the previous two sentences are based on a Washington Post article about it a few months ago.) Failure to disclose to USCIS is also not legal. Legal discovery would be required to ascertain this information for court proceeding purposes.After that, he's possibly on a fraudulently obtained H1-B and conversion to a permanent resident status (\\"Green Card\\") based on a fraudulently obtained H1-B is *also* illegal, as is failure to disclose at this stage.Finally, naturalization on a fraudulently obtained permanent resident status is *also* illegal, and by the black letter of the law, would be grounds for denaturalization if USCIS chose to pursue the matter. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell Law School and faculty director of its Immigration Law and Policy Program, says that its not clear that if Musk worked in the US without authorization and attested he hadnt, that would be considered important enough to denaturalize him. However, he says, on purely legal grounds, this would justify revoking citizenship, because if he had told the truth, he would not have been eligible for an H1-B, a green card, or naturalization.","title":"Trump Sure Seems Pissed at Elon Musk Over the Spending Bill.

Why? Because now insurance pays for everything and the user does not even pay for the insurance. Prices are the means of communicating value, but with healthcare, prices are irrelevant as a result of the 3rd party payer system. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl3LwMGFAFM) briefly describes the problem.Because insurance companies are  partly  obligated to pay for any expenses of their customers, and the inability of customers to establish what the real prices of their services provided are  something readily available in a real free market  prices are able to rise far beyond what would be the case in a free market with functioning price signals. Because governments, through taxation, pay for the largest part of these health insurance schemes, we as consumers are not aware of the total costs of these medical services. This lack of awareness in turn contributes to the possibilities of rising prices for medical services.[vi]But then, what happens when one needs to change jobs for better money or whatever...fine, if you are healthy but not if you are sick. Voila, the pre-existing condition problem. Again, the result of employer provided insurance which had been incentivized by government wage and tax policy. So, what happens when one retires from all but a handful of the largest employers which have healthcare plans for retirees? Since the insurance was employer provided and not individually owned, no more insurance at retirement. Add to this the expense at that point of trying to obtain insurance, which at 65 is not cheap, and you have the need for Medicare. Again, a problem caused by government.So along comes the HMO law the brainchild of Ted Kennedy[vii]. Combined with Medicare, the HMO Act eventually eliminated the market for affordable individual health insurance.[viii]  Within 20 years of that law, the system is hopelessly damaged and the 3rd party payer system is the rule. Do not also forget the prices of policies are forced up by numerous mandates by both the states and federal government.[ix] Pricing for medical services is almost universally based on Medicare pricing[x] and policy pricing is regulated by the states[xi]. Thus, bureaucrats have decided what the value of a medical service will be, not the market and there is no pricing mechanism to transmit information.ACA made the 3rd party payer system, which was already failing, into law by mandating employers offer those benefits. In other words, ACA doubled down on failure.  ACA creates an illusion of having elements of the free market in the form of the exchanges and when the system begins to fail, as it is now, the blame can be laid on the failure of markets so as to usher in a single payer system.One of the big justifications used by many advocating a single payer system is that in single payer countries, the health of the people is better. Health outcomes in those countries are in fact not better than those in the United States.For example, life expectancies are affected by exogenous factors such as violent crime, poverty, obesity, tobacco and drug use, and other issues unrelated to health care. As the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development explains, It is difficult to estimate the relative contribution of the numerous nonmedical and medical factors that might affect variations in life expectancy across countries and over time.[xii]Similarly, infant mortality, a common measure in cross-country comparisons, is highly problematic. In the United States, very low birth-weight infants have a much greater chance of being brought to term with the latest medical technologies. Some of those low birth-weight babies die soon after birth, which boosts our infant mortality rate, but in many other Western countries, those high-risk, low birth-weight infants are not included when infant mortality is calculated.[xiii]When you compare the outcomes for specific diseases, the United States clearly outperforms the rest of the world. Whether the disease is cancer, pneumonia, heart disease, or AIDS, the chances of a patient surviving are far higher in the United States than in other countries. For example, according to a study published in the British medical journal The Lancet, the United States is at the top of the charts when it comes to surviving cancer. Among men, roughly 62.9 percent of those diagnosed with cancer survive for at least five years.[xiv] The news is even better for women: the five year-survival rate is 66.3 percent, or two thirds. The countries with the next best results are Iceland for men (61.8 percent) and Sweden for women (60.3 percent). Most countries with national health care fare far worse.[xv]Moreover, the United States drives much of the innovation and research on health care worldwide. Eighteen of the last 25 winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine are either U.S. citizens or individuals working here.[xvi] U.S. companies have developed half of all new major medicines introduced worldwide over the past 20 years.[xvii] In fact, Americans played a key role in 80 percent of the most important medical advances of the past 30 years.[xviii] Advanced medical technology is far more available in the United States than in nearly any other country.By the same token, not only do thousands of foreign-born doctors come to the United States to practice medicine, but foreign pharmaceutical companies fleeing taxes, regulation, and price controls are increasingly relocating to the United States.[xix] In many ways, the rest of the world piggybacks on the U.S. system.Health and medicine present unique challenges but non-coercive measures are best able to address these challenges. A comprehensive functional market-based system is far better positioned to match resources without price controls or rationing care. A market-based system suffers far less of the feast-or-famine misallocation of resources driven by our current mercantile system. It also saves huge sums that our current system wastes on administration, physician micro-management, billing, excessive executive compensation, and risk selection signing up only the healthy and wealthy leaving the sick and poor to be paid at the maximum rate by the American taxpayer.","title":"In case I'm not preaching to the choir here.

He goes into detail concerning the results of the report:The main effect of the report was to change public and political opinion about medical education and to influence the implementation of strict licensing laws.  The change in sentiment was facilitated by the political and financial influence of organizations such as the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation.In the wake of the report, and under the lobbying efforts of the AMA, states rapidly established medical acts to regulate the issuance of medical licenses.  Henceforth, licenses would only be given to graduates of schools that met criteria set forth by the Flexner report.  Those medical schools would have to be accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a joint venture of the AMA and its close ally, the American Association of Medical Colleges.From an economic standpoint, what happened next was a period of severe medical price inflation which occurred quickly and dramatically.  The situation was so serious that in 1925, a national Committee on the Costs of Medical Care (CCMC) was organized to address the question.The CCMC was also funded by the Carnegie Corporation and by a number of other private foundations, such as the Rockefeller Foundation.  The committee received material assistance from the AMA, the American Hospital Association, and other leading professional organizations, as well as from many government agencies, including the National Bureau of Economic Research.  Numerous reports were issued over the next few years, and those were compiled in 1932 into a large volume entitled The Costs of Medical Care.The CCMC confirmed that the costs of medical care had risen dramatically in the prior years.  The committee also found that health care disparities had increased, with access to medical care in rural and poor areas being particularly problematic.[ii]Coinciding with the Flexner Reforms was the active effort by the government to terminate the relationship people had with mutual assistance organizations.  Mutual assistance organizations used to be a source for primary care for working poor across the country.  Lodge practice was the means by which doctors provided primary care to members of these organizations.  Removing primary care as a benefit to lodge membership, by making lodge practice illegal, forced people to pay for care out of pocket.Lodge practice refers to an arrangement, reminiscent of todays HMOs, whereby a particular society or lodge would contract with a doctor to provide medical care to its members. The doctor received a regular salary on a retainer basis, rather than charging per item; members would pay a yearly fee and then call on the doctors services as needed. If medical services were found unsatisfactory, the doctor would be penalized, and the contract might not be renewed.Most remarkable was the low cost at which these medical services were provided. At the turn of the century, the average cost of lodge practice to an individual member was between one and two dollars a year. A days wage would pay for a years worth of medical care. By contrast, the average cost of medical service on the regular market was between one and two dollars per visit. Yet licensed physicians, particularly those who did not come from big name medical schools, competed vigorously for lodge contracts, perhaps because of the security they offered; and this competition continued to keep costs low.The response of the medical establishment, both in America and in Britain, was one of outrage; the institution of lodge practice was denounced in harsh language and apocalyptic tones. Such low fees, many doctors charged, were bankrupting the medical profession. Moreover, many saw it as a blow to the dignity of the profession that trained physicians should be eagerly bidding for the chance to serve as the hirelings of lower-class tradesmen. It was particularly detestable that such uneducated and socially inferior people should be permitted to set fees for the physicians services, or to sit in judgment on professionals to determine whether their services had been satisfactory. The government, they demanded, must do something.And so it did. In Britain, the state put an end to the evil of lodge practice by bringing health care under political control. Physicians fees would now be determined by panels of trained professionals (i.e., the physicians themselves) rather than by ignorant patients. State-financed medical care edged out lodge practice; those who were being forced to pay taxes for free health care whether they wanted it or not had little incentive to pay extra for health care through the fraternal societies, rather than using the government care they had already paid for.In America, it took longer for the nations health care system to be socialized, so the medical establishment had to achieve its ends more indirectly; but the essential result was the same. Medical societies like the AMA imposed sanctions on doctors who dared to sign lodge practice contracts. This might have been less effective if such medical societies had not had access to government power; but in fact, thanks to governmental grants of privilege, they controlled the medical licensure procedure, thus ensuring that those in their disfavor would be denied the right to practice medicine.Such licensure laws also offered the medical establishment a less overt way of combating lodge practice. It was during this period that the AMA made the requirements for medical licensure far more strict than they had previously been. Their reason, they claimed, was to raise the quality of medical care. But the result was that the number of physicians fell, competition dwindled, and medical fees rose; the vast pool of physicians bidding for lodge practice contracts had been abolished. As with any market good, artificial restrictions on supply created higher prices  a particular hardship for the working-class members of fraternal societies.[iii]Then, along comes WWII and government policies which connected health insurance with ones employer and began the 3rd party payer system we have made into law with ACA.It started with wartime wage freezes. Employers desperate to entice employees used health insurance benefits as an enticement since wages were frozen by law.[iv] After the war, the tax code was altered to give tax benefits to employers for providing health insurance.[v]","title":"In case I'm not preaching to the choir here.

Further, the cost of care in the United States is the result of government interventions for over a century. The difference is the single payer systems have the means to control expenses through the rationing of care.Every government-run healthcare system around the world rations care to control costs. In Great Britain, the National Institute on Clinical Effectiveness makes such decisions, including a controversial determination that certain cancer drugs are too expensive. The government effectively puts a price tag on each citizens lifesome $44,305 per year, to be exact. Thats just a baseline, of course, and, as the British Institutes chairman, Michael Rawlins, points out, the agency has at times approved treatments costing as much as $70,887 per year of extended life. But these are approved only if it can be shown they extend life by at least three months and are used for illnesses that affect fewer than 7,000 new patients per year.This is the reality of socialized medicine. But the mercantile system in the US is little better as noted in this quote describing the problems with the US system:Both the current public and private insurance systems main techniques for holding down costs are practicing third party rationing by limiting the services covered, price controls by constraining payments to providers, and shifting costs to patients. But given the systems fragmentation and perverse incentives, much cost-effective care is squeezed out, resources are increasingly allocated to costly, inefficient and opaque administrative and regulatory procedures and central organizational overgrowth with un-necessary and in-efficient micro-management of physicians rather than medical need. The system wastes money on unnecessary premium care workups for all patients, and inappropriate use of expensive technology. Other inefficiencies include information failures, inefficient moral hazard issues, adverse selection, distorted incentives, inflated hospital and pharmaceutical pricing and cost shifting. Many attainable efficiencies are not achieved. We also use medicines and technologies that cost a lot for little or no marginal health benefit. Administrative expenses are high, and enormous sums are squandered in efforts to game the system. Given the mercantile emphasis on production and the ignored consumer it is no wonder that between one fifth and one third of medical outlays do nothing to improve health.[i]So, what then is the answer to this? More government, the same government which created the US system we have now? What? The US did not create our healthcare system, you are probably saying. Indeed it did and is described in this article.  But managed care and our current single payer government systems, Medicare and Medicaid, are not fixing what is broken.  Cookbook medicine does not contain costs. All current cost containment strategies are failing.","title":"In case I'm not preaching to the choir here.

I'm talking about Democrats.Second Trump impeachment vote resulted in Democrats voting unanimously for guilty. Are you also saying the indictments were merely performative and meaningless? \\"Both sides are the same\\" is a right wing psyop. Democrats would do a great job making real change if they actually got the votes and numbers to do it. The 48 *good* Democrat senators didn't have the luxury of being able to control Joe Machin &amp; Kyrsten Sinema from 2020-22. But that's still a 24:1 ratio of good Democrats in the senate while *all* of the republicans are trash. You will never convince me that defeatist Democrat rhetoric is not a right wing psyop.Democrats who also believe insider trading by Senators is peachy-keen? Biden currently advocating for making stock trading among congresspeople illegal. Yes, this was always a bad thing, but has only entered the public consciousness relatively recently. It should be bipartisan but it's not, with Republicans prepared to vote unanimously against it. That's not Democrats' fault. will not lift a finger to hold accountable Supreme Court Justices who've lied in their confirmation hearings or who have accepted lavish gifts from people with business before the court.All of this is extremely difficult to accomplish because the Supreme Court itself will be ruling on the constitutionality of these measures, and will strike down anything they do not like. Legislatively, this is basically a waste of time. If it's not an outright psyop, I believe this idea that Democrats are ineffective stems from a fundamental inability or refusal to understand how the government actually works and operates. Yes, you do in fact need a lot of votes and support to make broad sweeping changes. Republicans are able to do more because the way the constitution is set up makes it a lot easier to dismantle progress at the federal level than to achieve it. Just because we are struggling to achieve positive change does not mean that we should disparage those who are actively working toward that change as we speak. Ineffectiveness is not a sin, at least not when there is no clear path dictating how you could have done things differently. You are essentially faulting current democrats in congress for the fact that more people did not vote for their colleagues in other districts. It's all about votes and if you do not have the votes you do not get what you want. This is why it feels like a psyop to me. Democrats are ineffective because not enough people vote for them, which is used as an argument by Democrat sympathizers for why we should not vote for them. This is why we keep losing to republicans. When you spend all day shitting on your own side it just give ammunition to the Republicans. It does not make the Democrats an ounce better. It just gives your everyday average Joe who does not pay much attention to politics one more reason to not show up to vote, or vote for Republicans because 'at least they do something.'","title":"CMV: Special Counsel Jack Smith voluntarily dismissing the Trump indictments after the election was a mistake and a dereliction of his Constitutional duty"},{"text":"I wonder if president musk will show trump out the window russian style.","title":"House Republicans say they have deal to avert government shutdown"},{"text":"I give the bromance another 6 months tops.

Ukraine is definitely trying to improve, and the west should support them in their effort, but it's still a Soviet country at heart, and operate a Soviet style army, where corruption, abuse of power, misallocation of resources, politically-motivated order, ... cause untold damage and suffering to civilians and enlisted alike.As far as enlisting more people is concerned, it is a cornelian dilemma and I don't envy people making that choice one bit. Though given how little sacrifice the West has been consenting, I feel that the obsession with Ukraine mobilisation is frankly hypocritical.  \\nI have no such sympathy for the absolute horror stories coming out of the Ukrainian military, or the military trainwrecks that we can see happen live with incompetent or corrupt soviet-era officers simply letting their troops die completely avoidable death just to hold a couple km for a week longer. Just to have those same officers get dismissed for their fuckery and assigned to another front where they can do less.   \\nThis kind of stuff absolutely toxic to any army's morale, those officers should not command troops.

This was also in Iowa, and one of my classmates vehemently refused to believe we nuked Japan. Came into work and she was having a heated debate with another coworker and I got looped in and just had my flabbers ghasted. I still laugh at that conversation to this day because I lost all attraction I had in her at that very moment. So did a quick search to learn myself on fiat: brought the tl:Dr definition over for others as well.Prior to 1971, the US dollar was backed by gold. Today, the dollar is backed by 2 things: the government's ability to generate revenues (via debt or taxes), and its authority to compel economic participants to transact in dollars.So, if government wants more money, shouldn't it tax the people with the most money more which makes it funny as fuck they are reducing the amount those assholes pay. Also, pushing crypto by that definition means Elon's gonna tank the budget since it shifts away from the dollar. And if no one's gonna buy any extravagant shit at 12% sales tax cept people better off so there goes 70+ million rural americans helping with economy outside of their government aided shopping trips. Money's still gotta come from somewhere.  If the government can't pay itself, and no one's trading in dollars, and no one can afford anything so there goes money from sales tax, and you just killed income tax, so how is the government going to acquire money? Because I sure as fuck wouldn't by any treasury note from the government in the state its in because again, they are openly pushing crypto, thus weakening the dollar.If the debt ceiling binds, and the U.S. Treasury does not have the ability to pay its obligations, the negative economic effects would quickly mount and risk triggering a deep recession. The debt limit caps the total amount of allowable outstanding U.S. federal debt. And I don't want to outsource more debt, to foreign entities if we uncap it.  Because at the rate we're going, that will be Russia, China, and North Korea seeing how deep the painted whore already is their pockets.","title":"Trump calls for abolishing the debt ceiling"},{"text":"They are hillbilly apologists for the elites.

Making suits and uniforms are the least worrisome aspect of corporate collaboration with the Nazis.

Today theyre still publicly traded with revenues in the 10s of billions of dollars. Bayer is a large medical company that exists today and has household products used by many people. You might be one. They used prisoners in concentration camps to test and experiment with medicines that were too risky to use in studies. Often, leaving prisoners with long term untreated medical side effects or even death. Degussa, now known as Evonik, helped to create the gas known as Zyklon B knowingly. This gas was used in the mass death of concentration camp prisoners. They still exist today and are publicly traded with billions in revenue. Deutsche Bank lent the money to the nazis for the construction of major concentration camps, such as Auschwitz, they knew about the plan for forced labor and helped to involve major brands like BMW and Mercedes into using the prisoners as free labor to produce their automobiles. Merck KGaA supported Hitler and the Nazi regime so enthusiastically they deemed the company for Hitler, willing to do just about anything for him. The company produced and tested pharmaceuticals, medical implants, used slave labor to develop and implement various compounds to then be used on Jews for euthanasia. Today the company exists and is still publicly traded. These are companies who also benefited greatly from the non-stop forced labor, among many others like Porsche, Volkswagen, Hugo, and Zeiss, that worked people to death in the 10s of thousands. Particularly these examples are still existing companies who willingly tortured, mutilated, experimented, and developed devices of genocide. Today, they still exist. They still get to make billions of dollars. Even though they acted in some of the worst atrocities in human history.","title":"Musk Kills Government Funding Deal, Demands Shutdown Until Trump Is Sworn In"},{"text":"Oh did he \\"suborn\\" them?","title":"How Did the GOP Win the House?

Democrat Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick didn't have a single opponent in the general election in FL-20, so Florida straight up just didn't count her votes.

And at the time their definition of natural born subject matched the 1790 law Over the years, multiple people have run for President with questionable eligibility.The courts have proven reluctant to outright unwilling to hear these cases, so they usually get sent over the Congressional Research Service, a Congressional agency who's job is to proving Congress research and analysis of the meaning of old laws.In 1968 George Romney (Mitt Romneys father) ran for President. George was born in Mexico, and only 1 of his parents had been born in the US.So he went to the Congressional Research Service, and they determined that from they could see the founders had intended to use the same definition as the British did, hence its temporary legal inclusion in 1790. And since our laws were no longer gendered, 1 parent was all it took.Romney would go on to run for President, where hed lose the primary to eventual election winner Richard Nixon.But ultimately yes, since CRS findings are not law, this is just a 200+ year old agreed upon assumption.","title":"Fact Check: Trumps birthright citizenship ban will not affect his children"},{"text":"Yeah I agree that a tradition should be judged on its merits.

He studiously went through a list of all Bureau of Investigation agents, to find the \\"uncorruptable\\" agents who would not be swayed by any of Capone's large bribes. As a result of the work done by Ness and his team, Capone would be convicted of financial crimes and sent to prison.So, I guess we can call Willis and her boyfriend as \\"The Touchables\\", cause apparently what they were most interested in doing was having their hands all over each other.","title":"Fani Willis disqualified from Trump's Georgia election interference case"},{"text":"Donald Trump is not adored by most Americans.And yes Elections do have consequences.?Abstention is a big problem in this country.?","title":"Under pressure from Elon Musk, House GOP prepares to scrap spending bill"},{"text":"Exactly and if they arent phased by shooting and killing someone.

Because this last election has shown me that a huge amount of voters simply do not pay any attention at all to politics, and I don't think there's really any concrete actions that a party can take that can break through that, especially one that is either in the minority or has a majority so thin it cannot actually pass legislation. The right has massive propaganda networks that are more effective because they're willing to just constantly shamelessly lie to be outrageous and entertaining. Yet people I mostly agree with on policy seem to think the answer is to scream abuse at Democrats for not accomplishing more when they have been overachieving based on the little power they  actually had, and either not vote or vote for third party candidates giving even less chance for meaningful legislation to be passed.

We obviously know one thing that these people have a lot of money. There are a few names in there that is can see, that due to interviews with family members and colleagues we know that two to three of these people got rich while trying to do right by the world and people of the world so we can logically assume their intentions are pure and righteous or reasonably so.  Many on the left may not know this, but inside Trumps inner circle he demanded on his last term they sign a contract to never take any lobby money or special interest dollars.  The traditional way in which these miscreants enrich themselves and their families. I say families because by extension as we have seen the previous four years by learning the Chinese technique of how to bypass the laws and ethics of trading influence, secrets or vote direction they will use their family members as bag men and shields so they can deny they have taken any money from anyone.  The point however is that if all else is equal I would much rather have a billionaire in a top position  because they already being rich will be much harder to sway with money from likely conspirators. It will be much less  likely that they do something that would jeopardize their position of power for any small or meager amount of cash. They will be much harder to buy off if they decide to go against their agreement.  In all I find this notion more comforting than if they were broke and desperate essentially. My question is what is the reasoning for the post? This is seemingly I would think a good thing why else would their financial status make them bad for these positions?

The CFR for H5N1?is upwards of 60%.COVID was a pandemic on easy mode.. and Trump *massively* fucked it up.  If this thing somehow manages to jump species, we're not in for a fun time.  The only saving grace here - the virus is predominantly a lower respiratory tract virus, so would be far harder to spread from person to person if it were to become something human-transmitted.  Wearing a mask - unlike with covid - would generally protect you from a moron refusing to wear a mask, rather than *somewhat* protecting you from others while generally protecting others from yourself... so the raw milk/anti-vax/anti-mask dipshits would for the most part predominantly spread it amongst themselves.Though.. I really, really have to imagine that, were a virus that had a mortality that high to really start spreading through the population, even the dipshits would start taking it seriously.

It doesnt matter. Dont be pedantic. There are people who either intentionally or unintentionally commit voter fraud every election. Every single one. There has never been even a question that the number of votes invalidated by voter fraud had absolutely zero effect on the outcome of the 2020 election. Not at all federal level, a state level, or even a county level. None. That is indisputable. And thats really the point of the argument. 70% of Trump voters dont believe that minor election fraud happened consistent with every other presidential election. No, 70% believe that Trump unfairly lost the election due to widespread voter fraud and a conspiracy masterminded by a non-incumbent candidate. On the other hand, this same candidate who screamed about voter fraud, also called Georgia and pressured and harassed and vaguely threatened their political leaders to find votes to flip the state. The next election, that same candidate had a billionaire pay people to vote for him. And so I understand that that is at best an ancillary  point to the original commenters argument. But it only adds to the absurdity and the fact the every single Republican talking point is absolute projection and hypocrisy in its purest form.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"I did on the other thread that you are also acting unhinged on.","title":"Appeals court removes prosecutor Fani Willis from Georgia election case against Trump and others"},{"text":"Its disappointing how unserious congress is to control spending.
