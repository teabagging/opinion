Trump and many in his inner circle already commit treason by *levying war* against the US Gov on Jan 6th. And Trump is more desperate now than ever, with his numerous felony charges. Based on the?[Constitution](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-iii/clauses/39#:~:text=Treason%20against%20the%20United%20States,on%20Confession%20in%20open%20Court.)?and the interpretation of founding father and Chief Justice,?[John Marshall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall):The Constitution specifically identifies what constitutes treason against the United States and, importantly, limits the offense of treason to only two types of conduct:?**(1) levying war against the United States**; or (2) adhering to \\\\[the\\\\] enemies \\\\[of the United States\\\\], giving them aid and comfort. Although there have not been many treason prosecutions in American historyindeed, only one person has been indicted for treason since 1954the Supreme Court has had occasion to further define what each type of treason entails.The offense of **levying war** against the United States was interpreted narrowly in Ex parte Bollman &amp; Swarthout (1807), a case stemming from the infamous alleged plot led by former Vice President Aaron Burr to overthrow the American government in New Orleans.The Supreme Court dismissed charges of treason that had been brought against two of Burrs associatesBollman and Swarthouton the grounds that their alleged conduct did not constitute levying war against the United States within the meaning of the Treason Clause. It was not enough, Chief Justice John Marshall opinion emphasized, merely to conspire to subvert by force the government of our country by recruiting troops, procuring maps, and drawing up plans.Conspiring **to levy war was distinct from** actually **levying war.**?Rather, a person could be convicted of treason for levying war only if there was an **actual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design.** In so holding, the Court sharply confined the scope of the offense of treason by levying war against the United States.By actually [amassing/inciting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/proud-boys-leader-sentenced-22-years-prison-seditious-conspiracy-and-other-charges-related) a group of supporters [to attack](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jan-6-hearing-roger-stone-voting-violence-1234610680/) the Nations Capital (*actual assemblage of men*), to prevent the certification of the election he [knowingly lost](https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-saying-he-lost-could-mean-legal-trouble/) (*for the purpose of executing*), combined with the multi-State [fake elector](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/the-cases-against-fake-electors-and-where-they-stand/) scheme that is now [in evidence](https://imghoster.co/en/nPG4vUcEkUP83KY?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=unitedagainsttheright) (*a treasonable design*), Trump, his Admin, several [Secret Service](https://www.newsweek.com/pence-refusing-get-secret-service-car-jan-6-chilling-raskin-1700341) members, and many high ranking officials in various positions of powerincluding: \\n- SC?Justice, [Samuel Alito](https://apnews.com/article/alito-supreme-court-flags-history-symbol-protest-a5415aeba90e21a86a50f8489fc54b7a)\\n- Speaker of the House,?[Mike Johnson](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/mike-johnson-christian-nationalist-appeal-to-heaven-flag-1234873851/)\\n- SC Justice, [Clarence Thomas](https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/4501934-clarence-thomass-conflict-is-clear-he-must-recuse-himself-from-the-trump-immunity-case/)\\n- his spouse, [Virginia Ginni Thomas](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ginni-thomas-tells-jan-6-committee-she-regrets-texting-with-meadows-about-2020-election/)\\n- and [many more..](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/gop-lawmakers-were-intimately-involved-in-jan-6-protest-planning-new-report-shows)levied war against the US on J6, committing treason as written in the Constitution and further defined by founding father and Chief Justice, John Marshall.. and conservatives are going to [deny it happened](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/01/jd-vance-trump-2020-election-loss-debate/), while helping them [try again..](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/12/trump-overturn-result-presidential-election-vote)*[Penalty:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_laws_in_the_United_States#:~:text=Penalty%3A%20Under%20U.S.%20Code%20Title,office%20in%20the%20United%20States.)?Under U.S. Code Title 18, the penalty is death, or not less than five years imprisonment (with a minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death).**Any person convicted of treason against the United States also forfeits the right to hold public office in the United States.*And now it seems Elon*who has numerous defense contracts*is giving [*aid and comfort*](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-in-secret-contact-vladimir-putin-since-2022-claims-wall-street-journal-report-us-ukraine-russia-war-starlink/) to Putin.","title":"Putins Pals Are Freaking Out About Bidens Bombshell Missile Move"},{"text":"I appreciate what you do.

No sense just making some needed adjustments and continuing the fight. The DNC has not failed the working class. The voters have failed to give them the power needed to overcome republican obstructionism. Last time we gave the DNC a real super majority was in Clinton's first term over three decades ago. And they raised taxes on the richest which set us on the course to create millions of good jobs, gave us the first balanced budget in memory, and helped extend the social safety nets of Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid. You can sit here and bitch that it's the DNC's fault because they don't give you exactly what you want. But at some point you will hopefully wake up and realize we operate under a two-party system. And you have to do everything you can to prevent the greater evil from winning even if that means voting for someone who will be somewhat progressive even if it's not as progressive as you like. Biden ran one of the most progressive administrations in decades. And he did it even with a party controlling the House that did not want him to have any successes. The proof of that could not have been more clear than when they refused to vote for a border bill that gave them pretty much everything they wanted without have to make any concessions. We do need to unite against a common threat. And there is a party you can support that exists *right now* that will fight them *if* you stop trying to defeat them and give them the power and support they need to overcome republican obstruction.","title":"The Democratic Party needs to go"},{"text":"Ukraine is already the most heavily mined country in the world.

If it were Id simply respond with 50 or 60 crying laughing faces. The fact that people are spouting vote blue nonsense freshly after a crushing defeat suffered by the blue party is astounding. You talk as though so many others have been brainwashed, yet you lack the wherewithal to recognize what the Dem party has done to you. They offer nothing other than platitudes. They drift further right every election season and still manage to keep people like you in their pocket. Youve already vote-blued yourselves right off a cliff. Still, you preach their rhetoric. Still, you prop Kamala up despite a frankly embarrassing loss. The red vs blue ideology is all many people know of politics in the US. Its sad how hard people like you cling to it. You need things to be as simple as go out, vote and vote for the good party. Mind you, there are only two parties worth considering, but one is definitely good. Thats how the good vs evil binary works, and just like in the childrens stories you can tell which is which by the colors assigned to them /s.You all need that to be true because if its not true youre left with the realization that the two-party system is rife with corruption and never had any interest in achieving justice for the people. If thats true, you might have to do something that wasnt as simple as go out, vote, and that would just be a big old inconvenience, wouldnt it?You people need to wise up. Simply going out and voting blue, and brow-beating others into doing the same, lost you all three branches of government in spectacular fashion. The Dem party has been dead for years and the fossils and the ghouls at its helm are only too happy to keep reanimating its corpse with your donation money.

So, if shes going to be governor, she has to be governor... she probably would, would fail at both.A recent poll found nearly half of voters would be very or somewhat likely to support Ms Harris, 60, if she runs to replace Gavin Newsom in her home state.Mr Newsom,?[who is tipped to run for the White House in 2028](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/12/gavin-newsom-california-already-losing-war-against-trump/), is retiring at the end of his term in 2026 in compliance with Californias two-term limit on the governorship.The survey, from UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and the Los Angeles Times, found that nearly three quarters of Democrats would be very or somewhat likely to consider Ms Harris for the role.Ms Harriss career has been filled with firsts: first female vice-president, first female and first black California attorney general. If she won the gubernatorial race, she would become the first woman to hold that office too.If Ms Harris opted for a run as governor of the Golden State, she would be following the career moves of Richard Nixon, who ran an unsuccessful campaign in 1962, two years after losing the 1960 presidential election.He became president seven years later, in 1969.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/20/kamala-harris-next-california-governor-planned-parenthood/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/20/kamala-harris-next-california-governor-planned-parenthood/)","title":"Californias next governor or head of Planned Parenthood  what Kamala Harris could do next"},{"text":"It doesnt matter.

That would have formalized NATO presence in the region and would have stalled off Putins invasion, buying a few years for Ukraine and Europe to prepare and very possibly prevent the invasion.  Instead the response was so much much worse: USA stated very publicly no boots on the ground!  No matter what Putin does, and no matter what atrocities he commits this time, we will not put a single set of boots on the ground.  We will only consider financial sanctions.Doing that publicly, in front of voters, was a golden permission slip for Putin to invade.  Dozens of allies immediately echoed the same suicidal and morally vacant permission, and the fatal die was cast.  For Putin, sanctions just means a rounding error of cost which he easily handles by pumping a bit more oil, or better yet, with simple methods of circumvention.So instead of preventing it, we just stated there would be a minor financial fee involved, in exchange for publicly assured guarantee he would face no resistance from any western nation. That was the greatest gift he could have received, and it was a green light to invade with confidence knowing all western leaders were now beholden to their public promises not to resist.So now we have hundreds of thousands of innocents murdered, and hundreds of thousands more Russian conscript lives wasted.  We have hospitals and schools and churches and homes and entire cities flattened.Even at the onset of the invasion, we could have taken very small but (politically) brave steps to repel it.

If both of those children spend the next 30 years living in the US, does one being born 10 miles further south 30 years ago really make a difference?Im not saying immigrating through proper channels isnt important, but illegal immigration isnt as black and white as people want it to be.My biggest issue with it isnt that people are coming in illegally, its that we are kicking out the people who are upfront and honest and trying to do everything by the book.  I had 2 coworkers at my previous job who came to the US to attend college and got a work visa after graduation.  Both were engineers working full time.  But its a lottery system to renew the visa.  So they had a couple of chances but didnt get picked.  They had to quit their job and leave the country.  They paid taxes, were fully transparent on their situation, and they got kicked out.  How moronic is that, that we are kicking out highly educated workers doing good work, supporting the economy, etc.  just because they didnt get picked for a lottery.  We have a looming population crisis as people are having fewer kids, but we have teenagers coming to our country to attend college and work valuable jobs and we kick them out.  Its like we got to skip all the cost sink years of raising a child and skip right to productive worker, but xenophobic racists wont have it.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"We will be, too.

A very obvious example of this is the health care system in the US. To give a counter example for what I mean between socialism and capitlism.

Dallas Democrat leaders stood silent when liberal protesters came to my home, while my children were inside, and demanded I stop supporting our police department. I stood firm and called for even more investment in public safety with a goal of becoming the safest major city in America. As a result, Dallas is now in its fourth-straight year of violent crime reduction. This is part of why the election was not an anomaly. Trump made history by breaking the Democrats' real blue wall: their grip on racial identity politics, which they'd used to maintain power for decades.  But we all saw clearly what the Democrat Party has become these last four years. Under President Joe Biden, borders opened, inflation surged and disorder flourished in Democrat-led cities.

You have to go back to 2008 to find a difference in votes between those races that is even marginally close to the scale of 2024. Data I used can actually be pulled straight from the election dashboard https://er.ncsbe.govBecause NC is very purple when you get down to the state level you cant simply look at # of Dem versus # of GOP, it has to be a totals. So my analysis is very different from the bullet ballot but it still shows a similar trend and unusual disparity between people voting for president versus voting for state races. In fact digging back further NC had a previous problem of people undervoting for President (only voting state and not federal) which I found interesting.","title":"GOP No-Shows Help Dems Push Through Biden Judicial Nominees"},{"text":"Mark cuban seems nice.

It arrives at the wrong conclusions reliably enough that it needs modification.For example, you said household economics doesnt appear to be a useful classification tool for political messaging.When polls seem to suggest that household economics was a major deciding factor in the last election. Trump connected with his household economics political messaging much better than Harris, so he won.Democrats and liberals at the moment are essentially pitching a globalized version of trickle down economics. The stock market goes up, sure, but that has been tracking alongside wealth inequality. It should be a chilling condemnation of the party and platform that so many people wanted Trump over it.But look at all these statistics that show Americans are actually better off! Youre absolutely correct, instead of turning a critical lens on ourselves, the positions we hold, where we have missed the mark, and how that manifests in the world - we simply blame the electorate for being stupid for not realizing how good we are for them. As though that is a winning political strategy.Here is an example of a winning political economic strategy for Democrats.Military budget.We dont just spend billions of taxpayer money on it, we overwhelmingly funnel poor people into a system that, among other things, guarantees the free flow of trade and ensures our global economy can operate.There is a socio-economic class of people in the United States called draftees. People without enough access to money and power such that when it gets down to it, they have to go to war and people like Trump dont. Even in times of peace, our military is overwhelmingly comprised of this powerless class.The thing is the very same people who get to avoid military service also receive the lions share of the economic benefit from that military. They get to build factories in Southeast Asia. They get to extract resources from Iraq. They get the new open markets to sell their goods and services in.We should be having those businesses pick up more of the tab. If we need a bunch of carrier groups near a place in order to ensure the status quo of good business, shouldnt the economic beneficiaries have to pay for that? Isnt the US military simply one large cost of doing business line item for almost every business that does business internationally?To put it bluntly, if the only reason a business owner can relocate a factory from Indiana to China is because the US military makes it possible, why aint that person picking up the tab?That right there is the philosophical foundation of a winning economic message that can also roll right into sound policy.I am from the orthodoxy, I know the argument against what I am saying. But a rising tide raises all boats, all that increased economic activity globally has greatly benefited everyone. That may be true, but it is also trickle down economics with a global coat of paint and the electorate does. not. want. it.Until we change the liberal orthodox perspective to be more contemporary to the times we live in, we are on a global shift to the right.","title":"America doesnt really have a working class || Noahopinion"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|bjB3gtFvREqqr5NAHW)","title":"Biden allows Ukraine to strike inside Russia with long-range missiles"},{"text":"I don't really care, do you?","title":"Republicans Are Mad That Democrats Are Confirming Lots Of Biden's Judges"},{"text":"Remember he ran on Medicare for All (Universal Health Care) and dropped that position 2 seconds after winning.

Since young people aren't allowed to disrespect their elders in any meaningful way, but a lot of expectations are placed on them to support their elder family members, there's a lot of resentment and frustration they end up taking out on the only people below them. Men are placed above women, so young men bully young women. And young women have nobody they're allowed to do the same to, so the least punishing group they can attack are the young men, who are only marginally less powerless than young women.?\\nSounds to me like the age hierarchy is the root of the problem. And it kind of self perpetuates because the \\"people did this to me when I was your age, so it's only fair I get to do it now\\" mindset is so common in humans. But I don't know if that's an accurate assessment or just some biased misunderstanding given to me by another relatively ignorant westerner lol\\nRegardless, it sounds like this is growing pains from the social order breaking down. We're kinda going through something similar here in the States, where minorities have been oppressed for centuries, so they feel pretty interested in some payback. Which is understandable, but now white people and men are clearly not reacting very well, and it's had disastrous consequences in the most recent presidential election.?\\nI don't know what to do about it. The obvious answer is that everyone should treat each other with empathy. But that's hard when everyone's so fucking angry at each other. Maybe the truth is that we just need to duke it out until we get it out of our systems. On a macro level, that's probably true. But it doesn't change the reality that women are having rights taken away in my country, and other minorities are next on the chopping block.

Almost all politicians are bought and paid for, and try to implement their hidden agendas. The left, the right, it doesn't matter. That said, you have to judge someone based on their actions. *just* because someone has money or has hob-nobed with other rich folk doesn't mean they like/agree with the agenda that's being pushed onto the country. And with Trump, any time I see this argument, it's only justification is becuase he has wealth. And while people will say Trump is a millionaire/billionaire he was a self made business man. He made his money by marketing himself, really. Trump is alot of negative things. One of those things, while i'm not qualified to make a diagnosis, is that he is likely a narcissist. But because of that, he isn't going to implement anyone else's ideas. His ideas are always the best and greatest (reguardless if they are or not, he believes that). I do not think he would be a good puppet. Its likely they tried, and they failed. And that's why the media and the government itself turned on him. For all intents and purposes, what it seems to me, from Trumps actions and future proposed actions, that he is trying to *dismantle* the Rothschilds power, control and influence. The Rothschilds have spent the last 100+ years slowly working behind the scenes to pass legislation and create government organizations that give them a massive amount of control of the population. For example, the Department of Education. It was Rothschild funded. And it was created to make sure people are only educated just enough so they can be functional employees. Wage slaves, if you will. And Trump, atleast from his words, wants to dismantle this. It is yet to be seen if he will follow through, though. Trump has also talked about (although, not recently) dismantling the Fed. If he did that, that would be the single biggest blow to the Rothchilds power. And if he did do it, he would absolutely not be controlled. It would effectly sever most of their influence from the country. That said, talking about dismantling the Fed is a one way ticket to murder town, because the last two president's  that discussed real plans to dismantling the fed (Lincoln, passed legislation that created a new system of money, called \\"greenbacks\\", that was owned and controlled by nationally funded and owned banks (i.e. the government itself), which was meant to circumvent the creation of the FED, and severed as a major road block for the rothchilds. Prior to the Fed being established in 1913, the rothchilds were hard at work trying to create a centralized, privately owned bank, and Lincoln forsaw the problem. The real reason he was killed wasn't becuase of the civil war, it was because he was becoming an annoyance to the Rothchilds. JFK frequently talked about dismantling the deep state, to include many occasions where he wanted to abolish the Fed. But, before he actually inacted any legislation that would dismantle the fed, they murdered him.)","title":"How can you call yourself a conspiracy theorist and also claim a party"},{"text":"As much as I'd love it, it would set a terrible precedent that would be abused by the left so no","title":"If there was a loophole for Trump to run again in 2028 would you vote for him?"},{"text":"There is no loophole, so this question is pointless.

Competent people don't want to waste the time and energy on the kind of narcissistic fantasy BS that fascists do and which always drags their country to hell.People thought Hitler wouldn't be so bad because he and his picks were so incompetent, but it's that incompetence which made them so scary. They ran on deporting all the jews, then couldn't manage it so turned to killing them and covering it up, along with other groups such as gay and trans people, artists, progressives, etc.His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \\"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei?em und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaosand it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \\"the greatest actor in Europe,\\" and wrote to a friend, \\"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childishhe would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \\"prodigious amounts of cake\\" and \\"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\\"He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.**Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \\"half-mad rascal\\" or a \\"man with a beery vocal organ.\\"** In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and **it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.**","title":"GOP No-Shows Help Dems Push Through Biden Judicial Nominees"},{"text":"who used to be a republican.  \\nThe billionaires won't save us, change minds in meat space.

Simultaneously you can't afford to turn off older voters because collectively Boomers and Gen X will have the majority over voting aged people until th 2032 election.Ruben Gellego is the youngest on your list but he's still a Gen X.

Capitalism is great at creating wealth, sure, but communismat least in theoryis about distributing that wealth in a way that prioritizes collective flourishing over individual profit.If you look at Marxs Critique of the Gotha Program, he argues that under communism, society could finally achieve from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. Its a simple yet profound principle: wellbeing isnt about how much you can hoard, but about making sure everyone has enough to live a decent life. Compare that to capitalism, where Jeff Bezos can fund his space hobby while millions of workers struggle to afford rent or healthcare. Is that wellbeing? Or just a system rewarding greed?Take Amartya Sen, a modern philosopher and economist. He introduced the idea of capabilitieswhat people are actually able to do and be in life. Under capitalism, your capabilities depend largely on your income. Cant afford education or healthcare? Too bad. Communisms focus on universal access to essential goods and services directly addresses this, ensuring people have the actual freedom to live meaningful lives.Now, critics say communism doesnt work in practiceand yeah, historical examples like Stalins USSR were a mess. But lets not pretend capitalisms track record is spotless. Look at David Graeber and his analysis of capitalisms inefficiencies in Bullshit Jobs. So many people are stuck in pointless jobs that exist only to pad corporate profits, not to provide real value or wellbeing. Under communism, the focus shifts to meaningful workproducing what society needs, not just what sells.Sure, communism isnt perfect (and maybe we need something beyond either system), but when you think about wellbeing as a shared goal rather than a competition, its hard to argue capitalism is doing the best job.

Obviously this is not something where you can just walk in, there are many young people and you don't want to keep rooms for more than a small fraction of that number, so this would be something you'd have to book in advance, probably well in advance, and there has to be some hard limit or price for booking so that people don't just reserve rooms indefinitely in case they need them.This means that the following situations don't work: * You're on a first / second / third date, it's going well, you want to go to the municipal sex den after drinks. * You're meet someone on tinder and decide to go together. * You're a couple spending the evening together, can't find a quiet place and decide to go to the sex den. * You had a quiet place set up, but something changed and you're looking for an alternative.The only situation that would work is if you're a stable couple, you assume you'll still be together in a month, which is when the next available sex den slot is, and you both schedule an appointment in your calendars, to go have sex on the 17th between 8 and 10 pm. I think this is the exact situation where you don't need the sex den - you have a month to find contraceptives (I agree these should be handed out for free), you have as many opportunities to confirm consent as you can hope to get, and you can find a day where you have access to a clean and safe private space, or book a hotel room if you really have none.","title":"CMV: States should provide spaces for young couples to make love by mutual consent, in clean environments, and in safety.

However, my focus wasnt to single out any specific religion but to explore the broader idea that all religions might hold partial truths, particularly regarding shared moral and spiritual principles.The exclusivity in Christianity and Islam, with their stipulations about salvation and eternal punishment, does create a tension with the concept of a loving and just God. But my intent wasnt to argue that all religions are equally right in their doctrinesrather, that they all reflect attempts to grapple with universal human questions about morality, justice, and meaning. This doesnt mean every religions core tenets are true but that they each capture elements of a shared human pursuit of truth.Judaism, as you pointed out, takes a different approach. Its lack of a doctrine condemning non-Jews to punishment in the afterlife aligns more easily with the idea of a just and loving God. This supports the broader idea that religions, while diverse, often converge on key principles like justice and compassion, even if they differ in their specific doctrines.Ultimately, my argument isnt that all religions are \\"true\\" in a doctrinal sense but that they all reflect humanitys attempt to connect with something greaterwhether thats a divine reality or simply a shared moral framework. This doesnt exclude the possibility that Christianity could be false while other religions are closer to the truth, but it also leaves room for the idea that no single religion fully captures the ultimate reality.

These behaviors make sense as adaptations for social survival, promoting group cohesion and increasing the chances of genetic success. Your examples, such as bats sharing food and bees sacrificing themselves for the hive, beautifully illustrate how these traits exist beyond humans and dont require divine inspiration to emerge.However, Id argue that just because these traits can be explained through naturalistic means doesnt necessarily rule out the possibility of divine influence. Evolution might explain how these behaviors developed, but it doesnt address the deeper existential question of why humans are so uniquely aware of and compelled by concepts like altruism and morality, even when they transcend immediate survival benefits. For instance, humans often act altruistically toward unrelated individuals or sacrifice for ideals that dont directly aid genetic successthings like justice, equality, or love for strangers.Religious teachings often take these instinctual behaviors and elevate them into moral and spiritual ideals, giving them meaning and purpose beyond mere survival. Whether this is purely a cultural development or reflects a deeper divine truth is, of course, open to interpretation. While naturalistic explanations are compelling and valid, they dont necessarily negate the idea that these traits might also point to something greater. Its less about disproving divine inspiration and more about recognizing that the natural and the divine could coexist as complementary perspectives.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":" he's literally going to be out on bail his entire presidencyWatch that dissapear...","title":"GOP No-Shows Help Dems Push Through Biden Judicial Nominees"},{"text":"When is 6g dropping","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The primary issue isn't about the farmers per se. it's about people effectively land banking to be quasi farmers to increase their IHT allowance.

DHaiti* pertained to a case in which the defendant, a male who was a cheerleading coach at a central Florida High school, was arrested in 2022 for possession of child pornography. The defendant, in one instance, reached his hands up a minors sports bra and fondled her. Kidd elected to release the defendant based on his high character, ties to the community, and lack of criminal history. The order was reversed by a district judge, and the defendant was ultimately sentenced to 29 years in prison.2. *U.S. v. King* related to a convicted sex offender charged with receipt and possession of child sex abuse material. Kidd issued an order restricting only some of the defendants usage of the internet and devices. Kidd told the defendant all thats been presented is that you downloaded images and that you had them on your phone, that you admitted to having them and initially ordered his release based on limited risk of danger to the community. An FBI special agent later testified about the defendants attraction to a child at a restaurant. The order was reversed by a district judge, and the defendant was ultimately sentenced to about 24 years in prison.If this is all accurate (I know the *Washington Examiner* is a biased paper), I probably wouldnt have voted for him either. Child sex crimes are serious offenses.**EDIT:** The cases are discussed in the [Nomination Hearing](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/06/05/2024/nominations) starting at 1:01:20.

The bill in question is usually called the Treaty Principles Bill, and its put forward by the ACT Party, specifically under David Seymour, who is going to be Deputy Prime Minister and one of the three parties that underwrite the current coalition government: the National Party, which is the largest and the center-right party; New Zealand First, which is essentially Winston Peters' personal party (he is the current Foreign Minister and leads a generic populist party which is basically just himhe has been Foreign under several governments); and the ACT Party, a right-wing libertarian party. For the most part, ACT is generally consistent about being libertarianthey are not alt-right IMO.To explain the Treaty Principles Bill, we first have to explain what the treaty is. The treaty refers to the Treaty of Waitangi, one of the founding documents of New Zealand. Like the UK, New Zealand doesnt have a codified constitution; it uses an uncodified constitution built out of various documents. The Treaty of Waitangi is probably the first document that is truly New Zealands, there are older documents that are part of the broader New Zealand constitutional canon, but they are all from the UK. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the Crown and various Mori leaders in New Zealand with both an English and Moari versionthis has led to some difficulties since the Maori one had more chiefs sign. There several ways to interpret it but by in large its really the symbol and the broad principles that matter.Every once in a while, you see a literalist reading being doneusually to argue that a specific piece of land isnt actually legally part of New Zealand and was unceded territory because the relevant chief didn't sign the treat. Theres a lot of history surrounding this but by and large, it was a treaty between the Mori and the Crown, which guaranteed something referred to as *tino rangatiratanga* (which, in English, we might consider sovereignty, though the discrepancy between the exact meanings of the two terms has consistently been a cause of disagreement) and ceded *Kwanatanga*. The treaty can be thought of as, essentially, an agreement: in exchange for ceding your land, the Crown would protect you and provide certain rights and privileges, such as access to resources for harvesting game and fishing, and broader protections like education.In its current understandingthough interpretations have evolved over the yearsthe Treaty of Waitangi recognizes Mori tribes (*iwi*) as having certain privileges. For example, Ngi Tahu has specific rules related to littoral rights and fishing. Ngti Whtua rkeiin in Auckland owns significant amounts of land. Mori are granted certain access to public lands and are guaranteed representation in government, currently through the Mori seats. These are a separate voter roll exclusively for Mori, allowing them to elect a certain number of representatives to the legislaturenot many, I think its seven currently out of 120. Its proportional to the number of Mori enrolled now, if I remember correctly but its always been a minority and it isn't explicity in the treaty so some from time to time want to abolish them though that hasn't been a thing for 50 years at this point though Seymour probably wants too.Anyway the powers of these iwi and related structures are, of course, somewhat controversial. Recent controversies include the Mori Health Authority, created under the last Labour government to reduce inequities in healthcare. There inequities in healthcare that it aims to address however, but basically just how you have affirmative action since it messed with the \\"dispassionate\\" analysisstrongly influenced by metrics like quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)it was somewhat controversial. Another major controversy arose from the Three Waters Reform, which aimed to address water infrastructure issues but also allowed for Mori representatives, chosen by hapu /iwiIIRC, to have statutory seats on boards managing water resources. These were not elected officials, which many viewed as undemocratic. This reform was highly unpopular and likely contributed to Jacinda Arderns resignation. Personally I disliked the reform for other reasons it was very complexthough the current system is also complex and needs fixingI recall this co-governance being the thing on Radio NZ that people cared about.So, what would the Treaty Principles Bill actually do? First, its not going to pass. It was introduced as a condition for ACT joining the coalition government. Neither New Zealand First nor the National Party officially supports it, though individual members might. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has stated he doesnt support it, and even if it passed Parliament, it would only trigger a referendumits possible to be a referendum without parliament too given the support Seymour has in the broader public. The bill proposes to establish treaty principles in statute, focusing on limited co-governance, which largely arose from the fears with failed Three Waters Reform. It aim to equalize rights in accessing public services aiming indigenous right universal (so they wouldn't exist), though Mori are, in practice, often worse off. It would also limit the rights of *hap* and *iwi* though from what I understand, this is a compromise position, as it recognizes their existence in the first place but reduces their powersfrankly not entirely sure about what is happening with that part. It would override (in spirit and in part) the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, which created the Waitangi Tribunal. The tribunal appoints judges to determine the treaty's meaning and address specific Mori claims, often resulting in compensation or mandates for government action to redress historical grievances.Symbolically, the bill would change the balance of power in New Zealands system. For instance, the New Zealand coat of arms depicts a British figure on one side and a Mori figure on the other, reflecting co-equality. This bill would essentially assert that Mori are no longer co-equal but instead fully subordinate to the crown (democratic) governmentthough, in practice, this is already largely the case.!ping NZ&amp;IndigenousConstitutionally though IMO if parliament passes it then the treaty gets overwritten.Disclaimer: I would vote against if it went to a voteassuming I get my franchise back.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"They have been spending millions on creating a list of federal employees they suspect of being disloyal over the last two years.","title":"GOP No-Shows Help Dems Push Through Biden Judicial Nominees"},{"text":"If Americans m dont want to research candidates, then they deserve trump in a roundabout way","title":"The current state of the Dem party in a nutshell."},{"text":"Clarkson is literally the problem here","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You talking about the imaginary friend stuff?

The conservative-leaning think tanks like Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute generally argue that there should be no cap whatsoever, but that seems a bit dishonest since high-level caps set well above market rates (e.g. usury laws) have little impact on the market while protecting consumers from predatory lending.I think it might be possible to calibrate interest rates at some level below market rates, but not so low as to exclude lenders from the market. That could pressure them to reduce administrative overhead and operate more efficiently without substantial reduction in the overall credit supply.

THe bronze and flint arrowheads were recovered from the Tollense Valley in northeast Germany. Researchers first uncovered the site in 1996 when an amateur archaeologist spotted a bone sticking out of a bank of the Tollense River. Since then, excavations have unearthed 300 metal finds and 12,500 bones belonging to about 150 individuals who fell in battle at the site in 1250 BC. Recovered weaponry has included swords, wooden clubs and the array of arrowheads  including some found still embedded in the bones of the fallen. No direct evidence of an earlier battle of this scale has ever been discovered, which is why Tollense Valley is considered the site of Europes oldest battle, according to researchers who have studied the area since 2007. Studies of the bones have yielded some insights into the men  all young, strong and able-bodied warriors, some with healed wounds from previous skirmishes. But details on who was involved in the violent conflict, and why they fought in such a bloody battle, has long eluded researchers. There are no written accounts describing the battle, so as teams of archaeologists have unearthed more finds from the valley, they have used the well-preserved remains and weapons to try to piece together the story behind the ancient battle scene. Now, a team of researchers studying arrowheads used in the battle has discovered evidence that it included local groups as well as an army from the south. These findings, published Sunday in the journal Antiquity, suggest the clash was the earliest example of interregional conflict in Europe  and raise questions about the state of organized, armed violence thousands of years ago. \\"The arrowheads are a kind of smoking gun, said lead study author Leif Inselmann, researcher at the Berlin Graduate School of Ancient Studies within the Free University of Berlin, in a statement. Just like the murder weapon in a mystery, they give us a clue about the culprit, the fighters of the Tollense Valley battle and where they came from. Previous discoveries of foreign artifacts, such as a Bohemian bronze ax and a sword from southeastern Central Europe, and analyses of the remains have suggested that outsiders fought in the Tollense Valley battle. But the researchers of the new study were curious to see what clues the arrowheads would yield. When Inselmann and his colleagues analyzed the arrowheads, they realized that no two were identical  not exactly shocking before the days of mass production. But the archaeologists could pick out key differences in the shapes and features that signified some of the arrowheads were not made within Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, a state in northeast Germany thats home to the Tollense Valley. Inselmann collected literature, data and examples of more than 4,700 Bronze Age arrowheads from Central Europe and mapped out where they came from to compare them with the Tollense Valley arrowheads. Many matched the style of arrowheads from other sites in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, suggesting they were locally made and carried by men who called the region home, according to the study. But other arrowheads with straight or rhombus-shaped bases and side spurs and barbs matched those from a southern region that now includes modern Bavaria and Moravia, Inselmann said. This suggests that at least a part of the fighters or even a complete battle faction involved in Tollense Valley derive from a very distant region, Inselmann wrote in an email. Inselmann and his colleagues suspect it unlikely that the arrowheads were imported from another region to be used by local fighters. Otherwise, they would expect to find evidence of arrowheads within ceremonial burials in the region that were practiced during the Bronze Age. **The spark of war** A causeway that crossed the Tollense River, constructed about 500 years before the battle, is thought to have been the starting point of the conflict, said study coauthor Thomas Terberger. Terberger, a professor in the department of prehistoric and historical archaeology at Germanys University of G?ttingen, has studied the site, a 1.8-mile (3-kilometer) stretch of the river, since 2007. The causeway was probably part of an important trade route, he said. Control of this bottleneck situation could well have been an important reason for the conflict. However, the fact that researchers havent found any clear evidence in the area of sources of wealth, such as mines for metal or places to extract salt, makes the trade route theory less likely, said Barry Molloy, an associate professor in the school of archaeology at University College Dublin. Molloy was not involved in the study. The causes of warfare were many, but it is likely in my view that this was about a group seeking to impose political control over another  an age old thing  in order to extract wealth systematically over time, not simply as plunder, Molloy said in an email. The exact scale and cause of the battle remain unknown, but the remains and weaponry found so far suggest more than 2,000 people were involved, according to the study. And researchers believe that more human bones are preserved in the valley, which could represent hundreds of victims. The 13th century BC was a time of increased trade and cultural exchange, but the discovery of bronze arrowheads across Germany has suggested it was also when armed conflict arose. This new information has considerably changed the image of the Bronze Age, which was not as peaceful as believed before, Terberger said. The 13th century BC saw changes of burial rites, symbols and material culture. I consider the conflict as a sign that this major transformation process of Bronze Age society was accompanied by violent conflicts. Tollense is probably only the tip of the iceberg. The new study also points to the placement of arrow injuries found on remains buried at the battle site, which suggests that shields may have protected warriors from the front, while their backs were left exposed. The research drives home the importance of archery on the battlefield, which has often been underestimated in previous studies of Bronze Age warfare, Molloy said. This is a really convincing study that uses routine archaeological methods to great effect to provide insight into the nature of this key prehistoric battle site, with regard to aspects of battlefield actions and the participants involved, he said. The authors make a robust case that there were at least two competing forces and that they were from distinct societies, with one group having travelled hundreds of kilometers. That is a crucial insight into the logistics behind the armies involved at Tollense. **The scale of the conflict** The large scale of battle has researchers rethinking what social organization and warfare were like during the Bronze Age. Were the Bronze Age warriors (organized) as a tribal coalition, the retinue or mercenaries of a charismatic leader  a kind of warlord  or even the army of an early kingdom? Inselmann said. For a long time, researchers argued that Bronze Age violence was a small-scale affair involving tens of individuals from local communities, but Tollense blows that theory wide open, Molloy said. We have many sites where we find evidence of mass killing and even slaughter of whole communities, Molloy said, but this is the first time that the demographics of the dead are those we can reasonably argue were warriors and not, for example, whole families migrating. Bronze Age societies built fortified settlements and smiths to forge weapons, but Tollense shows that both were more than just displays of power, he said. Tollense shows us that they were also created for very real military purposes including full scale battles that involved armies on the march, moving into hostile lands and waging war, Molloy said.!ping HISTORY&amp;GER","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|4yBx0sP3dg4dq)I stand with Israel","title":"AOC blames pro-Israel group for Democrats' 2024 election losses"},{"text":"Like Ozzy Osbourne's daughter infamously said on The View \\"Whose going to be left to clean your toilets?\\"","title":"The argument that we shouldn't deport illegals because we need their cheap labor is essentially an argument for slavery"},{"text":"Thank you!

It was only after he got the presidency that he came out in full force for the progressive causes he's remembered for (neglecting that he's also remembered for Vietnam, but heycomplicated man), and he was able to do so in part by appealing to Kennedy's legacy.Those circumstances, a fairly centrist-seeming candidate who's able to hide behind a party realignment to climb the ladder and ascends the presidency by coincidence, are pretty remarkable. You're absolutely right that we need someone unafraid to swing the hammer (though maybe not as...literally as LBJ did), but it's gonna be difficult to get that person into office with divisions as high as they are now.

Just because he didn't physically steal from them doesn't negate that it was theft.Everybody benefitedPardon? How? While some early investors received returns, many more C especially those who invested later C lost their entire investment when the scheme collapsed. The total losses were estimated at around $65b, and as the original commenter noted, many lost their life savings. How did they benefit?also this is inconsistent with your stated definition of \\"hurt\\" elsewhere:I consider a felony non-violent if it meets the following criteria: Nobody is hurt, physically or emotionally. Groups of individuals, such as companies, do not count because a company is not a sentient being. Emotional damage does count because it does hurt somebody.I would certainly say that being financially ruined would cause me a great deal of emotional distress and hurt.This definition puts you on very unstable ground: anyone can state that they were emotionally hurt by something, and it's not something that can be proven definitively.Perhaps you would like to change your view to something a bit more concrete with a definitive scale? Large-scale defrauding and victimizing of vulnerable people should simply not be equated with a person stealing food from a grocery store to survive. Aperson stealing a small amount out of necessity should not be considered on the same level as people who are privileged enough to exploit vulnerabilities in the system and effectively steal billions of dollars from broader society. The indirect effects of the latter must be taken into consideration C large-scale tax fraud causes a massive lack of funding for, e.g., essential governance and public services, like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. You could argue that that causes a lot of physical and emotional harm to many people in society through the deterioration of these structures.Let's take the example of tax fraud: it is already the case that small-scale tax evaders (even unintentional ones) are much more likely to be investigated by the IRS because wealthier people have entire legal teams to protect them, which makes the whole process lengthier and less likely to succeed from the IRS' perspective. What you're arguing for would effectively lead to no consequences whatsoever for this behavior, especially if one could easily afford the fines or whatever you are suggesting. This would cause increased inequality, which it seems is against your general underlying ideology here (apologies if I'm misinterpreting that, but the rest of the argument stands either way).","title":"CMV: All Non-violent felonies should be reduced to misdemeanors"},{"text":"Because the D is all that counts.","title":"How come no one is talking about Biden approving missle launch but if it was Donald it would be mentioned everywhere by now?"},{"text":"lol.

James Talarico] told me, is people who say, Im an atheist, agnostic, or I left the church or I left religion. But this is the kind of Christianity I can believe in.Last August, he enrolled in seminary to get his Master of Divinity  which, with any luck, hell receive in 2025 in order to become a pastor, right around the time he might begin to look at running for governor in 2026.In the 2018 midterms, at just 29, he flipped his suburban Austin, Trump-leaning district blue, winning it by 2 points, one of only a handful of Texas Democrats to do so that year.Like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, [Tony Coelho, the veteran Democratic talent scout,] said, Talarico is a politician with strong views and round edges. He continued, This kid, in my view, is one of the best Ive seen.Doctors diagnosed [Texas Rep. James Talarico] with diabetes, and he found out the insulin would cost him $684 a month. He understood immediately the burden that cost would place on his constituents, so he wrote a Twitter thread about the experience that received more than 50,000 retweets. But he attempted to back that up with real change, authoring and passing a bill that capped insulin copays at $25 a month. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed it into law. Hes already notched serious bipartisan accomplishments in his two terms. In his first session, his name touched no fewer than 112 pieces of legislation; 25 became law.Whats the frenetic pace of legislation all add up to? I am looking forward to running statewide, Talarico said. In another conversation, he told me that Ted Cruz would be fun to debate. Talarico and his advisers have discussed possibly challenging Cruz next year or Gov. Greg Abbott in 2026. But those close to him say hes leaning toward a bid against the governor, especially now that Rep. Colin Allred has entered the race against Cruz. Talarico is expected to launch a statewide political action committee, Big and Bright PAC, later this year.","title":"Jon Stewart to Democrats: Exploit the loopholes"},{"text":"This sub is so full of misinformation.

Not that the IJs do many favors, but the fact is that the law and courts require it. Bed space in detention is very limited in proportion to the number of illegal aliens (and legal yet possibly deportable aliens). There are 600 IJs. The line is very, very long, and detained aliens go first. If there's no bed space, the alien is \\"non-detained\\" and might see an IJ in a few years, after which he has married a US citizen and has a couple of kids...which, with an approved I-601A, makes him eligible for permanent residency. Absent that, and if his asylum claim is denied, then he will likely be ordered removed. Then, his docket officer (or HQ for some countries) will arrange to get a travel document. You don't need it for certain Central American countries, but you do for pretty much everywhere else. Southeast Asia? Certain African countries? Central/West Asia? China? Russia? It ain't gonna happen unless the alien is wanted for a crime back home and they actually want to get their pound of flesh (most of the time they're just happy to be rid of him). Even South Korea and the UK can be difficult to get a TD from. Meanwhile the clock is ticking, and you cannot hold an alien indefinitely if he is cooperating to the best of his ability. Within six months he will usually have to be released, most often at less than 90 days, unless you can accomplish everything above and get him deported...and that's not even taking into account the Board of Immigration Appeals or US District Court of Appeals.So yeah, Trump talks a big game, and both sides, generally ignorant of the process, believe him.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"They are already planning to purge the generals, purging the MIC seems plausible enough.

The Democrats have long suffered from an identity crisis, and this latest rejection of Crockett in favor of the entrenched Dingell perfectly encapsulates why they continue to flounder. The party clings to outdated, safe strategies that are more about maintaining the status quo than addressing the root causes of societal unrest. Its almost as if theyve convinced themselves that incrementalism is a virtue rather than a failure to act boldly when the moment demands it.What makes this even more frustrating is the sheer unwillingness to embrace the energy and ideas of younger, more progressive leaders. Crockett, for all her imperfections, represents a fresh, aggressive approach to messagingsomething the Democratic Party desperately needs if it ever hopes to combat the GOPs firehose of disinformation. Instead, they double down on centrists like Dingell, who may be competent in their own right but offer nothing new to inspire voters or counter the hard-rights propaganda machine.The Stockholm syndrome comparison is painfully apt. The Democrats love to scold their base for daring to want more, painting progressives as unrealistic while ceding ground to conservatives on issue after issue. This has alienated countless voters, especially younger ones, who see through the hollow promises and recognize that the party isnt truly fighting for transformative change.At this point, I agree that a breakaway movement may be the only path forward. The DNC has shown time and again that it cannot be reformed from within2016 and 2020 shouldve made that crystal clear. A new coalition of progressives, independent of the party machine, could force the Democrats to confront their complacency and either adapt or lose relevance entirely. Its a gamble, sure, but whats the alternative? More of the same milquetoast centrism that does little to address the existential crises were facing? Thats the real risk.The time for half-measures has long passed. The GOP is charging ahead with its authoritarian playbook, and the Democrats lukewarm resistance simply isnt cutting it. If the DNC refuses to evolve, progressives need to stop wasting their energy trying to save it and start building something truly representative of the people they claim to champion. Otherwise, were doomed to repeat this cycle until its too late.","title":"The Democratic Party needs to go"},{"text":"This is what pisses me off, dems are playing politics like they are dealing with a normal political party with republicans when they should be getting down and dirty with them.

You might well say, theres nothing wrong with building a colony on the moon and sending unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime there. Ok, cool, lets agree theres nothing wrong with that. Whats next? Do you see what Im getting at? My adult daughter is adopted and of Mexican descent. She has birthright citizenship granted to her via the 14th Amendment to the Constitution (for now at least). She also has a learning disability and some mental health issues which make it difficult for her to communicate at times. What happens if she gets pulled over and accused of committing a crime? Youve said committed a crime, but I assume you mean, been convicted of committing a crime in a court of law, right? How does she prove she isnt an unauthorized  immigrant? She isnt married and has no children how do I find out shes in lockup and about to face deportation so I can bring the documentation needed for her trial? I was once in family court (I was a foster parent for many years) and one of the adult members of the family involved in the case didnt show up in court one day. The commissioner (like a judge) demanded to know where this person was and the bailiff informed them that this person had been pulled over for a traffic infraction and is now in ICE custody and there was little chance wed ever see them again. That was the end of the case, this member of the family was just gone, totally beyond the reach of the State Court. Do you really think theres nothing wrong with that? What about the people in that family who were left behind?

Cowboy Bebop is a Sci-fi show focused on a rag tag team of bounty hunters. The character writing is extremely compelling, the action is similar to that of a 90s movie mixed with some spaceship dogfighting, and the animation is gorgeous.\\n2. Monster (2004) is about a Japanese brain surgeon living in post cold war Germany who finds out that a young boy whose life he saved turned into a horrifying serial killer. So, the doctor vows to kill the Monster he inadvertently created. Genuinely the best written show/manga I've ever seen, it's a fantastic mystery thriller.\\n3. My Hero Academia is about a high school student named Deku who lives in a world where half of the population have quirks (i.e. superpowers). He wasn't born with any quirk, but due to his bravery in trying to save another student, he runs into the world's number 1 hero who passes down his quirk to Deku. So the show is about Deku learning to control his newfound abilities while villains plot to upend society as a whole. Really good action, a fun variety of characters, &amp; a general good time until the consequences start to ramp up towards the end of the series. \\n4. Star Trek: The Next Generation is a Sci-Fi show set in the far future about a space crew who explores the Galaxy looking for the unknown. The show can be both intentionally &amp; very unintentionally hilarious with its campy action &amp; bad special effects. But the real neat &amp; potatoes are the philosophical discussions. Topics about what defines life, what inherent rights do all sentient beings deserve, and so on. \\n5. Arcane is mostly focused on two sisters who find themselves caught up in the unrest of a city dealing with power struggles between the ultra rich &amp; the poor. I don't want to give toomuch away since imo it's vest experienced blind. The show uses brand new animation techniques that make it breath takingly gorgeous and this show has stellar writing. Season 2 is currently airing so it's a great time to get into it.\\n6. Psych is a buddy cop show about a a guy who's observation skills are so good, he cons people &amp; the police into thinking he's psychic. Just a laid back mystery comedy where you can turn your brain off &amp; enjoy yourself. \\n7. Pantheon is an animated show about how the world would react to the technology of being able to transfer a human mind into a computer. It goes deep into the ditches about how world governments, corporations, &amp; individuals caught up in this would handle such a revelation. A very fascinating &amp; underrated show.

Only immigration agencies (ICE, CBP) can enforce immigration law, aside from the 287g program through ICE.As far as committing a crime. Most aliens are arrested for driving without a valid license. They still have to get to work, church, go to the doctor, grocery store, and so on. We'd be pissed if they weren't working. If they have kids they're taking kids to school. Consider that US citizens do the exact same thing every day, clearly they have the same lack of respect for the law. Why should it be any different? A US citizen didn't necessarily earn citizenship, I was born here, and my family came here about 400 years ago (without visas or greencards). Also consider that once upon a time, the Mexican border was much further north...if you're Texan, Californian, New Mexican, Arizonan, then your ancestors were themselves Mexican citizens. The border moved.But, I can agree that it's \\"less wrong\\" to deport an unaccompanied adult alien for committing a crime than one who has a family, or who has committed no crime.Asylum law requires applying for asylum in a safe country. If Mexico is a safe country, then how come there's not a lot of American migration there? Do you want to live in Mexico? I sure as hell don't. Some countries and political entities also do not entertain asylum claims. It sounds funny to say it, but Hong Kong is one notable place that doesn't grant asylum to anyone, they will refer you to mainland China for that (where the chance is slightly greater than 0%).If someone is too dangerous to be allowed in the US, then they shouldn't be released from jail. It's not any better that his victims will be in whatever country he's deported to. Is it okay if he murders, rapes, or assaults someone as long as it doesn't take place on US soil? Is it okay if he drives drunk and kills someone as long as it's not on an American road? Is selling dope okay as long as it's sold elsewhere? Personally I'm not going to feel any relief that a pedophile gets deported and then abuses children in some other country.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I see Vice President Trump couldn't get President Musk to take action, at least not here; no, he's currently getting in all kinds of trouble at Maralago.","title":"GOP No-Shows Help Dems Push Through Biden Judicial Nominees"},{"text":"Which is why I am firmly in the camp of \\"if they go low we go lower.\\"If they want politics to be mud wrestling then fine.

You try to dismiss this as oh, the company can easily afford to pay more, but how do you think the company is making those fat stacks in the first place?

Roy Cooper, who could approve it, veto it, or let it pass without signing it.The bill has skipped typical processes for debate and committee-level vetting, being released to the public just minutes before Tuesday's session began. Republican leaders in the House and Senate met in secret to hammer out the details ahead of the vote.-Multiple changes in the bill would limit the power of the attorney general, such as banning the office from taking stances in court that don't align with the opinions of state legislative leaders, and banning the office from automatically being allowed to advocate for customers at the state commission that oversees Duke Energy and other utilities.It would also enact a new strategy to strip the governor's control over the State Board of Elections  a goal state Republican leaders have been chasing for nearly a decade, only to be repeatedly thwarted by voters and state courts. And it would eliminate state commissions on energy policy and school safety that are led by offices currently held by Republicans, the lieutenant governor and superintendent of schools, in offices Democrats won the elections for this year.-The first 12 pages of the 131-page bill deal with Helene recovery efforts. The rest is dedicated to unrelated provisions.-Some of the unrelated changes included in the newest Helene bill Tuesday would:* Create new judicial positions to be appointed by the legislature instead of being elected, like most judgeships in North Carolina are. It's a strategy lawmakers began last year to ensure more Republican judges are in office around the state.\\n* Eliminate the Wake County judicial seat held by Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins, a Democrat who ruled against GOP lawmakers in a high-profile 2018 lawsuit over gerrymandering and voter identification requirements.\\n* Make the State Highway Patrol an independent agency, giving the legislature the ability to vote down Stein's pick to run the agency. Lawmakers did the same with the State Bureau of Investigation last year.\\n* Take away the governor's ability to pick a majority of members on the Utilities Commission, which regulates energy companies.\\n* Eliminate the state Energy Policy Council and the Task Force for Safer Schools, each of which are chaired by state leaders who are currently Republicans but which Democrats won election for this year  lieutenant governor and state superintendent of schools.Barber said the various changes seem particularly undemocratic given that they all appear directly aimed at rejecting the message voters sent just days ago, in the 2024 elections, about what they want from state government.It's stuff like this that Democrats need to blast everywhere: news, local publications, local talk shows, radio shows, podcasts, social media, etc. Go on the offensive on communication and keep the voters educated.","title":"NC House votes to strip power from incoming Democratic governor, AG as part of Helene aid bill"},{"text":"Oh, Im sorry, even though literally none of this ever happened, if it _did_ happen Im super curious why running an online network would make someones opinion valuable as to what cuts to make at the Pentagon.

In retrospect, yes, Biden should have refused to run for a second term, which put democrats in a tough spot this election, but there are still some roadblocks in place for Republicans come next term.Looking at the last eight years alone, two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.Contrarily, the Trump/MAGA coalition has had four years to prepare an agenda that will bring about a crisis of incompetence at every level government, and pave the way for Republicans to consolidate power. If Trump won in 2020, the midterms would have probably been more favorable for Democrats though. and judging by the shit show in the house the last two years, the GOP would have probably been even more powerless due to the Republican factionalism we've seen.Also, a second consecutive Trump presidency would have completely tarnished his legacy, considering that it was always going to be an uphill battle no matter who won in 2020.Inflationary issues, economic fallout from the pandemic, foreign conflicts, increased immigration, all of these things would have still occurred under a 2020 Trump presidency. (If you're skeptical about that last one, remember that there was a massive slowdown in immigration due to the pandemic, and subsequent migration/asylum restrictions). And judging by Trump's previous economic and foreign policy record, which was disastrous mind you, it's very likely that some of these issues would have been exacerbated by another Trump term.However, precisely because Biden is sandwiched between two Trump terms, his admin can forever be scapegoated by Republicans for any and all problems that may arise over the next four years. Whereas, if Trump won in 2020, Republicans would have, realistically, no one to blame but themselves. That probably wouldn't stop them from finding some way to blame Democrats though. What's really unnerving is the fact that Donald Trump will be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. He'll take credit for everything he can take credit for, and he'll blame others for everything he can avoid taking responsibility for.History is repeating itself. At the end of the last two Republican administrations, an economic crisis emerged, both times a Democrat stepped into office and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. And in the midst of this fallout, Republicans took advantage of the opportunity to turn crisis into campaign talking points.Donald Trump inherited a growing economy in 2017, and he left office in 2020 with the economy in tatters.Under Trump the national debt exploded.Under Trump Republicans passed tax cuts legislation that permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations, legislation that is estimated to cost the government trillions. During his first presidency, Trump instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. While his tariff proposals for his next administration are estimated to be far more economically damaging for Americans. While he was president, Trump pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His administration hamstringed the labor movement, made it more difficult for workers to unionize, weakened labor regulations and protections, reduced overtime pay eligibility, and implemented policies that generally favored employers over employees, taking power away from unions. Trump also mishandled the pandemic at nearly every turn, and was responsible, in no small part, for encouraging Republicans to politicize every aspect of COVID. The culture wars that ensued divided Americans during a time of crisis.It can't be emphasized enough that all of these things and more contributed to economic issues that extended into the Biden administration.In terms of his foreign policy, and I'll have to make this as brief as I can, he also cozied up to the world's autocrats and dictators, and escalated conflicts in multiple theaters. In fact, during Trump's presidency, Congress had to pass not one, but two historic war powers resolutions due to Trump's dangerous interventionism and his actions that directly led to increased provocations in multiple foreign regions. Trump weakened our alliances, emboldened our enemies, withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, abandoned our Kurdish allies, aided the Kremlin agenda and Russian proxy wars, sought to weaken NATO, rescind Russian sanctions, encouraged Russian cyber attacks, crippled our ability to act as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians, made allies with the Saudi crown Prince and emboldened and intervened in his violent, warmongering agenda in Yemen. Trump literally negotiated with terrorists, caved into the Taliban's pressures, made concessions that were dubious at best, and provided no Afghanistan withdrawal or evacuation plan for the next administration. And this doesn't even scratch the surface. Unfortunately, the fallout from all of this will be blamed on Biden in perpetuity, but ironically, if it were not for Biden winning in 2020, the outcomes under Trump would have been far far worse. That's the silver lining here I suppose, and maybe, considering everything, it's thinner than I imagined.It's a shame that such a large percentage of the American electorate does not make politically informed decisions, that they care more about their immediate circumstances than knowing anything I've mentioned previously about Trump's record.Walter Lippman, one of the most influential journalists in American history, called the general public an \\"irrational force,\\" nearly a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever.*Feelings* are what got Trump elected, and although there might be some of us looking forward to the next Trump administration crashing and burning, let's instead hope that Republicans run into enough obstacles, that any challenges or threats to democracy are met with the appropriate guardrails, and that the ramifications of a second Trump term are just critical enough to encourage Americans to make politically informed decisions moving forward.Edit: if you're going to respond, read the whole comment, don't just respond to the second or third paragraph and miss the part that addresses your response.

I dont know what they plan to do either, but its possible that the scope of the plan is simply larger than the original project to build the bridge was and that this is the major source of the cost disparity. There have been significant advances in construction technology not available back then that could, and likely will, be implemented into this project. These technologies should be worth it in the long run, despite adding to the cost, because they will last longer and be safer, meaning more bang for your buck with every dollar of taxpayer money. Im not saying you are wrong that the company should probably have to contribute some there too by the way.
