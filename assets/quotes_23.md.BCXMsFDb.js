Intentional by who, how specifically, and how is it organized?Most of the bizarre things we see, imo, flow logically from current conditions of capitalist nation-state competition. The US is at a political impasse and so this lack of ruling class unity tends to open space for both alternative political views (left and right polarization) but also conspiracy theory and a general populism. Capitalism is at an impasse since the Great Recession. They could recover profitability but not really fix the problems, so we have a kind of zombie neoliberal status quo with the main alternative being a creeping neo-fascism and both the center and right lined up to stop progressive populism or labor or socialism.The so-called culture war is asymmetrical. LGBTQ rights for example are only a cultural issue for straight people its just a direct rights issue for LGBTQ people. So what the culture war really is imo, is an attempt to discipline and control people under the guise of culture. Again, abortion is not a cultural choice for a pregnant person, its about their control over their medical situation. Back the blue is a cultural issue and identity for some people, not for people in highly policed areas where its not about culture but about your immediate environment and personal physical mobility (will I be stopped while driving, patrolled while waiting at the bus stop.) Immigration and trans people seem less culture war than classic scapegoating. So this could be intentionally manufactured (parts of it definitely are) or it could just have developed since the 90s and is not just seen as an easy go-to tool for creating panic and xenophobia.Neo-fascism is increasing across a lot of the world. I think rather than necessarily intentional (the far right has been trying to get to this point for a long time without as much success) it is more a development. The rise of Brics and the USs desire to prevent Chinas influence has made the old post-war and Cold War US system obsolete. The US kept it around though toyed with abandoning it during the invasion of Iraq but I think Trump represents the US abandoning this approach and seeing utility in a more direct militarism and backing various powers like in the pre-WWI imperial set-up.In short, the recession and war on terror broke the post-cold war status quo and this is why politics seems not normal we are in a transition period. If only more Democrat supporters would embrace this and this populist era rather than drag around a Weekend-at-Bernies corpse of New Democrat centrism.","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"No one stormed the capital?

That isnt to say debt hasnt always existed, we all know it has. Just pointing out how much a modern person has to get into often times, just to live a basic life.Basic life includes - Owning a house, Owning a new car, Going to college, Having the newest phone, and starting a business. Name me one other time in history that that was the \\"basic\\" life. You aren't owed any of those things and if you dont have the money don't buy them. Basic life when my mom was growing up was living in a boarding house with 6 other women and taking the bus to work, without any college degree. That was \\"basic\\".  Next, I want to highlight the inflation more, with it sharply increasing and peoples wages barely rising at all, combined with ridiculous cost of living that skyrockets every single year. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600QReal wages are up. Explain to me why it should cost just as much to live in my small town away from any major metropolitan area in a one bed room apartment as it does in a major city, rising over 1000-1500 dollars. Because thats what people will pay for it. Build more houses.  Other than the fact that private equity companies like black rock are buying up mass amounts of real estate and creating a chokehold where they charge people whatever they want to the point where the average person can barely even afford to live in a one bedroom or studio apartment literally anywhere in the country on their own, rural or metro. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-wall-street-investors-haven-015642526.html?guccounter=1You might have fun reading this.

Debt isnt some modern invention of oppression; it has always existed. The difference today is that loans enable opportunities like education, homeownership, and business venturestools for upward mobility when managed well. The real problem lies in stagnant wages and inadequate regulation, not some orchestrated scheme to enslave you.Inflation and housing costs are similarly mischaracterized. Inflation spikes due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical factorsnot because some shadowy entity wants to crush you. Housing affordability issues are systemic, driven by zoning restrictions, supply shortages, and market greed. Blaming firms like BlackRock for controlling the entirety of housing markets oversimplifies a multifaceted problem. These issues require reform, not paranoid scapegoating.Your media argument is equally weak. Outrage sells, and media companies exploit it to generate profitsits capitalism, not a divide and conquer scheme. And your outrage over diverse representation in media? Laughable. If seeing characters who dont look like you sends people into a spiral, thats a personal failing, not evidence of a global plot to divide society.The leap from these issues to a coordinated effort to provoke civil war and authoritarianism is pure fantasy. Whos running this conspiracy? Wheres the evidence? The world is messy, systems are flawed, and greed existsbut attributing it all to some master plan is intellectual laziness.

(Sounds familiar...). Sure, there were some specific actors who took advantage of the situation to achieve their self-interested goals, but if they had not, chances are very good that someone else would have.One of the basic assumptions of social science is that, while individual people are irrational and unpredictable, large groups of people tend to collectively react to circumstances in predictable ways that can be studied. A corollary to that is that big, world altering events are rarely if ever the product of conscious planning and actions by individuals. To be sure, sometimes individuals fine themselves in a position where their actions change the course of history in large ways--e.g., Stanislav Petrov during the Cold War, James Comey during the close of the 2016 U.S. President's race--but that is virtually always the product of chance, not some master plan to change the world.The Foundation series by Isaac Asimov and Tipping Point by Malcom Gladwell both deal heavily with these issues.","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"Remind us with the 14th amendment","title":"Biden urges Americans to never forget Jan. 6 attack: 'Cannot allow the truth to be lost'"},{"text":"Im all for having a woman of color as president one day just not *that* one.","title":"HISTORIC: Kamala Harris becomes the first woman of color to certify her own election loss before Congress"},{"text":"Why would anyone expect the government to tell us how it spends our money?

This always happens, to varying degrees, but we've seen a lot of corporate consolidation in recent years. Prices fluctuate more when big, globally connected companies hold sway in the economy.3) Rage bait sells. This has also always been true, but now there's more ways to distribute rage bait via social media with even fewer checks on its spread. Legacy media has never been \\"good\\" but is arguably worse now because they're looped in on the social media trend cycle as well and are trying to compete with it. Shows aren't going 'woke' any more than they used to, there's just way more coverage and focus on anything perceived as 'woke' than there was 20 years ago. We don't see the progressiveness of older shows because the things that were then progressive (e.g. having Kirk kiss Uhura on Star Trek) are no longer transgressive.  \\n  \\nUS politics, and specifically the Republican party, have also bought into the rage bait cycle in recent years.

Have you? Police and justice systems at large have been shown repeatedly to not be interested in harm reduction. If you want specific examples, feel free to Google \\"innocent POCs murdered by police\\" and see how many results you get. Breanna Taylor being shot in her sleep by police blind firing through her front door. Derell Mickles being shot in public, where the police injured 3 other bystanders and another cop because he skipped the fare. Tamir Rice being shot for the crime of being a 12 year old playing with a toy gun in his own backyard. Spreading awareness includes bringing these up, but do you expect to be spoonfed every single one of these by someone who's willing to do the legwork you aren't? Further, firing those particular cops don't solve the problem in the slightest, and that's when they get fired instead of a paid vacation. The system begins before them, with people like David Grossman teaching \\"killogy\\" to people who call themselves peace officers. And that goes to the very root of our police system. When it was started, most police came from slave catchers and ex military, the ones with experience catching folks who weren't afraid of fighting. There are plantations (since converted to prisons) filled with POC unjustly targeted by police (who have quotas to fill) because if that free (slave) labor isn't produced, the state gets fined for it.Look up Angola Farm, as a specific example. 76% of the inmates are black, 71% of the inmates have life sentences, the prisoners are sent into LITERAL COTTON FIELDS, while the cops call themselves 'freemen'. The plantation earned its name because when it was founded, most of the enslaved black men were from Angola. The plantation produces 4 million pounds of vegetable crops a year, sells cattle for beef at markets, and breeds horses for field work. All done by black men who aren't getting paid and aren't allowed to leave. It is literally just slavery as maintained by the constitution, where the 13th amendment still to this day states, \\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime...\\" in a judicial system armed with police that have been shown over and over targeting black communities. There isn't a John \\"Racism\\" Smith we can find to stop these entities that do exist outside the scope of one individual. Not when the police force is built around maintaining this free prison labor at the expense of black communities.And the systems go deeper from there, like the CIA actively funneling drugs into black neighborhoods (crack in LA), redlining black districts, DMVs closing in predominantly black counties during elections with states that have voters ID laws (Alabama and Gov. Bentley). That is what systemic racism is. It's not your neighbor Joe saying the n-word, it's the policy and legacy put in place that by-design perpetuates modern racism. Rebuilding these systems to be fair isn't gonna be something someone on the internet can explain to you in a 'step 1, step 2, step 3 profit' format. It's gonna require reworking the whole system from the ground up, taking millions of people into consideration.

Need a phone for work or living, loan, need a house for your family, loan, need a car to get to work, loan, need to get a college or trade education loan, need to start a business, loan, and so on and so forth until inevitably one day you wake up to your eyeballs in debt and you are a complete slave, constantly paying and never getting your head above water. That isnt to say debt hasnt always existed, we all know it has. Just pointing out how much a modern person has to get into often times, just to live a basic life.the motivation behind getting people to take out loans is straight forward.  Banks can make money by collecting interest on debt.You are using this as evidence of a fairly exotic motive, but the real motive is simple and straight forward.  If you have money you want to loan it out to make more money.Next, I want to highlight the inflation more, with it sharply increasing and peoples wages barely rising at all, combined with ridiculous cost of living that skyrockets every single year. Explain to me why it should cost just as much to live in my small town away from any major metropolitan area in a one bed room apartment as it does in a major city, rising over 1000-1500 dollars. Other than the fact that private equity companies like black rock are buying up mass amounts of real estate and creating a chokehold where they charge people whatever they want to the point where the average person can barely even afford to live in a one bedroom or studio apartment literally anywhere in the country on their own, rural or metro.Again there is a much simpler and more straight forward explanation here.  If you have money and want to make more, one method is to buy property and maximize the amount of rent you can charge for that property.Furthermore take media, I would like to preface this by saying I am neither conservative or liberal, I am as moderate as they come. But the constant culture wars and identity politics played in every single legacy news media company throughout the west is driving people to the point of insanity with its divisiveness. Looks at movies, shows, video games, the replacing of characters and racial politics that media companies play games with simply for no other reason than to just piss people off and further divide people by cultural and racial group serves to do nothing more than increase hatred and further conflict.The explanation for the culture war is less straight forward i think.In part, I think it is actually happening.  The number of people who identify as Christian has decreased massively.  Christians want their ideology pushed in schools and Christian ideology has been removed from public schools, meanwhile there is a real movement to make schools more accepting and supportive of LBGTQ people.the culture war sells.  It attracts and keeps users on social media sites.  And it helps politicians gets votes.  Lots of people will vote for the Pro-Life/Choice candidate.result in worldwide violence, civil war, and authoritarian leadership.who benefits from worldwide violence and civil war?

One of my parents works for the local town government. As part of this, they are legally obligated to pay into a pension fund that they can receive a pension from if they work there for 10+ years. At the same time they are also legally obligated to pay into social security. As things stood (before Biden signed this bill into law) once retired (can anyone even afford to retire anymore honestly?) the value of their pension (past a certain dollar amount) would be deducted from their social security. So, despite paying a considerable amount of their bi-monthly paycheck into pension funds and social security they would receive relatively little of what they paid in overall. This can also affect widows/widowers by the way. Pre-bill signing a retired schoolteacher married to a retired plumber (for example) could find (when their plumber spouse passes) their social security survivor benefits vastly reduced due to the existence of their teacher's pension.I would also point out that many town, city, and municipality jobs in America do not pay particularly well, and so this pension can make a real difference when it comes to the possibility of being able to retire with some degree of dignity.","title":"Biden signs bill to increase Social Security benefits for millions of public workers"},{"text":"\\"Professional does job to the minimum standard\\"Sad when that is a headline in this country.

Who is responsible? What are the concrete steps to fix it?That sounds like a \\"you\\" problem. These questions have answers and their fairly easy to find, however you have to put some work in. Activists have to compete in the same social media/soundbite/clickbait environment that everyone else does. That makes it almost impossible to explain very complex issues and activists have very little control over this. Activists will give long, nuanced interviews to the press, only to see everything they've said edited down to the 20 seconds that is most inflammatory. If you want to understand an issue like \\"systemic racism\\" you are going to have to seek out that information on your own. Luckily there are endless resources to do so right at your fingertips because it's 2025. \\"By framing societal issues in broad terms, activists create a scenario where everyone is complicit and no one is directly responsible.\\" There are more effective and less effective activists. However as a general rule, political organizers want the most specific target they can get because that makes campaigns more likely to win. So if you're seeing people frame issues in a way where no one is directly responsible, then you're either watching inept activists, or you're not understanding something. But no skilled organizer or activist would do that on purpose. \\"Then theres the money. Activist organizations frequently lobby for public funds, claiming they need resources to fight these systemic issues.\\" Public funding doesn't go to political organizing  at least not in any significant quantity. There are many organizations that also do social service work. For example on organization might run a homeless shelter and also have a department that does activism and advocacy on behalf of homeless people. Any or most public funding they got would be going to the homeless shelter not the advocacy department. As a rule activism is funded through individual donations and foundation grants. \\"From what Ive seen, the money often goes to performative effort like workshops, social media campaigns, and endless panel discussions that dont seem to improve anyones life. Meanwhile, critical public services like law enforcement, the judiciary, and victim support systems remain underfunded. These are institutions that deal with real harm: solving crimes, protecting communities, and ensuring justice for victims. Yet, theyre losing resources to what feels like political theater. The consequences are significant. With fewer resources, police and justice systems are stretched thinner, making it harder for them to investigate crimes, prosecute offenders, and provide support to victims.\\"This is a massive misunderstanding of how funding is distributed. I also have a substantive disagreement about the claim you're making about who is \\"dealing with real societal problems.\\" But I want to separate that out. The police and the judiciary aren't losing money to political activism. That is just not a thing. At all. I dare you to find me a single place where police funding was transferred to an activist group. (Again, you would have a hard time finding an organization getting government funding for their activism period, let alone getting repurposed police funding.) There is another much more complicated discussion to be had about the value of funding the police/judiciary, etc. but just as a matter of fact, most police departments across the US have had their funding increased, not decreased since the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. So whatever else is going on, politicians are not starving police departments for funds. (BTW there is also basically no evidence that more police funding leads to lower crime, but again that's a complex topic for another time.)In addition, you likely don't realize just how much public policy is advanced by activist advocacy groups. Do you like not having child labor? Workplace safety protections? Clean drinking water? An ozone layer? Paid family leave and medical leave? Parental leave? Consumer safety laws? Airbags and seatbelts? How about not having unchecked, endemic police brutality? Not having an HIV/AIDS epidemic? Not having legal racial segregation? Reproductive rights? Gay rights? Every single one of these victories happened because of activist groups outside the government fighting tooth and nail for change. In many cases these groups do the first draft of the legislation that elected officials introduce (and often later take credit for) and these organizations may do as much or more than politicians' staffs to negotiate and lobby to get a bill passed. \\"They excel at pointing out problems but rarely offer practical solutions. For instance, they might criticize policing as systemically racist but fail to provide realistic reforms that balance accountability with public safety.\\" The media isn't interested in policy and neither is the public  people seek out conflict and clickbait because it's more exciting. So you might not have seen the voluminous, detailed public policy proposals, draft legislation, and rigorous research papers produced by police reform activists across the country. That's, again, a \\"you\\" problem (and a media problem). The problem is compounded by the asymmetric way that the public and the media treat the institutions that we are familiar with, vs. things that are new. So for example, no matter how huge the budget for police and prisons get, no one blames the police for failing to prevent large amounts of crime and societal dysfunction. And yet when alternatives that prioritize public health or other non-policing solutions are proposed, they are scrutinized to a degree that the police never are. And yet you will find very little data showing that arresting more people and putting them in jail lowers the crime rate. \\"When people see activists receiving millions in funding without producing tangible outcomes, they grow skeptical, not just of the activists but also of the governments and institutions that support them.\\" Again, this does not happen. \\"Im open to changing my view if someone can provide evidence or arguments that prove activism today is delivering measurable benefits, especially compared to the resources it consumes.\\" Basically anytime your city or state passes a law, there's an activist group of some kind behind it. (BTW, groups that advocate for more police funding are activist groups ?they're just not left wing activist groups.)","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"I don't understand your comment.

The threads were also surprisingly very civil, at least comparatively.In my personal life, there have been more than a few women who openly talk about how they take advantage of men. No one really says anything about it though. I recognize there are shitty people, but it would be nice if there was more recognition and pushback about misandry.

You are right, actions that are harmful should be punished. But in order for the action to be punished, there has to be a general consensus within the public that an action is in fact wrong in the first place and should be punishable. . This can be applied to many different laws and changes that have come about throughout the history of at the very least the United States.For example, slavery. We now understand that slavery is wrong and should be punished, but there had to be activists, scholars, writers, etc. to explain to the general public over the course of several decades why slavery is something wrong to even begin with. The general public had to be convinced that slaves were actually people worth valuing in the first place. There is no legislation that could have made that possible until there was a cultural shift that addressed the underlying societal issue of blatant racism. It is the same with sexism. People have to believe that the action is wrong for it to be considered punishable. That is one of the main purposes of activism. Raising awareness about an issue and convincing people that it is something they should care about and something that is wrong. And explaining why its wrong. If the general public believes that women are less-deserving and subservient to men, it going to be hard to create any solutions that address an issue that people don't believe even exists. So what I'm saying is that the people who are in charge of enforcing have to believe in a 'perpetrator' and 'victim' in the first place. Labeling something as wrong does require structural and systematic change, it doesn't just come as a revelation to some high-profile individual who can put legislation in place to punish it.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"Youre asking for simple answers to complex problems. Activists often rely on broad, undefined language. They talk about systems or structures as if these are sentient entities causing harm, while avoiding the need to pinpoint specific people, policies, or actions responsible for the problems they claim to address. Some issues are structural issues. The fact that you dont know what that term means isnt evidence that it shouldnt be used. For example, when someone says systemic racism, I find myself asking, What exactly do you mean? Who is responsible? What are the concrete steps to fix it? You dont ask this question to many activists if you havent gotten answers to this very straightforward question. By framing societal issues in broad terms, activists create a scenario where everyone is complicit and no one is directly responsible.There are very few people who would vote for a bill that states it wants to (for example) keep black people poor or that hurt gay people but we vote for things every year that do just that. If you only engage with *explicit* oppression, you allow lots of bad stuff to continue under the guise of wanting to know whos directly responsible.From what Ive seen, the money often goes to performative effort like workshops, social media campaigns, and endless panel discussions that dont seem to improve anyones life. Meanwhile, critical public services like law enforcement, the judiciary, and victim support systems remain underfunded. What have you seen? No one can respond if you simply **conclude** that money that goes to unnamed organizations with unknown causes and doesnt do anything.With fewer resources, police and justice systems are stretched thinner, making it harder for them to investigate crimes, prosecute offenders, and provide support to victims. Your assumption here is that the justice system and police support these marginalized groups and in many cases, thats the exact opposite point that these activists would make.

That requires delayed gratification though. I want to highlight the inflation moreYes, inflation is bad, it robs you of the money you already have by devaluing it. Inflation occurs from excessive government spending and since Covid and current political trends encourage spending for things like Green projects, transportation projects, welfare/UBI, and healthcare, politicians have responded by spending more and more to drive inflation.Explain to me why it should cost just as much to live in my small town away from any major metropolitan area in a one bed room apartment as it does in a major cityBecause the governments have a reliable voting base of older people.  Those older people have most of their retirement tied into their house, so it has been an active government policy to re-inflate the housing market so that those home owners get the value of their house back.  That includes restricting new builds so that excess quantity doesn't reduce the price and to increase demand to buy by giving out loan assistance.  This prices a lot of people out of the market which increases demand for rentals since there are a lot of people looking and that raises the rent prices too.Other than the fact that private equity companies like black rock are buying up mass amounts of real estate and creating a chokeholdThis is true and feeds into the above section of demand, but in BlackRock's case, I think it's more of a protection of their assets against inflation because they know government inflates housing prices.  So to shield themselves from inflation, they bought property whose value goes up when inflation occurs. culture warsI'd say this has been ongoing for decades, with the most recent stuff being more extreme because it's testing the limits of liberalist thought (you do you).

I think it's really a combination of driving forces from several groups. Caught in between is the common folks.Take housing. On one side, we have mass immigration. More period= more need for housing. Then we have developers who only want to build expensive houses, not starter houses. Then we have rental corporations who are actively gobbling up single-family homes.Then we have city planners who only greenlight apartments, not lower-middle class homes. Then we have banks who use predatory lending practices. All of these together work to drive up housing, and prevent people from getting a mortgage that allows them to eventually pay off the house and retire, and/or use the equity to get a better place. They're not necessarily caused by one corporation or group, but they're combining to crush the lower and middle classes.Why?Because at every level, these policies enrich and empower the people who push them.

We need to understand why and then address appropriately. Take everyday sexism, those individual people learnt it from somewhere didn't they? And they undoubtedly taught it to others if they had the chance. How do you address that? You can't punish millions of people, and punishment is probably not the best action either for the most part Spreading awareness is addressing those individuals, it's telling them that what they're doing is wrong and showing them that other people see it as wrong. then its still about addressing those individuals who perpetuate that behavior, not just calling out broad concepts like \\"patriarchy\\" or \\"misogyny.\\"Those aren't broad concepts though.

Thats what we all wake up praying for. /sIve yet to see a valid rationale for how the establishment dems can lose again and again and still think offering little and doing less is a good idea!","title":"Democrats blame Merrick Garland slow-rolling Trump investigation for election loss: 'Fatal mistake'"},{"text":" Activists often rely on broad, undefined language. They talk about systems or structures as if these are sentient entities causing harm, while avoiding the need to pinpoint specific people, policies, or actions responsible for the problems they claim to address.So for an example, let's take climate change. What are the specific people, policies, or actions that are causing it? Is there one specific cause you can point to and say \\"That's it, that's the thing that's causing climate change, and if we can fix that we're all good\\"? Or are there a *lot* of contributing factors that have to be looked at and managed? Because if you look into the issue, you may realize that it's not just a matter of burning fossil fuels for power plants, but also vehicle fuel for the international shipping industry, deforestation caused by industrial cattle farming, aquatic ecosystem collapse due to overfishing and ocean acidification, and many more \\"real\\" problems that are all really complicated to address. Because do you know how badly it would mess up the global economy to cut back on international shipping? Do you know how many competing national interests you need to satisfy to get marine conservation areas working? And that's only mentioning a few of the biggest causes!Because that's the thing about systems, from the environment to the economy to jurisprudence. They're built out of a thousand moving parts that all interact with each other, so fixing just one \\"real problem\\" might not fix everything that's wrong. You have to look at everything that's going on and understand the relationships between the pieces, and probably make dozens of small fixes to try to move the whole system in the direction you want. And because hundreds of different people put up those thousand different moving parts, how do you decide which one of them is \\"responsible\\"?Here's another example: microplastics. A large amount of microplastic contamination in the world today comes from the breakdown of synthetic fabrics over time as they're washed and dried. Acrylic or polyester blend shirts getting worn and thin, for example, are slowly shedding microplastics into the water system, which are too small to be removed again. But how do we solve this problem? Do we just ban synthetic fabrics? Well... no, because a huge majority of people rely on those sythetic fabrics for affordable clothing, so banning them would deal a terrible blow to the cost of living (plus put millions out of their jobs). Yet we can also see that certain trends of \\"fast fashion\\" are definitely making the problem much worse, causing people to buy and throw out cheap clothing at a highly accelerated rate. So what do we do? Do we ban Shien and Temu and other super-cheap fast fashion retailers? Do we ban the social media apps people are popularizing their \\"hauls\\" on? What's the practical solution you'd advocate for here? At least maybe by \\"raising awareness\\" in telling people that synthetic fabrics cause microplastic shedding, we can at least hope for *some* change by the kind of environmentally conscious consumers who can afford to switch to natural fibers, who might make different choices now that they know. And we can start gaining public support and momentum for any other, costlier changes that we might decide to initiate.Ultimately, here's the thing. I can't try to prove to you that \\"modern activists\\" are using their money effectively, because that's about a billion different organizations we're talking about here. I'm certain that some of them are definitely wasting the money. What I hope to change your mind about here is what \\"using their money effectively\\" *looks like*. For problems like systemic racism, where the thing you're fighting is a combination of historic (and current) lack of access to resources and opportunities, widespread underlying/subconscious beliefs about inferiority, and backlash from socially conservative elements who will refuse to agree there's even a problem; there's no such thing as simple straightforward solutions. For these problems, there *is* value in convincing people that the discrimination faced by others is real, and in teaching everyone to recognize and confront those ingrained subconscious beliefs, and in getting everyone on the same page that the problem exists to begin with. But how would I measure that value or prove it to you? What tangible metric would you accept?","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"The Jan 6th riot was because trump told them to fight like hell or theyll lose their country.

Yes, society is complex, but at the core of every societal issue, there are always perpetrators and victims. Whether its inequality in relationships, everyday sexism, or any other social issue, there are always specific individuals or groups causing harm, and those harmed by it. These individuals can and should be held accountable for their actions.For example, if were talking about inequality in relationships, the problem isnt some abstract societal force; its the behavior of specific individuals who perpetuate unequal power dynamics, whether its in a domestic setting, in the workplace, or in social interactions. The answer isnt simply spreading awareness and changing mindsets, but addressing the actions of those who perpetrate the harm. Everyday sexism is a behavior, and there are specific perpetrators behind it. Targeting those behaviors and holding individuals accountable is more effective than generalizing about societal structures.When you say that some things cant be legislated against, Id argue that even in those cases, the focus should be on identifying concrete problems and specific people involved. If there are systems or structures contributing to these issues, we should point to the specific actions or policies that need change. If its a matter of behavior or mindset, then its still about addressing those individuals who perpetuate that behavior, not just calling out broad concepts like \\"patriarchy\\" or \\"misogyny.\\"Activism can be broad, but it should always focus on identifying whos doing the harm and what concrete steps need to be taken to stop it. Throwing out abstract terms without pointing to specific perpetrators doesnt solve the problem; it just creates noise. Change happens when we focus on concrete actions, whether its changing laws, holding people accountable for harmful behaviors, or addressing the root causes of inequality in clear, actionable terms. Society doesnt need more slogans; it needs concrete steps to address the real harm being done by real people.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"More seriously, I think what you say is true, but in a kind of tautological way.Of course, activist groups that gain the most visibility and power will be those that are most intent on gaining those.

Certain regions of Africa are greening, and the arctic circle melting is generally a huge economic boon -- it enables mining in greenland and opens up northern trade routes. The greening in Africa is happening so extensively that it may actually be problematic for the region according to an MIT article I read on the topic a while ago. Even with all of this, it is still very obvious that the net effect of fossil fuels has been towards a more rather than less livable climate. Widespread climate control &amp; air conditioning has made previously uninhabitable regions of earth, like the american southwest, extremely desirable. Water reclamation and cleanliness is enabled by energy consuming treatment plants. This is reflected in the statistical reality that climate related deaths are down 99%+ since the industrial revolution, and the trend has not reversed. Meanwhile every cent you add to transporation costs, manufacturing costs, or energy costs has a direct relationship with one marginal family going without a meal, one marginal investment not being made, one hospital going without power in the developing world when someone could be getting treatment. It means one more city or settlement lacking access to clean water. It means essentially diminishing living standards in every conceivable way. So its certainly a tall order, maybe the tallest, to PROVE the real future economic costs of fossil fuel consumption, when there is absolutely nothing that even comes close to outweighing the positives in observable reality today.","title":"Biden to ban offshore oil, gas drilling in vast areas ahead of Trump term"},{"text":"Thats mostly on Garland.

Systems and structures are a framework of rules, norms, institutions, and practices created and perpetuated by human actions over times.While individuals may contribute to how these systems are run, systemic issues are often much bigger than a single person or individual policies and involve deeply embedded patterns of behaviors.The benefit of using broad terms like \\"systems\\" or \\"structures\\" is that it allows activists to address issues that are interwoven across different domains (for example, legal issues, economic issues, or social issues.) Narrowing focus to one aspect risks oversimplifying, and might not really fully address a problem. (As in, you don't want to simply put a band-aid on a smaller problem.)Who is responsible? What are the concrete steps to fix it?This is challenging to answer because responsibility is spread out over a wide area. Certain individuals or policies may play significant roles, but systemic problems exist because of the collective inertia of governments, social norms, or economic incentives.A call to address systemic issues often focuses on changing institutions, laws, and cultural practices, rather than assigning singular blame.I usually hear more generic statements or calls to raise awareness.Raising awareness isn't an end goal, but a means to encourage the public to mobilize for an issue. Many systemic issues persist because the public or policymakers are unaware or indifferent. Clear action plans often follow awareness campaigns once the issue has garnered sufficient attention.Activists do propose concrete actions (like policy reform or resource allocation), but these often require broader buy-in from the public in order to implement (hence the need to raise awareness.)And addressing systemic issues- because the problems are often so broad- requires iterative solutions that have to evolve as new information and feedback comes in, making it difficult to present a definitive, one-size-fits-all plan.I'll be really brief with this, but let's look at an issue like housing discrimination.  Housing discrimination, like redlining and exclusionary zoning, denied certain groups access to home ownership and wealth-building opportunities, concentrating poverty in specific neighborhoods. These policies created lasting inequalities, such as underfunded schools (due to property tax reliance,) fewer job opportunities, and poor access to resources like healthcare and fresh food. These conditions perpetuate cycles of disadvantage. Raising awareness of housing discrimination is just the first step. But possible solutions would be things like reforming school funding to be equitable, investing in affordable housing, addressing wealth gaps through reparative policies, improving public transportation, and ensuring community resources are accessible and fairly distributed. And I think an issue like OP is having is that people don't always connect these dots between the people raising awareness of the issues and the proposed solutions.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"Tough pill to swallow.

Or at least the unalienable right to life, liberty, property. And thats the standard? According to the Encyclop?dia Britannica: In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire economic policies.[33] This variety of liberalism is also known as modern liberalism to distinguish it from classical liberalism, which evolved into modern conservatism.FDR and his policies were profoundly against mans rights and turned the depression into the Great Depression. FDR is responsible for some of the worst, worse for mans rights, growth of the executive branch. You can trace how much power Biden had and Trump will have back to FDR. And the Unionization laws or the Wagner Act were a violation of mans rights as well.  American liberals have completely rejected liberalism while using the word liberal to maintain a veneer of respectability. Thats why American liberals are better known as leftists instead of liberals. American leftists have been leading the charge against property rights (or capitalism) and subsequently undermining mans other rights. American conservatives are more on the side of property rights, as badly as they do support them. The main thing conservatives done, badly while opposing property rights whenever it was convenient for them, is serve as a check on the lefts opposition to property rights. And thats why you cant point to much of theyve done.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"Mila Cohen was the only baby that died on Oct 7th.  7 months old she was shot through a safe room door.

Because if the Palestinians were focused more on their own identity than the \\"identity\\" of trying to reverse the historic injustice of the creation of a Jewish state on Arab land, then the occupation wouldn't be necessary.Thats why I argue that annexation and eventual citizenship might be a better long-term solution.

Even policies that encourage intermarriage between the two groups could foster unity over time, though such measures cannot and should not be enforced.Again - this is something that the Palestinians want even less than the Israelis.

Iran had already made it clear that it had no interest in escalation - its only direct involvements were both in response to Israeli attacks on Iranian Embassies and territory, so in this case there was no war to prolong. The Houthis have made it clear that they won't stop attacking Israel unless the war in Gaza ends. Israel will not be able to damage the Houthis the way it damaged Hezbollah because it doesn't have the intel or the proximity (strikes on Yemen require Israel to cross Saudi Arabia), so their only option for deescalation there is really to get a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. And that brings us to why there is no permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The simply answer is that Israel doesn't want one. Independently of Hamas's negotiation tactics, the Israeli government has flatly refused to accept any agreement that includes a permanent ceasefire. It's not clear to me how the Biden administration could have gotten Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire by providing more support - unless you think that they shouldn't have pushed them to provide humanitarian aid and should instead have let them starve all of Gaza to death? No ceasefire would have been needed in that case.","title":"CMV: The attitude of the West, alongside Biden's foreign policy in the Middle-East, was terrible, and his and Blinken's policies only prolonged the Israel-Hamas war."},{"text":"The attitude of the West, alongside Biden's foreign policy in the Middle-East, was terrible, and his and Blinken's policies only prolonged the Israel-Hamas war.You haven't really made the case for this in the text of your post. You never say what factors you think were actually involved in prolonging the war, nor do you state what alternative actions you think that the Biden administration could have taken that would have reduced the duration of the war.I think that the primary driver of the length of the war is actually just that the ruling coalition in Israel does not want the war to end. That was made pretty clear by the far that Netanyahu categorically refused to set achievable war aims or to outline a plan for after the war. The IDF strategy in Gaza has also not been geared towards ending the war. Here are some specifics:* Netanyahu's stated goals have been the \\"eradication of Hamas\\" or \\"total victory.\\" Everyone knows that these goals are unachievable. Yoav Gallant, the defense minister for most of the war made this clear, as did Daniel Hagari, the IDF spokeman. So the primary war aim was unachievable, which means that there were no criteria that would mark an end to the war from an Israeli perspective.\\n* Even if we consider the narrower war aim \\"removal of Hamas as a governing force,\\" which is more achievable, Israel's war strategy has not been consistent with achieving that aim. The US's history in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrated very clearly that once you clear an area of insurgents and the ruling group, it is essential to provide an alternative civil governing body to administer the area. Without that, there is a power vacuum that gets filled with returning insurgents. Israel has known this from the beginning as US officials were part of strategy discussions from day 1. Nonetheless, over a year later Israel has yet to identify an alternative governing body and they are playing a predictable game of whack-a- mole with insurgent groups in Gaza.Simply put, the strategic decisions Israel has made in Gaza are consistent with the goal of an indefinite war rather than a the goal of ending the war. This is not surprising because an indefinite war is aligned with Netanyahu's political interests: he was horribly unpopular and facing criminal prosecution after October 7th, and he needed to avoid accountability at all costs. As long as he is PM, it is highly unlikely that there will be any sort of government inquiry into his failures, and he has more leeway to delay his criminal case. The governing coalition that secures his position as PM depends on far-right groups that have threatened to leave his coalition if he ends the war. Together, these factors created a strong political incentive for him to prolong the war, and it has worked out for him - he is now the most popular person to lead Israel in recent polls.So the question then is \\"what could the Biden administration have done to alter the incentive structure in favor of ending the war?\\" Your proposal seems to be that he should have provided more full-throated support for Israel. I don't see how that would have given the ruling coalition in Israel any interest in ending the war. Imo the only way the Biden admin could have induced Israel to end the war (and this was in no way guaranteed) would have been to halt weapons sales to Israel. Because Israel received most of its weapons from the US, this would have forced it to ration supplies in a way that might have incentivized ending the war.

And the sooner the west confronts this, the better they start to understand what's actually happening over there.The Palestinian people can certainly be convinced and start to choose to abandon this national ethos. In my mind it starts with them confronting the very real and devastating consequences of this ideology: the complete destruction of Gaza, a loss of national dignity for decades, and seemingly eternal occupation. That means accepting and confronting defeat, and surrendering.I can certainly still feel awful for all of these people, even if they choose to cling to the destructive ideology that's been imprisoning them for so long.

Who is responsible? What are the concrete steps to fix it?There is an entire fields of study and millions of pages of white papers you can read that defines these terms. If you want to skip to the solutions, then there's lots of examples of implementation from big corporation's \\"DEI\\" initiatves, or the white house, example: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-roomstatements-releases/2021/03/21/fact-sheet-u-s-efforts-to-combat-systemic-racism/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-roomstatements-releases/2021/03/21/fact-sheet-u-s-efforts-to-combat-systemic-racism/)What really is at play is there's a no-win when it comes to social justice.

If someone does, then they'll help contribute towards how to make the policy implementation better.

The most successful cases of a nation turning themselves around were results of occupation without annexation or \\"full integration\\". And in fact were only accomplished through devastating military defeats, and the deaths of millions of people. Complete with actual indiscriminate bombing, demolishing entire cities in surprise attacks, attempts to maximize damage to civilians for shock and awe strategies, etc. none of these things have ever featured in any Israeli/Palestinian war, including the current one. See: Japan and Germany.If you're going to occupy a territory, you must either remove the existing population or embrace them as members of your society. Theres no in-between.Says you? It isn't a rule just because you said it with confidence. That's just you saying nonsense, confidently.You cannot occupy a territory indefinitely without a declared timeline or at least holding referendums, and expect any state structure to emerge that is positively inclined toward the occupying power.Israel has posed a pretty clear timeline: \\"you get a state when your national ethos is no longer trying to destroy ours\\". That could be tomorrow. But it's not something the Palestinians have even tried as of yet.Unless the process involves eventual annexation with citizenship, separation as a nominally independent territory protected by Israel, or the creation of a fully self-governed nation-state, the current state of occupation does not make sense.Of course it does. And in fact, annexing Palestine, something the Palestinians want even less than the Israelis, separation is not only morally correct, but legally required of Israel. Annexation is an explicitly illegal outcome of occupation. And the last time Israel did this, in 1988 with East Jerusalem, it was roundly chided by the international community for doing so, not commended for bringing equality to the East Jerusalem Palestinians.You cannot guarantee that a newly created nation-state will align its future political decisions with your diplomatic desires.I agree. But Israel simply isn't obligated to hand a gun to an enemy that has said that the first thing they will do with that gun is to shoot Israel in the head with it. Israel *can't* guarantee that Palestine will decide to forego its national ethos of \\"no Jewish state\\". Which is *why* occupation is necessary until it does, on its own terms. You might think occupation is sad (I do) and a cause of great suffering for Palestinians (I do), but you can't really say that Israel is obligated to do something different, when something different spells the end of their existence.You, like many westerners, seem to be under the impression that the Palestinians are simple reactive beasts who can only act on impulse. And that agency to make choices that are in their best interest are simply unavailable to them. In reality they're smart people who have very deep opinions about the Jewish state, and have religious and cultural reasons for believing in those opinions. They're also being handcuffed by those very same opinions and views. And at the end of the day, the Palestinians are responsible for their opinions and views, not Israelis or anyone else.","title":"CMV: The attitude of the West, alongside Biden's foreign policy in the Middle-East, was terrible, and his and Blinken's policies only prolonged the Israel-Hamas war."},{"text":"My point is that \\"they can NOT force us\\" is objectively false when they did successfully force us and no one's been held accountable.

It was much, much harder for me to vote for Harris.One of the main promises he made was to be a transitory, one-term president; to wipe clean the stain of Trump and help usher in the next generation of leadership.  This was overridden by arrogance and obstinate hubris as he sought reelection, *knowing* he was unfit.  He clung to this ruinous pride until the debate, when he could no longer hide his decline...and it was far too late for a primary, or indeed for anyone to mount a successful campain.We turned out for Biden, in droves.  One of his first acts as president, he broke the railway strike.  Nearing the end of his presidency, he refused to be in any way critical of Netanyahu.

Bitcoin mining increasingly uses renewable energy and helps stabilize power grids by providing flexible demand. Traditional banking uses way more energy when you add up all their offices, servers, and infrastructure.\\n#Crypto Talking Point #32 (stranded energy)**\\"Crypto/Bitcoin promotes renewable energy development\\"** / **\\"Crypto mining helps the energy industry\\"**There are four fundamental problems with arguing that crypto helps with energy:1.  Bitcoin's energy usage produces *absolutely nothing useful in the real world* - it's just a number guessing game to determine who wins the next block reward. It's a very expensive, energy-intensive \\"lottery\\" that is needlessly inefficient.2.  Crypto (and everybody in crypto) has an exclusive motivation is to make money.  There is no mandate to facilitate clean/renewable energy. There is no mandate to do *anything* to help others or the world. As such, crypto entities will always seek the cheapest form of energy, and it's well established at this point that fossil fuels (or stealing energy) offer the best ROI.  3.  Crypto's energy usage, specifically with schemes like \\"Proof-of-work\\" **require** energy to be expensive.  If energy was cheap and ubiquitous, it would undermine the design of blockchain and the PoW model and render it useless.4.  Any energy grid that has excess (stranded) energy that is significantly more than is typically needed, is not a grid that needs something/someone to use that energy; it's a grid that is poorly designed.I agree most altcoins are garbage. But that's like saying stocks are bad because penny stocks exist. Focus on Bitcoin - it has a fixed supply of 21M coins and the strongest network security by far.#Crypto Talking Point #16 (Bitcoin is different)\\"**Bitcoin is not \\"crypto**\\" / \\"**Bitcoin is different / a \\"commodity\\"**\\" 1.  This is what's known as an \\"Unstated Major Premise\\" fallacy.  A Naked Assertion.  Often employed as a begging-the-question fallacy.  Just because you say \\"Bitcoin is different\\" doesn't mean it is.\\n \\n 2.  There's absolutely no functional/material difference between BTC and thousands of other crypto-currencies, including versions using the exact same codebase.\\n \\n 3.  The *only* distinction BTC (currently) holds is that according to various shady, unregulated exchanges, it seems to be trading at the highest price point.  But even those figures are dubious due to the lack of transparency and oversight in the industry.  Just because one crypto is more popular, doesn't mean it's fundamentally different than others.  BTC shares 99.9% of its DNA with many cryptos including BCH, BSV and thousands of others.\\n \\n 4.  Crypto evangelists try to move the goalposts between bitcoin (the technology) and bitcoin (the \\"investment\\").   When you note that [bitcoin and most cryptos depending upon the context can pass the Howey test and be classified as securities](https://www.investopedia.com/does-crypto-pass-the-howey-test-8385183), they will reference bitcoin as a \\"technology\\" and not an investment.  And it's true, the tech itself isn't packaged as an investment, **but** various others do package crypto as an investment, and it's a pretty well established underlying concept throughout all of crypto (buy, hold, you will make money) - and those tenets are principals in the Howey test indicating there's an \\"investment contract\\" being promoted.  For example, right now the SEC may not consider BTC itself a security, but the process of staking BTC (and other cryptos) and offering a return, **[that is absolutely considered a security](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/exercise-caution-crypto-asset-securities-investor-alert)**. it has a fixed supply of 21M coins \\n#Crypto Talking Point #4 (scarcity)\\"**Only 21M!**\\" / \\"**Bitcoin has a \\"hard cap\\"**\\" / \\"**Bitcoin is 'scarce' and that makes it valuable**\\" / \\"**DeFlAtiOnArY cUrReNCy FTW**\\" / \\"**The 'halvening' will make everything better**\\" 1.  Even children are aware that scarcity is not a guarantee of value.  It's really a shame that crypto people cling to this irrational argument. \\n 2.  If there only being 21 million BTC were reason for it to be valuable, then why aren't other cryptos that also share similar deflationary characteristics equally valuable?  Why wouldn't something that is even more scarce than BTC be even more valuable?  Because scarcity is meaningless without demand and demand is primarily a function of intrinsic value and utility -- *not* scarcity.  See [here](https://ioradio.org/i/value/) for details.\\n 3.  Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and no material utility. It's one of the least capable stores or transfers of value. The *only* way anybody can extract value from crypto is by coercion -- forcefully convincing someone (usually through FOMO or scare tactics) that this is something they need, and it's often accompanied by unrealistic promises of significant returns.  Those returns are mathematically impossible for even a tiny percentage of holders.\\n 4.  Bitcoin also is not scarce.  There are multiple versions of Bitcoin, including Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision - both of which are limited to 21M tokens and in many cases are more technologically advanced than BTC.  Also, every time there's a fork of crypto, the amount of tokesn in circulation doubles.  Crypto proponents ignore these forks because they don't play into the \\"it's scarce\\" argument.  But any crypto fork absolutely siphons value away from the original version.  BTC might be priced higher than BCH, but BCH still holds value as well, and that's a total of 42M just of those two \\"bitcoin\\" versions that are out there, among hundreds of others.\\n 5.  The \\"hard cap\\" of 21M for BTC can easily be changed by altering a parameter in the source code.  Less than 6 people have commit access to the repo so BTC's source code control is centralized. It's entirely possible if BTC existed long enough to the point where block rewards weren't enough to motivate miners, and transaction fees became incredibly high, that influential players in the community would advocate increasing the cap and reinstating higher block rewards. So there are absolutely situations where the max amount in circulation could be increased.and the strongest network security by far\\n#Crypto Talking Point #19 (hashrate)\\"**Bitcoin's hashrate is up!**\\" / \\"**Bitcoin is becoming more secure/useful/growing/gaining adoption because of \\"hashrate\\"**\\"1.  Bitcoin's increased hash rate means two things:  \\n  1. **There's more competition between miners.**  \\n  2. And **[more electricity is being wasted maintaining the network and creating nothing of value](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index).** That is all \\"increased hashrate\\" indicates.    This doesn't mean there's greater adoption.  This doesn't mean the network is \\"more secure.\\"  This doesn't mean \\"bitcoin is growing.\\"  It doesn't mean there's more utility or usefulness in the network. 2.  People mine bitcoin for one thing: to make more bitcoin.  Mining activity is a natural reaction to the \\"price\\" of BTC (or the availability of cheap/free electricity) and not its utility.3.  Using an increase in hashrate to claim bitcoin is more secure or has more adoption is misleading and deceptive.  The increase in hash rate has no actual bearing on how \\"secure\\" the network is.  The cryptography works the same whether there's 10 nodes or 10,000.  And with mining cartels being concentrated, it makes no difference whether 51% attacks are perpetrated by 6 nodes or 5,001 in one of the top 2-3 cartels. Also [bitcoin has been hacked in the past and it's had nothing to do with hash rate](https://neptunemutual.com/blog/analysis-of-the-overflow-bug-in-bitcoin/).4.  So when you see people harping about the \\"hashrate\\", note that it's probably one of the few metrics that has been steadily increasing, but this is not a reflection of the utility or growth of bitcoin, but instead, that people have found new markets where they can get cheap electricity or profit by [wasting electricity and selling it back to the same grid at a profit.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html)  There are some companies that have set up crypto mining operations as a scheme to defraud local governments, citizens and public utilities.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Its an Executive Order.

The first was the handling of Biden's transition from being a one-term transition president to a second run while he was visibly in decline.  I think it would be hard to argue that the lack of transparency and inaction resulting in a late transition without a primary here were not a huge failing of the party and administration.  I think this was the most major failing I will list because it was self-inflicted and purely within the control of democrats.   The rest of the major failures on my list are harder problems where I think there was a mixture of not doing enough, not acting soon enough or perhaps the problems did not have good solutions.The second part that I think can be seen as a major failure is the failure to either do something to tame inflation or at least to be seen as doing something meaningful to try to alleviate the effects on the common family.  Inflation is complex.  One of the main knobs to control it is completely out of the executive branch's hands (interest rates) and a major part of it hinges on externalities such as wars and supply chains.  This quite hard for messaging, but the optics of actually doing something (anything) that would help the common American with high prices was completely absent.  You might bring up the passing of the inflation reduction act but the counterargument is that there was very little in that actually did anything to fight inflation, especially in the short term.  Eventually inflation did slow down, but it's of little help once the prices are already so high.I also think democrats failed on immigration and not in a \\"close the borders\\" sort of way.  When red states started transporting immigrants to blue states this was an opportunity to show the public a positive vision of immigration, of integrating hard-working folks eager for the american dream successfully into communities with labor shortages severely hit by the covid-19 pandemic.  Now this might have happened in isolated cases, but was the exception to the rule.  Instead you had lucrative contracts funneled to private companies where massive overspending took place with very little actually going to help migrant families who could have provided for themselves with expedited work permits.  Eventually this did start to happen in some states, but perhaps too little too late.Finally democrats failed in foreign policy in the middle east.  I get it, it was a lose-lose.  Perhaps there was no good option for the democrats here.  I personally feel that the path they ultimately chose felt like they were talking out of both sides of their mouth and left them open to defections from both sides.  Saying you feel for the plight Palestinians but having your harshest action against Israel be to deprive them of one particular flavor of bomb for a small amount of time feels like the lamest of lame gestures.  It is telling that even Reagan was able to tell Israel \\"enough\\" in a more effective way than Biden did.I write this as someone who voted for Biden and then for Harris, btw (because obviously the alternative was way worse).","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

Here's an [entire video segment that debunks this claim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&amp;t=2557s) 2. Crypto can easily be blocked at the network level by any of the various authorities that arbitrarily decide to do so.  Since it's a public network with no leader, all participants have to be able to identify themselves to others on the network, and technically speaking, this makes it easy for network admins to filter the traffic.  Just because this hasn't been done on any large scale, doesn't mean it can't be done.  It absolutely can. 3. Bitcoin and crypto operations have been banned in various countries and other jurisdictions.  While it's not possible to censor 100% of the network's operations, it's definitely possible to cripple enough of it to render crypto &amp; blockchain impractical to use.  And NOTE that in countries where bitcoin/mining and other operations have been banned, they've chosen a *political* solution (simply making it illegal) as opposed to requiring networks to actively filter crypto traffic, but that latter option is always a possibility and definitely doable (see #2) 4. The vast majority of crypto trades are done on a small number of centralized exchanges, such as Binance, Kraken and Coinbase.  The ToS of each of these systems gives them the absolute authority to censor any and all transactions.  So if 99% of bitcoin transactions are on CEX's, most certainly they can be censored. 5. To even exist, blockchain requires an elaborate array of networks, all managed by central authorities and private institutions who are not in any way obligated to route crypto traffic, and can, at any time, decide not to, and there's nothing you can do about it. 6. Even if crypto was \\"censorship resistant\\" which it isn't in any meaningful way, since crypto can't be used as \\"money\\" for 99.99% of things people use, it's still wholly dependent on the CEX on and off-ramps, which are subject to various laws, AML and KYC rules, etc. 7. Since blockchain is a public ledger, we're already seeing examples of peoples crypto being frozen for being associated with suspicious activities on-chain.  While your crypto may not be seizable in a private wallet, the moment you move it someplace to actually use it, it can be seized and the immutable blockchain can be used as evidence of money laundering and more.Try sending $100k internationally through banks - it takes days and costs a fortune. With Bitcoin it's minutes and cents.\\n#Crypto Talking Point #7 (remittances/unbanked)\\"**Crypto allows you to send \\"money\\" around the world instantly with no middlemen**\\" / \\"**I can buy stuff with crypto**\\" / **\\"Crypto is used for remittances\\"** / **\\"Crypto helps 'Bank the Un-banked\\"**1.  The notion that crypto is a solution to people in countries with hyper-inflation, unstable governments, etc does not make sense. Most people in problematic areas lack the resources to use crypto, and those that do, have much more stable and reliable alternatives to do their \\"banking\\".  See [this debunking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&amp;t=4334s).2.  [Sending crypto is NOT sending \\"money\\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&amp;t=4118s).  In order to do anything useful with crypto, it has to be converted back into fiat and that involves all the fees, delays and middlemen you claim crypto will bypass.3.  Due to Bitcoin and crypto's volatile and manipulated price, and its inability to scale, it's proven to be [unsuitable as a payment method](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/cryptocurrency-volatility-andrew-bailey-bank-england-governor-bitcoin-boe-2021-6-1030520851) for most things, and virtually nobody accepts crypto.4.  The exception to that are criminals and scammers.  If you think you're clever being able to buy drugs with crypto, remember that thanks to the immutable nature of blockchain, your dumb ass just created a [permanent record that you are engaged in illegal drug dealing and money laundering.](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/combatting-trafficking-with-blockchain-analysis/)5.  Any major site that likely accepts crypto, is using a third party exchange and not getting paid in actual crypto, so in that case (like using Bitpay), you're paying fees and spread exchange rate charges to a \\"middleman\\", and they have various regulatory restrictions you'll have to comply with as well.  6.  Even sending crypto to countries like El Salvador, who accept it natively, is not the best way to send \\"remittances.\\"  Nobody who is not a criminal is getting paid in bitcoin so nobody is sending BTC to third world countries without going through exchanges and other outlets with fees and delays.  In every case, it's easier to just send fiat and skip crypto altogether.  7.  The exception doesn't prove the rule.  Just because you can anecdotally claim you have sent crypto to somebody doesn't mean this is a common/useful practice.  There is no evidence of that.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"This is Trump we are talking about here. He doesn't change the law.

Now will you admit you were wrong?**\\" / \\"**Crypto has 'UsE cAs3S!'**\\" / \\"**EEE TEE EFFs!!one**\\" 1.  The original claim was that crypto was \\"disruptive technology\\" and was going to \\"replace the banking/finance system\\".  There were all these claims suggesting blockchain has tremendous \\"potential\\".  Now with [the truth slowly surfacing regarding blockchain's inability to be particularly good at anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA), crypto people have backpedaled to instead suggest, \\"Hey it has 'use-cases'!\\"    Congrats!  You found somebody willing to use crypto/blockchain technology.  That still is not an endorsement of crypto or blockchain.  I can choose to use a pair of scissors to cut my grass.  This doesn't mean scissors are \\"the future of lawn care technology.\\"  It just means I'm an eccentric who wants to use a backwards tool to do something for which everybody else has far superior tools available.   The operative issue isn't whether crypto &amp; blockchain can be \\"used\\" here-or-there.  The issue is: *Is there a good reason?  Does this tech actually do anything better than what we have already been using?*  And the answer to that is, [No.](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/) 2.  Most of the time, adoption claims are outright wrong. Just because you read some press release from a dubious source does not mean any major government, corporation or other entity is embracing crypto.  It usually means someone asked them about crypto and they said, \\"We'll look into it\\" and that got interpreted as \\"adoption imminent!\\"\\n 3.  In cases where companies did launch crypto/blockchain projects they usually fall into one of these categories:\\n  * Some company or supplier put out a press release advertising some \\"crypto project\\" involving a well known entity that never got off the ground, or was tried and failed miserably (such as [IBM/Maersk's Tradelens](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/11/29/maersk-and-ibm-to-discontinue-tradelens), [Australia's stock exchange](https://www.reuters.com/markets/australian-stock-exchanges-blockchain-failure-burns-market-trust-2022-12-20/), etc.)  See also [dead blockchain projects](https://weh.wtf/34-blockchain-projects.html).\\n  * Companies (like VISA, Fidelity or Robin Hood) **are not embracing crypto directly**.  Instead they are *partnering with a crypto exchange* (such as BitPay) that will either handle all the crypto transactions and they're merely licensing their network, or they're a third party payment gateway that pays the big companies in fiat.  There's no evidence any major company is actually switching over to crypto, or that any of these major companies are even touching crypto.  It's a huge liability they let newbie third parties deal with so they have plausible deniability for liabilities due to money laundering and sanctions laws.\\n  * What some companies are calling \\"blockchain\\" is not in any meaningful way actually using 'blockchain' tech. For example, IBM's \\"Hyperledger\\" claims to have \\"[blockchain design philosophy](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/Hyperledger/Offers/Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf)\\" but in reality, it is not decentralized and has no core architecture that's anything like crypto blockchain systems. Also note that IBM has their own trademarked phrase, \\"IBM Blockchain?\\" - their version of \\"blockchain\\" is neither decentralized, nor permissionless. It does not in any way resemble a crypto blockchain. It also remains to be seen, the degree to which anybody is actually using their \\"IBM Food Trust\\" supply chain tracking system, which we've [proven cannot really benefit from blockchain technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&amp;t=2108s).\\n  \\n 4.  Sometimes, politicians who are into crypto take advantage of their power and influence to force some crypto adoption on the community they serve -- [this almost always fails](https://truthout.org/articles/miamis-mayor-went-all-in-on-cryptocurrency-his-constituents-suffered/), but again, crypto people will promote the press release announcing the deal, while ignoring any follow-up materials that say such a proposal was rejected. 5.  Just because some company has jumped on the crypto bandwagon doesn't mean, \\"It's the future.\\"  McDonald's bundled [Beanie Babies](https://i.imgur.com/McdwlxA.jpg) with their Happy Meals for a time, when those collectable plush toys were being billed as the next big investment scheme.  Corporations have a duty to exploit any goofy fad available if it can help them make money, and the moment these fads fade, they drop any association and pretend it never happened.  This has already occurred with many tech companies from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613) to [Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/microsoft-is-shutting-down-its-azure-blockchain-service/), to [a major consortium of European corporations who pulled the plug on their blockchain projects](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/major-insurers-pull-the-plug-on-b3i-insurance-blockchain-consortium/).  Even though these companies discontinued any association with crypto years ago, proponents still hype the projects as if they're still active.\\n 6. Crypto ETFs are not an endorsement of crypto. (In fact part of the US SEC [was vehemently against approving ETFs - it was not a unanimous decision](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023))  They're simply ways for traditional companies to exploit crypto enthusiasts.  These entities do not care at all about the future of crypto.  It's just a way for them to make more money with fees, and just like in #4, the moment it becomes unprofitable for them to run the scheme, they'll drop it.  It's simply businesses taking advantage of a fad.  Crypto ETFs though are actually worse, because they're a vehicle to siphon money into the crypto market -- if crypto was a viable *alternative* to TradFi, then these gimmicky things wouldn't be desirable. 7. Countries like El Salvador who claim to have adopted bitcoin really [haven't in any meaningful way.](https://reason.com/2024/10/31/a-week-of-failing-to-pay-with-bitcoin-in-el-salvador/)  El Salvador's endorsement of bitcoin is tied to a proprietary exchange with their own non-transparent software, \\"Chivo\\" that is not on bitcoin's main blockchain - and as such isn't really bitcoin adoption as much as it's bitcoin exploitation.  Plus, USD is the real legal tender in El Salvador and since BTC's adoption, [use of crypto has stagnated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-04/el-salvador-s-bitcoin-revolution-is-failing-badly).  In two years, the country's investment in BTC has yielded lower returns than one would find in a standard fiat savings account.  Also note [Venezuela has now scrapped its state-sanctioned cryptocurrency](https://www.foreignbrief.com/venezuela-to-scrap-state-cryptocurrency/)So, whenever you hear \\"so-and-so company is using crypto\\" always be suspect.  What you'll find is either that's not totally true, or if they are, they're partnering with a crypto company who is paying them for the association, not unlike an advertiser/licensing relationship.   **Not** adoption.  Exploitation.   And temporary at that.We've seen absolutely no increase in crypto adoption - in fact quite the contrary.  More and more people in every industry from [gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust) to [banking](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-federal-reserve-rejects-crypto-focused-banks-application-be-supervised-by-2023-01-27/), are rejecting deals with crypto companies.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"This \\"delta-awarded\\" post is nothing but a long list of debunked, erroneous crypto talking points.

Yet people still consider stocks legitimate investments.Tesla is an atypical and horrible example of a typical stock.  TSLA is more of a memestock at this point and is highly manipulated by its cult-like leader, Elon Musk.  \\n#Crypto Talking Point #17 (stocks)\\"**Crypto is just like the stock market!**\\" , \\"**Comparing crypto to stocks**\\"\\n1.  Crypto tokens are absolutely NOT like stocks.  Unlike crypto, which is just a digital abstraction, stocks represent actual ownership in real-world entities, that own assets, provide useful products and services for mainstream society, generate revenue and can pay dividends to shareholders in real money.2.  You don't have to sell a stock to make money from it. Many companies pay dividends of their profits, which means you can truly INvest in the company as opposed to DIvesting when you want to see a return.  This is an important and fundamentally different function that crypto does not have. Many stocks create value in actual money, providing income without speculating on share price.3.  The value of a stock, while it can be \\"speculative\\" based on popularity and hype, also is based on the intrinsic value of the company's assets and business performance.  Therefore you can perform actual research and due-diligence and come up with a practical value for the shares and the assets they represent.  Crypto has no such feature.4.  Because companies are valued based on actual real-world assets and income, there's a limit to how low their share price could fall, at which point it would be economically viable to buy the whole company and liquidate it for a profit.  Crypto has no such limitation. The inherent value of crypto tokens is based at *zero* because it neither creates, nor represents any minimum base, real-world value.5.  Unlike crypto, the stock market is heavily regulated and transparent.  There are entire industries and agencies that are tasked with making sure public companies operate legitimately and legally.  Crypto has no such oversight or regulations or transparency.6.  While there are some over-valued stocks that are hype driven, and some companies whose shares are extremely risky and speculative, and OTC and option markets that are more like gambling than investing, that's not the way the stock market system normally operates.  Those highly-speculative markets and penny stocks *are the exception; NOT the rule.*  In crypto, speculation is exclusively the rule.7.  Public companies are subject to great scrutiny, and must produce regular independent audits and quarterly reports on profit and loss.  They can also be sued by their shareholders or even be held criminally liable if they lie about their business model, or even the risk factors their investors face.  Again, there is no such function or protections in the world of crypto.Bitcoin has proven itself over 15+ years now. It's survived countless \\"deaths,\\" regulations, and attempts to shut it down.Bitcoin has failed.  It's survival is based on constantly distracting people from its many failures and pretending some new thing on the horizon will suddenly provide actual utility to the public.  This has not happened yet, in 16 years.#Crypto Talking Point #29 (admit wrong?)**\\"Is there anything that would happen that would make you admit you're wrong about crypto?\\"** / **\\"What if everybody used Bitcoin and it was $1M would you admit you're wrong?\\"** This question seems to be asked *daily* by you guys. You spend virtually no time lurking and seeing what goes on in this community before you barf out the same question we have addressed hundreds of times already.. 1. Wrong about What? We've made it crystal clear how to change our minds about crypto &amp; blockchain:   **Cite one specific example of *anything* (non-crime-related) that blockchain tech is better at than existing non-blockchain technology?**   We're 16 years into this mess, and you still can't answer that basic question.  We now call it \\"The Ultimate Crypto Question\\" because it's so embarrassing you're pretending after 16 years your tech does anything useful.  It [does not](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/).  Since there's zero evidence blockchain tech does anything useful for society, what's the point of operating this system when it wastes so many resources, and involves so much criminal activity? 2. Stop dreaming that any major nation-state is going to make bitcoin or any crypto their \\"default currency.\\" It makes no sense for any reasonable nation that cares about its people to make legal tender, some digital tokens that are primarily controlled by people outside that nation-state.  So stop thinking that's likely.  It will not happen.  We live in the real world, not the realm of hypotheticals.  We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but you'd be foolish to think that bridge will ever manifest. 3. No amount of \\"price\\" of crypto will change the operational dynamics of what it is. See [Talking point](https://ioradio.org/i/crypto-talking-points/) #2 - the price of crypto is not a reflection of its utility, but instead popularity and market manipulation.\\n 4. No amount of \\"time\\" of crypto being around will change the operational dynamics of what it is. People still smoke cigarettes.  Does that mean everybody was wrong about smoking being bad for society? Scientology has been around for 70+ years.  Are you finally going to admit that Xenu is legit? Just because something \\"lasts\\" doesn't mean it's a good thing.  As long as a few people can get away with exploiting others to make money, crypto (like smoking) will continue to be a thing.  And like smoking, crypto hurts people who haven't fully thought about the big picture of what they're doing and the negative long term impact it will have. Here is the [list](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/) of claims made thus far and why they're bogus.

The only point of a political party is to win elections. Although I agree with Matty Ygelsias who had a piece that started with, \\"If you pick up the phone to call 'the democrats' nobody will answer.\\" And he goes on to say there's no central control. It's true, there's just hundreds of people in various positions that do things. But those members of a political party have the job to convince people to support them. Those on the left who stayed home becauseThe number of true leftists is too low to swing elections. The Democratic Party, for instance, which is considered a left leaning party, only has 12% of its coalition comprising of leftists. [**https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/the-democratic-coalition/**](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/the-democratic-coalition/) Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 45 of 50 states and DC. Generic Democratic Party members can expect huge margins in say, New York, where she got only 60%. She lost among a variety of groups. There's more Hispanic/Latinos that voted for Trump than leftists stayed home. By a huge margin. Turning out Latinos in large numbers is why Obama won in 2008 and 2012; in fact, it was so world breaking that it galvanized the GOP fundraising for project REDMAP and ALEC. But, this is a group that didn't turn out for Clinton in the same numbers, didn't turn out as much in 2020, and turned out for Trump in 2024. They're king makers. Florida going from purple to easily red is a death sentence for the Dems. What you're seeing nationally you're also seeing in some states - like California where the share of Latinos going red, or GOP doing better in rural parts of the state, is following the national trend. What will happen in 2028 is New York and California will lose electoral college votes and Florida will gain some. I think Texas too but I'm not as sure.Where you can place the most blame on the Dems as a party is they essentially have nationalized and focus too much on urban areas. They have no presence in rural areas of the country and all their money gets aimed at their national ticket - political science shows people vote more on valance issues than on policy issues. So all this hemming and hawing about particulars around policy issues doesn't matter if there's not a core vein of trust within the party of the person by association with the party.","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

If the DNC loses an election, then it's the DNC who is at fault. Full stop. Pissed that people in support of Gaza didn't vote for Harris? Maybe she should have actually taken a stance against what Israel is doing in Gaza. Pissed that people who hate cops didn't vote for her?

Maybe she should have ran a campaign like Bernie. Instead of being a conservative in a blue tie. And that's what all \\"moderates\\" like her and Biden are.

But the response to any policy attack is nuanced and takes more than a quick quip or soundbite to properly explain. As far as \\"the left\\" failing them, I'm with you on that, partially. People like Mike from PA in particular really pissed me off this election cycle. He was bitching every day how the dems needed to \\"earn your vote\\" in relating to policy toward Israel. My position on that was, do you really think Trump as president will increase or decrease harm to the suffering people in Gaza? The loopy-lefties who vote third party because the Biden or Harris didn't check every single one of their boxes really pissed me off.That said...Harris needed to distinguish herself from Biden on this point and come out hard against Netanyahu. It was leaked that she had a problem with how Biden was handling the situation early on and was the first to utter the term ceasefire publically. She should have stabbed Biden in the back on that issue, for the good of the country. This wasn't the only reason she lost, but a big enough one for Michigan.Instead, one of the campaign's big strategies was that they were going to somehow get republicans to vote for her. Yeah, like they were going to flock to vote for a black woman who's messaging was pretty much \\"republican-lite.\\"Like it or not, and though it was a lie, Trump voters voted for who they saw as a change candidate and populist. He was never going to lose any of his base and most republican voters just hate dems enough they weren't going to flip, no matter how much batshit crazy stuff Tump said or did.Listen to the dummies at Pod Save America's episode where they interviewed the top Harris campaign officials and they say something along the lines of (paraphrasing), \\"We ran the best campaign we could have and we wouldn't do anything different if we could try again.\\" Like really? The strategy lost and you'd do the same? This is why the standard dems are losing - they don't know how to learn from their mistakes. They're too blinded by corporate money, power and status.

It isnt any more as it no longer seems to exist.","title":"Kamala Harris Affirms Peaceful Transfer Of Power Ahead Of Certification Of Electoral Vote For Donald Trump: Our Democracy Can Be Fragile"},{"text":"Democrats made a number of key mistakes this last election cycle that led directly to their loss.First, they covered up and minimized Biden's age related decline. The inner circle of leadership around Biden was fully aware he was nowhere near where he was in 2020, and only after a legendarily bad debate performance was he finally pressured into stepping aside. But it was too late. The hit to credibility was done. Also it was so late in the process that a primary couldn't be done so Harris was nominated. It cannot be overstated how much Americans despised that move. Second, Harris completely failed to distance herself from Biden. The internal polling Dems had shown Biden losing by 400 electoral points. The dissatisfaction with the administration was palpable. However when Kamala was asked what she would do differently she had no answer. She fumbled the most basic and obvious question her campaign could get. People.did.not.want.Biden. Harris chose to run as Biden 2.0. There were literally states that elected a Democrat for governor and Trump for President.Third, \\"it's the economy stupid\\". Incumbent parties all over the world got ousted because of inflation. Americans were and are pissed that prices are much higher. No one cares that it is worse in other places. Democrats completely ignored this obvious issue and worse kept trying to explain it away. Trump may have spouted utter nonsense about how to fix the issue, but at least he acknowledged its existence.Fourth, \\"the Left\\" is not some huge electoral block that swings elections. Lefties are a relatively small chunk of the electorate. Most voters are not aware enough of politics to be described as leftists. If every self-described leftist that stayed home because of anti-Israel sentiment voted, it wouldn't have won Harris a single additional electoral vote. She got beaten by apathy in the middle. Most people who didn't vote did so because while they don't like Trump, they felt Kamala wasn't worth getting out of bed for. Largely for the reasons stated above. Trump was able to leverage his base to get enough people to the polls to win out over the people who couldn't be bothered. He got 3 million fewer votes than 2020 but Dems got like 10 million fewer.","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

On the other hand Trump offered a solution - a solution you might not agree with but a solution nonetheless.So to put it very gently, maybe she can be a good president, but she wasnt able to convince people of that during her very short campaign.

Unemployment rates and the economy only go so far to convince people. Democrats generally win the Minds argument, but they almost never win the heart.The modern democratic party can't even understand what is meant by the idea of \\"Make America Great Again\\". To them, America is great. They got lots of money from lots of big businesses, and they have control in arguably the most powerful country in the world.The problem is there's millions of Americans who don't give a damn about unemployment rates or economic performance. There's millions of Americans who just want to feel more powerful. The people who vote for Trump wanted to stick it to the government. They simply don't care about the things we think they're supposed to care about.Democrats will continue to fail to inspire people as long as they fail to reach the hearts of people. As much as I hate to say it, Americans don't really want America to be the good guy. Health care? Take it or leave it. Policing the world? Ugh, what a drag. Technology and industry? What, like Japan?At every turn the Democratic party turns away from the firebrands of our time. They continually seek out the moderate - the middle-ground - the compromise. They reject the spirited protestor, they drown narratives in beaurocracy and they don't give anyone anything to believe in.People are, ultimately, idealists. Trump was basically \\"I'm going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it!\\"Can you imagine what it would be like if America had a leader that said something like \\"I'm going to tear down the Health Insurance Industry! I'm going to make them all pay for the Universal Healthcare! It's not going to cost you a cent! No more Insurance Costs full stop!\\"It doesn't matter if it's true, or even possible.

I think you're really, really overestimating our power in America. Harris ran on an alright platform (basically pro-status quo compared to Biden) and tried to poach moderates.

But the cost was driving away some of the far left and staking claim to perpetuate the status quo.Do you think that \\"fear of Trump\\" is sufficiently motivating for people who thought the status quo was unacceptable? Remember most people in the bottom 3 quintiles believe the economy sucks right now. Being the pro-status quo candidate in such an environment is not a good idea. The \\"failure\\" here was to separate policy from Biden's because his was unpopular among the portion of the public which mattered. I think one of the GOP ads that really worked well was a statement from Harris saying she basically wouldn't do anything differently from Biden.I say this as someone who believes in and follows economic indicators - which appear to look alright compared to previous economies.","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

Your opinion about the previous administration, just cherry picks reality.?Inflation has significantly reduced purchasing power, with rising costs for essentials like groceries, housing, and energy eroding real incomes. Although unemployment is low, median wages have not kept pace with inflation, leaving many struggling to maintain their standard of living. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation have made borrowing more expensive, increasing the cost of mortgages, credit card debt, and loans. The stock market, while recovering from pandemic lows, remains more volatile and uncertain than in 2019, creating insecurity for retirement savings and investments. Small businesses have also faced significant challenges due to higher operating costs, labor shortages, and decreased consumer spending, leaving the small business environment far less favorable than it was pre-pandemic. Furthermore, ballooning national debt and deficits raise concerns about long-term economic stability.

(Note that the initial EOs often did not follow the APA either)Separation of Powers: Executive actions must comply with statutory and constitutional requirements, even when reversing a predecessor's policies. (even though by the logic the previous EOs would also be invalid)Judicial Oversight: Courts act as a check on administrative actions, ensuring adherence to procedural norms and substantive law. (often what I call selective oversight)\\n1. DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)    Case: Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, 591 U.S. ___ (2020)\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration attempted to terminate DACA, an Obama-era program that deferred deportation for certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\\n    Court Ruling: The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to rescind DACA was \\"arbitrary and capricious\\" under the APA because it failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision. The Court did not rule on the legality of DACA itself but required a more thorough process for rescinding it.\\n    Citation: 591 U.S. ___ (2020).2. Clean Power Plan    Case: State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration sought to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP), an Obama-era policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and replace it with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.\\n    Court Ruling: The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the ACE rule in American Lung Association v. EPA (2021), holding that the EPA had improperly limited its authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The repeal of the CPP was indirectly invalidated by this ruling.\\n    Citation: American Lung Association v. EPA, 985 F.3d 914 (D.C. Cir. 2021).3. Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule    Case: California v. Environmental Protection Agency\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration attempted to roll back the Obama-era WOTUS rule, which expanded federal jurisdiction over wetlands and waterways.\\n    Court Ruling: Multiple district courts blocked the Trump administration's repeal and replacement of the rule, citing failures to adequately consider scientific evidence and the impact on water quality, as required under the APA.\\n    Citation: Pasqua Yaqui Tribe v. EPA, No. CV-20-00266-TUC-RM (D. Ariz. 2021).4. Paris Climate Agreement Withdrawal    Key Issue: Although not directly subject to a court ruling, the Trump administration's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement faced legal scrutiny in state courts. Several states argued that federal policies undermining the agreement violated environmental laws. These challenges influenced subsequent federal policies but did not directly block the withdrawal.5. Asylum and Immigration Policies    Case: East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration issued executive actions limiting asylum eligibility for migrants entering the U.S. between official ports of entry, counteracting Obama-era immigration policies.\\n    Court Ruling: Courts blocked these policies, holding that they violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and were implemented without proper notice-and-comment procedures under the APA.\\n    Citation: East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742 (9th Cir. 2018).6. Methane Emissions Standards    Case: California v. Bureau of Land Management\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration sought to delay and repeal Obama-era regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas operations on federal lands.\\n    Court Ruling: Courts ruled that the administration violated the APA by failing to provide a sufficient rationale for delaying the implementation of the rule.\\n    Citation: California v.

Cal. 2017).","title":"Biden sabotages Trump as he bans all future oil and gas drilling just days before he's sworn in"},{"text":"Sorry gotta go high and crash into the ceiling while Trump runs away with the money.

Climate change is an existential threat isn't it?What you're missing is China's reasoning and long-term strategy here. Neither the US (save for a few fringe lawmakers) nor Chinese governments actually care to combat climate change beyond the PR win. The Chinese government is weaponizing their auto industry to *deliberately undercut* international competitors at a net loss - they're not operating sustainably (economically speaking); they're making a play, and they expect to reap the profits in the long-term.China isn't subsidizing the EV industry out of the goodness of their heart and care for the environment, they're doing it to out-compete international competition. China's ideal result (the one this tariff aims to fight) is for Chinese vehicles to be so affordable that they push the US (and EU) out of the core of the industry. Economies of scale mean that whoever is currently dominating the market is poised to continue doing so, and weaponized subsidization of the EV market is a play for auto dominance.If the West didn't fight back at all, and the Chinese plan worked as hoped, they'd simply stop selling the cars at a loss, using their newfound position at the top to profit massively and deliver huge blows to their rival economies.At the end of the day, nobody's actually working for the well-being of you or the environment, but if youre American/European, a stronger auto industry in the West is ultimately the side that will benefit you.","title":"CMV: Democrats should repeal Biden's 100% tariff on Chinese EVs to help fight climate change"},{"text":"Sounds like we need to uncap Social Security from it's $168,600 limit on incomes.","title":"Higher Social Security payments coming for millions of people from bill that Biden signed"},{"text":"Passively?

You would prefer to have a country that doesnt care about environmental standards control global EV production? Lets see your thoughts experiment through.In the short term, youre getting a larger environmental impact from EV production in China compared to basically any other vehicle. If everyone went out and purchased that vehicle tomorrow, we would overwhelm existing charging infrastructure and most people would end up trickle charging at home. This would increase variable grid load. In the US, most communities rely on coal to meet variable demand. In the long term, global automakers are sucking wind due to their heavy investment in tech being undermined by China. They struggle to scale EV production and cannot benefit from economies of scale. The global automotive industry becomes increasingly dependent on China, who continues to artificially manipulate the market, eventually exploiting their dominance to raise prices and artificially limit supply. Vehicles become more expensive and the western world loses control over environmental standards. Domestically, we rapidly build out charging and grid infrastructure up to a point, but automakers and special interests alike correctly insist on continued ICE vehicle production because we cannot benefit entirely reliant on China. This limits the expansion of the EV/grid infrastructure.This transition needs to happen on multiple fronts and needs support from regulatory agencies and automakers in order to be successful. Dont take their influence away and hand it to China, who can and will abuse it. They dont care about environmental regulation. On the flip side, there is Toyota. As soon as their solid state battery hits the market every automaker around the world will be clamoring to buy and license it.

There is no mandate to facilitate clean/renewable energy. There is no mandate to do *anything* to help others or the world. As such, crypto entities will always seek the cheapest form of energy, and it's well established at this point that fossil fuels (or stealing energy) offer the best ROI.  3.  Crypto's energy usage, specifically with schemes like \\"Proof-of-work\\" **require** energy to be expensive.  If energy was cheap and ubiquitous, it would undermine the design of blockchain and the PoW model and render it useless.4.

The government does **not** \\"print money indefinitely\\"... all money in circulation is [tightly regulated and regularly audited and publicly transparent](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/audited-annual-financial-statements.htm).  The organization that manages the money in circulation is the Federal Reserve and contrary to what crypto bros claim, they're not a private cabal - they [are overseen and regulated by Congress](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/structure-federal-reserve-system.htm).  And any attempt to put more money in circulation [requires an Act of Congress to increase the debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) - it's neither arbitrary, nor easy to do.2. [Currency is meant to be *spent*, not hoarded](https://medium.com/change-your-mind/money-is-meant-to-be-spent-not-saved-9618edec676f).  A dollar today will buy what it buys. If you hold a dollar for 90 years, of course it won't buy the same thing decades later (although it might actually be worth significantly more as antique money).  You people don't seem to understand the first thing about how currency works - it's NOT an \\"investment!\\"  You **spend** it, *not* hoard it!3.  If you are looking to \\"invest\\" you don't keep your value in cash/currency/fiat. You put it into something that can *create value* like stocks that pay dividends, real estate, etc.  Crypto creates no value and makes a lousy \\"investment.\\"  It also [hasn't proven to be a hedge](http://prasad.dyson.cornell.edu/doc/WSJ.08Oct23.pdf) against anything, least of all monetary inflation.4. Over time more money is put in circulation - you pretend like this is a bad thing, but it's not done in a vacuum.  The average annual wage in 1900 was less than $4000.  In 2023 [it's more than $70,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200838/median-household-income-in-the-united-states/)!  There's more people out there and the monetary supply grows appropriately, as does wages.  You can't take one element of the monetary system completely out of context and ignore everything else.5. The causes of inflation are **many**, and the amount of money in circulation is one of the least significant factors in causing the prices of things to rise.  More prominent inflationary causes are things like: [fuel prices](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-inflation-high-causes-gas-price-outlook-forecast-2022-7), [supply chain issues](https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/supply-chain-issues-contribution-to-inflation.html), [war](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-effect-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-global-activity-and-inflation-20220527.html), environmental disasters, [one-time COVID mitigations](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2022/03/why-is-us-inflation-higher-than-in-other-countries/), pandemics, and even [car dealerships](https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-dealer-markups-helped-drive-inflation-study-finds-7c1d5a2d). 6.  Sure there may be some nations that have caused out of control inflation as a result of their monetary policy (such as Zimbabwe) but comparing modern nations to third-world dictatorships is beyond absurd.7.  If bitcoin and crypto was an actually disruptive, stable, useful technology, you wouldn't need to promote lies and scare people over the existing system. The *real* reason you do this is [because nobody can find any legitimate reason to use crypto in the first place](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/).8.  Crypto ironically has more inflation in its ecosystem that is even more out of control, than in any traditional fiat system.  At least with the US Dollar, money is accounted for and fully audited and it takes an Act of Congress to increase the debt.  In crypto, all it takes is a dude printing USDT, USDC, BUSD or any of the other unsecured stablecoins to just print more out of thin air, and crypto-morons assume they're worth $1 of value.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Saying that there's no apartheid in Israel is a blatant lie.","title":"New bill in NY Senate, \\"New York state antisemitism vandalism Act,\\" would create a special Class A misdemeanor for the crime of vandalizing \\"pro-Israel print.\\""},{"text":" The action, which CNN reported on Friday, invokes the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, a law that gives presidents broad authority to withdraw federal waters from future oil and gas leasing and development.

Like it or not, when governments adopt Bitcoin, you will be wrong.Well, so far I'm not wrong.   El Salvador \\"adopted\\" bitcoin and it failed miserably.  Now they've pivoted from their Bitcoin adoption and no longer made it mandatory in order to pander to a sweet FIAT loan from the IMF.Your point about stable coins has not really been fleshed out or thought through. The number of units of a stable coin can expand and contract in response to supply and demand.It can also expand in response to Paolo clicking a button on his computer and printing a billion USDT out of thin air, as he is often prone to do, suspiciously right before the price pumps for no other reason.The federal reserve has massively expanded M2 money supplyThis has very little to do with price inflation that most people feel.  This is explained in my talking point rebuttal.\\n#Crypto Talking Point #3 (inflation)**\\"InFl4ti0n!!!\\"** / **\\"The dollar will eventually become worthless\\"** / **\\"The dollar has lost 104% of its value since 1900!\\"** / **\\"The government prints money out of thin air\\"**1. The government does **not** \\"print money indefinitely\\"... all money in circulation is [tightly regulated and regularly audited and publicly transparent](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/audited-annual-financial-statements.htm).  The organization that manages the money in circulation is the Federal Reserve and contrary to what crypto bros claim, they're not a private cabal - they [are overseen and regulated by Congress](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/structure-federal-reserve-system.htm).  And any attempt to put more money in circulation [requires an Act of Congress to increase the debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) - it's neither arbitrary, nor easy to do.2. [Currency is meant to be *spent*, not hoarded](https://medium.com/change-your-mind/money-is-meant-to-be-spent-not-saved-9618edec676f).  A dollar today will buy what it buys. If you hold a dollar for 90 years, of course it won't buy the same thing decades later (although it might actually be worth significantly more as antique money).  You people don't seem to understand the first thing about how currency works - it's NOT an \\"investment!\\"  You **spend** it, *not* hoard it!3.  If you are looking to \\"invest\\" you don't keep your value in cash/currency/fiat. You put it into something that can *create value* like stocks that pay dividends, real estate, etc.  Crypto creates no value and makes a lousy \\"investment.\\"  It also [hasn't proven to be a hedge](http://prasad.dyson.cornell.edu/doc/WSJ.08Oct23.pdf) against anything, least of all monetary inflation.4. Over time more money is put in circulation - you pretend like this is a bad thing, but it's not done in a vacuum.  The average annual wage in 1900 was less than $4000.  In 2023 [it's more than $70,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200838/median-household-income-in-the-united-states/)!  There's more people out there and the monetary supply grows appropriately, as does wages.  You can't take one element of the monetary system completely out of context and ignore everything else.5. The causes of inflation are **many**, and the amount of money in circulation is one of the least significant factors in causing the prices of things to rise.  More prominent inflationary causes are things like: [fuel prices](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-inflation-high-causes-gas-price-outlook-forecast-2022-7), [supply chain issues](https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/supply-chain-issues-contribution-to-inflation.html), [war](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-effect-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-global-activity-and-inflation-20220527.html), environmental disasters, [one-time COVID mitigations](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2022/03/why-is-us-inflation-higher-than-in-other-countries/), pandemics, and even [car dealerships](https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-dealer-markups-helped-drive-inflation-study-finds-7c1d5a2d). 6.  Sure there may be some nations that have caused out of control inflation as a result of their monetary policy (such as Zimbabwe) but comparing modern nations to third-world dictatorships is beyond absurd.7.  If bitcoin and crypto was an actually disruptive, stable, useful technology, you wouldn't need to promote lies and scare people over the existing system. The *real* reason you do this is [because nobody can find any legitimate reason to use crypto in the first place](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/).8.  Crypto ironically has more inflation in its ecosystem that is even more out of control, than in any traditional fiat system.  At least with the US Dollar, money is accounted for and fully audited and it takes an Act of Congress to increase the debt.  In crypto, all it takes is a dude printing USDT, USDC, BUSD or any of the other unsecured stablecoins to just print more out of thin air, and crypto-morons assume they're worth $1 of value. No ones saying that you have to invest all of your money in Bitcoin, but its justifiable to have some long term exposure. It must kill people like American Scream to know that that MSTR is part of the Nasdaq and that most people are already indirectly invested in Bitcoin.Repeat after me:  Crypto is NOT an \\"investment.\\"   It's gambling. If you want to gamble, feel free, but you're not actually investing in anything.  Crypto produces absolutely nothing useful for (non-criminal) society.I'm not at all worried about MSTR.  It's going to eventually collapse.  I can't predict when but mathematically that ponzi can't last forever.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"From [Globe.com](http://Globe.com)By Tal KopanWASHINGTON  One of Vice President Kamala Harriss last responsibilities before leaving office comes on Monday, when she presides over the Senate and certifies her own loss to President-elect Donald Trump.It will also be the anniversary of the day a violent mob broke into the Capitol to try to overturn his defeat four years ago. But its widely expected that this year, the certification of the election on?Jan. 6 will return to a peaceful, perfunctory cadence, and that the vice president will calmly perform her ceremonial role.Nonetheless, the echoes of 2021 will be unmistakable, when Trump pressured his own vice president, Mike Pence, to reject their defeat by President Biden and Harris. Those who know Harris expect her participation this year to be quiet and routine  which, they say, will speak volumes.Retiring Representative Barbara Lee of California, a longtime Harris ally, was among the members of Congress who had to flee the House chamber in 2021.I hope people see the contrast between Jan. 6, \\\\[2021,\\\\] and when she presides over the peaceful transfer of power, Lee said. Im sure shes very proud that shes able to do this and demonstrate once again what democracy is all about.Harris declined through her office to be interviewed. But her staff pointed to how she opened her concession speech by noting the importance of a peaceful transfer of power as an indication of how seriously she takes the role she will play.A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results, Harris told a crowd at Howard University the day after the election. That principle as much as any other distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party but to the Constitution of the United States.In a statement, Trumps spokesperson credited Harris and Biden for working with his team.The Biden-Harris administration is cooperating with President Trump and the transition team to ensure a smooth transition of power, Karoline Leavitt said. When Kamala Harris certifies the election results, President Trump will deliver on his promise to serve ALL Americans and will unify the country through success.The Jan. 6 certification is a historically routine step in the Electoral College process. In a joint session of the House and Senate, the vice president in her role as president of the Senate oversees the proceedings as the tally of electoral votes from each state is presented and certified.In 2021, Republicans, touting baseless theories regarding the election,?wanted to object to the certifications of key states that voted for Biden and Harris as a way to potentially overturn the results.?Meanwhile, at a rally on the Ellipse near the White House, Trump spoke to a raucous crowd who then marched to the Capitol and forced their way in to stop the counting. Members of Congress who were present in the Capitol were forced to evacuate, some leaving mere moments before the violent?crowd closed on the chamber. Five law enforcement officers and four rally-goers died?[i](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/us/politics/jan-6-capitol-deaths.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share)n the aftermath.

I'd encourage you to read Reflections on the Revolution in France by Edmund Burke, which is widely considered the foundational text of Western conservatism. In it, he explains that conservatism isn't about resisting all change and creating a state of perpetual stasis. In many ways, the American revolution was a fundamentally conservative effort. It was based on principles and traditions that had been enumerated for centuries dating back to the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Right. On the contrary, the French Revolution devolved into chaos and ultimately the restoration of an absolute monarchy because it sought to randomly invent entirely new rights and methods of governance that were not moored in tradition.If your definition of liberalism is \\"we conserve things that are good and change things that are bad\\" and your view of conservatives is \\"we resist any and all change,\\" no shit there's no reason to have conservatives. Some of your examples are also somewhat flawed. The Great Depression was ended by US entry into World War II, not FDR's New Deal programs. In 1940, the unemployment rate was still nearly 15% after years of New Deal era government programs. I also don't see how \\"defeating the Nazis\\" was a primarily \\"liberal\\" position.

The idea that Israel can't \\"hand over\\" land that even with decades of settlement efforts is more Palestinian, by population, than ever lends credence to a world that upends all postwar geopolitical norms - meaning at the very least is an argument supportive of total annexation of Ukraine by Russia.The problem with upending postwar geopolitical norms is that Israel was established by UN vote in favor of self-determination for the Jewish people. If Israel doesn't even believe in such a thing, it has truly decided to simply be a satrap of the USA. Which means once the USA is distracted by other geopolitical concerns (such as Taiwan) Israel will always face more war. It hasn't earnestly sought peace or understanding with even the people it governs (Palestinians), much less its neighbors.","title":"CMV: The attitude of the West, alongside Biden's foreign policy in the Middle-East, was terrible, and his and Blinken's policies only prolonged the Israel-Hamas war."},{"text":"so long as the externalities are properly pricedThey will not be.

Because there came a time when nobody else was there but HIM and saved me.  Now for the very very long part...If you want a less personal story that is based on history, then I'll tell you, but like I said, I'll warn you this is very long and in depth'ish and very strange all at once.  I will not judge you at all for not reading, because it has more words than probably the Constitution. But another person asked the other day and I shared this, so maybe you will like it as well. But again, no judgement for not reading because it is very long.  The Dead Sea Scrolls changed everything for me.  They were blocked from being released for almost a century, including people being sued for even releasing pictures showing it.  But finally after a huge push and tons of signatures some of them were released for study.  It opened my eyes to so much info.To put it into context, before this, the oldest version we had of the Bible was actually copied closer to us than it was to the first Bibles that existed or the time period they came from (the russian codex copy was a COPY of another bible, but is the oldest we supposedly have available).  The Dead Sea Scrolls had the same general layout of books together as the Russian Codex COPY and confirmed a lot of the Bible and its layout. But also, we found out that Enoch and Jubilees were some of the most read books (but Psalms was by far the most popular).  So why is Enoch not included in any way?  Well if you've read Enoch or Jubilees, you read that it is about the Watchers and Angels.  The Watchers were Angels that ended up taking a pact before they slept with human women and had Giant children that go on to cause war and they eat everything including humans.  This is what causes the Flood of Noah and Old Testament G_d to become very angry, punish them (and their children, who will be evil spirits trapped on Earth until the end).  This is also why G_d blesses Joshua to go and battle these Giants, and David who is God's favorite servant, goes on to kill one of the last Giants starting the new age.  In fact, thw bible even goes on to say that after the flood, G_d was going to rid the world of all evil spirits, but some were spared to carry out G_d's plan for the world.  [This story forever made sense of this bible verse, which never made sense to me before](https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-1.htm).  He resides over a counci of the Sons of Spirit who then he has gotten angry at for not being just.  And these sons of spirit, and the Watchers, and all other evil will be re-released at the end times.  It led me down a path of reading about Enoch and discovering the history of how it was not included as well as other books that were almost not included (including Joshua and other books talking about thw conquest of the Giants!). Plus, I was already a history buff and knew the stories of how thw Smithsonian and other museums used to have Giants on display, but now refuse to acknowledge them.  The Roman Catholic church took over the church from thw Apostles when they died and more and more decisions don't make sense.  The Bible says that you should only worship God (and that Jesus was his voice in creating the universe before he became a man).  The Catholic Church, Constantine, and the Council of Nicaea made so many strange decisions. Now we have the worship of saints and the obsession with the Virgin Mary and so many other decisions that seem so strange, as well as strange decisions in the KJV interpretations (again, to me personally, because it seems like choices avoiding the watchers and the giants were made).  Add this to the fact that \\"a council of the sons of spirits\\" exist who had control over their own territories for a time when lots were divided (and why Isreal is G_d's Holy Land)... and suddenly the stories of all other parthenons and systems opens up. Which as a historian connected so many dots for me.  These arent multiple different systems fighting for control...it's been the same system and the power fighting back and forth.  The fact that those same spirits are still around today, still being built up in temple's by Masons that are the same as they were in antiquity. Or the fact that the same Obelisks in Egypt now sit in Washington D.C., the Vatican, and The City of London that were supposedly the same obelisks that supposedly witnessed The Exodus, the fact that our money system today still follows the Baylonian money system, the fact that Washington DC was first called Rome, Maryland because it sat on 7 hills similar to Rome (and is located between VIRGINia, and MARYland).  The fact that the Capitol Building has the [\\"apotheosis of washington\\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apotheosis_of_Washington) which includes \\"columbia\\" matching the exact same descriptions as those same \\"gods\\" before (going back to Babylon, aka inanna or ishtar), as well as all the others that show up over and over again, including a recreation of [the thrown of zeus pointing up with apollo at his back and nike \\"the god of victory\\" at his right](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Le_Jupiter_Olympien_ou_l%27art_de_la_sculpture_antique.jpg), being replicated into a [thrown for Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_(Greenough)) including apollo on his backside, and nike on his right. Add this to the fact that Rothschilds have [temple's to apollo](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dMCIH0voDWk), and the babylon money system.  It's like reading Enoch suddenly opened my eyes to how blind I waa about everything.  In fact, an apostle to the temple of apollo even had a famous poem of how thw parthenon of Greece fled as animals to Egypt and other stories that seem to tell more of this story.  The babylon story of Tiamat the great dragon is the same story as the Serpent in the sea of the Bible.  The babylon story is the Sons of Spirit telling the events that took place Once you start reading these atories understanding this, they all make so much more sense, but they all do not want to talk about each other.  In Enoch it says that the Watchers were so ashamed that they couldnt even look up.  I think the Watchers are the ones guiding these decisions to hide their shame.  I can write so much more, especially since I tried covering so much here and probably had a lot of typos.

This could not be further from the truth. If you do your research and/or are exposed to information from outside the West, you would know that Israel has never once agreed to the concept of a Palestinian state despite being officially recognized by the PA and despite even Hamas accepting a two state solution based on 1967 borders. Israel never has and never will never accept a two state solution. ever.Furthermore, much of the news about October 7th in the West was blatant atrocity propaganda. Even Joe Biden was talking about dozens of beheaded babies when we now know that only a single baby died on October 7 and it appears they died due to Israeli fire.All this is to say I don't think you understand how much of a geopolitically liability Israel is now. The perception of the world is that everyone, especially Palestinians, have done everything to accommodate and attempt peace with Israelis while Israelis continue to literally remove Palestinians from their homes (even in Jerusalem, which Israel claims it has annexed and thus those Palestinians should be subject to Israeli law but they are not - they are subject to martial law solely because they're Palestinian). So the natural conclusion is that Israel has done anything and everything it can to sabotage peace and remove (either by killing or expelling) as many Palestinians as possible.The US has already lost a ton of legitimacy by supporting Ukraine as an existential cause for self-determination then doing seemingly the opposite in Palestine. If the US does any more at all, friendly nations will be swayed to trust China's leadership more than America's.

Among his policies, he saw to limiting working hours for women and children in factories, banning child labour in mines, offering free education to children of poor workers, and he was a champion of the Factories Act of 1847.Industrialisation and capitalism had led to changes in relation between employer and employee, leading to rising poverty forcing families to work their children, but he strove to counter these changes in society (i.e. a conservative), I hope most would say for the better. Some might say he did this out of his Christian convictions, but it remains true that he was a Tory with conservative values and nonetheless was on the right side of a major issue.We are too politically correct as a culture to acknowledge this. And yet this demonstrably destructive ideology is kept on life support.It offers no value to us. We pretend it does because we are afraid of offending and begets we think ideologies are owed respect regardless of results.The assumption hereperhaps one drawn from your lack of good answers to your questionseems to be that progress is necessarily good, that opposing it is necessarily bad, so that conservatism is a dinosaur for opposing it. I disagree.The role of conservatives may not be to implement social reforms (though they may propose bills to avert harmful trends). But they might still be needed to play devil's advocate when progressives propose well-meaning but perhaps misguided or half-baked bills, or when reactionaries propose bad ones. That is why we have an opposition government and shadow ministers.Democracy is built on mutual respect; that each party has something valuable to offer, and may be acting in the interests of the people, or some of them. Most societies, generally autocratic ones, that toss that aside in the interests of action for action's sake! also tend to make stupid mistakes with no one to pull the emergency cord on them.An extreme case would be Mao's Great Leap Forward. If enough opposition to his reforms had been voiced, conservative objections like Peng Dehuai's could not have been silenced and the disastrous proposal (which led to the deaths of perhaps 40 million people) might be altered, planned better, or cancelled.  \\nPerhaps in Nazi Germany, if conservatives had had more voice and reactionaries less, they might not have been so rash as to declare war on half of Europe. u/[genevievestrome](https://www.reddit.com/user/genevievestrome/) has provided excellent American examples.One can be a progressive or conservative and acknowledge that the other side has something to offer.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"The original link is dead.

Its hard for me to believe that a historical scholar truly has this take. NATO isnt expanding into the East. The East is expanding into NATO. These countries are literally BEGGING to join NATO because they are afraid of Russia. Poland literally blackmailed Clinton into pushing for them to join.Russias entire history, no exaggeration, is territorial expansion. The only time Russia isnt expanding and taking its neighbors land is when its either plotting its next land grab or its getting its ass kicked by a different empire who is pissed at Russia for taking its land in the past. Almost every time Russia has taken land, it has genocided the fuck out of the people. Go back 800 years. Russias expanding. Go back 1500 years. 300. NATO is a defensive alliance. This means the only reason you EVER have to fear NATO is if you intend to attack a NATO country. If Russia opposes Ukraine joining nato, the ONLY logical reason for that opposition is because Russia wants to be able to invade Ukraine. Its really that simple.These Eastern European countries arent in love with the west. But they are so afraid of Russian expansion that theyre begging to join NATO. Go to r/Latvia, r/Ukraine, r/Bolivia. Ask them if they fear Russian expansion. Go to r/finland or any country that used to be part of the Soviet Union if the people there have a fear of Russia one day knocking on their doors.Also, both of the recent wars in Chechnya had absolutely nothing to do with NATO expansion. And those were pretty recent.Its hard for people to accept that Putin is just basically a movie-esque bad guy who wants to take over the world. I think weve seen so many movies and tv shows and read so many books where that bad guy exists that it almost doesnt feel believable anymore because that fictional character seems unoriginal and lacking in writing creativity. But in real life, he exists. And his name is Vladimir Putin.These eastern EU nations feel they have two options to defend themselves against Putin. The first is joining NATO. The second is getting nukes. If we dont defend them, they all start getting nukes. If you understand nuclear warfare, you absolutely DO NOT want any more countries ever building nukes. The more countries that have nukes, the more likely we will see nuclear war one day. And putting nukes into the hands of small, impoverished developing nations that more vulnerable to corruption is especially dangerous.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Well ?who do you think contributes more tax dollars and domestic spending?

The ongoing Israeli invasion is a war of choice. There is no current threat by Hamas for Israel. Hamas has offered a cease for in exchange for the release hostages in the spring of last year. By continuing the conflict, the Israeli cabinet aims to:* destroy a large part of the Palestinian population\\n* drive of the remaining population\\n* destroy the infrastructure (hospitals, mosques, community centers, government buildings) that sustain Palestinian life in the area\\n* destroy Hamas as an organisation\\n* keep the current coalition government in place (and avoid Netanyahu being convicted)1. The United States has supported Israel in its continued war. It has repeatedly (threatened to) veto UN resolutions calling for a cease fire. It has sent 18 billion in arms to Israel in the year following the invasion. The US administration has critiqued the ICJ's decision that Israel should stop the occupation of the West Bank. *By doing so, the USA has provided Israel with the means to continue its genocide, shielded Israel from international measures against the invastion, and undercut International law - thus prolonging the current conflict*.\\n2. The USA has asked Israel not to conduct a major ground operation, but after Israel (very obviously) crossed the red line, the US has failed to implement any repercussions. *There is no significant pressure by the USA to end the conflict*.\\n3. Hamas is not still alive because of humanitarian pauses, but because it is practically impossible to destroy the organisation by invading and occupying Palestine; experts agreed on this in december of last year ([Israel-Gaza war: Can Hamas actually be eliminated? Experts weigh in](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/12/israel-gaza-war-can-hamas-actually-be-eliminated-experts-weigh-in.html)). *Your assessment that Israel has failed to destroy Hamas because of the US restraining them is therefore fundamentally incorrect.*","title":"CMV: The attitude of the West, alongside Biden's foreign policy in the Middle-East, was terrible, and his and Blinken's policies only prolonged the Israel-Hamas war."},{"text":"Would of been nice if the \\"justice\\" department remembered the first 2 years after it happened","title":"Biden calls on Americans not to forget Jan 6 attack"},{"text":"This is just a distraction.

They've just been around longer.You're looking at this through a very singular lens.As an alternative, consider r/AskHistorians . This is a sub that was created by historians as a place to answer questions related to history in a mostly academic way - responses must be properly sourced, make clear distinctions between facts and educated guesses and basically represent 'sound' fundamentals of the \\"historian\\". Respondents don't need to be qualified in any way, but they're all held to this same standard.This was created as a direct response to r/history where you can have a discussion on whether aliens built the pyramids or Israel controls the CIA, all being discussed by people who may never have actually read a book much less are able to source one. There is very little in the way of 'content moderation'.IMO It's very good that *both* of these subs exist, because it can be disappointing when an interesting question is asked in r/AskHistorians only to find every single reply has been deleted by the mods for failing to adhere to their standards. But this is the whole point on that sub! To get good quality answers that can be relied on to accurately espouse at least one view on a given question. This is only possible because the mods of r/AskHistorians maintain a very strict content moderation policy, otherwise it would simply turn in to r/history which seems entirely pointless. In this case the mods certainly weren't 'around for longer', they just wanted a sub that fulfils a different goal and that goal requires significant levels of moderating of content. This would continue to be the case even if the users of the sub disagreed. If they want it to be different, why don't they simply make their own sub with the rules that they want - which, of course, is exactly what the initial r/AskHistorians mods did.","title":"CMV: The Mods on reddit have too much control over the online communities they're charged with monitoring"},{"text":"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\\\\_Palestine\\\\_Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Palestine_Movement)Not good guys","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"But nobody thought of Jewish people as \\"white\\" until 20-35 years ago","title":"New bill in NY Senate, \\"New York state antisemitism vandalism Act,\\" would create a special Class A misdemeanor for the crime of vandalizing \\"pro-Israel print.\\""},{"text":"I can understand not wanting to post \\"Free Palestine\\" to avoid aligning yourself with the \\"Free Palestine Movement\\"","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The only foreign policy the Biden administration had in the Middle East was attempting to prevent a broader conflict that would suck the US in.

Among other things, depending on how big the gap is between the two events, it later quadruples the number of official options for anniversary gifts (traditional and modern), if that's of interest.I can also endorse getting married in a small ceremony at a nice restaurant just after the holidays have died down, as well as not mentioning to anyone, including the restaurant and the guests, that the event is a wedding (we said it was an engagement party). In the former case, things ended up being significantly cheaper because we were able to avoid saying the word 'wedding'. In the second case, we were able to entirely dodge anyone's and everyone's Very Firm Opinions, demands, and whines about how our wedding should look. We revealed the truth after everyone had eaten their appetizers, and we completed the ceremony before the entrees arrived.I should acknowledge the heroic efforts of my mother. She was, and is, a justice of the peace in the state where she raised me, so I had to ask her: 'Ok Mom, do you want to be the mother of the bride for once, or do you want to do the ceremony?' She chose the latter and did not hesitate, getting her official dispensation to be a justice of the peace in my state for one day. She also accepted the rigidly short script we chose for the vows without complaint.Being our officiant required her to keep her mouth shut from just after Thanksgiving to the day of.

What about subreddits where the main idea is itself incredibly controversial, and subject to frequent brigading? The goals of ideological diversity and promotion and discussion of the topic concept are in direct conflict. (See r/openchristian, r/georgism, r/atheism, etc.)Equally, to your other point, people are drawn to communities based on more than just the subreddit name (see r/worldpolitics). While superficial, redditors arent *that* stupid. Furthermore, there are countless possible names a community could have, and most of them are available if a community gets destroyed  or at least diverted from the original purpose  by improper moderation. (See r/femcelgrippysockjail to r/letgirlshavefun, r/nuclear and r/nuclearpower, r/loveforlandlords to r/loveforlandchads). Preservation of their communities is fundamentally what the communities want, and moderators should be given the powers to act towards that goal. Unrestricted discussion is a good ideal to hold, but it would actually decrease diversity, making all of Reddit a melting pot, and no community unique.

You did literally say that subreddits *belong* to their members, which they do not. Your entire argument is that moderators should not have the power to moderate, because you should be allowed to post things they don't like. Now is that not \\"purporting to be owed a platform\\"?But on a website with threads on numerous topics, the topic (Berlin, movies, philosophy) is what draws people to them not the arbitrary moderation. Whether or not someone's ideology lines up with that of some moderator is completely irrelevant.Reddit, the *actual* owner of all of the subreddits, clearly sees it differently, which is why they have set their platform up so that moderators can moderate however they like, and ban whoever they want.**Anyway, here's why your view is wrong...**Subreddits need to have rules, and they need to have moderators to enforce those rules, otherwise you basically just have 4chan. Moderators, who are all volunteers, can't really function in their role if they have to jump through hoops and justify every decision, or put things to a vote, or cannot update rules as things change.

Makes me that much more pissed at Garlland and sad about losing Jimmy and our Democracy all at once :So, we are watching people in Kazakhstan try to recover the right to have a say in their own government on the anniversary of the day that Americans came perilously close to losing that right. \\n \\nA year ago, forces marshaled by then-president Donald Trump tried to overturn the legitimate results of an election and install Trump against the will of the majority. They failed on that day, but their efforts have not stopped. In the past year, 19 Republican-dominated states have reworked their election systems to suppress Democratic voting and to give control of election results to partisan Republicans. They have purged from office election officials who refused to overturn the election results, and NPRs Miles Parks reported today that Republicans who continue to deny that Biden won the 2020 electionagainst all evidenceare running to become their states top election officials in at least 15 states in 2022.\\n \\nToday, former president Jimmy Carter, who co-founded the Carter Center with his wife Rosalynn to promote democracy and human rights, published an op-ed in the New York Times titled: I Fear for Our Democracy.I have... seen howdemocratic systemscan fall to military juntas or power-hungry despots, he wrote. He urged Americans to respect free and fair elections, refuse violence, pass election reforms that would make it easier to vote, and ignore disinformation. Our great nation now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss, he wrote. Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy. Today, Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke about the first anniversary of the attack on the Capitol. He reassured those frustrated that prosecutors have so far charged only the rioters themselves, while those who planned and then incited the insurrection still walk free. Garland explained that large investigations always begin with the smaller, easier cases while the department builds a timeline and gathers evidence. He promised that the Justice Department will follow the facts and that it will hold all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under lawwhether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.He called attention to the fact that the Department of Justice has issued more than 5,000 subpoenas and search warrants, seized around 2,000 devices, watched more than 20,000 hours of video, and searched through 15 terabytes of data. It has arrested and charged more than 725 defendants. And then he gave an eloquent defense of democracy and the voting rights on which it depends. After all, Congress established the Department of Justice in 1870 to protect the civil rights promised in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments by protecting the right of Black Americans to vote and so have a say in their government.Those who wrote the Reconstruction Amendments believed that voting was central to the concept of self-government, a belief Congress reinforced in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act that gave the Department of Justice new tools to protect the right to vote. But in the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder case, the Supreme Court gutted that law. Immediately, states began to pass laws to restrict voting. Lately, that push has gotten even stronger.Garland promised that the Justice Department will continue to do all it can with the powers it has, but he called it essential for Congress to give the department the power it needs to guarantee that every eligible voter can cast a vote that counts.What is at stake today in America is the nature of our government. Will we accept an authoritarian government like that currently under attack in Kazakhstan, in which an autocratic leader funnels money to his cronies while ordinary people struggle, unable to fix the system that is rigged against them until finally they lay down their lives to change it? Or will we restore the principles on which the Founders based this nation: that all men are created equal and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.?","title":"Joe Biden: What Americans should remember about Jan. 6"},{"text":"If Dems ran on a platform of we will invade Cuba and depose the communists would that make a dent in their performance in Florida?

There are \\"anonymous\\" websites like 4chan. The reason why Reddit is popular is because the moderation is good, and chops out a lot of the guff that other websites fail to moderate. The reason Twitter is turning into a shithole is because of the lack of moderation.What you really want is the ability to post what you want which goes against the current moderation standards. The reason why you can't post it is because the content lowers the quality of the subreddit. Let me make this abundently clear: The subreddit does not want the content you want to post. If your posts get removed, that's people telling you actively that the subreddit does not want what you want.This means that that subreddit is Not The Right Place for you to post what you want to post. It doesn't mean the Mods are wrong, or the Users are wrong, it means you, specifically you, are wrong.Your reading of the subreddit was wrong. If you thought it was okay to post the content you wanted to, it isn't. So, like others have said here, you have two options:1. Make your own website.\\n2. Make your own subreddit.If you think a \\"Berlin\\" subreddit would be more popular with a pro-Palestine slant, make that subreddit and prove it. If, as you seem to believe, there is democratic support for it, then you will create a more popular subreddit, and if people like your subreddit more, then the other one will slowly die.That actually is the democratic support you're looking for.

Your view is thus that conservatives consistently choose the wrong side, but I am suggesting that perhaps at least part of the cause of the phenomenon is that you consistently label what you understand to be the wrong side as conservative. Your view would thus be correct, but at least sometimes only in a trivial way, if you identify the movements through history, and the contemporary politics through your life, that as conservative in a way that guided partially by your preferences rather than some kind of objective ideological criteria.The ADA, if I recall, was bipartisan. Not something conservatives came up with but ended up supporting nonetheless.The ADA was indeed substantially bipartisan. For example, the template for the legislation was based on the accomplishments of conservative democrats in Virginia, and there was indeed meaningful opposition from conservative Evangelicals concerned about the initial inclusion of Churches in the definition of public accommodations. It also passed with substantial majorities in both parties after it was clear that it was going to pass regardless and be considered landmark legislation for generations. However, the Chamber of Commerce which organized the opposition did so largely within the Democratic party as well as a strange bedfellows coalition that it built with unions, and it passed mostly due to the focus that the Bush administration place on it. I do recall with AIDS that the Reagan admin and conservatives at the time used it to attack the gay population but I'll read into it more.The actions and inaction of the Regan Administration were horrific, and animated by ideology that I agree is correctly identified as conservative. However, it is easy to forget how similarly homophobic both the left and liberals were at the time. This was absolutely not just conservative, [Regan's press secretary joked about the AIDS crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAzDn7tE1lU) because essentially the whole country found it funny that gay men were dying. Compassion and humanity outside of the gay community was rare, and not actually that unevenly distributed. We mostly remember the hate as being conservative, because they were willing to say out loud what leftists and liberals were also thinking. Looking at real action at a Federal level however, both the [Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_White_CARE_Act) and its major modernization in 2006 were primarily conservative accomplishments.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"Frazzled.rip is real.

A 2023 study led by scientists from Australias CSIRO agency also found that greenhouse gas emissions were likely making strong El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation events, including the rainier La Ni?a phase, more frequent and severe. Tracy Ledger, an anthropologist who leads the Just Transition Programme at South Africas Public Affairs Research Institute, says Zambia and nations across the globe need to integrate the reality of climate change when they make decisions around energy infrastructure. Its not just about what a climate-neutral energy system looks like. But what does a climate resilient energy system look like? she says. If you incentivize every single household to put solar on their roof, what happens when the inevitable storm or flood comes and they wash away? I dont see a level of critical thinking about how we climate-proof our energy systems. In Zambia, we dont always have very long sunlight hours, unlike areas that are closer to deserts, like Namibia or Egypt, says Kabwe Mubanga, a lecturer and researcher at the University of Zambias Department of Geography and Environmental Studies. Some research really has to be done in that area to comprehensively say this is a direction we should take. The high start-up costs of solar remain another obstacle. While smaller solar devices might help power a lighting system or charge a phone, theres no cheap substitute for the demands of bigger operations. Moses Fwanyanga, 43, owns a small fish farm close to the banks of Lake Kariba, just miles away from the power station. He needs electricity to pump water from the lake into his fish ponds, half of which have dried up due to the blackouts. His business is barely surviving. I got a quote from China for solar that would help me pump water during the blackouts, but what I needed was going to cost $10,000, he says. We cannot afford that. We are living hand to mouth. The government will also need support to integrate solar into the national grid. Zambias Ministry of Green Economy and Environment has called on more international aid, most recently appealing to India to set up manufacturing plants in Zambia for solar panels, batteries, inverters, and other accessories. A 2023 agreement with the United Arab Emirates renewables company MASDAR to develop solar projects worth $2 billion in Zambia has stalled but the agreement is ongoing, according to the company. **While solars prospects as a viable, long-term energy solution remain uncertain, for many it is already indispensable.** For Mubanga, at the University of Zambia, a more cost-effective, climate-resilient solution needs to embrace hydro and solar as well as wind, geothermal, and even coal. Zambia currently draws just 13 percent of its power from coal, but this years outages have forced the government to approve plans for the nations second and third coal-fired power plants. Unable to light their electric stoves, the blackouts have also pushed many Zambians to use charcoal for their cooking, creating a huge demand for the resource, which is accelerating deforestation and leading to increased carbon emissions. Mubanga says Zambias Ministry of Energy has also identified more than 80 hotspots for geothermal energy, as well as locations for hydroelectric in the north, where theres more rainfall. You need both adaptation and a coping strategy, he says. For me, solar is a good back-up. But the Zambian government hopes that \\"back-up will provide more than a third of the nations electricity by 2030. And while solars prospects as a viable, long-term energy solution in Zambia remain uncertain, for many it is already indispensable. Earlier this year, Emmanuel Simukoko purchased, for $27.50, a solar light that he can also use to charge his phone. When you dont have electricity, everything is a challenge, he says as he sets up for the night shift. With solar, I can keep a light on.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":" The American approach that led to the KKK and what not was born of the conservative movement.You are arguing that Lincoln was a conservative?

With multiple utility-scale arrays now in the works, the country is betting on solar to increase its power capacity by a third. When the lights are off, people think that my shop is closed. As the sun sets on Lusaka, Zambias capital, Emmanuel Simukoko explains why his business has suffered from the worst blackouts in living memory. Usually he stays open until 11 pm and makes a healthy living selling groceries, snacks, and drinks to his neighbors in Kabwata, a middle-class suburb in southeast Lusaka. But this year, Zambians have experienced power outages lasting 21 hours, or even days at a time. The luckiest households may receive five hours of electricity a day, but its often at unpredictable times or in the middle of the night. Simukoko, 33, can no longer sell cold drinks, his biggest money maker, or perishables like milk and yogurt. He cant charge his phone, so he cant take online payments. And without lights, he has to close early. Its never been this bad before, he says. I lost maybe 30 percent of my business. I had to spend all my money on candles. It was getting too much, so I had to take on other piecework to provide for the people who look up to me. **Zambia has lost $1.3 billion due to the energy crisis, equivalent to 5 percent of gross domestic product, says an economist.** Zambias energy crisis stems from an unprecedented drought. In 2024, southern Africa suffered its worst mid-season dry spell in over a century as El Ni?o brought record-breaking warm weather to the planet, leaving tens of millions of people food insecure. In Zambia, where 83 percent of the nations electricity comes from hydropower, the drought also decimated its ability to generate power as the nations lakes and rivers dried up. While only 42 percent of Zambians are connected to the national grid, millions who have come to rely on electricity for their livelihoods have been affected by the outages. The crisis has had a massive impact, says Nicholas Phiri, permanent secretary for Zambias Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. We are talking about those running barber shops. We are talking about those running welding machines, butcheries, hair salons. As the blackouts devastate businesses, the crisis has also wreaked havoc on the nations economy, reducing its revenues as citizens pay lower taxes and spend less money amid rising import costs and a weakened kwacha, the local currency. Trevor Hambayi, a Zambian economist, says the nation has lost approximately $1.3 billion due to the energy crisis, equivalent to 5 percent of the nations gross domestic product. At the end of the day, this is also going to increase the level of poverty within the country, he says. As climate change threatens more frequent and intense droughts, Zambia will remain vulnerable to such crises so long as it relies on hydroelectricity. Thats why the nation has recently pivoted to a more predictable type of renewable energy: solar. In peak times, Zambia needs to provide households and businesses on the grid with 2,400 megawatts of electricity, but the drought has slashed its available hydropower generation from 3,777 megawatts to only 1,040 megawatts. The 1,080-megawatt Kariba Dam power station on the Zambezi River in southern Zambia, which ordinarily produces about a third of the countrys electricity, is close to shutting down completely, with the enormous Lake Kariba reservoir near record lows. Zambia is currently in the bottom tenth of the worlds solar rankings, with solar contributing just 0.7 percent of the national output. But as power from the dam began to stutter, the government called for a solar explosion, and officials hope that percentage will increase dramatically as the nation seeks to diversify its energy supply. In March, the Zambian government entered into a power purchase agreement with the Canadian producer SkyPower Global, one of the worlds largest developers of utility-scale energy projects, to supply 1,000 megawatts of solar energy  enough to power approximately 4 million homes. As the deal was announced, Zambias president, Hakainde Hichilema, said the project was a crucial component of our Integrated Renewable Energy Plan, especially in the context of our current drought. **Solar projects could supply electricity to people off grid, as well as accommodate a rapidly growing population.** Three months later, Hichilema commissioned a 60-megawatt solar plant in the city of Kitwe to supply surrounding copper mines with power, which will help mitigate the financial impact of the crisis on the nations biggest export industry. In August, the Chisamba District of Zambias Central Province announced the construction of a 100-megwatt solar power facility that is slated to take a maximum of two years to complete. Then, at the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation in September, China Datang Corporation and Zambias national provider signed an agreement to develop three solar energy projects by 2026 for an additional 220 megawatts. Meanwhile, the African Development Bank has approved $8 million in funding to develop a 25-megawatt solar plant in western Zambia. A Turkish company has also partnered with Zambias GEI Power to develop in the south a 60-megawatt solar plant with battery storage that is scheduled to begin operations in September 2025 and serve 65,000 households. If these projects are completed, Zambias maximum installed generation capacity would increase by more than a third; The government aims to source at least 30 percent of the nations energy from non-hydro renewables by 2030. This would not only alleviate crises in times of drought but could also supply electricity to people currently off grid, as well as accommodate a rapidly growing population. Johnstone Chikwanda, an energy expert and chairperson of the nonprofit Energy Forum Zambia, says nature has forced a major shift in [our] mindset. Zambia has come to realize that our safe zone is solar energy. The nations move toward solar and battery storage is a trend reflected across other African countries. Solar is growing fastest in South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and Botswana, with large facilities operating and planned in those four nations. Still, Zambias utility-scale solar projects wont be fully realized for years. Just getting the panels to Zambia can take months, as most of the equipment is imported. China currently has a 55 percent share of Africas total supply market for solar panels. In the meantime, the Zambian government is encouraging citizens to invest in personal, off-grid solar solutions, and in July it removed import duties and value-added taxes on solar equipment. People are buying solar panels and batteries like hot cakes, notes Chikwanda. The ferocity of this years drought has led to unprecedented investment in solar. And while those efforts are now mitigating the impacts of the energy crisis for thousands of Zambians, some fear the nation risks running head-first into another energy relationship thats dependent on meteorological conditions.Rest of the article is below ??  !ping ECO&amp;AFRICA&amp;CHINA","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I hate when prices are high, as stuff is unaffordable to me.I hate when prices are low, as it encourages waste and degrades the value I feel products ought to have.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I have looked at your comment history, I have only seen left wing stance, why do you think you are a centrist? feel like you are not at all.","title":"CMV: The future will hold diminishing returns for Elon Musk."},{"text":"The fuck you telling us for you're the president.","title":"Biden calls on Americans not to forget Jan 6 attack"},{"text":"The point isn't to replace the other sub, though, it's to create one ran the way you want.

A conservative approach to this issue was taken through the Spanish empire and Brazil. Why is the American approach to this issue superior? It lead to a civil war, segregation, the first KKK, the second KKK, and a hundred and fifty years of racial tensions with no end in sight. It had one major tradeoff, which was that emancipation took 25 years longer, though that does need to be weighed with the consequences. And that tradeoff needs to be contextualized - because sudden freedom for an illiterate agricultural worker who has spent their entire life on a plantation is meaningless, all that happened for most of them was just that they were sharecroppers... after a significant number literally starved to death due to the war.  -DesegregationSegregation only happened due to the progressive approach to emancipation.  -Women's SuffrageImmediately resulted in the Harding administration, the most corrupt administration in US history.  -Child Labor LawsMade illegal after child labor already went away  -UnionizationUnions are fucking evil, the Teamter's are just a legalized branch of the Italian mafia. -FDRs 4 terms -Defeating the Nazis - Pulling the US out of the Great Depression and emerging as a world power -UN and NATOFDR made the great depression worse, and committed atrocities like burning food while people starved.

Even as much of the rest of the developed world has spent the last three decades working to catch up to the standard set by this legislation that was championed by Bush Sr. in a deeply conservative way, and passed with more republican votes than Democratic. \\n* [President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Emergency_Plan_for_AIDS_Relief) is the global health funding by the United States to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and help save the lives of those suffering from the disease, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. It has done much more than directly save 25 million lives, but also made possible the contributions to society that those 25 million people have made over the last two decades. The $110 billion investment that Bush Jr. championed is one of the primary reasons why sub-Saharan Africa is rapidly developing into a 21st century where it will be the center of the new world our kids grow in, rather than regressing back into the chaos and deprivation of the 60s.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"Because you are probably making more than the average workers income.

Cleveland Cliffs would control 95% of US iron ore production, and car companies were legitimately concerned this would raise prices.\\nBlocking this deal on national security grounds is dubious since US Steel will continue to be run as an independent subsidiary with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. Additionally, Japan is a US ally and them operating in the US is not actually a security threat.  Their automobile manufacturers operate dozens of US factories.  If it was really a national security threat, then why would they be allowed to operate here?  If things would change and we went to war with Japan, theres nothing stopping the US from simply nationalizing all their steel and automobile plants if needed for war production.\\nCleveland Cliffs essentially lobbied the US government to block this deal so they could buy a competitor with a below-market offer.  Their follow-up offer will likely be much lower than their initial bid as a result, and could result in a monopoly which is bad for consumers.

It's a common refrain that what conservatism offers is conservation of the good systems we have as a balance for the change liberals push. But the reality, if you are objective and honest,  is that liberals do not push for change for change's sake. Liberals already do the work of conserving systems, they just don't do so reflexively and are open to change. Liberals for example can be seen today trying to conserve democracy, trying to conserve social security, trying to conserve abortion access. If the claim to success is just that conservatives don't change things (even this is demonstrably not true), then my point stands that. Liberals are the ones pushing society forward while conservatives can,  at best, only preserve the good liberals have given while at worst they oppose the good liberals have done historically and lag behind liberals in that regard. English common law is not preserved by the Constitution. English common law wad what we got away from and when we adopted the Constitution, that superceded any traditions in English common law that came before it.

By definition it's the liberals who are pushing for major changes and thus defining what we see, in retrospect, as having been major issues. When conservatives win stuff just stays the same, which doesn't make it into the history books. Like, for example, the US Constitution was liberal for its time, but it was also in some senses quite conservative - the English common law system, for example, was completely preserved in the US constitution, with traditions going all the way back to Anglo-Saxon times. The framers could have created an entirely new legal system, but they didn't. If they had, and it was considered to be good, you would be listing it out as a major win for liberalism, but since they didn't, and the old system was conserved, we don't even think of this as being a major issue.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"Are you sure US conservatism is a good representation of actual conservatism?
