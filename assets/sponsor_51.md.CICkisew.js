Catholics really are the kings of passive aggressive speech. I quote excerpts - the whole article is worth reading.\\nOne could almost imagine the tears welling up in his eyes as New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan lamented the rejection he received from Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president, of his invitation to the annual Al Smith charity dinner.\\nHe said he was \\"doubly disappointed\\" at her refusal to attend. The cardinal has tried to convince the world that she is receiving bad advice. Others have tried to convince her that a change of mind would allow her to show civility, to elevate political discourse, to show she doesn't have anything against Catholics and so on.\\nPerhaps it would be best to stop here to collect our breath and spend a moment or two reflecting on just who should be placed on the spot for engaging in less-than-civil behavior, as well as contributing to the diminishment of Catholic identity and credibility in the public square.\\nEven in this era of the endless gush of stuff coming at us on every manner of device, it is possible to cull reality from it all. In the case of Trump, the material almost outruns social media's ability to keep up. *(!!)*\\nBut it seems we've become so numb to his destruction of norms that behavior that would have disqualified someone from running for dogcatcher in a previous era is now tolerated at the level of the presidency.\\nThe mistake  and the cardinal is hardly the first or last to make it  is to judge the moment as if it were somehow still attached to a degree of normalcy, or what we've always known in presidential politics.\\nYes, the Al Smith dinner was once a place where, even amid the sharp-elbow politics of a presidential campaign, normal humans could sit with each other, share a meal and some levity and walk away with dignity and reputation intact. Trump changed all that. And it is absurd at this point to act otherwise.\\nThe sin here is not that Kamala Harris had the good sense to reply, \\"No thank you, I'm previously engaged.\\" The real scandal is that the good Catholic cardinal of the great city of New York would not have the courage to say, this year, that the current Republican candidate is a walking example of so much the Catholic Church finds repugnant in today's politics that he would suspend the normal invitations.\\nThe real controversy is that an event that touts its history of raising funds for society's most needy is going to host someone who is one of the culture's greatest threats to that kind of caring. The real outrage is that Trump, given the public nature and extent of his repulsive record, should be invited to a fundraiser for an organization, Catholic Charities, that has long worked in the trenches to save and transform lives on society's farthest margins. It is tragic that the guest of honor this year will be someone whose personal example and policy wishes are in a collision course with the principles of Catholic social teaching. *(!!!)*","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Trump: I am going to kill you, take all your money and remove any rights from anyone you loveMAGA: He sure has my vote, he tells it like it is","title":"Trumps Closing Pitch to Voters: I Will Let You Die If You Dont Bow to My Demands"},{"text":"I have a friend who thinks that being gay is a sin.

Societies are liberal because they are superior. Specifically, they are superior economically. A society that is wealthy has a population that is less interdependent. People have money so instead of fostering good relationships with the whole town/clan/neighborhood, you just buy the goods and services that you need, when you need them. In poor societies, you can't demand things on the fly, so you have to foster and maintain good relations so that they are ready to help you when the need arises. Conservatism is all about maintaining traditions. These traditions came about for whatever historical or happenstance reason, but they are maintained as a way of signalling your membership in the group, and thus your trustworthiness. Liberalism happens since you need to rely on other people less, you can express your individuality. This is the default state because we are all diverse and want to be free to do what we want inspite of other peoples objections. But, our understanding of mutual dependence forces us to socialize and sacrifice our own individuality for our own material wellbeing, leading to traditions","title":"CMV: Some societies/cultures are superior because they are liberal.

I would say Reddit is not representative either, as you noted about city subs.I would argue that, within left-leaning and diverse cities, the strongest proponents of both funding and defunding the police tend to come from communities with high rates of crime and policing. So you'll see Eric Adams with strong Black support, and you'll also see Black activists among his loudest critics for his pro-police policies. But even the people of color who want to increase police levels also oppose discrimination and want certain police reforms. They largely agree with Black Lives Matter as a concept, they just feel that it should include safety from community violence as well (i.e., violent crime). And, when you look nationally, Black voters are more skeptical of the police than white voters. Within cities, you just tend to get much more liberal white voters than you do elsewhere, so the gap can sometimes flip.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"Make it a 5 over 1 and Ill be happy?","title":"Unironically, the future Neoliberals want"},{"text":"Have you tried a lemon meringue pie?","title":"How do you exorcise a demon?"},{"text":"Except it's more common in Japan for such crimes to go unreported or unpunished.","title":"CMV: Some societies/cultures are superior because they are liberal.

Theres a sampling bias involved: to be observed, a society must exist currently. Most super radical, change-oriented civilizations dont survive for one simple reason: their ideas suck.

Holding a once-a-year gathering to make decisions made national defense impossible.https://www.adventurecanada.com/iceland/a-political-history-of-the-worlds-oldest-democracy250 years of democracy, then conquered for the next 600 years.

Just because the most dominant civilizations have liberal roots, it doesnt mean that any given society will become more successful if it starts implementing liberal policies. Bitcoin is an official currency in El Salvador. Is this likely to lead to El Salvador becoming a world power, hell fucking no. But it certainly creates a higher ceiling of an outcome than staying the same, which would be the conservative thing to do. Every time that a move like this works, it ends up in the history books. You just dont see all the times it doesnt. Thats not to say that a great idea shouldnt be copied, I just dont think changing established and proven elements of society is worth changing just for the sake of change.  Heres an example of a boring, average conservative state: Oman. Oil state but not super wealthy (gdp per capita 25k). Monarchy. Havent fought a war since 1975. Are they going to become a world power?

Conservative societies are backward because they are conservative"},{"text":"That PRRI report is a good source, but it doesn't back up your conclusions. I actually think it backs up mine. In particular, the report states:* Most Americans (63%) believe that programs geared toward helping poor students or students of color get admission to selective or prestigious colleges are effective in preparing young people for the future. This includes majorities of Gen Z adults (69%) and teens (65%).\\n* While 70% of American adults hold some or a great deal of trust in the police, Gen Zers (53%) and millennials (57%) are less likely to do so.So Gen Z overall is more likely to approve of affirmative action and less likely to trust the police. The report also says they are more likely to report having experienced discrimination, lining up closely with Millenials. So I'm not sure where you get your argument that moderates oppose DEI initiatives. Moderates often have complex ideologies, and teens are still forming their identities. I would also say this is a misunderstanding of what DEI policies are and how they get enacted in the workplace. They are often pushed by liberals and employees of color (who may be otherwise moderate), but DEI hiring policies tend to be pursued for legal reasons (non-discrimination) and marketing practices tend to be pursued for business reasons (appealing to younger, more diverse generations). Gen Z being more diverse is likely to continue the trend. The companies that have backtracked have done so because they appeal to older, whiter, or more conservative customers (John Deere, Harley Davidson) or because they felt the DEI policies were too abrasive (where they usually kept the diversity initiatives and dropped the equity/justice-oriented ones).I'd also disagree with your assertion that Gen Z is becoming significantly more conservative based on this data. From the report:* Gen Z adults (21%) are less likely than all generational groups except millennials (21%) to identify as Republican.  \\n* With the exception of millennials (24%), Gen Z adults (28%) are notably less likely than other generational cohorts, including Gen X (36%), baby boomers (40%), and the Silent Generation (46%), to identify as conservative. By contrast, Gen Z adults are the most likely of any generation to identify as liberal, at 43%...\\n* Gen Z teens and Gen Z adults are equally likely to identify as conservative (30% for both), but teens are notably less likely to identify as liberal (24%) than Gen Z adults.\\n* Gen Z teens are as likely as Gen Z adults to identify as Republicans (both about 22%) and as independents (35% vs. 30%, respectively), but they are notably less likely to identify as Democrats (27% vs. 36%).On the last two points, most of the change is from Democrat/liberal to Independent/moderate/unknown. Conservative/Republican identification didn't gain from this shift, and teen views are likely to be in flux as they enter adulthood.Bringing it back to Black Lives Matter, the movement likely had more of an impact on older Gen Z adults, who were of prime protesting age, than on younger Gen Z teens.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"I'll fill in; yes, they're very shit.

But did your local governing body really solve homelessness? I would argue, not at all.Large cities become catchments for the homeless problem of surrounding areas. That doesnt necessarily mean that the large cities themselves are the cause of or reason for homelessness or that they alone should be the solution. Merely that they are the ones currently saddled with the homelessness problem which is also heavily linked to the drug abuse problem.While this is all to address your points, the bigger point is that OP was speaking of larger cultures and societies.","title":"CMV: Some societies/cultures are superior because they are liberal.

Sure it's Washington's precedent, but a two limit term is pretty quick and (aside from Supreme Court nominations) a lot of presidential/executive actions and even Congressional/legislative stuff can get undone pretty quickly after two terms (and especially after one). I think a 4 term limit would have been better. Because first most presidents are never popular enough to get a third (let alone a fourth) term so that's already an EXTREMELY difficult task that only an accomplished leader would get. And second most presidents (whether good or bad) don't even want a third term lol. Close to a decade in office being in the public's eye is more than enough for most with a big enough ego to run for president. I definitely think the amendment going with two terms as the limit was more unfavorable to an effective liberal/Democratic president and gave republicans an effective built in tool to stop progress.","title":"Society if Democrats won every election!"},{"text":"**Daniel McCarthy writing for The Telegraph:** Kamala Harris is not on pace to win Americas presidential election. The momentum that seemed to be propelling her to the White House has bled away. While the race is not exactly Donald Trumps to lose, his prospects have never looked better. Indeed, theyve only been improving.Harris may hold a slight lead in the national polling averages, but thats deceptive. Her numbers are much worse than Hillary Clintons were in 2016 before she lost to Trump. Clinton was ahead by more than six points; Harris is up less than a point and a half. And in the six states most likely to decide this years outcome,?[polls show a dead heat](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/16/kamala-harris-donald-trump-are-neck-neck-michigan-poll/), with leads for either candidate within the margin of error.?If the past is any guide, that tie is also misleading, and Trump has a clear advantage. He exceeded polling projections in both of his previous races, even in his unsuccessful 2020 re-election bid.The Vice President pinned her all hopes on getting voters to see her as a force for renewal and change. It seemed to work, at first. Voters appeared eager for a younger, less familiar face in national politics. She may be Joe Bidens colleague in government, but a vice president rarely occupies much space in Americans minds.?Trump, on the other hand, is nothing if not overfamiliar. Presidential elections are usually a referendum on the party in power, but an ex-president isnt usually at the head of the other partys ticket.?So Harris has tried to make herself seem like the outsider in this race. She campaigns on slogans like turn the page and were not going back, as if the Biden-Harris record in office were really a joint Biden-Trump record stretching back eight years. She hopes to promise a fresh beginning, under a leader decades younger than Biden or Trump.?Consciously or not, Harris has been copying Trumps sales pitch from 2016, when he offered himself as an alternative to the worn-out politics of the Bush and Clinton dynasties.?The trouble for Harris is that millions of Americans have fond memories of the Trump years, before inflation shot up like a SpaceX rocket and wars broke out from Ukraine to the Middle East. Trump delivered peace and prosperity; Biden and Harris have presided over inflation, chaos on the world stage, and uncontrollable immigration.?While voters might not have paid close attention to Harriss actions as vice president, they know shes Bidens partner in all the frustrations and failures of the past four years. They also know Biden named her his border tsar, a flattering title that has come back to haunt Harris as voters hold her responsible for the immigration crisis. Along with inflation, that is voters top concern.Harris hasnt been able to run away from the record she shares with Biden. And she hasnt been able to capitalise on Trumps age as a campaign issue because she still has to keep up the pretence that the President is still fit to serve, when hes obviously in much worse shape than Trump.  \\n**Article Link:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/19/kamala-harris-has-lost-momentum-election-day/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/19/kamala-harris-has-lost-momentum-election-day/)","title":"Daniel McCarthy: 'Kamala Harris has lost momentum C no wonder shes getting desperate'"},{"text":"In America, probably grow a penis and get vitiligo.

Effectively, with a liberal government any sort of international dominance must be won through diplomacy or economics rather than direct military action, or you get riots and unrest at home.Similarly, if you don't care about international politics or human rights at all, liberal democracies harm your interests by limiting the amount of power you can hold over others. If you wanted to become a dictator there are term limits and other barriers you'd have to overcome. If you wanted to own slaves you wouldn't easily be able to. If you wanted to hurt other people of a group you don't like then it's much harder because group specific protections exist.Bare always in mind that for the vast majority of human history the only thing that has mattered is being the strongest nation and you can see how it's possible for permissive cultures to fall behind strict, planned countries.

We already see across dozens of nations what education and health model works best.Healthcare, Housing, and Education are all issues where US troubles are unique and even other countries haven't fully solved those issues. In K-12, I don't really see where the US lags behind other countries, and the US has some of the best colleges/college system in the world. If you're talking about fully funded education, I have a lot of issues with how people talk about that. While it's true that graduate education isn't really taxpayer funded in the US, many colleges come up with their own system of funding (TA-ships and fellowships) and undergraduate education is often heavily funded. For example, in California, if you make under 80,000, then all tuition is covered, and a lot of your housing is funded. In other states as well, if your parents make under certain thresholds, then tuition is almost free a lot of the time. In Europe, your tuition is free, but housing isn't. The US system isn't that much different from other countries. It is on average, more costly, but not nearly as much as people call it. So I'm not sure what you mean by the best model of education. You haven't addressed housing, so I'll skip that.Even European and Canadian healthcare face issues. Overcrowding, lack of medical research, relatively low healthcare wages. As I said in my main argument, what are the compromises the American people are willing to make to publicize healthcare?You're right on climate issues though. Scientists/nations do know what to implement and how to implement. The only problem is uprooting current systems like oil or fracking. It's not just companies who advocate for those. People depend on those industries for jobs and they're still an important voter block.

The failure of government to address issues that directly affect the lives of young people  such as climate, and the costs of education, housing and health care  fuels pervasive fatalism.These are all real issues, but I don't see how raising taxes would solve these issues?Climate first needs to be agreed on by the government (and the public) as a real issue that needs fixing and we need to agree how we're going to solve it before we throw money at the issue. For example, there's nuclear, solar, wind, electrical vehicles, reducing pollution (which is also a question of where), which companies are going to be the ones implementing solutions, and much more. Just throwing more money at it isn't enough, if the US as a whole cannot agree on specific measures, which is indicated by Democrats implementing policies immediately to be removed by Republicans, and then the Democratic candidate specifically endorsing fracking.Housing right now is more of an issue of supply and demand. There's so many potential buyers and little potential sellers. There's arguments that companies are buying houses and keeping them as assets for rent, which is raising prices, but that isn't a problem that can solved just by throwing money at it. Education is a different beast, but it still isn't really an issue of money. Biden's student loan forgiveness, while it's a nice step, it ultimately gives money to the already college educated, which is a small, but well-off portion of the population, while providing no incentives for future graduates. Also, I don't think enough people acknowledge this, but the federal government gives massive amounts of aid through FAFSA. For me, a current college student, it gives me complete tuition reimbursement and covers a large part of my housing.Healthcare is probably the closest issue that can be solved by higher taxes/ publicization of healthcare, but another big issue I don't see people address is how the medical industry also has to be reformed. Healthcare workers in the US in general earn much higher wages than their counterparts in Europe and there are a lot of differences between healthcare in the EU and here. A large part of it is how we specifically bottleneck residencies, but another reason is the privatization of healthcare. For example, in both the US and the EU, there's an issue of doctors not wanting to practice in rural areas. The US deals with it by offering salary incentives to rural doctors, while the Britain specifically deals with it by using a roulette and randomly assigning doctors, regardless of merit or preference to areas in need. There's also the question of healthcare research. The US funds more healthcare research than any other nation. Are we going to reduce funding to cancer research? Because the fact of the matter is that a public system just won't have as much money as a private one. So what sacrifices are people willing to make?You make a lot of arguments about how tax cuts are bad and how the wealthy are going to benefit, while the public suffers, but I think the premise of your argument: that the government with more money is going to solve public issues, is flawed. Throwing more money at issues can be a solution, but it's an inefficient one, and I believe that the public/government needs to agree first on *how* we're going to solve issues before we throw taxpayer money around. Half-promises and half-measures just reduces trust in the government to get the job done while increasing the reluctance to give them more money in the first place. The US has a lot of money to begin with. How about we demand better use of that money before we give them more?","title":"CMV: The US government should do more to solve societys problems, even if it means higher taxes for all"},{"text":"Hear hear.

From buying your house and hoping it increases in value so that you have something to leave your kids, to building a multi national megacorp.Fact is that the megacorps can handle it. They'll split off into banks, sell their shit to the banks, and live off loans or some other bullshit move that they have the money and resources to accomplish, but anyone smaller will be stuck where they are.Your \\"balance\\" is a maintaining the status quo, solidifying the position of the megacorps in perpetuity by making it impossible for anyone to rise to their level.As for it only applying to earnings above 50 million?

The government taking less is actually a beneficent boon rather than the status quo, they're doing you a favor by allowing you to have more money, right?No. I make 200k. That is the amount of money that I earn. The government \\"costs\\" me about 66k a year. Back when I only made a 100k, when I made half what I do now, and felt far wealthier, under Trump. His tax cuts reduced my \\"costs\\" what I pay to the government by a bout 500 bucks a month.

What that will do is lower government revenue, revenue they leech off of you.When phrased that way it doesn't sound as palatable. When phrased honestly. Taxes are a cost you pay. Taxes are revenue the governent pulls from you. They provide a service, or rather claim to provide a service, and force you to pay it under threat of death and imprisonment.Be honest.

Sounds good? Who doesn't want free healthcare? Look at Canada and the UK and the Netherlands. I'm not talking about the costs or the wait times or the (sometimes) shitty service. No. I'm talking about the things like little Alfie Evans or the things that happened to Christine Gauthier or like what happened with Zoraya ter Beek; those are not isolated cases.You give the government power over your health, and incentivize them to take the cheapest route possible for taking care of your health, and the obvious will happen. As was the case for little Alfie, it wasn't even about costs that had them refuse him care, their supreme court demanded that that boy die, purely and completely as a power move.Then there's gun control. If I drive 20 minutes up the street with the pistol I'm licensed to carry, then I've committed a felony. Is this because MD or DC don't trust VA's ccw process? No. They're virtually identical. It's purely a power move. It has nothing to do with safety and everything to do with them letting us know that they control us. I can drive to any of the nearby states with my pistol and they're fine with that, because for the most part, they aren't authoritarian hellholes that selectively enforce their enforcement against the law abiding.

A large majority of the elected Democrat politicians are progressive, sane, and principled representatives of the people they represent. But there have been some very high profile ... Problem children .. over the past few decades that gave a Christofascist right wing a target rich opportunity for disinformation and propaganda. 2 examples that stick out have been the \\"please stop talking;  making it worse\\" antics of Maxine Waters, and the now convicted corruption of Bob Menendez. We're in a desperate situation in 2024 because of voter apathy and lack of turnout, ESPECIALLY in non-presidential election years. Being choosey and critical isn't a luxury we have for this election cycle - and part of that is our own fault as underperforming voters (by track record.)2024 requires down-ballot blue wave voting and demands voter turnout for DEM voters of at least 70%+. The same will be required in 2026 for the midterms. What I'm advising along the way is for voters to pay close attention to their representatives and hold them accountable if they warrant scrutiny. But that also means paying attention during Primaries and after to ensure that specific seats are occupied by representatives who are like more professional like AOC, Buttigieg, Crockett, and so on. And keep them ethical and legal. But not at the expense of an office. Demand accountability when ethics or law violations are proven but turnout and replace them in special elections with better blue choices. Then we can begin to build towards the ideal in the image.","title":"Society if Democrats won every election!"},{"text":"That depends on who gets to say what qualifies as a valid concern, doesnt it? And who DOES have that power? Whoever the MSM focuses their cameras on as the authority, thats who.In the case of the last election, it seemed like most election concerns raised by the Trump team and republicans got taken pretty seriously until they were found to be baseless. When Clinton threw a fit, her concerns over Russia were taken seriously. And the revelations from that investigation werent enough to change the outcome of the election. Heres my take: I dont have the least bit of confidence in the sincerity, capability or trustworthiness of either of the POTUS candidates, nor any of the Congresscritters, for that matter. Those that pull the $tring$ from backstage will continue to hold onto REAL power regardless of which puppet theyre dangling in front of our faces.Agree with the first sentence. Ive said it before in this sub, but my lack of confidence in either candidate has prevented me from voting in the last two elections. And I will carry that trend forward for this one. I refuse to sacrifice my morality and participate in the game. I dislike one far more than the other, but thats not really important. I dont know how much I agree with the *real power* holder line, but I can see why people think that.Recently, and especially in this election cycle, it seems that the primary goal has been to create rampant division and animosity among the populace  the more areas of heated division, internal strife and hatred, the better, and theyre doing a fine job, because regardless of who wins, the mood of the country is volatile, and all of the peoples pent up anger and frustration is poised to be focused on one another  peasants vs. peasants  while the Lord Class chuckles, and consolidates their power.Big agree on ramped up animosity. Its felt like a steady rise over the last few cycles. The Obama years were a little uncomfortable as people started to display some open racism and the shift to identity politics began. The first Trump cycle brought about the chants of jailing his opponent and making up names for opposition. And weve only increased in temperature as time has gone on.

Id like to see her talk more about foreign policy, which I find her to be weak on.Biden chose to continue Trumps hostility towards China. I think Trumps suggestions at starting another trade war will harm consumers and US companies, while at the same time, we do need to push back on Chinese aggression in the south pacific, its spying efforts, and its anti-competitive practices of subsidizing the production of goods to undercut domestic companies. I worry about how Trump will handle Ukraine/Russia, however the writing is on the wall that total victory for Ukraine is out of reach. The next president will most likely have to mediate some form of cease-fire. Harris needs to be clear on what her objectives are for Ukraine, as keeping with the Biden status-quo of supplying weapons is becoming expensive and futile. Lastly, in the middle east, Harris needs to be unwavering in her support of Israel while also using this moment of weakness for Hamas/Hezbollah/Iran to outline a two-state solution that will bring lasting peace.As a candidate, I think Harris is intentionally vague because she most likely plans to continue the Biden admins policies. This would be a mistake, as it is undeniable that the administration has failed in several areas (boarder, acceleration of inflation, afghanistan withdrawal, containing Russia/China/Iran aggression).

As evidence, I provided the fact that Democrats have gotten more votes in every election except 2004 for the last thirty years; if there were a conspiracy to create phantom Democratic voters, it would have to have been in effect for at least that long, and one has to wonder why it was not used to swing the elections in 2000 or 2016 in the favor of the Democratic party.

The defund the police aspect was just stupid and idiotic. But the overall public outcry from BLM over police brutality did achieve some great steps in the right direction. Thousands of counties around the country have elevated their minimum requirements for police recruits and have started actually denying young, inexperienced and low educated applicants. The emphasis on restraint for the use of lethal force has been increased. Problem officers are punished and fired more frequently/easily. Most police officers, for better or worse, are so scared to use their service weapon because there is nothing they fear more than being Derrick Chauvin. Deescalation tactics are not only taught more to recruits and veteran officers, but they are strongly emphasised and the training is much more through now, vs the outdated tactics from pre george floyd. \\nI think that scaring police has had some bad outcomes, like officers who have died because they are too scared to use lethal force, but these seem to be few and far between. I think holding police accountable was an extremely important step in the right direction. \\nAnd like I said, not all police forces in the country have improved and trained better officers, but I do believe it forced a ton, the majority, to update and modernize  their training and hiring process while also stressing the importance of deescalation tactics as a first resort, and lethal force as an absolute last resort. Combine that with a more thorough hiring process and a shorter leash for problem officers and I think it's been an overall positive force for good. So BLM as an organization? Corrupt and too toxic.

Even if Philly turnout doesn't increase, a small shift right isn't going to net as many votes as people think it does, especially if offset by SEPA left shifts, the latter of which is nearly certain to happen anyway.\\"I messed with the PA margins a bit back, will have to do it again, but I recall giving Trump a generous 3-5 margin gains in most counties, and Harris the typical gains in Allegheny and SEPA.  On top of those rural gains he required a big gain in Philly, like +8 points margin wise to win.  This is with assuming 2020 turnout across the board. It really showcase how big of a uphill battle it will be for him if those blue counties do what they likely will.**Edit:** Messed with the margins again assuming the same 2020 vote numbers in every county using: https://elections-daily.com/shuffler/ Didn't give any change to Blueish counties: Lehigh, Northampton, Monroe, Lackawanna, Dauphin, Centre and Erie even though those all shifted our way a good bit in 2020.  Just gave Harris +3 in Allegheny, Montgomery, Bucks, and Chester. *(They all shifted more than that in 2020)* For Trump, I gave him +3 in all the red counties, even ones that have been trending our way.  *(His highest margin gain in a county in 2020 was +3.8 in Clarion)*I then gave him a +8 margin gain in Philly.

[Here's what we know:](https://twitter.com/umichvoter/status/1847792649782075793)* Detroit has returned 55,000 absentee ballots so far out of 107,000 requested.* Today was the first day of early in-person voting in Detroit, and about 1,900 people voted.* Detroit will have 15 more days of early in-person voting.* You can still request an absentee ballot in Michigan until November 1st.* In 2022, 46% of Detroit votes were early, and 54% were on Election Day.Now let's start making assumptions to see how we're doing:* Assumption #1: We end up with 107,000 absentee votes, total.  I'm assuming that over 90% of requested ballots will be returned, and we'll get a few more requests by November 1st to make up the gap.* Assumption #2: We'll get 1,900 in-person early votes a day for every day of early voting.* Assumption #3: 54% of Detroit voters will vote on Election Day again.This would add up to:107,000 absentee votes + 30,400 in-person early votes = 137,400 early votes in total.If that's 46% of the total, we'd end up with a final number of **298,696 votes** out of Detroit.**Is that good?**  Well, check the Twitter thread.  Detroit had 248k votes in 2016, and 257k votes in 2020.  Given that Detroit regularly gives Dems well over 90% of the vote, and Republicans struggle to stay ahead of the Greens there, just under 300k votes be extremely good news.  Even a little slippage gets us to 2020 numbers, which as you'll recall would be enough to win the state, all else equal.So no dooming about Detroit's early vote numbers.  They're actually in line with a pretty solid performance, and they're probably mostly people who voted by mail last time and decided it'd be easier to just go to the polls.  The best thing we can do is hop on a phonebank or textbank and contact some Detroit voters to bump those numbers even higher.(And yes, as payment for posting unscientific hot takes I will be textbanking again tomorrow).","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 19, 2024 - 17 days until election day!"},{"text":"Of course Putin's puppet is not well.....his cult does not care.","title":"Does Trump have dementia?"},{"text":"Nobody runs in donald's family.

In other words, Trumps repeated stumbles this week are going to be a very serious problem for him in the home stretch of the campaign, and the campaign has been smart to lean in hard on what weve all seen with our own eyes. -It seems like Trumps health is becoming an increasingly key issue in the waning days/weeks of this campaign and I encourage everyone to keep this point in mind when trying to sway potential undecided voters you encounter Since late August more than 70 right-aligned polls have been dropped into the polling averages. The two states that have been worked the hardest are North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In October of the 27 Presidential polls released in Pennsylvania, 16 are from right-aligned pollsters, a majority. Since August 31st of the 41 Presidential polls released in North Carolina, 21, a majority have home come from right aligned pollsters - This is exactly what Ive been saying for several weeks now at least. The right wing effort to spam the averages and move them right is much more aggressive and includes many more pollsters than 2022 or 2020. They also started the effort much earlier this year than in years past. Keep this in mind when looking at averages/ forecasts Speaking of the red wave pollsters, Heres the ones to ignore when looking at averages/forecasts: American Greatness, American Pulse Research and Polling, Daily Mail, co/efficent, Cygnal, Echelon, Emerson, Fabrizio, Fox News, Hunt Research, Insider Advantage, J.L. Partners, McLaughlin, Mitchell Communications, Napolitan Institute, Noble Predictive, On Message, Orbital Digital, Public Opinion Strategies, Quantus, Rasmussen, Redfield &amp; Wilton, Remington, RMG, SoCal Data, The Telegraph, TIPP, Trafalgar, Victory Insights, University of Austin, and The Wall Street Journal.while the red wave campaign has largely focused on state polls, this week it started focusing on the national polling averages. TIPP launched a daily poll tracker which will be able to be used to push down the averages every day. Yesterday 4 right-aligned national polls dropped, and the 538 national poll average went from 2.6 Harris to 2.1 in 48 hours. This movement then tipped the 538 forecast to Trump, and if they keep working it all averages and forecasts will very soon show Trump winning the election and the national narrative will change. - this right wing effort is now starting to spam the national averages instead of just the state averages, even more reason to be cautious when looking at averages and forecasts as I said above**they would only be doing all this if they thought they were losing. You only cheat when you are losing.** - this is probably the most important point here. You dont do all this fuckery and manipulation of reality and the averages if you werent losing, keep the gas on the pedal friends and we can have the election we want to have 17 days from now.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 19, 2024 - 17 days until election day!"},{"text":"We are fighting not to live in a fascist dictatorship with a guy at the helm who seems to think Arnold Palmer's pen(s size is an important issue to Americans.

Puberty blockers are temporary and give that time all these close-minded people obsessed with the genitals of children are demanding so that they can be sure before making any irriversibe decisions.But, when it comes to gender affirming surgeries, most of the people getting it are CIS people... it's used to correct things like gynecomastia.Anyway, my point is that the people who oppose most of the stuff surrounding trans individuals also tend to be the people who are entirely uneducated about trans issues and trans people as a whole.

It is just someone wanting to live authentically as who they are. If my 90-year-old ultra christian aunt can state that she's so proud of our family for being who they are, when she spent most of her life being conditioned to be against anything like that, and if she can even be so understanding and supportive as to remember not to deadname these family members and to call out others if they're not being respectful.. SURELY reasonable people can take the time to learn about these issues instead of just believe blatant falsehoods that are shared all over social media. Yes, reasonable people should find these attacks off-putting, but it seems as though a lot of reasonable people still aren't taking the time to properly educate themselves.","title":"Tim Walz defiantly defends trans people from Republicans demonizing attacks"},{"text":"Simson and SchusterIn his seminal work The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, Samuel Huntington argued provocatively and presciently that with the end of the cold war, civilizations were replacing ideologies as the new fault lines in international politics.Now in his controversial new work, Who Are We?, Huntington focuses on an identity crisis closer to home as he examines the impact other civilizations and their values are having on our own country.America was founded by British settlers who brought with them a distinct culture, says Huntington, including the English language, Protestant values, individualism, religious commitment, and respect for law. The waves of immigrants that later came to the United States gradually accepted these values and assimilated into America's Anglo-Protestant culture. More recently, however, our national identity has been eroded by the problems of assimilating massive numbers of primarily Hispanic immigrants and challenged by issues such as bilingualism, multiculturalism, the devaluation of citizenship, and the denationalization of American elites.September 11 brought a revival of American patriotism and a renewal of American identity, but already there are signs that this revival is fading. Huntington argues the need for us to reassert the core values that make us Americans. Timely and thought-provoking, Who Are We? is an important book that is certain to shape our national conversation about who we are.","title":"Kamala Harris continues to underperform in critical states"},{"text":"Truly disheartening that its even close.

Its goose-bump prophetic in its prediction that around this time we would be entering a period of creedal passion  Huntingtons term for the moralizing distrust of organized power that grips America every 60 years or so. In such periods, the driving narrative is that America has lost its way and we need to return to our constitutional roots.The core of Huntingtons argument is that we are a nation founded on ideals. The problem is that these are ideals can never be fully realized. This creates some obvious tensions.As Huntington explains: In terms of American beliefs, government is supposed to be egalitarian, participatory, open, noncoercive, and responsive to the demands of individuals and groups. Yet no government can be all these things and still remain a government...WikipediaWho Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity (2004) is a treatise by political scientist and historian Samuel P. Huntington (1927C2008).The book attempts to understand the nature of American identity and the challenges it will face in the future...Huntington argues that it is during the 1960s that American identity begins to erode. This was the result of several factors:1 The beginning of economic globalization and the rise of global subnational identities2 The easing of the Cold War and its end in 1989 reduced the importance of national identity3 Attempts by candidates for political offices to win over groups of voters4 The desire of subnational group leaders to enhance the status of their respective groups and their personal status within them5 The interpretation of Congressional acts that led to their execution in expedient ways, but not necessarily in the ways the framers intended6 The passing on of feelings of sympathy and guilt for past actions as encouraged by academic elites and intellectuals7 The changes in views of race and ethnicity as promoted by civil rights and immigration laws...Renewing American identityAfter laying out the concerns for the weakening and subsequent dissolution of America, which could plausibly occur due to cultural bifurcation and/or a government formed of denationalized elites that increasingly ignore the will of the public, Huntington attempts to formulate a solution to these problems.He argues that adherence to the American Creed is by itself not enough to sustain an American identity. An example of a state that attempted to use ideology alone was the Soviet Union, which attempted to impose communism on different cultures and nationalities, and eventually collapsed.A similar fate could lie in store for the United States unless Americans \\"participate in American life, learn America's language \\\\[English\\\\], history, and customs, absorb America's Anglo-Protestant culture, and identify primarily with America rather than with their country of birth\\".In particular, Huntington suggests that Americans turn to Protestantism, and recognize that what distinguishes America from other countries is that it is an extremely religious Western country, founded on the principles of the Enlightenment and Protestant Reformation.","title":"Kamala Harris continues to underperform in critical states"},{"text":"Shes the most unifying human in politics right now and of the last 10 years","title":"Commentary: What more does Kamala Harris have to do to win?"},{"text":"Honestly, working in government if people just tried and lasted 30% more than they did it would result in the people getting 90% of what they want...

Do you know why? ( this is despite me not actively teaching them anything )Because my entire days schedule is tied to the Dharma practice.I do puja in the morning where I take Precepts and Refuge and read the Suttas. I never invited my daughters to join me until they self invited and joined me.I do meditation in the evenings for half an hour.

When was the campaign the most energizing? Right after Tim came on board. He had a unique way of blowing off criticisms of progressive policies, kinda like call it socialism or whatever you want, I just care that hungry kids are getting fed. That and the Dems using language like weird, it felt like they were finding their footing. It was the first time in recent politics where the Dems started to *appear* to actually backup their words, in the face of republican criticism, and actually have some good messaging. Usually they crumble and eventually settle with some center right ideology (like Obamacare/Romneycare, or fighting for Merrick Garland like hes some left wing hero). Im so sick of watching the Dems help themselves get dunked on, it was refreshing to see them making grounds. I dont even want to get into the Gaza issue beyond the fact that you dont lose any dem voters by coming strongly out in favor of a cease fire, and saying youll withhold money. They dropped the ball on galvanizing the growing left wing of the party (many of whom would bring a lot of energy to the campaign), in favor of touting Cheneys around. These were the people they called the most dangerous enemies like 15-20 years ago. It means NOTHING to anyone except liberals who are already on board, and are foolish enough to think that will turn some conservatives.

Boom, civil unrest, then, blaming the electors and trying to get new electors in place before ratification of the results, which will cause more legal battles, eventually causing the results of the election to come into question, leading to the house voting for the president, and if that fails, it will be passed to the Supreme Court who will more than likely vote in favor of the conservative candidate who put them there in the first place.

I remember a few days after, I swear to god, there was an article trying to make it a BLM thing.... maybe Im remembering wrong. How was that possibly a BLM kind of incident though? This was the same year as the stop asian hate incident, so its not like that culture had died out then. That was the last time I remember there being a big of headlines about police brutality was that Memphis incident, but its not like im a mainstream media expert constantly consuming media.Im all about racial equality and against hate crimes and police brutality, but I honestly think they are duping people with the BLM movement. Its hard to measure how much race is a factor in some of these killings. People point out that black people are 13% of the population but half the murders every year are from black people, that might have some effect on them dying 5 times more often to the police then white people. I thinks a complicated issue and people get so riled up its unfortunate.I think they are pandering to people, liberal politicians have found outa way to convince everyone they care about black people and conservatives dont. Who knows? Its just hard to measure racism when youre not in people's heads. Unless the cops say they shot the person cause they are black, or we find out some other way they are racist, were just jumping to conclusions.In Critical race theory they tell people to look at anecdotes and emphasize the importance of storytelling in understanding institutionalized racism. Then the media doesnt report on horrible instances of police brutality happening to white people (and it does). Anecdotes in and of themselves are arguably a bad way to study a phenomenon and get an accurate understanding of whats going on. I've had people on reddit tell me the American South is very racist. And there are small towns that are super racist, but people from the South will sometimes tell you there is more racism they experience in other parts of the country. And theres way more non-racist shit that happens everyday in the South. You can look at lynchings and overgeneralize. Theres a danger in using anecdotes solely to understand whats going on. God knows how big of an issue it really is (the role race plays in these instances of police brutality). Im not saying its a false narrative, but the role racism plays in these issues is not an easy thing to measure.Its horrible what happens to a lot of these people, but im not convinced the BLM movement is a legit as I was 5 or more years ago.So I dont know what happened on a larger scale, but thats personally why im not as big of a supporter as I used to be.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"You seem to have an obsession with dicks.

Further encroachments will inevitably occur; the government has never been capable of letting power sit idle and has never voluntarily given it up.Further, the government is usually the worst possible judge of what is helpful or harmful, and should absolutely not be trusted to make distinctions there.

I  am so much happier now that it is Kamala running Instead of Biden. The GOP has, at best, gone completely fucking insane. I like Pete Buttigiegs policies the most of any politician in the last 5 years. To stop my self centered rambling and answer the damn question 1. We need term limits in all branches of the government and here is what I am going to do help enact that2. Corporate lobbying needs to be stopped; elected officials and federally appointed judges must not be allowed to to own stock/Investments in private entities to ensure their actions are serving the American people and not their own self interests.3. A top priority in the first 100 days is to pass legislation to stop gun violence in schools. Here are some of the components to enable that.\\nA) A license will now be required to own a firearm, it must be re-certified every 4 years.\\nB)To obtain this license Citizens must pass a full background check, pass a mental health screening, and attend a firearms safety course\\nC) Citizens must prove they have a safe locked area with controlled access as well as trigger locks for all firearms.\\nD) If a weapon you own is used in a crime then you are held responsible for those actions, with the exception of reported stolen firearms. Stolen firearms must be reported immediately and will be thoroughly investigated to determine if owner negligence was a key factor.\\nE) A new Agency will be created with the sole focus of protecting our children in schools.5. There will be no Income limit to prevent individuals from choosing to use the ACA. No American should worry about complete economic ruin due to an injury or illness, if private sector insurance wants to capitalize on injuries and illnesses of American citizens we have no choice but to do this for the welfare of America.6. If a government shutdown or a budget over 5% of the annual revenue is passed any sitting member of the legislative or executive branch are no longer eligible for re-election ever.Edit- would also love to massive investments into NASA and the department of education. Edit 2- how do we pay for this? Cut out all the fucking tax loop holes and lower the defense budget by 25%. The amount of sheer waste in the military is mind blowing and revolting.

He doesn't believe there is not a \\"deal\\" that he can't make. It hurts his huge ego too damn much to think he can't cut a deal that others thought was impossible. This is part of why he's not a warmonger. He wants to prove to the world that his brand of \\"deal making\\" is better than anyone else can achieve. But the Military Indusrial Complex hates him. Because Trump doesn't believe in \\"Forever Wars\\" For all his faults, and there are many to be sure, Trump at least is not someone who wants to send in young American servicemen to go and die so some corporate cronies of Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney can make more billions selling the government a bunch of missiles and bombs, paid with our tax dollars. So, yes, it's pretty obvious the current \\"establishment\\", most of it, want Trump gone by any means necessary. The FBI was weaponized. The DOJ. The mainstream media and most of the major social media companies. Big Tech. Most of the public education system. FISA warrants were abused. The legal system, with lawfare from Tish James, Alvin Bragga and others are being abused. Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, testified under oath that Russiagate was a political smear operation that was funded and approved of by Hillary Clinton. Right after Bernie Sanders had the 2016 nomination stolen from him with Clinton coordinating with DNC HQ. Not long after, the replacement head of the DNC, Donna Brazile, came out in public and admitted that Clinton turned her campaign and the DNC into one of the largest money laundering operations in American history. Career criminals are being no bailed out. Illegal immigrants are allowed to invade this country by a count of 15-20 million. So yes, Trump, for all his failures, is a threat to the establishment. They've practically chased him and demonized him non stop since 2015.

Your comments about Gen z being more religious are also directly disproven [BY YOUR OWN SOURCE](https://www.prri.org/spotlight/prri-generation-z-fact-sheet/?amp=1)Gen Z includes more religiously unaffiliated Americans and fewer white Christians than older generations, with the exception of millennials.Around one-third of Gen Zers (34%) and millennials (35%) identify as religiously unaffiliated, compared with 25% of Gen Xers, 19% of baby boomers, and 15% of the Silent Generation.\\nLess than half of Gen Zers, millennials, and Gen Xers identify as white Christians (27%, 31%, and 41%, respectively), compared with a majority of baby boomers (54%) and the Silent Generation (61%).Gen Zers (20%) are almost 20 percentage points less likely than members of the Silent Generation (38%) to attend religious services at least once a week.Around one in ten Gen Zers (11%) say they attend religious services once a week. Gen Zers (38%) and millennials (41%) are both more likely than older generations to say they never attend religious services.Fewer than half of Gen Zers and millennials say that religion is important in their life, compared with the majority of Gen Xers (55%) and baby boomers (62%) and two-thirds of the Silent Generation (67%).The majority of Gen Zers say religion is either not at all important (32%) or not as important as other things (20%). Fewer than two in ten Gen Zers (17%) say that religion is the most important thing in their life.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"I think there is a big difference between teaching a kid dont run onto the road and if you commit a sin you will go to hell.

Now you can present that number in percentages if you like and it might not amount to a large number, but 6 million people is a fucking lot and it is absolutely a high enough number for it to be taken into consideration when deciding things like at what age should they be baptized.Fine, valid. But atleast in US annually, 3.67 million kids live beyond an age of 15 and 20,000 die3)The third point is that you're coming at all of this from an extremely secularist perspective and are making distinctions between the real world and the things we can't see, extremist views, etc. The problem here is that you fail to step into the shoes of a religious person and realize that all of these things have the same value to them. To them, telling their children they shouldn't run in front of a car because they might die and telling them they shouldn't sin because they might burn in hell holds the same weight. Both statements are true to them and very important. There is no distinction to be had here. So again, you asking them to not teach children these things, is the equivalent of asking them to not tell their children to be careful around cars. You can say it's different all you want, but the person you're talking to isn't you, it's not your children, it's not your worldview. You're essentially asking them to act against the best interests of the child.I know, my family was very religious and I somewhat disliked being forced to participate in the practices and it was not really an option for me to refuse so it is my personal view that they should not have done that. Now I am an atheist but still like there were times when I wondered if I should consider running away or if there is anything else which I could do but it wasn't that bad in comparison to the situations of some other kids so I just stayed till I was 18 and then left. I am still in good terms with them it is just I would prefer not to talk to them about anything religion related. I think there is a big difference between teaching a kid dont run onto the road and if you commit a sin you will go to hell. Like there is an objective reality.

I do not subscribe to any sort of horeshoe theory because it flattens something that is pretty 3 dimensional. The people who are just doing it to stick it to Biden are really going to fall into one of a few camps: Politically ignorant to the extreme, Trolling/Propaganda, or Accelerationist.Of those, only the latter is a real political ideology. But while they are leftist in the same sense that early Marxist-Lenninists were leftist, their ideology tends to be more on the side of violent revolution. They think that the only way to create a utopia is for things to get so bad that the public has zero choice but to have a revolution. This is also pretty dumb, as it has been VERY bad for humans at multiple occasions in history, and yet we still have states, inequity, and private ownership of the means. But the more I talk to or listen to them, they tend to just be people against the current status quo, and want to have a new one with them on top. This is essentially the same sort of thinking that lead to the Marxist-Lenninist failures. It just puts violent people in charge.Anyway, so most of their social presciptions are leftist, but their governing theory is authoritarian and lacks empathy. The reason I am saying that they should not be characterized as \\"super duper left\\" is that in the false-binary we use of left v. right, it makes them appear to be *farther* down the leftist spectrum than groups like communists, anarchists, and other forms of libertarian leftism. You just can't really put them on the same scale, and the important bit in this case is not that they are for some measure of leftist principles, but that they advocate getting a lot of people killed so they can have power.\\nAs in they kept the aesthetic and the revolution, but threw out every other aspect of what we would consider leftism in a modern sense, e.g. radical democracy, flattened heirarchy, freedom of choice, collective ownership of the means of production, and the removal of *private* (not personal) property. They tend to think that State Capitalism is the same thing as communism, which is fair given that a lot of early Marxists did, but not founded as it turns out that it does not work.","title":"Democrats Are Enthusiastic About Harrisbut Dont Tell the Media"},{"text":"UAW workers do so do Toyota workers and the Kelly/Manpower temps at Nissan and Honda.

Now you can present that number in percentages if you like and it might not amount to a large number, but 6 million people is a fucking lot and it is absolutely a high enough number for it to be taken into consideration when deciding things like at what age should they be baptized.2)Children not being allowed in churches and infant baptisms being illegal is the one practical solution you've proposed, so I won't argue much against that. Though I would say that the opposition from religious communities to this would be immense and this type of restriction would probably not pass.3)The third point is that you're coming at all of this from an extremely secularist perspective and are making distinctions between the real world and the things we can't see, extremist views, etc. The problem here is that you fail to step into the shoes of a religious person and realize that all of these things have the same value to them. To them, telling their children they shouldn't run in front of a car because they might die and telling them they shouldn't sin because they might burn in hell holds the same weight. Both statements are true to them and very important. There is no distinction to be had here. So again, you asking them to not teach children these things, is the equivalent of asking them to not tell their children to be careful around cars. You can say it's different all you want, but the person you're talking to isn't you, it's not your children, it's not your worldview.

I distinctly remember a lesson about Noahs Arc - at a time I was really into nature docs and so on - and I was like there are too many animals even if you just take two of each, this is fake. My family was more or less fine with this and respected my non-belief as long as I did all the family and cultural parts.Personally I dont like specific ideological indoctrination of kids, but I also dont think theres that much in current circumstances to do much about it for determined parents.On a second level i think atheists sometimes believe religion is alternative facts and while I decided the myths were a bit too much to swallow plenty of non-fundie religious people just take it as symbolic or poetic etc. So I am uncomfortable saying Jewish people or Catholics or Muslims should not have children participate since these are also cultural as much as a religion likely other religions too, just going for ones I know have more of a culture aspect compared to US evangelicals or whatever which is a lot more just politics and fundamentalism.I am a Marxist and a parent and thought about this for my part too. I am against expecting my child to adopt my specific ideology, but its also impossible not to influence them when they ask me what I think about something or history or society and politics. So my approach is that general values are sort of unavoidable and thats what I teach kids (ironically probably not that different than a lot of non-fundie Christians.) golden rule-treat people with respect by default unless given good reason not to, help others, dont dominate or marginalize people, help the littler kids at your school or pre-school. Dont be a bully and stand up for others when you are able Etc.At any rate some influence is unavoidable but specific  indoctrination imo is unethical and a fools errand as if I indoctrinated my kid with Marxism theyd be a teenage libertarian or if I indoctrinated them with a specific religious ideology they likewise reject it by teen years lol.","title":"CMV: Religious indoctrination should be postponed until children are 14-16"},{"text":"I personally dont feel the system is perfect.

Religious people often spend a significant amount of time in religious practice. I am a Christian, so that is my point of reference. I attend various church activities (services, classes, Bible studies), and spend a lot of time on service activities. If my children are under the age of 14, am I required to find child care for them during those activities? What am I allowed to tell them? Can they accompany me if I want them to, say, volunteer at a church soup kitchen or shelter? Or is that forcing them to participate in religious activities? And I consider acts of service to be part of my religion, what if you disagree? Is it my definition of my religion or yours that defines how I can spend time with my children?Can I pray in front of my children, or is that indoctrination?Also, how do you police how parents talk to their children? Children ask A LOT of questions, many of which have religious or philosophical answers (especially when it comes to morality). If you forbid parents from teaching \\"religion\\", you're going to make it very hard to answer their questions and guide their behavior.Of course, all of this means that if you have children and practice a religion, the government is governing almost every interaction you have with your child. This is simply unenforceable, and I think many nonreligious people would be deeply uncomfortable with this.Finally, why are you singling out religion? Parents \\"indoctrinate\\" their kids into their world view, even if they try not to. They are modeling their own world view every day. There are many philosophies and secular \\"religions\\" that could be just as deeply harmful to children. Your view is essentially anti- religion. I can't speak for other countries, but this would violate the free exercise clause of the US Constitution.

Turns out indoctrination of your children doesnt guarantee them as adult converts, not even as much as the fervent keep insisting it does. Thats literally why Christianity is in decline, and I mean HEAVY decline. Those who leave the faith behind almost always become nones and will raise their children in a secular manner.

They also attract people who don't really care about politics but hate Trump.When you purge voters, most of the ones wrongly purged tend to be new voters and those who haven't registered; meaning that purging hurts Democrats way more than Republicans.Also, purging voters isn't needed, it doesn't matter if your registered to vote, every vote is checked to confirm that the voter is a legal citizen and there's only one vote by every citizen. Purging voters does nothing to stop fraudulent voting, all it does is deny voter rights to certain people.Some Republican states have also set up a website where anyone can remove anyone's voter rights by just providing their name, address, and date of birth. The website was so badly done that it gave the public access to other people private info, meaning that anyone could just go on there and remove anyone they want without even knowing them.

The Constitution (or at the least the Amendments) is pretty clear that the state laws are subsidiary to the federal laws.  The only reason they got away with gutting the VRA was that it treated different states differently, as it had been focused on states with histories of voter suppression.Basically, the SCUTOS is focusing on minutia to try to dismantle the VRA.  The newer act would close a lot these lot of these loopholes.What I'm less clear on is whether they would pass something that would address gerrymandering.  While Gerrymandering broadly helps Republicans right now, the Blue states are finally getting in on it, but there are certain areas like Florida which has in the state Constitution required gerrymandering in order to give Black and minority voters representation (because of the distribution of minorities in Florida, they actually wouldn't get much representation at all if you used a grid system.Of course, the Florida SCOTUS was fine with letting Desantis change this from one region to two in the face of their constitution.  Anyway, eliminating Gerrymandering may be harder than you might first thing.Back to the national system, while I think a whole bunch of the post 2000 SCOTUS decisions have been on shaky ground, they are usually using loopholes or excuses for their decisions.  If something is clearly spelled out in a bill, and is addresses and constitutional loopholes, I don't think the current SCOTUS has the balls to try to push back on that.However, if the Democrats someone get all three chambers and pass a new VRA, and the SCOTUS tries to knock it down, it's going to get interesting.  They already seriously pushed themselves with the Trump Immunity Ruling (and I still think Biden should have used his newly granted immunities to arrest at least four of the Justices for undermining the rule of law), that was based on an . . . interesting interpretation of materials not included in the Constitution.To go fully against a unified Democratic Government that is already considering court packing . . . well, it would definitely be interesting.On the flip side, Biden didn't move as strongly as he could have against Texas for it's border shenanigans, but he was already into an election year, and I think that is why he tried to play nice and go through the courts.","title":"Democrats eye voting rights bill as first priority in House majority"},{"text":"California invaders.","title":"Hope Im not being delusional but why  do these libs genuinely think Texas can actually turn blue ?"},{"text":"Yup.

You say that some kids will choose the same religion as their parents and some will choose different ones based off their own values and beliefs, but you have just unintentionally asserted your own standard on everyone in asking for that in the same way that you critique religious people for doing.  If you are saying that they should find which religion best matches their beliefs and values, you are forcing your own view on the people that whatever a person feels individually is equally valid.  The obvious response from the religious person is, it does not make a difference what they personally feel is good or bad, that is the whole point of religious morality and ethics, that there is some standard higher than yourself that must be abides by, not your own values.  Third, I think it is simply not possible to omit religious ideas from children.

There is infant baptism but there are also people who get baptized later on in life like when they are 14-16 or some other time.Others have already pointed this out, but another reason for infant baptism is that no matter what happens, the child has received grace. There was always fear in religious communities that if a child were to die before being baptized, they might not receive salvation. That is why when a baby was in danger of early death, families were advised to get them baptized as soon as physically possible.For the rest of your text, I agree with some of it. My question is what exactly are you proposing? Legal restrictions on bringing children to religious institutions and performing religious ceremonies? Because that's the only practical solution to the issue you have raised.If not that, then you're basically asking parents to not teach children what they believe. Simple as that. And that is extremely impractical. If someone believes something so strongly that they become a member of that religion and participate in those ceremonies and rituals, there is absolutely no reason, from their perspective, to not make sure their child gets initiated into this process as soon as possible.","title":"CMV: Religious indoctrination should be postponed until children are 14-16"},{"text":"Both support genocide.","title":"Kamala Harris continues to underperform in critical states"},{"text":"Mate hes been shitting his pants since the apprentice?","title":"Obama: You would be worried if your grandpa was acting like Trump"},{"text":"I think culture and religion are more intertwined than you might believe.

Would you be in favor of forbidding the parents from explaining their own religious practices?At the end of the day, most religious people don't view their religion as being completely separable from their everyday life. They don't view things as \\"This is my religious life and this is EVERYTHING else.\\" That separation just doesn't exist.

People don't even respond to email anymore, let alone letters or door knocker polls.Back in the day, you could just call someone's home and that person would answer. During the time that neither caller ID or answering machines existed, people just answered the phone. You might even be able to go door to door and people would answer the door and be happy to respond to a poll.Now, it's mostly elderly and retired people who bother to respond to polls. Or very, very politically involved people. Most polls are weighted to acknowledge that fact, but the exact weight to give the poll is guesswork.However, it's in the media's best interest to announce polls that create the most excitement and suspense for their audiences. So when you factor in that need for engagement, the polls become even less meaningful.I'm just telling you what I've read  I'm no poll expert. I can imagine that some polls are taken on college campuses or at shopping malls to try to get a better cross section of people. I know some polls measure things like whether or not the person is a registered voter, what their registration is, what their level of enthusiasm is for their candidate, how likely they think they are to vote in this election, etc. So some polls may be far more accurate than others. But it seems like every poll size I've seen is around 1,000 people. That doesn't seem large enough to indicate much. (I could be wrong about poll sizes, though.)Last, there's the factor that some people lie in polls. Like there's a huge faction of people who don't want other voters to be lulled into not voting because they think their candidate will win anyway. So they answer the poll as though they were voting the opposite way in order to skew the numbers. There's also an unknown number of women who won't disclose whom they're really voting for because they're in an abusive relationship. If they're polled in front of their abuser, their answer won't be the truth.I think I've read that more accurate indicators are fundraising, especially from small donors (which indicates a lot of people support a candidate rather than one billionaire with one vote), new registrations (which indicate a voter who is more likely to vote in the current election), and turnout size (like the amazing numbers of voters who have already voted in some of the swing states.)I don't think yard signs are considered an accurate predictor, because if you live in a place where most people are against your candidate you might not want to advertise your support. Conversely, if you live where everyone agrees with you, you might not think it's worthwhile to put up a yard sign.Idk if rally sizes are an indicator. Normally I would guess that they are, but in this climate they can also just indicate a dedicated cult following who is still in the minority. There are lots of voters who wouldn't bother going to a rally.Of course, all this is skewed by the electoral college and gerrymandering. I, personally, am cautiously optimistic that Harris will win and the US will escape being turned into a fascist dictatorship.","title":"Trumps Closing Pitch to Voters: I Will Let You Die If You Dont Bow to My Demands"},{"text":"Typically I agree, but this field of Republicans is something Ill *never* get behind.","title":"Society if Democrats won every election!"},{"text":"Probably cause the issue is that the thread is propagating a this is the Dems trying to get a steal. look, in a conspiracy sub where it shouldnt be right nor left leaning.I have my biases, but theyre not for here, some people take their republican biases and use conspiracy to talk about their parties like it isnt the same shit being shoveled.","title":"Looks like the steal is already in place for Michigan.

You can argue that in theory they shouldnt be taught their parents religion(s), but what are you going to do? Take away the kids and put them in the overloaded foster care system? Arrest the parents and Sunday school teachers?Plus, even if you do want to take away the kids and arrest the parents, how will you practically do that? Heres an example (using Christianity because thats what Im most familiar with).Its declared illegal to bring your kids to church, so you (and a lot of other parents from the church) hire a shared babysitter, a young adult also from the church. Shes just going to teach the kids Sunday school from a different building. If a kid tells that to their school teacher is it going to be a manhunt to go after the babysitter?Or maybe most churches are going underground. Youve already banned religious schooling (I assume) so a large number of these kids are now being homeschooled are you going to go after homeschooling laws next? Are you going to begin banning all gatherings on Sunday mornings (which will just move underground church to another day), or start sending in police to investigate any large gatherings to ensure its turkey just a book club or birthday party and not a secret church?Are you going to start arresting parents because the child claimed they read the Bible before bed or said a prayer at a meal? What if the kid just is modelling what the parent does independently, does the parent need to start hiding these things from their child? If a child sees their parent fasting, or wearing a head covering, or praying, are the parents not allowed to explain their reasoning as to why?I could see how your view could somewhat work for larger things, such as banning infant baptism/child communion (although theyd likely just be done in secret anyways) or not allowing young children to wear a head covering (of any religion) or participate in fasts, but even then that would be hard to enforce. If a Muslim child sees all the adults in their family practicing Ramadan, even if the parents did send a lunch to school (so they dont get reported to CPS) what if the child just decides to fast on their own?

Under Jim Crow, Blacks could be legally prevented from voting, from marrying who they wanted, from working at a company, from doing business with a company, or from living in certain places. Additionally, while it wasn't legal, lynching - extrajudicial murder - was effectively legal. Additionally, the ideas of racism became unpopular - to the point where \\"racist\\" is considered an insult by most people in the US today.\\"Failure\\" has to be measured not against absolute success - an outright end to all racism - and instead against relative success - a massive decline in institutional racism, especially in the legal system; and an end to the tolerance of overt racism as well as a sharp decline in the tolerance of covert racism.I'm not going to argue things are good now - but they're better today than any time before 1980....There's a saying, often misattributed to Gandhi (it actually goes back before Gandhi to an American Union worker in the 1910s labor movement) that saysAnd, my friends, in this story you have a history of this entire movement. First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.I really think there needs to be a couple more steps to that - but don't know how to match the poetry of it. Tracking multiple movements (including the American Labor Movement, which started in the 1870s, but didn't succeed until the 1910s; the Antislavery movement which has definite members before the American Revolution but doesn't succeed until 1865; and even the American AND Indian independence movements); there is a definite period of the movement not being paid attention to; then being ridiculed; then initial attacks - often legal; then a period of quiet where the movement either fails or reorganized in the face of the initial attacks; then a second set of attacks - often violent; followed by either some level of success or the complete destruction of the movement.It appears to me that BLM is currently in that \\"reorganizing\\" period. The initial attacks came in the form of infiltration, attacking the public image of and the internal structure and trust within the organization.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"Okay well then gay pride parades etc should be banned too until they are older.

The U.S. has a separation of church and state and while religious cultural factors influence policies and lawmakers, we should do our best to keep that separation. Where I would disagree with you is with academic institutions teaching religious classes and parents being forced to abide by rules regarding teaching their children religion. I dont trust colleges to teach things correctly and I believe most universities priority is to make money by checking of boxes on students education; not making sure they really understand a topic and can think critically about it (Im a current student; and have been to multiple universities). So I dont believe schools/universities should handle educating young people on religion. This is something a person can do on their own as I did. Parents also shouldnt be forced to shield their children from their religious practices unless there is some form of abuse involved. Teaching your children what one wants them to be taught is a freedom that we have and inviting more regulations into ones home is not a wise choice IMO.

Reagan had a ton of scandals. Clintons popularity increased after his impeachment. Its not really that interestingthese people are partisans. And partisan Democrats exist too. Biden wouldve gotten at least 45% of the vote no matter how the campaign went, and it wouldnt have just been anti-Trump votes. A large chunk of the Democratic base are also partisans who approve of Biden. But the media acts as if Republican partisanship is special and different but Democratic partisanship is just an anti-Trump reaction to Republicans. It how they create this environment that positions Democrats as responsible for everything that happens in politics. Republicans are just being Republicans. Cant change them.

When capitalism approaches a breaking point, left-wing populism tends to catch on (Occupy Wall Street, the enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders, BLM, etc) and fascism rears its ugly head as a last-ditch effort to force society back in line, usually by getting rid of all the socialists and other undesirable groups that are scapegoated as the cause of societal decline. The continued popularity of Trump, despite *everything* thats happened so far, is the result of decades of neoliberal policies whose consequences are now coming home to roost, such as:* The decent jobs have largely been outsourced and all thats left for most people are thankless, humiliating, menial service jobs that dont even pay a living wage* Most people currently alive will never retire, and will only be able to stop working when theyre so close to death they physically cant do it anymore?* Small rural communities have been slowly dying since the industries they relied on (farming, mining, logging, etc) were outsourced and/or automated, and many of the people in these communities lack the ability to simply move somewhere else* Reports on the health of the economy are almost completely divorced from the day-to-day life of the working class, instead focusing on the corporations and billionaires who *are* doing great because theyve captured most of the wealth and power in western society* Society has become atomized, community bonds are devalued, people feel isolated and abandoned and directionless because nearly every aspect of life has been turned into another monetization scheme?* Younger generations are stuck in what feels like a state of perpetual adolescence because the traditional signifiers of adulthood (moving out, owning a home, having a stable career, starting a family) are now too expensive to be pursued as viable life choices?* Basic necessities like healthcare, housing and even food are increasingly harder to comfortably afford for many people* Basically all forms of public infrastructure have been neglected for decades, resulting in crumbling roads, collapsing bridges, unclean water, dilapidated buildings, and an overall sense of inefficiency and decay?* Progressive social movements make groups that have historically been dominant (i.e. straight, cis white men) feel threatened, which wouldnt necessarily be an insurmountable problem if not for the fact that, with everything else being so shitty, privilege derived from skin color or gender is often feels like the *only scrap of power these people have left*, causing them to retreat into reactionary mindsets?Neoliberalism is no longer working, and this current wave of fascism (or fascist-*adjacent* sentiment, if you prefer) is capitalisms attempt to shock the system back into a comfortable status quo where the workers are compliant and the rich are allowed to do whatever they want without scrutiny. Beating Trump will fix *nothing*, because the root cause that made Trump such a force to be reckoned with will still be there, festering away.?If the Democrats win and try to simply go back to normal, this same crisis is going to happen all over again in 4-8 years, but with even more pent-up resentment and anger behind it.?Major, systemic change that *tangibly and materially* improves the lives of ordinary people is the only thing that can potentially bring long-term peace and stability.

I understand people's frustrations, but if Dems want to win elections, they should effectively spread their message to as many people and demographics as possible and appeal to these groups of people. And numerically, white males are a large part of the voter base. So, it matters. As others have said, the Dem policies do benefit young men. I'd say the key here would be to better counter-act a lot of the Trump/conservative rhetoric. Counter-act the fear mongering that brown illegal immigrants are going to take their job, eat up their tax money, and ruin their communities (this is the picture that is being painted). Counter-act the fear mongering that transgender people will receive disproportional treatment and attention, that their children (or in a lot of cases, their hypothetical children lol) will be pushed towards some kind of gender reassignment. Counter the growing sentiment that white males are becoming disenfranchised or somehow vilified.I know many of you do not feel these things or perceive them in any way, but these are fears being regularly fed to a LARGE voter base. The right is speaking directly to young (mainly white) males and spreading vitriol. The right is specifically trying to sway this (again, large) voter base through fear and it's working. Counter and assuage these fears. Tim Walz did an awesome job saying (paraphrasing) there are enough rights to go around for everybody; someone else getting their rights doesn't take away from yours. Emphasize that. Everyone gets the same rights with no detriment to those that are already enjoying those rights.How do we, as a society, fix the growing disparity between women and men furthering their education? I believe it's possible to correct this and the gender wage gap simultaneously.

You don't even have to look outside the United States to find examples of parties that are entitled to put candidates on general election ballots without counting primary votes AT ALL. The presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party is chosen every four years by whichever party activists are able to travel to their national convention; in states where Libertarian Party presidential candidates appear on primary ballots, the vote is completely non-binding on the convention. *Where are all the rank-and-file Greens who voted for Jill Stein to be their presidential nominee in the last four elections?*","title":"The Collapse of Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Sorry healthier kids is less money to be paid to healthcare, next it is proven well fed children learn better leading to a more educated population which I feel some dont want either.","title":"Opinion | Harris should take Walzs liberal school lunch program national"},{"text":"The hi","title":"Trumps Closing Pitch to Voters: I Will Let You Die If You Dont Bow to My Demands"},{"text":"No idea","title":"WOTBers: Remember that video of Kamala Harris from a couple of weeks ago?"},{"text":"The more I see her, the more I can't stand? her.?

He has to play a different game and may even have different personal views (remember- Obama not even 20 years ago would not speak in favor of even gay marriage).

He celebrated it even as his broader student loan plans remain halted by courts following legal challenges by Republican-led states.For too long, the government failed to live up to its commitments, Biden said in a statement. We vowed to fix that, and because of actions from our administration, now over 1 million public service workers have gotten the relief they are entitled to under the law.In total, the administration says it has now canceled $175 billion for about 5 million borrowers using several existing programs. Public Service Loan Forgiveness accounts for the largest share of that relief, while others have had their loans canceled through income-driven payment plans and through a 1994 rule offering relief to students who were cheated by their schools.The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was created in 2007, promising college graduates that the remainder of their federal student loans would be zeroed out after 10 years working in government or nonprofit jobs. But starting in 2017, the vast majority of applicants were rejected because of complicated and little-known eligibility rules.","title":"Biden administration has canceled student loans for more than 1 million in public service jobs"},{"text":"I say \\"dubious at best\\" because of *all the things* he could be convicted over it's a fucking defamation case that no one on either side fucking cares about.

Mostly, I think that this can be tied to the fact that our country was designed hundreds of years ago by people that couldn't possibly imagine, let alone account for what society would look like today. This is a fairly new thing to have happened. If you take any point in human history, and then compare that time to 300 years prior, its going have some measure of variation but, for the most part, society will still look very similar to the 300 years proper, or at least recognizable. When that fact holds true, it can make it a bit easier to design a system that should be able, with some ammendments, cope with the demands of a time 300 years in the future.Because of the industrial revolution, modern science and the scientific method, amongst other important factors, the founders certainly tried, but had no way to know that our contemporary time was wholly unimaginable for them, completely unrecognizable. Humanity has never seen such huge steps forward in such a short time period, relatively speaking.As a consequence, the design or our country is outdated and inadequate to cope with how alien our society is. Our system was designed to function within an environment that resembled the in which it was crested. Look at the many ways Trump was able to subvert, manipulate, weaponize and break the system for his own ends. He was able to do this despite being a massive idiot, with low cunning, that had no understanding of how DC politics operated as he first stepped into the white house.Imagine what the next far right populist might get away with, especially it they are highly intelligent, as charismatic as trump is off putting, handsome, a good orator that has the strong and singular goal of breaking the system and finding a way to take authoritarian control.We often, justifiably, look back at the 45th POTUS as being a nightmare of 4 hellish years. In truth, we lucked out that Trump is so incompetent, is barely able to read, and whose goals amount to increasing his wealthy, how people perceive him and the accumulation of power for the purposes of keeping himself out of the reach of justice and maintain the grifting mentality, which is all he knows. We fucking lucked out.Yeah, i worry about the consequences of a trump second term. We will be coping with the effects of his first term for at least 35 years to come. With that said, I'm much more worried about the next guy to control the type of people within our society inclined to supporting truly horrific people and practices. There is so many more of them today because politicians have systematically destroyed education and corporations have been allowed to run rampant in the creation of information bubbles and echo chambers. That next guy, he could show up as soon as 2028 but I wouldn't be surprised if he showed up anytime in the next 20 years. After hundreds of years of the American system, not only becoming outdated, but having taking a pounding from within from endless manipulation and fuckery. All the ingredients are there.

First things first\\nThe article literally starts with: Gen Z adults (21%) are less likely than all generational groups except millennials (21%) to identify as Republican. Meanwhile, 36% of Gen Z adults identify as Democrats, and this rate is similar to other generations, with the exception of Gen Xers, who are less Democratic (31%).I went and read through the rest of this study, and for the entire thing it does nothing but state and restate constantly how Gen z adults AND teens are far more likely to be liberal. Im genuinely not certain how far you made it in to the study if your takeaway was they lean conservativeSecond things second: even the [source you cited agrees](https://www.prri.org/research/generation-zs-views-on-generational-change-and-the-challenges-and-opportunities-ahead-a-political-and-cultural-glimpse-into-americas-future/) - Gen z adults and teens are both more liberal that other generationsAnd lastly, other [research sources](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far/) agree: Gen z in its totality is [more liberal than previous generations.](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/) Even Gen z teen men, who are slightly more conservative that Gen z women, are still overwhelmingly more liberal and - as the source above states - their republican positions are far more moderate that the general Republican platform.  In fact, your claim that Gen z teen boys are more conservative than Gen z men is the opposite. There is an 6% gap between Gen z teens and a 9% gap between the adults. And for my folks who never got to take a research methods class - heres your reminder than in studies like these 6% points usually boils down to a handful of people. We arent surveying the entire country. In total, there were 3,139 men and 3,477 women in the entire study. Of those, 1520 were Gen Z. 756 of which were teens. 754 of which were adults. The study doesnt offer a breakdown of how many of those were men and women so its impossible to deduce exactly how many people a 6% difference encapsulates, but keep it in mind The original comment is a pretty textbook example of lying via data, or more accurately preying upon the assumption that people wont actually look at any of the data and will simply interpret the title to support their position. From you comments regarding DEI is see it worked.So no, Gen z does not mean conservative. Gen z men, who lean liberal, trend slightly further right than Gen z women. Still firmly in the liberal to moderate territory, and this position is supported by both the original article you posted and [another by the same organization](https://www.prri.org/spotlight/is-gen-z-switching-political-direction-not-so-fast/?amp=1)","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"So Trump is lying when he says the exact opposite?","title":"Trumps Closing Pitch to Voters: I Will Let You Die If You Dont Bow to My Demands"},{"text":"Michigan has the best voters registration system in the entire country.

I tutor high school students for free in one of the poorest cities - mostly black/Hispanic - in the United States, and I also teach at a University - so saying that, I'm deeply concerned with the quality of K-12 education for boys, support for boys looking at higher education, and the general messaging targeted at young men and their self-image as self-reported to me during tutoring sessions. I am aware that this is all anecdotal of course, but for the past seven years I've just heard over and over from young boys ranging from 7th grade to 12th grade that they're to stupid to go to college, to stupid for a career, useless, worthless, etc. When probed, most of this referenced things told to them by their teachers. Note, I tutored these students - they were NOT stupid. They were not worthless. Many of them showed an excellent grasp of core concepts. All of them should have been thinking about college or trades as careers they could do well in. They were not doing well in the school district and were not given support. And these were the students who had parents that gave a shit enough to reach out to me. What about the students whose parents don't care? At the University I teach at, the vast majority of my undergraduate students are women - easily 60% to 70%. Most of the men are upper income/wealthy. For a project last spring, I compared the scholarship and aid packages for women and men - and they were insanely different for my students. The men were almost all self paid or student loans no matter their families income bracket (note: the small number of poorer boy students were almost 100% student loans). The women, on the other hand, had very little in student loans and a lot of financial aid, much of it organized through the school or their high schools. I absolutely see this as a major over correction from the pre-1981 condition of women in higher education. While I celebrate the advances of these women, and have personally acted as a mentor and coach for many of them (helping them get into prestigious programs at Oxford, Harvard, Stanford, etc), and also hired many of them - I look at the disparate treatment and am concerned.So yeah, I have concerns. I'm still voting for Harris, and consider Trump to be a trashfire of a shit stain. However, anyone who is thinking this in the bag and the Democrats don't have to care for a large segment of the population are incredibly guilty of hubris - and frankly, the worst impulses of the GOP. I am also aware that self-reflection is not a strong suit for anyone, so I'm not expecting anything to change. So I'll keep tutoring these students and doing what I can to inspire them to believe in themselves. Be they black, Hispanic, or white. Math is one of the few hard skills that can be learned even if you don't have money. You don't need a lab, or expensive equipment, just paper, pencils, and a will to learn. If I can make them see that, and embrace it, I can give them the skills and belief in themselves that literally NO ONE ELSE will give them in our society.And yes, I would really like to know what Harris has to say on that. I'd like to start there. I have a few other complaints but that's the main one. I do really want to know too, because when I asked our local Democrat candidate for Rep what they could do to help inspire young men in the community to show them that there is more to this world than joining a gang, they told me to \\"tutor more kids\\". I can help a handful, the Federal government could help so many more.Edit: to the person who doesn't like my use of \\"to\\": I'm dyslexic, ADHD, and autistic. I was severely developmentally delayed and didn't start vocalizing until I was three years old, or speaking till I was older. I teach math, not English. Mostly stats, but the occasional intro class. Please feel free to mock and make fun of me all you wish. I'll always struggle with English and I've heard it all before. I struggle with there their they're too though my phone is better at catching that. Please feel free to throw some nastiness in on that if you like making fun of someone with a disability. You are not the first to try to undermine the contributions of a learning disabled person with something that didn't affect your ability to understand what was said. You also will not be the last.

The tradition of going to the polls is familiar. But this is no typical election.    \\nThe stakes of this years presidential contest are higher than at any time in our nations recent history.    \\nThey transcend what can happen in a four-year presidential term.\\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris is elected, we are persuaded she will pursue policies that support working families and small businesses, continue essential infrastructure investments, advance historic alliances abroad and respect the rule of law, including our system of checks and balances among branches of the federal government.     \\nIf Donald Trump regains the White House, he has made his intentions clear. Trumps increasingly vengeful, chaotic and self-centered views do not serve the national interest. A second Trump term would threaten cherished American ideals of fair play and the rule of law C qualities that have defined civic life in the United States for nearly 250 years.      \\nThe rule of law includes accepting the outcome of elections. Trump continues to lie about the 2020 vote that removed him from office; he wont say whether he will accept results next month.     \\nFor many reasons, this is not just another election. It is a referendum on whether Americans want, by electing Harris, a president to attend to their interests and needs, a president who will continue the core principles that have served America so well for the past 90 years.    \\nOr, in the case of Trump, whether they want a leader who demands blind loyalty in his pursuit of personal power, a president who will turn his back on the rule of law here at home and alienate our allies abroad.    \\nThat choice is frighteningly stark in 2024.    \\nThe people who know Donald Trump best call him unfit for office. The reasons should be familiar by now to every voter, regardless of party.    \\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence witnessed Trumps effort, after he lost his re-election bid in 2020, to subvert the Constitution as he encouraged a mobs attack on the U.S. Capitol in a bid to prevent the election of Joe Biden. And anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again, Pence has said.     \\nConsider just one day at the end of the first Trump term C Jan. 6, 2021. For a reminder, look up video footage on YouTube. The sitting president lit the fuse on a violent mob that attempted to prevent Congress from certifying Bidens victory. Members of Congress voted for the second time, in January 2021, to impeach Trump, in part for his actions that day.     \\nRather than be chastened, Trump refers to those who took part in the insurrection as warriors, hostages and patriots and has said he will pardon a large portion of them if returned to office.\\nAmerica deserves a president like Kamala Harris who will lead with restraint, discipline, principle, factual information, personal integrity and humility.      \\nTrump possesses none of these qualities. He is a convicted felon who faces sentencing soon after Nov. 5. His conduct in and out of office should utterly disqualify him in the minds of voters. And yet the contest is close, in part because some voters think Trump is kidding about his most outlandish claims.     \\nWe think it more likely his former associates are right about him. This candidates character references simply do not check out.     \\nOn the campaign trail, Trumps lies constitute an assault and battery on the body politic. His falsehoods are legion and are compounded in social media echo chambers, some of them controlled by his ally Elon Musk. He has called Harris a fascist, when in fact he is the candidate who favors authoritarians like Vladimir Putin and who has said he would be a dictator on Day 1.     \\nIn Trumpworld, up is down and down is up, making it harder than it should be for voters to make informed choices.\\nOn the stump, Trump is a harbinger of doom. He repeated this past week that if elected he plans to go after his political enemies. Forget the notion of the loyal opposition. In this candidates mind, his 2024 rival, and Democrats more broadly, are the enemy from within.      \\nAt a town hall event in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed his political opponents had weaponized our elections.  They are so bad and frankly, theyre evil. He has said he will use the offices of the federal government, including the Department of Justice, to harass and punish people who he views as adversaries. Thats become a long list. If you think that claim is just bravado, keep in mind that at least 10 times during his first term, Trump sought to make government agencies target people he saw as adversaries, including John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and James B. Comey.     \\nIn September, 111 Republican Party officials, including members of Congress and past cabinet secretaries, wrote an open letter urging people to elect Harris, terming Trump unfit to serve. Trump, their letter said, promoted daily chaos in government, praised our enemies and undermined our allies, politicized the military and disparaged our veterans, prioritized his personal interest above American interests, and betrayed our values, democracy, and this countrys founding documents.    \\nOther former Trump administration officials see him as unfit as well, including a chief of staff, national security advisers and secretaries of state, defense and education. At no point in our history have so many insiders broken ranks to denounce a former commander in chiefs fitness for the Oval Office.     \\nThe Trump they served proved bad enough. The evidence is clear that if this candidate wins a second term, America will see a different Trump, one validated by the election results and no longer constrained by a wish to remain electable C as well as one newly immune, thanks to a Supreme Court stocked with his appointees, from legal accountability for actions taken in office.     \\nIf he loses, Trump has said that civil unrest C read, a repeat of the Jan. 6 violence C is possible based on a belief by his supporters, orchestrated by the candidate himself, that the outcome was somehow unfair.      \\nA Trump loss will, for that reason, be difficult for the   country to digest. We fear for public safety, win or lose.     \\nWith the high court on his side, and the makeup of Congress in play, a Trump victory would open a dangerous and potentially violent chapter in the American story.","title":"America deserves a president like Kamala Harris (Editorial)"},{"text":" He is ducking debates and canceling interviews.

If you say anything about the rights of people outside of blacks in a BLM circle, whether they're asian, white, or other groups such as muslims effected by the muslim ban - you are often met with outrage.The problem is that even without the propoganda, BLM was used most often and most loudly by extremists with narrow world views. The solution is a new movement that doesn't dismiss the other issues that are happening in the world, and to come together with a real solution.Just an example I always believed in - bring awareness to police brutality without blaming other races, instead blaming police establishments, because that's where the blame is deserved. Push to disarm common police - a police officer that is monitoring traffic or serving a citation should not be armed. Instead, create another, higher division of police, held to a much higher standard, and have them be armed. They only should enter into situations armed when there is a known threat. Reform police training to not put the police offer's life first. You're serving your community in dangerous situations. Your life should not be the most important to you. Being a police officer should be something that people do when they wish to selflessly serve their community, not join a gang.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"My issue with this line of thinking is that if we are in for a landslide Harris victory, what's going on with the polls?","title":"Democrats Are Enthusiastic About Harrisbut Dont Tell the Media"},{"text":"I'm so sick of the nytimes treating Trump like just a normal candidate","title":"Where Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Stand on the Issues"},{"text":"Well said!","title":"Kamala Harris promises full marijuana legalization C is that a gamechanger?"},{"text":"Right behind your mom","title":"Where Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Stand on the Issues"},{"text":"Nah, make Arnie ambassador to Germany, just to watch the Germans seethe at his accent.","title":"Kamala Harris says she wants to have a Republican in her cabinet.

However in my view your post misses the key point that Cold War deterrence was not primarily based on conventional means, but rather mutually assured destruction via nuclear weapons. It was generally accepted that NATO would lose a conventional war in Europe vs the USSR, especially in the immediate post-WWII environment, so nuclear deterrence was crucial to the strategy of containment. So when viewed through this lens, the logic behind US strategy is a little clearer, because the Russian invasion of Ukraine is not the kind of conflict NATO prepared for throughout the Cold War, which was the thrust of your post. It is not likely today that Russia could overwhelm NATO in Europe with conventional weapons as the USSR could, and rather it is Russia which would likely be overwhelmed by NATOs conventional capabilities, thus making it more likely that Russia would rely on nuclear deterrence in the current scenario. As I see it, the USs failure to develop a strong strategy for the post-Soviet space, including Russia itself, allowed for Russia (namely Putin) to capitalize on this weakness by attacking a neighboring non-NATO, non-EU country in such a way that made it awkward for the US to respond militarily without escalating to nuclear conflict. In addition, the soft power tools available to the US such as economic sanctions dont seem sufficient to deter Russia anymore as perhaps they could have prior to the 2008 financial crisis (approximately), because the global balance of power has shifted away from total US hegemony as it was post-1989. This is just my assessment, but I think where your post goes wrong is the view that US strategy hinged on containing Russia without triggering a larger conflict. In fact, I think its quite the opposite - US strategy hinged on creating fear of nuclear MAD if the USSR were to try any invasion, which makes it tricky now that Russia is invading a friendly non-NATO country.","title":"Sargent Stockpile or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Use America's Guns"},{"text":"??","title":"Kamala Harris says she wants to have a Republican in her cabinet.

The book was a good read, but very distressing. It talked about how we have more than flipped the higher education rate between the genders, leading to disparities in the labor market. How the intersectionality of one's identity can have drastic consequences when everything is factored together. And a general lack of good role models for young men.There were a few good suggestions in the book for initiatives as well. I only remember two of them off hand; Red Shirting boys as they generally psycologically develop a little slower and so they can be ready for school. And a HEAL(Healthcare, Education, Administration, and Litteracy) program to get men into female dominated fields reminicent of the push for women to get into STEM.These days I'm feeling abit more hopefull as i sit in my community college classes with young men talking about their desire to go into the fields mentioned above, but we still have a long way to go.","title":"Reaching out to the Young Men Demographic"},{"text":"A developed country is a developed country.

He retired because the US didn't need cold war trained generals and their battalions with gear, so no star incoming. This happened all over the military industrial complex.Now that we need that capability back to re-prepare for a Russian confrontation, the whole complex has to re-gear and re-tool everything we set aside two decades ago. That's expensive. The old stockpiles we do have needed upgrades to work with the now current electronics and training for years, and sending those parts of the stockpiles to Ukraine do have a cost because then we have to replace them with new equipment that the industry doesn't have the capacity to deliver without even more extensive outlays.There's the politics too of course, but those boil down to spending and escalation concerns than any resistance to giving resources to Ukraine.

I live in a solidly blue state but I'll be showing up and voting for Harris like my life depends on it because in many ways _it does_.However... there seems to be some fracturing on this issue in the Democratic party and I'm not at all thrilled to see people like Colin Allred dropping the transphobic \\"boys playing girls sports\\" dogwhistle in his campaign against Cruz. I'm worried, quite legitimately, that the Democrats are moving somewhat to the right on trans issues to bring in conservatives and that we're going to be sold out so that Democrats can maintain power. I mean, it's not a good look that they're taking advice on issues from the UK Labour Party which had a full-on embrace of transphobia as part of their win in the last election there.Again, to be clear, I am voting Democrat across the whole ballot. I am encouraging all my friends, trans and cis alike, to do the same. I'm just being cautious about it and hoping that the Democrats don't decide to throw us under the bus to appeal to centrists and center-right people. At least seeing Tim Walz being vocal in his support for trans rights is very reassuring in the short term.","title":"Tim Walz defiantly defends trans people from Republicans demonizing attacks"},{"text":"We only have two choices realistically.

Hold that thought. Funny thing is the same NT, Pauline passage they often use to condemn LGBT people (like 1 Corinthians 6:9-10) actually condemns the likes of them in THE VERY SAME DAMN SENTENCE.

When you see these religious monsters telling obvious lies, being gluttons for money, food, and power, etc... know that they are, biblically speaking and by their own interpretation (which is hypocritical BS, but let's pretend for a moment it's not), just as just as condemned as the gayest of gay man with the sexual morals of a 17th century Port Royal, pirate serving strumpet. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ... it's clearly written, lol. \\"Be not deceived\\" huh?

But they will always ignore the larger picture like in Norway: the government has passed the Act on the Right to Use the Romani Language and rolled out outreach programs aimed at integrating Romani communities. These arent just empty gestures; they show a genuine commitment to addressing historical injustices. Its not fair to paint these societies as inherently racist without acknowledging the broader context.And lets talk about the police registries. The focus on them feels more like an attempt to generate outrage than to foster understanding. Critics tend to overlook that these registries arent officially sanctioned anymore and have been largely dismantled. Remember the 2013 Public Health Agency report in Sweden? It confirmed that authorities ceased these practices after legal challenges. That directly contradicts the narrative of systemic anti-Romani sentiment.We cant ignore the progress either. In 2021, Sweden adopted a new National Minorities Act that strengthens the rights of minority groups, including the Romani. This isnt just lip service; it signals a shift toward acknowledgment and reconciliation instead of ongoing oppression.Moreover, both countries have legal frameworks that actively shut down these illegal registries. Take Swedens Constitutional Law, which offers strong protections against discrimination. The Supreme Administrative Court ruling in 2013 that deemed those Romani databases illegal shows a real willingness to confront past wrongs instead of perpetuating them.So, before labeling the Nordic countries as bastions of systemic racism, maybe consider the full picture. Theres a lot of complexity and progress here that simply cant be ignored.","title":"CMV: The Anglosphere Are The Most Unfair/Worst Societies In The Developed World"},{"text":"So because Israel is nominally attacking Hamas, we are going to overlook the civilian deaths? lol. lmao, even.

BLM was demanding that nonviolent offenders who were imprisoned awaiting trial be released in order to slow down the rampant spread of COVID in the jails, and that the PD finally fire an officer that had killed an unarmed black kid a few years before.What actually happened devolved into two trends - during the day literally hundreds of thousands of people would turn out to protest, and then at night, angry young men, mostly black, would riot and break stuff downtown (I wasnt breaking stuff but I was in that group). Why? Because the official BLM protests during the day consisted solely of a march, then listen to an hour to a speech where some whiny person would drone on for hours about how hard it was to be black. I mean sure, okay, but they took no leadership over the situation, had no plan, and didnt attempt to organize peoples means and efforts. With no direction, angry young men did what they do when they have no leadership and smashed some windows. Nothing was accomplished at all. With leaders like that, how could BLM not fail? Saddest thing about it was that there was a pretty deep pool of organizations that could have organized everyone and provided leadership, but since they were mostly the wrong race because it was a majority white city, they had to stand by and watch it all fall apart.
