Also CA is on West coast and once those 54 EC votes drop for Harris (which is reliably blue) then we can start talking numbers.

For the first time since the Supreme Court ended a federal right to abortion in 2022, voters have rejected a ballot measure seeking to enshrine the right to an abortion in a state constitution  even as a solid majority of Florida voters voted to approve the measure.It was always going to be a tall order: Florida requires at least 60 percent support for proposals amending the state constitution  the highest threshold for any measure that has gone before voters in the last two years. With 86 percent of the vote in, Amendment 4 had received support from 57 percent of voters, while 43 percent voted against.Beyond the practical challenges, organizers were also forced to contend with an unprecedented state-sponsored campaign to defeat the measure.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis expended huge amounts of effort and political capital in an effort to tank the measure, after signing back-to-back bans into law restricting abortion  first at 15 weeks, and later at six weeks. DeSantis threw the full weight of the state government into a campaign to ensure the ballot measure went down in defeat.His state agencies spent millions of dollars in public money on TV and radio ads peddling misinformation about the measure, and the state also put up a website that claims Amendment 4 threatens womens safety. DeSantis and the Heritage Foundation teamed up to add misleading language  ostensibly a financial impact statement  to the ballot measure claiming the amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida and that this may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time.DeSantis sent his election goon squad to knock on the doors of Florida voters who signed petitions supporting the amendment, then, just a few weeks before the election, his Office of Election Crimes and Security issued a report accusing organizers of submitting a large number of forged signatures or fraudulent petitions  months after organizers paid the state of Florida to validate those signatures.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/florida-amendment-4-abortion-rights-fails-desantis-1235153569/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/florida-amendment-4-abortion-rights-fails-desantis-1235153569/)","title":"DeSantis Dirty Tricks Pay Off as Florida Abortion Measure Fails"},{"text":"Trump has almost double the electoral votes.

Contextually speaking, to add some validity to my case, you can actually check on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/djt) to see the short interest for Trumps stock. Over an hour ago maybe around the time of the article, there were 0 shares available to short. What that means is, institutions borrowed every single share that was available to be borrowed, and sold them, because their outlook is that trump will lose the election resulting in his stock price crashing. So when they buy back the shares at a much lower price than when they sold, they pay what is owe and collect the difference. There is absolutely no fucking way in ANY parallel that trump is stupid enough to try and sell his shares the day of the election.

The market prices (and hence the optimal/rational forecast) are generally determined by betting exchanges --   bookmakers mostly just take the exchange prices and add on vig.Yes a bookmaker can tilt the odds slightly towards one side by increasing/reducting their vig in that direction, but the price is never going to go above the betfair lay price or they will just get arb'ed immediately. The exchange prices set a very hard maximum on what price a bookmaker is free to offer, because of arbitrage. If (e.g.) Trump can be laid at 1.7 elsewhere then you can't offer 1.75 odds, no matter how much you want people to bet in that direction.\\\\ Its why Las Vegas books do lose money on some bets.?They lose money if they can't get their risk fully hedged. This might be (e.g.) because they screwed up their vig and took too much money on one side of the bet, and they arent willing to pay the fees (bid/ask spread) to get it laid off, and so they prefer to just accept some risk.

When Virginia seceded from the Union, a group of people in the western part of the state declared that *they* were instead the legitimate government of Virginia. It was purely by fiat.They they voted, as the government of Virginia, to break the western part of the state off the rest of the state, and applied to the federal government to be admitted as a new state.The federal government was, of course, operating without any of the representatives from the states that seceded, so admission passed both the House and the Senate. Lincoln signed the bill in 1862.But Lincoln's position was that the Confederacy was not legitimate, and that the states did not secede. Yet he signed the admission of West Virginia which was not passed by Virginia's elected government.","title":"Jim Justice wins West Virginia Senate race, flipping the seat for Republicans"},{"text":"Of course he does.

Because its run by an unstable meglomaniac with no coherent principles, Norton tweeted on Oct. 4. He took a hard right-wing turn, intentionally appealing to Trumps MAGA followers....Blumenthal fired back. In a lengthy tweet he claimed Norton, a supporter of vaccines, did not leave the Grayzone last year but was in fact fired for publicly criticizing his colleagues anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine stances, which Blumenthal referred to as jab mandates. Blumenthal concluded by attaching a cease and desist letter from February 2022 stating that Norton was fired the previous month for alleged inappropriate and inflammatory posts on social media related to your Grayzone colleagues in breach of the agreement, and neglecting for an extended period to carry out your normal work duties. Blumenthal posted a recording of the incident during their online feud, claiming he confronted Norton for violating their mediation agreement. The video shows Blumenthal tossing accusations at a seated Norton who is shielded by a man and woman who Blumenthal claims are his twin brother and girlfriend. Can you tell the Moderate Rebels patreons why you stole the account from me? How much money you stole from me, because we had a fifty-fifty agreement, Blumenthal says.Thats a fucking lie, Norton retorts.You stole tens of thousands of dollars from me, Blumenthal continues.The video shows Parampil mocking Norton for hiding behind his brother.

It's 2,924.6[0]Now look in the 10Q for September.  Here:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-24-045260.htmAnd look at that unearned revenue figure now:  1,959.7[0]It's down.  It's a liability. Good news, right?Not so fast.  What is unearned revenue you ask?  It's money that was PAID in the past for services to be delivered sometime later.  When a dollar's worth of services are eventually rendered, then we add a dollar in the revenue line, and subtract a dollar in the unearned revenue line.  It's money the company gets to count as \\"revenue\\" in the future, even though customers won't be paying it in the future. What this means is that when unearned revenue goes down in a quarter, we can subtract that same amount from revenue in the quarter, to figure out how much customers actually paid the firm this quarter.Revenue in Sept quarter was 1,010.9[0]Reduction in unearned revenue was 2924.6-1952.7 = 971.9[0]Which means my dudes that the full amount of money this firm collected from customers this quarter was not just over a cool million...  It was a mere $39K!!!    \\n \\nAnd what did the company spend this quarter on sales and marketing to attract this $39K from customers?  $2,189.4[0]KIt takes a special kind of genius to spend 2 million to earn $40K.

In Helsinki, at the infamous [2018] summit meeting between Putin and Trump, people focus on what might have happened between them behind closed doors and what happened at the press conference where Trump was quick to praise Putin for being more trustworthy than his own advisers.  But there was a lunch prior to the press conference, and I personally saw there how Putin could easily goad Trump into saying terrible things about his fellow Americans.  He goaded Trump into talking about Joe Biden, who at that point wasnt yet a candidate for president, but was likely to be, and also about Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and about other political figures. Trump went on and on throwing other Americans, fellow Americans, under the bus, in front of a person who really does not care about America and certainly does not care about Americans. Putin was smirking. I was shocked. Im no longer shocked, but I just kept thinking about how Trump has no filter. So what else is he saying to Putin about other people? What vulnerabilities is he opening up?

It's funny the perception is that the media has it out for Trump when he just says way more crazy shit than anyone else. The sheer volume of crazy shit is just an absolute deluge. People bitched for months about how nobody talked about the things he would say at his rallies. Only now they've sort of started covering that. It also always seems like they give him the most charitable headline they possibly can. I'm so sick of hearing about bias. I really am. I don't think there's a person on this planet that isn't biased. I would rather have people admit that they're biased but try to be truthful in what they're saying. And that's usually what I'm looking for in the media.Edit:A classic case of this is Trump makes some statement and everyone interprets it. When we're not just arguing about whether he said what he said or not everyone seems to have their own interpretation. I'm sympathetic to the left, so I'm not going to interpret Trump in the way that someone like JD Vance or Mike Johnson would, let alone regular Republicans. But I do try to be honest about what I think he's saying. But in my mind I'm constantly seeing this double standard. Because everything Biden or Kamala says is taken at face value. Just like this comment by Biden the other day where he may or may not have called Trump supporters trash. He walked it back. He said he didn't mean it like that, and you know what? That's definitely good enough for when Trump says something out of line.
