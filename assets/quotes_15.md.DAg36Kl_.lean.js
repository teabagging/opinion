You say you love Dostoevsky, but yet you seemingly don't realize that Dostoevsky was a strict Christian. He was raised Orthodox Christian growing up, and after his arrest (and imprisonment) in 1849 he focused intently on Christ and the New Testament, which was the only book he was allowed whilst incarcerated. I will say that he wasn't a fan of Priests, but he was most definitely a believer in Christ.\\n3. It is difficult to place Dostoevsky politically, as he rejected atheistic socialism, and rejected the destructions of the institutes, as well as rejecting any violent method of upheaval, whether it came from progressives or reactionaries. He also supported private property and business rights, and did not agree with many of the criticisms levied against the Free Market by socialists of the day.So as such, I have a difficult time believing that he would label Conservatives/Traditionalists as \\"imbeciles\\", or agree with the modern woke Left.","title":"CMV: political conversations on reddit do more harm than good, and what may seem like an opportunity for more viewpoints is strongly overridden by elements that further compartmentalize our views."},{"text":"Your on reddit.","title":"Governor Newsom quickly secures Major Disaster Declaration from President Biden for Los Angeles fires"},{"text":"A fact checker once marked a claim by John Stossel as false.

All they need to do is convince the public that it is true.Hell, they don't even really need to do that, they just need to claim it is happening, then they can sign emergency authorization to force legal regulation for censorship on platforms like Facebook.Volunteering to do it themselves may benefit them in the long run rather than letting the legal infrastructure be set up to force them.Not saying I agree with Zuck giving in, but I do understand strong reasons for why he did.Hell, a tonne of people still believe all sorts of claims about Russian interference in elections and Russian propaganda manipulating people on platforms like X, despite the fact nobody could ever prove that to be true, and in fact when the documents came to light it turned out to be nothing but a narrative being sold to the public as another means of problem - reaction - solution in support of increased censorship and control online.But those claims were made and then repeated endlessly through many different forms of media until many of the general public accepted it must be demonstrable fact.I still do not trust Zuck, I have no clue what the true motivations might be behind this change, and I am mostly pessimistic about the future of online censorship and freedoms. The recent move around the globe to increase censorship really made me wonder if any and all truth movements would soon fade away into obscurity. Zuck's claims of these new changes do give me a tiny bit of cautious, sceptical hope.This move really does fit in with the whole right wing counter-culture phase of modern politics, which is something that to me appears to have been a very, very successful ploy by the intelligence agencies to manipulate a tonne of the people who are losing faith in authority institutions, and re-direct that skepticism into the same old two party tribalism politics, following their \\"anti-deep state\\" leader (lol) DJ Trump. They (Intel community) even played out an entire psy-op that appears to have been meant mostly for the Christian portion of the voter base that the right has adopted in the 70's with the whole Q-Anon thing. \\"Q\\" was an absolutely fantastical and bizarre conspiracy theory that was very, very much void of any logical, evidence, or critical thinking based ideas, and yet it was wildly successful because it was specifically targeted at a demographic whose strongest beliefs are faith based rather than evidence based. This psyop helped to grab attention of that Christian side of the voter base, and manipulate them into being more aligned with the rest of the modern \\"counter-culture\\" right, while simultaneously being successful in their consistent goal of maintaining a left-right divide by having the right spread conspiracy theories that were obviously wildly false and irrational to people on the left who caught a glimpse. Of course, this would also be successful in the usual muddying the waters in general for \\"conspiracy theories\\" and \\"conspiracy theorists\\", helping to make sure that the unacquainted would continue to see everything conspiracy related as the wild ramblings of the schizophrenic and obvious intentional manipulation for money, disregarding any and all that question the official narrative, and self correcting any time they find themselves catching some rational, evidence-based ideas opposing the narrative because \\"Hah, wait what am I thinking?

I'm not being dishonest.I agree that \\"comparisons were made\\", but I think the comparisons were correct. Trump *did* admire Hitler - according to his former chief of staff. It's possible his chief of staff (a highly respected former general and secretary of Homeland Security) is lying or misremembering or misstating what was said, and if you want to make that argument we could go into it, but if we *were* to take John Kelly at his word:He commented more than once that, You know, Hitler did some good things, too, Kelly recalled to The Times. Kelly said he would usually quash the conversation by saying nothing (Hitler) did, you could argue, was good, but that Trump would occasionally bring up the topic again. \\\\[...\\\\] In his interview with The Atlantic, Kelly recalled that when Trump raised the idea of needing German generals, Kelly would ask if he meant Bismarcks generals, referring to Otto von Bismarck, the former chancellor of the German Reich who oversaw the unification of Germany. Surely you cant mean Hitlers generals, Kelly recalled asking Trump. To which the former president responded, Yeah, yeah, Hitlers generals.Important note: Trump *didn't* admire the Holocaust, and we have zero evidence that Trump has ever planned the mass murder of any group of people. There are far-left folks who claim that Trump is planning to set up death camps, or whatever, and that's ludicrous. Moreover, Trump is generally against war (for all his bluster), so it seems unlikely that he would launch World War III by trying to invade other countries. It's possible to admire dictators (as Trump clearly does, by his own public statements, as well as his repeated statements to John Kelly) without being as bad as Adolf Hitler. That doesn't mean Harris was wrong to criticize him for it.Finally: *there's a difference between saying someone is a horrible person and being rude to them at a state event.* For folks like Obama, patriotism means showing a certain sort of respect and civility even to those you strongly disagree with. I'm the same way; I think Trump is a horrible person, perhaps the worst person we've ever had as US president; by refusing to accept the results of an election, spreading totally unfounded lies about the election being stolen and leading to a mob breaking into the US capitol, he has harmed American democratic norms. I'm happy to tell *you* that, or anyone else who'll listen. But if I met Trump himself at an event, I wouldn't cuss him out or throw a shoe at him or anything, because what would be the point? That would only further degrade public discourse; it's exactly what I don't want.","title":"CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about"},{"text":"Hell will be raised if he does even a fraction of the bullshit he plans to.

I have tried to understand some of these people, and many of them show me that they have no idea how the economy actually works, and others are playing ridiculous ideas like they felt that Harris was not qualified or that she didn't give clear answers. What really blows my mind is when they tell me I shouldn't take everything Trump says seriously. I then ask them why would we put somebody in the most top office of this country if we are not to take them seriously?And again, I always throw up there that if Obama or Biden did any of the kinds of things Trump did, would they be so forgiving? I think the only thing I can ever fathom is that many of these people so badly want to bring back the America of yesteryear and seemingly forget why things were so great in the '50s and '60s. They want to act like it was just the free market that made it all happen, ignoring the new deal and the Great society. The very kinds of socialism they claim are wrong. They don't want to fathom that we can't do it here. That we have to become more like Europe and have government play a bigger role in our lives with a good balance. I call it ignorance and denial. My biggest example I always pull up is healthcare. Insurance companies want to take our money but not help us when it's time, because they want to keep the money. Pharma doesn't want to cure ailments, but just suppress symptoms so they keep us on the hook buying drugs forever. All these providers are more interested in pushing treatments and procedures on us to make money as opposed to really analyzing the situation and looking for simpler solutions. That to me is the real free market now. They're not about the customer but about themselves. All these people voting for Trump are in denial, or they keep bringing up complaints about things but never want to accept this reality.","title":"Surprise!

The nation was at the height of the coronavirus pandemic; in that month, 3,000 Americans died daily from covid-19. There were newly developed, lifesaving vaccines, thanks to the Trump administrations Operation Warp Speed  but there was no viable plan to distribute them. The U.S. economy and the world economy were on life support.Four years later, the country is in vastly better shape. The economy, though still recovering, is the envy of the developed world; U.S. stock markets are at or near all-time highs. We have made overdue investments in infrastructure and technology. And American troops are not at war for the first time in a generation.By any objective standard, Biden was a very good president whose accomplishments will benefit the nation for many years to come.Bidens critics find it convenient to look past his biggest success: He guided the country through, and out of, the pandemic. Regardless of what Republicans want us to believe, it was during Trumps presidency when government officials imposed anti-covid rules that sent us into isolation  and during Bidens when we regained the freedom to go about our lives.The Trump administration repeatedly promised an infrastructure week but never delivered; Biden won approval of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. The Inflation Reduction Act made the nations biggest investment ever in fighting climate change  more than $400 billion. The Chips and Science Act marked $280 billion to boost scientific research and spur domestic manufacturing of cutting-edge semiconductors.These initiatives will produce returns in the years and decades to come. When future presidents smile for the cameras at ribbon-cuttings, remember that it was Biden who laid the foundations.Without putting boots on the ground, the United States and its allies fortified Ukraine with the arms and intelligence it needed to fight invading Russian troops to a stalemate. Biden forced Putin to pay a much bigger price in manpower and materiel than he had anticipated  weakening the Russian military at minimal cost to the United States.I am confident that historians, with the clarity of hindsight, will focus less on Bidens softening voice and tentative gait  and more on all that he managed to achieve in a single term. He was a consequential and farsighted president who leaves the nation much better off than he found it.","title":"Time caught up with Biden.

After two years of Democrats holding all three levers of power, Republicans say voters sent a message by taking down the Democratic majority in the House.They're preparing to take the speaker's gavel and powerful chair positions saying they have the majority, even if it's temporary.\\"There is no longer a tie in the state of Minnesota,\\" House Republican Leader Lisa Demuth said Monday.\\"Democrats will be coming in with 66 members,\\" Demuth continued, versus Republicans' 67. \\"What that does is that gives us an organizational majority that we fully intend to exercise. We will be showing up on Jan. 14, ready to do the work that Minnesotans have sent us to the House of Representatives to do.\\"Control of the chamber is important because it determines what policy moves forward. And in a budget-writing year, that comes with additional leverage....Democrats say Republicans should come to the table to discuss a power-sharing arrangement for the chamber. And if they don't, they say they'll walk out on Tuesday, potentially shutting down any chance for Republicans to take the reins.\\"If we have to deny quorum in order to preserve the will of the voters across the state who voted for a tie  then that's what we'll do,\\" House Democratic Leader Melissa Hortman said. \\"It is simply an outrageous and illegitimate power grab by Republicans to try to do that.\\"Republicans haven't said whether they'd bring in law enforcement officers to round up Democratic members, which has happened in other states. But they'll pursue recall efforts for lawmakers who don't show up for the session.Walkouts come with a risk of voter backlash, but Hortman says it's a move Democrats are prepared to take to ensure all representatives are seated and that chamber leadership represents the House makeup....Legislative leaders in both parties agree they're navigating unprecedented waters.\\"You always hear how, well, that wasn't on my bingo card. Mine has been shredded,\\" the House GOP Leader, Demuth, said. \\"I don't think that anyone could have anticipated where we are.\\"Hortman agreed this has been an odd series of legislative hypotheticals. Right after the election, she said, \\"When we flip that coin, the quarter landed on its side.\\"And as it's become more complicated in the weeks since, some have likened it to a movie the Coen brothers, who are Minnesota natives, might make.Murphy, the Senate Democratic leader, says she hopes that the legislature can meet the unpredictable moment.\\"This feels like a real test for us,\\" Murphy said. \\"And I hope that we show each other the best of who we are.\\"It's deeply unfortunate that political brinksmanship has appeared to firmly entrenched itself in politics at all levels.

It is human nature, and this need will not go away. Products satisfy needs. Anti-smoking forces have reduced smoking by punishing smokers financially, taking their money and adding it to various government slush funds. It has succeeded in moving people, especially younger people, away from cigarettes. But the need is still there. So, instead of cigarettes the now use vapes, nicotine pouches, cigars, dip, and add tobacco leaf to marijuana- wrap it in tobacco leaf and basically turn the joint into 50% cigarette. Sales of these items have more than replaced the decrease in cigarettes, especially among younger people. So, in the battle against nicotine nothing has been achieved. Government is only moving people from one delivery system to another. Government punishes one industry and gives rise to others- which are mostly foriegn. American tobacco did not bend the knee and give enough money to Democrats, so they were destroyed. Now government is looking for the other industries to bend the knee. American vapes did- but still got destroyed because Chinese companies keep sending non-FDA approved vapes anyway and doesnt care. There is too much demand, so companies are finding ways to get the vapes through. Its huge actually: Vape stores every quarter mile where I live. Its great- free enterprise in the absense of government control is very profitable and satisfies consumer needs.

I think it makes a difference though what population the basis of the majority is. The quotient of your political voice in relation to the population allowed to vote of, lets say, your local town might be 1/20.000 and the quotient of your political voice in relation to the population of the whole nation would be 1/264.000.000 for a us citizen. In this example your personal voice would be 13.000 times more valuable. This is only a very rough estimation. Usually your influence on lower levels is higher, because people influence each other in their communities.The way through which elites acquire power is by increasing the importance of government on national levels. By that they decrease the value of personal political power of individuals and their communities and give it to representatively elected politicians who can usually act without much control for the period they got elected for. That's what makes democracy a lips service and actually turning it into some form of [plutocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy) or [particracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particracy) or maybe more precisely described as \\"statocracy\\". Power is exercised by state-politicians who act on behalf of a national state.The word democracy itself, stems from *dmos*?'people' and?*kratos*?'rule', and thus necessarily implies some sort of local(!) [self-governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance). If it doesn't, then people simply don't rule themselves. I just want to be pedantic about the use and meaning of the word. But the fact that we people are 1) neither allowed to make our own political decisions or actually have a say in making policies and 2) our political power is being abstracted from us and the communities we live in towards a national state and the politicians who act on behalf of the state, simply forbids it for me to speak of democracy.","title":"Why the world slides Left and what to do about it"},{"text":"That's good....cause I don't have an ID anyways","title":"Petition for Urgent Recall of L.A.'s Democrat Mayor Hits 59,150 Signatures"},{"text":"\\"Illegitimate claim to power\\"CIA: \\"First time?\\"","title":"U.S. Increases Reward For Venezuela's Maduro to $25 Million As It Condemns 'Repression and Illegitimate Claim to Power'"},{"text":"Dont worry.

Its so deeply ingrained into everything, but its simplistic framework becomes problematic for more nuanced world issues.Unfortunately, propaganda is king - and it currently has a stranglehold on people who claim to be moral relativists. Thats why its become so easy for grandstanding governments to control the narrative. They get to be the arbiter of justice, which is essentially just altruism with ulterior motives, and the people get to clap for the good guys.In reality, the US doesnt support Israel and Ukraine out of the kindness of their hearts. They dont provide them with money and weapons because theyre good, or because theyre our allies, or to defend democracy.Its literally nothing more than a strategic political move. But its a delicate balance - the risks vs. rewards of intervening. Its why you dont hear anyone advocating to help the Uighurs in China, or the Tigrayans in Ethiopia.Thats why the US prioritizes Israel and Ukraine over its own people. Its better for business. Theyve also determined that the political and economical benefits outweigh the risks of you doing something about it.And lets face it - you wont. Or, rather, we as a collective society wont. Wed rather continue consuming their propaganda until weve fully dehumanized entire groups of people. I guess thats the price of supporting the good side?In conclusion, stop supporting war criminals, colonial states, and divisive governments that perpetuate violence.Do more research. Ask more questions. Lean on humanity. Support your fellow citizens, and demand your government to do the same.As for anyone who supports both Israel and Ukraine, please try and learn why thats an incredibly ironic stance.

Situations in which voters do not expect a politician to keep his word, and in many instances fervently hope and pray he will not, are rarer. Donald Trump, the US president-elect, fits this latter category. When Trump threatens to subjugate Canada, a Nato ally, by force, unilaterally annex Greenland, the autonomous territory of a friendly EU state, and override Panamas sovereignty for bogus security reasons, most people assume he is not serious and his remarks carry little real significance. This response, while comforting, is a mistake.Its entirely possible that Trump, pumped with hype, hot air and testosterone in the lead-up to his 20 January inauguration, is being gratuitously disruptive. He likes to shake things up. It amuses his Make America Great Again (Maga) hyper-nationalist fanclub. It may be that this former property developer and convicted felon, who counts himself a shrewd negotiator, is deliberately raising the stakes before more reasoned discussions about security and trade. But it is also possible Trump means what he says.If so, Trump will be following a well-trodden, discredited path. These days it It is somehow considered impolite, especially if you are British, to remind Americans that their republic was also once an unapologetically imperial power. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, US administrations aggressively pursued their own version of the colonial empires of contemporary Britain, Germany and France. In 1893, the sovereign state of Hawaii (whose royal family enjoyed close ties to Queen Victoria) fell victim to an American-assisted coup. In 1898, the US annexed Hawaii. Guam, Samoa and Puerto Rico followed. Americas loosely interpreted manifest destiny demanded ever more. The Philippines, Cuba and even China were all on the receiving end of US political-military, commercial and territorial ambitions.Far from being abandoned, neocolonialist American thinking persisted well into the latter half of the 20th century, operating under various guises. Newly-independent countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, liberated from collapsing European empires, were invited to join the free world, as defined and dominated by Washington. America promised protection and prosperity within the US-policed, post-1945 cold war order in return for fealty (plus military bases, trade concessions and access to resources). States that declined the invitation, such as Iran, Vietnam and Nicaragua, paid a high price.Viewed from this perspective, Trumps territorial ambitions are not so much an aberration as a throwback or regression to periods of unabashed American expansionism. And his motives are not dissimilar. As in the past, its all about security, cash and control. Greenland has valuable mineral wealth. It also has growing strategic importance, vis-a-vis China and Russia, as the Arctic sea ice melts and new trade routes open up. The US already maintains a military base there. Trump sees a lucrative opportunity C and by absorbing Greenlands vast territory, a chance to make America even greater, again. Trump claims the protectionist, high-tariff America First policies he espouses were the reason why the US, at the height of the Gilded Age in the 1890s, was, in his words, probably the wealthiest it ever was because it was a system of tariffs. Like Denmark and Panama (where Trump would like to get his hands on the canal), Canada has robustly rejected his turgid annexation fantasies. But mercantilist ideas dating from that period plainly influence his thinking, such as it is. Justin Trudeau, Canadas prime minister, says Trumps menacing talk is a tactic designed to distract attention from the damaging inflationary impact of his threatened 25% increase in taxes on Canadian imports such as oil, electricity, timber and steel. Everything American consumers buy from Canada [is] suddenly going to get a lot more expensive if he moves forward on these tariffs, Trudeau warned.The broader, significant point is that Trumps half-baked neo-imperialist tendencies are but one aspect of an overall, deliberately disruptive modus operandi designed to suborn, co-opt and disadvantage friend and foe alike. His intervention helped spur pre-existing turbulence in Canadian politics, resulting in Trudeaus resignation. He has stirred up the longstanding independence debate in Greenland, where most people would probably prefer to be free of both Copenhagen and Washington. In Mexico, another target of his geopolitical wrecking ball, Trumps antics grimly recall decades of Yanqui bullying and meddling in Latin America.The crass activities of Trumps sycophantic office boy, businessman Elon Musk, are all of a piece with this strategy of anti-democratic disruption and destabilisation. By backing far-right parties in Germany and France, imposing his ignorant opinions on British politics and picking gratuitous fights with the EU, all the while hiding behind the fuzzy screen of unaccountable, fact-free social media, Musk advances a Trump agenda that is fundamentally about control. Control of politicians and political discourse, control of open debate and communication, control of territory, trade and wealth, to be achieved through transactional deal-making, crude barter, intimidation, humiliation, subversion and, ultimately, through threats of force.This is how Trump operates. For him, this is strongman leadership. For others, it resembles mafioso-style extortion. It is this imperious, domineering, unscrupulous, manipulative and unprincipled, self-serving behaviour that the worlds leaders must face up to once again over the coming four years. Britain and like-minded countries that cherish democratic values and free societies should not duck the challenge. Better to take a stand and draw a line now, as Greenlands leaders have bravely done, than risk being steamrollered into subservience and satrapy.","title":"Donald Trumps Imperial Bullying Must Be Nipped In The Bud: Countries that cherish democratic values need to take a stand against the president-elects throwback to unabashed American expansionism"},{"text":"They definitely did not say that on Wednesday morning.

Politics is exhausting, and when there are people on the other side of the political spectrum who can be friendly outside of  political topics make the job a bit less emotionally draining, especially when dealing with the others on the side of the aisle who are never friendly. My family friend worked with Jason Carter (Jimmy Carters grandson) on different sides of the aisle, and despite disagreeing on most issues, they were friends to the point where Jason Carter jokingly offered to endorse my family friends political opponent to ensure said political opponent would lose. In addition, Ive heard the reports from multiple former presidents say that the job of president can be so insanely isolating and draining given that there are so few people who have ever had it and understand what its like that when they do meet up with former presidents, no matter what side of the aisle theyre on, its an immense relief to be able to finally speak with someone who understands. Im not saying I dont sort of understand people not liking the optics of seeing Obama and Trump chatting amiably with each other at Jimmy Carters funeral, but Id rather see it as a sign of hope that no matter how much we disagree, in the end, we can still see each other as people and approach each other on levels we understand instead of always fighting at every opportunity, that there is hope for unity beyond this constant tension we see in the news. I for one would much rather have the confidence that if an unprecedented situation arose, the current president would have enough of a relationship with all the living former presidents to consult perhaps the only people who would understand the pressures of the position he holds before doing something world shaking. But thats just the way I see it from my experience. I can see why people would see it differently, but Id rather we choose the hopeful signs rather than the gloomy ones.","title":"CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about"},{"text":"it is hard to fight 4 wildfires at the same time especially with the Hugh winds and tough terrain.","title":"Aurora Culpo rips Democratic leaders for lack of wildfire preparedness, calls on Newsom, Bass to resign"},{"text":"Pinged GARAND ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20GARAND&amp;message=subscribe%20GARAND) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20GARAND&amp;message=unsubscribe%20GARAND) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=GARAND&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Tim Walz backs David Hogg for DNC vice chair"},{"text":"Good God, Tim Walz really is the platonic ideal of the Fudd.\\"Whacha need that mattel rifle there for, sonny?

Morgan Chase &amp; Companys risk committee, was Obamas fundraising chair in his 2004 campaign for the Senate.25The Crowns investments in Obama paid off General Dynamics revenues shot up to over $30 billion in 2016, a three-fold increase from 2000. The Crowns net worth doubled in the Obama years, causing the family to rise in the Forbes ranking to the 27th?richest family in the United States.26Penny Pritzker of the Pritzker banking dynastyranked number 9 on the Forbes list with a fortune of $32.5 billiongave $500,000 to Obamas second inaugurationearning her appointment as Obamas Secretary of Commerce.Pritzker had helped finance Obama from the beginning of his political career, having allegedly?met him in the early 1990s when her kids were playing on a basketball team coached by Michelle Obamas brother, Craig Robinson.During Obamas 2008 White House run,?Pritzker served as the national chairwoman of his campaign finance team, which shattered fundraising records, and in the 2012 reelection effort, she was a top bundler.The Pritzker familywhich made its fortune through ownership of Hyatt hotelshad long ties to the CIA. They were leading depositors in the Bahamas-based Castle Bank, a CIA outfit founded by one of the CIAs mob liaisons, Paul Helliwell, which specialized in off-shoring money.27The Pritzkers were also war profiteers. In 1953, family patriarchs Jay and Robert Pritzker founded the Marmon Group, an industrial holding company which includes the subsidiary?Marmon Aerospace and Defense?which manufactures wires and cables for aerospace, military vehicles, combat systems, radar installations and naval shipboards.The Pritzkerslike the Crownsthus personally profited from Obamas mammoth military budgets, which outstripped those of President Bush by an average of $18.7 billion per year, Obamas naval buildup in the South China Sea and his?overseeing more sales of military weaponry than any other president$60 billion more than President Bush.28ConclusionAs the first Black president, Obama is often placed on a pedestal as a moral beacon and compared to such historic figures as Martin Luther King, Jr., and Nelson Mandela.These comparisons are off base, as Obama is an opportunistic and often deceitful politician who has shown a lack of moral integrity throughout his career.Obamas deep ties to and support of the CIA and offshoot agencies like the NED fueled great foreign policy disasters which ravaged numerous countries.After he left the presidency, Obama worked through his consiglire John Brennan to help?conjure up the Russia Gate scandal, which revived Cold War-era demonologies, poisoned U.S.-Russia relations and greatly increased the threat of nuclear war.Media outlets including those on the Left continue to perpetrate many myths about Obama and to assume a defensive posture in the face of right-wing attacks.While these attacks may be nefarious, they should not preclude sober and critical analysis about Americas forty-fourth president and the dark forces behind his rise to power and reign.","title":"A Company Family: The untold history of Obama and the CIA"},{"text":"It actually is.

He was the one who selected Obama Sr. for the scholarship.Obama Sr. returned the favor by going back to Kenya to work for the Kenyan Finance and Transport Ministries and an oil firm in Kenya before dying in a car crash in 1982. Mboya himself was assassinated in 1969.Far-fetched as it sounds, Obama Sr. may not have been Obamas real father.Obama Sr. and Ann never lived together or had a real wedding, and Obama Sr. had no contact with his son, except for a short two-week visit to Hawaii when Obama was ten, which may have been for the purpose of securing Obama a spot in the coveted Punahou Prep School.12The photo of Stanley and Obama Sr. is suspicious because what father in his right mind would be pictured smiling with the man who impregnated his teenaged daughter and then abandoned her?There is evidence to suggest that Obamas real father was Frank Marshall Davis, an African American journalist, sexually libertine poet, political radical and alleged target of Grandpa Dunhams surveillance.Obamas friend Keith Kakugawa told an interviewer that Ann had had an affair with Davis because she was angry that the family had to move to Hawaii, away from her high-school friends who were all attending the University of Washington.Ann became pregnant and, to hide the truth, Dunham paid Obama Sr.whom he knew through the University of Hawaii exchangeto marry Ann, giving him the opportunity to extend his visa to attend Harvard.Barack eventually found out the truth, writing in his first memoir,?Dreams from My Father, that the visits to Franks house always left me feeling vaguely uncomfortable as if I were witnessing some complicated, unspoken transaction between the two men, a transaction I couldnt understand.13Obama paid tribute to his actual father in a 1981 poem published in the Occidental College Literary Journal called?Pop,?which attributes to him features that resemble Davis, and references Pops poetry, written before his mother died.Barack Sr. was not a poet and, although Stanley dabbled in poetry, Barry called him gramps and his mother committed suicide before his eighth birthday.14Madelyn DunhamOne other connection between Obama and the U.S. national security state lies with his grandmother Madelynwhom Obama called Toot.Though lacking a college degree, Madelyn rose to the rank of Vice President of the Bank of Hawaiiwhich suggests she had high level personal connections.In that job, Madelyn handled escrow accounts used to pay American Cold War clients in Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea and elsewhereincluding through CIA proprietaries.The Bank of Hawaii further had dealings with Nugan Hand Bank of Australia through which the CIA funded the constitutional coup dtat against Australian Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975.15Covering Up the TruthObama and his handlers effectively covered up the truth about Obamas family history.They marketed Obama as a multi-racial candidate whose sensitivity to divergent cultures around the world would help restore Americas international reputation following the Bush years.In his 2020 memoir,?A Promised Land, Obama presents his mother as a 1960s rebel and beatnik who partook in civil rights protests, opposed the Vietnam War, married outside her race twice, and decided to devote her career to setting up micro-lending projects for poor women in Indonesia and later Pakistan whose language and culture she absorbed.16Obama claimed that his mother did not know about the countless atrocities that were committed by the Suharto government, which is implausible given her background and the fact that they were reported on by mainstream newspapers at the timefavorably.Of further significance, Obama underplayed his stepfather Lolos army rank in his 2006 book,?The Audacity of Hope.17Regarding his own story, Obama has promoted falsehoods at every step.In?A Promised Land, he neglects to mention that, after graduating Columbia University in 1983, he?worked for about a year for Business International Corporation (BIC),?a Manhattan-based consulting house to multinational corporations, where his job was to edit newsletters on business conditions in countries around the world.Headed by a close friend of former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Orville Freeman, Jr., the former Governor of Minnesota who was involved with Humphrey in the purge of suspected communists in the Farmer-Labor Party, BIC had functioned as a CIA front.Its sub-specialty was in recruiting left-wing organizers to use as assets, and in infiltrating foreign labor unions with the goal of promoting disruptions in targeted economies.An activist with the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) described BIC as the guys who wrote the Alliance for Progress (Marshall Plan for Latin America):Theyre the left-wing of the ruling class.18Besides underplaying his employment with BIC, Obama in his writings omits the fact that his work as a community organizer was for the Gamaliel Foundation, a satellite of his mothers old employer the Ford Foundation, whose underlying aim was to prevent class solidarity and the revival of Martin Luther King, Jr.s inter-racial poor peoples movement.19Obama further leaves out that as an Illinois state senator, he partook in pay-to-play schemes granting favors to political donors like?slumlord Tony Rezkowho?helped him purchase his Hyde Park mansion for below market value, and?the CEO of a technology firm, Robert Blacwell Jr., who paid Obama $112,000 in legal fees for work that appears impossible for him to have done.Obamas timeline for his life story, meanwhile, is often wrong. In?A Promised Land, for example, he claims to have spent three years in New York after transferring from Occidental College to Columbia after his sophomore year; however, it is believed that Obama spent the 1981-1982 school year in Pakistan and only studied at Columbia for one year.20","title":"A Company Family: The untold history of Obama and the CIA"},{"text":"What does Afghanistan provide except heroin?

One of her closest colleagues, Adi Sasono, had been the leader of the Muslim students during the overthrow of Sukarno.While Anns recruitment as a CIA agent has never been openly acknowledged, she was among the few U.S. government employees with the language skills and access to fulfill this role effectively. Development projects in the region were explicitly designed to pry villagers away from the PKI orbit, and Anns work would have contributed to this.In March 1965, Ann married an Indonesian Lieutenant Colonel, Lolo Soetoro, whom she met at the University of Hawaiis East-West Center, a kinder, gentler version of the School of the Americas, according to one writer, and cover for a training program in which Southeast Asians were brought to Hawaii and trained to go back to create agent nets, as U.S. Information Service (USIS) Director Frank Scotten described it.The head of the East-West Center in 1965 was Howard P. Jones, U.S. ambassador to Indonesia from 1958 to 1965.10Jones was present in Jakarta as Suharto and his CIA-backed military officers planned the 1965 overthrow of Sukarno, who was seen, along with the PKI as an ally of China.Jones later defended the coup in?The Washington Post, writing that Suharto was merely responding to a communist coup against Sukarno led by Colonel Untungwhich was actually set up by the CIA.11A friend of Anns told her biographer that the marriage to Lolo was arranged, suggesting that Ann may have acted as a female honeypot for the CIA whose job was to recruit assets and help them obtain U.S. citizenship.Hailing from an aristocratic family which lost out in Sukarnos land reform, Soetoro was recalled to active duty in July 1965 before General Suhartos right-wing coup and worked as an army geographer in Java and Papua New Guinea, where the Indonesian army brutally suppressed popular revolts.Soetoro went on to become an executive at Mobil Oil and its liaison to Suharto, whose economic policies Dunham praised.CIA Family ConnectionStanley Armour DunhamObamas grandfather Stanley Armour Dunhamwho helped raise himserved with the 9th?Air Force Division in World War II.He was pictured in a military uniform with no insignia, which suggests an intelligence unit.Another photo featured his daughter Ann, with the insignia of an elite school in Lebanon on her shirt in the 1950s, where Stanley may have worked with the CIA or another U.S. government agency.In the early 1960s, Stanley Dunham was part of a group photo taken with Barack Obama, Sr., on his departure from the University of Hawaii.Obama Sr. had been part of a State Department/CIA exchange financed in part by the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation that brought future African leaders to the U.S. who were being groomed to serve U.S. interests in the Cold War.The photo would suggest that Dunham was one of the coordinators of the exchange, indicating work for the State Department or CIA.According to his official biography, Dunham worked as a furniture salesman for the Standard-Grunbaum Furniture Company, which led to his frequent travel and family moves.Independent researchers believe, however, that this job was a cover for his work as an intelligence agent, who surveilled radical groups, or military or Air Force production facilities, which is what brought him to Hawaii.Dunhams favorite bar in Honolulu, to which he brought young Barry, perhaps not coincidentally was owned by William J. Lederer, a known CIA agent who wrote the Cold War classic,?The Ugly American.","title":"A Company Family: The untold history of Obama and the CIA"},{"text":"Another excellent post.

Obama has been in the news this week for overseeing groundbreaking on his presidential center. This center has sparked controversy because it will?not house any actual documents and is being built on the supposedly protected Jackson Park on Chicagos southern lakefront.?Hugh Iglarsh wrote in Counterpunch that the main towerwhich resembles a giant upraised cell phonewill be?a Great Tower of Nothing, a monument to hubris, chutzpah and Chicago-style cloutwhich rivals the Pyramid of Khufu in its brutal, enigmatic grandiosity.CEditors]\\nIn the summer of 2012, President Barack Obama signed a secret order authorizing the CIA and other U.S. agencies to support rebels in Syria seeking to oust Syrian leader Bashir al-Assada nationalist who had allied with Iran and stood up to U.S. proxy Israel.1Costing more than $1 billion, Operation Timber Sycamore evolved into the largest covert operation since the arming of mujahadin fighters in Afghanistan in the 1980s.U.S. Special Forces under Timber Sycamore again trained Islamic fundamentalists, this time in Jordan, who again carried out a reign of terror.2A voracious consumer of intelligence, Obamas trademark throughout his presidency was to move war into the shadows, a light-footprint approach designed to expand U.S. power covertly.General Joseph Votel, head of the special operations command (SOCOM) characterized the Obama era as a?golden age for special operations.

Reddit was originally designed to encourage open, democratic discussion, with upvotes and downvotes meant to highlight quality contributions rather than enforce ideological conformity. During its peak years, around 2010 to 2013, there was a better balance of political perspectives, and subreddits were spaces for genuine debate. The downvote was used to weed out irrelevant or low-effort content, not to suppress ideas outside a subreddits Overton window.As subreddits grew and became more ideologically homogeneous, this balance eroded. The downvote shifted into a tool for silencing dissent, and many communities devolved into echo chambers where groupthink and tribalism dominate.

Influencing people isn't always for protecting society from specific bad people but also for other directional purposes. In other words if they want to direct society to look a certain way more quickly they have to block people who prevent that from happening.It is similar to the type of thing that Russia has historically practiced along with their inclusion of espionage or trickery as an official military tactic, and the understanding that a large mine drilled in that area was reported to have been stopped when workers believed that it was a spiritual portal to hell.As for the people making decisions, the people convincing them to do that may have people in their ears who have money in their pockets and those are people who desire for it to remain that way. But people with that much money usually aren't satisfied with money. Look at how quickly Elon Musk and Donald Trump decided that they wanted to take over Greenland, Canada and Panama.

Per [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism), \\"Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \\"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall\\".\\"Personally, I think Trump doesn't meet all definitions of a fascist. The Wikipedia page above lists many definitions of fascism; some really don't feel like they apply to Trump (\\"prioritizing the nation over the individual\\"). Others apply only in part. For example, Umberto Eco has a 14-point list of properties of fascism; I'd say Trump meets maybe nine of those - things like machismo, contempt for the weak, enemies are \\"too strong and too weak\\", \\"obsession with a plot\\" (stop the steal), fear of difference. But he doesn't meet others (cult of tradition, anti-pacifism, etc.).But given all this, I don't think it's irresponsible to point out the many ways his ideas are similar to fascism.The problem with a Hitler comparison is, Hitler's worst deeds (e.g., Holocaust) are just so much worse than anything I think Trump might do. But Trump *does* do things that are generally connected to fascist ideology (e.g., \\"they're eating the cats\\" - blatant lies about outgroup members meant to stoke fear and hatred).","title":"CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about"},{"text":"I personally don't smoke since it can lead to a lot of negative health effects, but for people who do smoke that's their choice to do so.

Fires"},{"text":"There is much to be said for the  observation. The problem is there will always be some interpretation of the Constitution, even by well-intended people, that expands it beyond what we may interpret its limits to be.Take the Commerce Clause as an example. It was originally thought to be the means by which the central government insured the free flow of commerce from one state to another. But it has become the means by which the central government regulates almost every aspect of the economy. SCOTUS has put some limits on that but Congress continues to use the clause to justify nearly all of its economic interventions.You and I may interpret the Commerce Clause one way but others interpret it more expansively. Who is to say which interpretation is right or wrong other than the voters? And based on the outcome of elections for the last century, the voters accept the more expansive interpretation.Ultimately, the voters are supposed to have the final say in enforcing any constitution. The flaw in that is that voters can basically be bought. There really has to be a conflict between political entities which prevents either from expanding its power beyond the limits of a constitution. I suggest the federal arrangement of sovereign states and a central government was the Founders solution to create this political conflict and limit power.The problem is the states have also been bought, just like the voters. This is where the amendments in the link I posted come into play. They take multiple steps to restore the balance between the state and central governments in order to limit the latter.For example, deficit spending is extremely difficult. This makes buying voters and states more difficult.The Senate is restored to being a council of the states rather than a a body of older and richer people than the House.The central government is prohibited from bribing the states.The states have the limited ability to fully nullify federal laws.Together, these amendments create that political conflict necessary to bind government to within its constitutional limits.","title":"When the government has their boot on your neck, does it matter if its the right or left boot."},{"text":"She should have prosecuted him for treason on the campaign trail.Biden blew it by failing to prosecute.The DNC blew it by forcing 2 candidates on us against Medicare for All.","title":"How the Democrats Blew It.

The only so-called liberal media is MSNBC and that's only seen by a very small percentage of people. Next you've had right wing foundations that have spent the last 50 plus years slowly weakening the education system so that the average American has an IQ of under 100 and a reading level of 5 to 6th grade. You've eliminated the Fairness Doctrine so that so-called news channels don't have to present real facts from fake ones. There's a myriad of other factors involved but you can go through what happened from Biden not dropping out early enough to Harris being Black, Asian and female to a thousand other things but the reality is Republicans have ginned the system so that they only have to do a little bit right and Democrats have to have an Obama and do everything right to have a prayer of a chance. You could go down the list of so-called hot Democrats and I don't know if any of them had a year or two extra would have won as well.

The political organization in western countries can be labeled as [civic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism). I sometimes call them party autocracies. The representative \\"democracies\\" in western states ain't really democratic. In germany we have a strong political force called \\"social democracy\\" and this term makes no sense to me. A real democracy, interpreted literally, can't be unsocial. This hints to the fact that what we commonly label as democracy isn't really democratic. It's a lip service, like the values these systems associate themselves with. In general the main motivation of national states is to accumulate and centralize power on a national level, which is very, very far away from the people. The people in their (decentralized) communities are the origins, the sources of political organization. Nation states take the power to self-organize from the people and abstract it to a mich higher level. This is kinda similar to big corporations, which take decentralized resources and concentrate them in the form of money in the hand of a few people. If you criticize political system to be too centralized, you have to also take a look at how wealth is distributed and question that. I perceive a parallel here.I agree with you, but I still call it democracy. And if ought to be a real one, it must adhere to the [principle of subsidiarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity) and must include some form of grassroot elements. This necessarily includes a minimalistic state on national levels. Even though this principle is explicitly stated in many constitutions, it's completely uneffective, because the basic principle that guides western polticis is generally nationalism (maybe switzerland being among the few exception where not nationalism is the central political principle, but actually allowing room for regional self-determination and sub-national policies; I heard there are also some decentral political elements in the federal organization of the usa), that means an ever growing statism on national levels.","title":"Why the world slides Left and what to do about it"},{"text":"California has NEVER put in a bill (even as symbolic one) to secede.

And it comes down to communication.I want to draw parallels between 2 clear-cut policy areas.First, immigration. The entire narrative was spun and dominated by Trump. Harris had quite good policies, and it came down to \\"Let's stop people immigrating in the first place\\". But the entire platform got twisted by Trump into Harris being border czar (a made-up role), into Dems having an open border policy and that the whole great replacement theory. An area of total failure for the Democrats.The second, abortion. Abortion was clear, they stuck to the message. They didn't let themselves get bogged down in the nitty-gritty of 'well where does life begin??' - they simply supported *abortion* and didn't let the messaging around it get too twisted. This worked, it became a big point after RvW was overturned and helped avert a red wave in 2022. In 2025, it helped Harris keep the race close &amp; contested (even if she did lose).There are many other areas that can be used as examples. And there are many other reasons why the Democrats failed in 2024 (Picking Walz over Shapiro, Biden running in the first place, culture war) but communication is a big, big part.","title":"Have the past 10 years of Democratic politics been a disaster?"},{"text":"I noticed he also rammed up job creation to make it harder to make further rate cuts,","title":"Why is Biden making sure to escalate the Ukraine war right before Trump takes office?

The government identifying and removing Russian disinformation campaigns, for instance, is not about suppressing personal opinions or requiring \\"government approval\\" for every piece of information posted online. It's about protecting the integrity of our democratic processes and preventing foreign interference. Which, the US has utterly failed at.Your argument implies a false dichotomy. That either we have completely unregulated social media, where disinformation runs rampant, or we have a government that dictates what can and cannot be said. This is a simplistic and misleading view. In reality, there's a middle ground where social media platforms, with guidance from fact-checking organizations and regulatory bodies, can work to reduce the spread of harmful disinformation without infringing on individuals' right to free speech.It's also worth noting that the First Amendment does not protect speech that is intended to deceive or harm others. The Supreme Court has established that certain types of speech, such as defamation, obscenity, and incitement to violence, are not protected under the First Amendment. Coordinated disinformation campaigns aimed at undermining our democracy can be seen as a threat to national security and public safety, and thus, can be subject to regulation without violating the principles of free speech.Your question about who is the real threat to a free society is a clever attempt to deflect attention from the issue at hand. However, it's essential to recognize that the spread of disinformation, often facilitated by foreign actors, poses a significant threat to our democratic institutions and the integrity of our public discourse. By addressing this issue, we're not undermining freedom; we're protecting it from those who would seek to exploit and manipulate public opinion for their own nefarious purposes.","title":"Biden calls Meta's decision to end fact-checking 'really shameful'"},{"text":"??","title":"Trump can't get in office fast enough ??"},{"text":"Maybe the [governor next.](https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/article240434781.html)","title":"Petition for Urgent Recall of L.A.'s Democrat Mayor Hits 59,150 Signatures"},{"text":"askeconomics is probably one of the highest quality subreddits.

If you don't toe Trump's line, you will be punished.[Absurdly Weird](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdGOP/?f=flair_name%3A%22Absurdly%20Weird%22)# Trump is showing he intends to lead through intimidation and fear. Your political convictions will have no bearing on the matter.He and his band of thugs are considering allowing California's citizens burn to death in their homes if their elected governor and state officials refuse to acquiesce to their political demands.Even as the conflagration rages and citizens die gruesome deaths, threats are replacing compassion and ultimatums replacing empathy.Is this the government we voted for or were we deceived by tyrants?Not my word, Trump's. It's all written here:Los Angeles is still ablaze and being ravaged by a raft of unprecedented wildfires. And some Republicans see opportunities to settle scores and punish liberals by withholding crucial aid.At a September news conference, Trump floated the possibility of denying wildfire aid to California as president unless the states governor, Gavin Newsom, acquiesced to his policy demands. He said if Newsom doesnt come to heel, we wont give him money to put out all his fires. . And if we dont give him the money to put out his fires, hes got problems, Trump added. It was an explicit threat.Now, with fires raging, Trump and his allies  including Elon Musk  have waged a dubious misinformation war against Newsom, peddling fact-free propaganda blaming the governor, and liberals more broadly, for the ongoing tragedy. And in the midst of this conspiratorial blame game, Republicans are embracing the prospect of withholding vital aid. That includes far-right activist Charlie Kirk. As Media Matters noted, Kirk said Tuesday that Trump should withhold aid unless Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley  who, as the citys first openly gay fire chief, has garnered hatred from bigots looking to blame the fires on diversity measures  is fired.And when California, in a couple of weeks, comes crawling back for federal assistance, Trump should say, Listen, Im not gonna give you a dime unless you fire the lesbian Kristins, Kirk said.In a Fox Business interview Friday, Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio said disaster relief should be contingent on policy changes in California. If they want the money, then there should be consequences where they have to change their policies, he said, baselessly claiming that state officials have embraced policies that are making the problem bad or worse.Theres no evidence the fires were caused or exacerbated by Californias policies. In fact, Id argue its a climate-ignorant party that bows to Big Oil  such as Davidsons Republican Party  that bears some responsibility for what were seeing play out in California, given the GOPs refusal to adequately reckon with the reality of climate-related disasters. But this baseless notion that local or statewide mismanagement is to blame is quickly becoming a pretense for Republicans to ponder denying aid to California.On Thursday, Rep. Andy Harris told Newsmax that money for wildfire aid isnt a priority for Republicans because we just put more money into FEMA before we left for the Christmas holidays, and the Maryland Republican claimed that Los Angeles mishandled the fire department so egregiously that they ought to bear some of the burden for that rebuilding.In a time of crisis, Republicans are giving Americans  Los Angelenos in particular  a taste of the vengeful and overtly political behavior we can expect from the party in the years ahead.[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-sound-eager-to-deny-fire-aid-to-los-angeles/ar-BB1rflUO](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-sound-eager-to-deny-fire-aid-to-los-angeles/ar-BB1rflUO)?","title":"I got banned from..."},{"text":"The fact you dont know that speaks volumes.I'm sure you think so.","title":"Biden calls Meta's decision to end fact-checking 'really shameful'"},{"text":"Eat your own dogfood.","title":"Biden calls Meta's decision to end fact-checking 'really shameful'"},{"text":"Its hump day my dudes","title":"Biden just authorized $500 million in aid to Californians who lost everything in the fires.

Even a convicted felon, rapist, and friendly agent of Americas enemies**made possible by five corrupt Republicans on the Supreme Court, and it worked. Democrats were massively outspent, not to mention the power of the billionaire Murdoch familys Fox News and 1500 hate talk radio stations.They are responsible for our crises of gun violence, the drug epidemic, homelessness, political gridlock, our slow response to the climate emergency, a looming crisis for Social Security and Medicare, the situation on our southern border, even the lack of affordable drugs, insurance, and healthcare.Clarence Thomas and his wife have been accepting millions Sam Alito is also on the gravy train, and there are questions about how Brett Kavanaugh managed to pay off his credit cards and gambling debts. John Roberts wife has made over $10 million from law firms with business before the court; Neil Gorsuch got a sweetheart real estate deal; Amy Coney Barrett refuses to recuse herself from cases involving her fathers oil company.None of this is illegal because when five corrupt Republicans on the Court legalized members of Congress taking bribes they legalized that same behavior for themselves.Our modern era of big money controlling government began in the decade after Richard Nixon put Lewis Powell  the tobacco lawyer who wrote the infamous 1971 Powell Memo outlining how billionaires and corporations could take over America  on the Supreme Court in 1972.In the 200 preceding years  all the way back to the American Revolution of 1776  no politician or credible political scientist had ever proposed that spending billions to buy votes with dishonest advertising was anything other than simple corruption.The originalists on the Supreme Court, however, claimed to be channeling the Founders of this nation, particularly those who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, when they said that money is the same thing as free speech. In that claim, Republicans on the Court were lying through their teeth.In a letter to Samuel Kercheval in 1816, President and author of the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson explicitly laid it out:Those seeking profits, were they given total freedom, would not be the ones to trust to keep government pure and our rights secure. Indeed, it has always been those seeking wealth who were the source of corruption in government.Thus, today America has a severe problem of big money controlling our political system. And last night it hit its peak, **putting an open fascist in charge of our government*No other developed country in the world has this problem, which is why every other developed country has a national healthcare system, free or near-free college, and strong unions that maintain a healthy middle class.

Asked by USA Todays Susan Page whether he could have beaten Donald Trump if he had stayed in the race, Biden responded: Its presumptuous to say that, but I think yes.Reality thinks not.Of course, well never know for sure, but the evidence (including polling) suggests that he would have been crushed by an even larger margin than Kamala Harris was. Bidens answer is a reminder that his legacy will be tarnished by his fundamental misreading of the moment and his own role in it.To be sure, Biden can point to some impressive successes. He leaves behind a healthy and growing economy, a record of legislative accomplishment, and more than 230 judicial appointments, including a Supreme Court justice. And then there were the failures: the chaotic exit from Afghanistan; a massive surge of migrants at the border in 2023. Although Biden was not solely to blame for inflationfactors included the Federal Reserves low-interest-rate policy and Russias invasion of Ukrainehis spending policies contributed to the problem. And even though he rallied Europe to the defense of Ukraine, critics suggest that he also misread that momentPhillips Payson OBrien argued in The Atlantic in November that the Biden administration treated the conflict like a crisis to be managed, not a war to be won. Ukraines uncertain fate is now left to Bidens successor.A charismatic and energetic president might have been able to overcome these failures and win a run for reelection. Some presidents seize the publics imagination; Biden barely even got its attention. He presumed that he could return to a Before Times style of politics, where the president was a backroom bipartisan dealmaker. Whereas Trump dominated the news, Biden seemed to fade into the background almost from the beginning, seldom using his bully pulpit to rally public support or explain his vision for the country. Trump was always in our faces, but it often felt like Biden was  elsewhere.Biden also misread the trajectory of Trumpism. Like so many others, he thought that the problem of Trump had taken care of itself and that his election meant a return to normalcy. So he chose as his attorney general Merrick Garland, who seems to have seen his role as restoring the Department of Justice rather than pursuing accountability for the man whod tried to overturn the election. Eventually, Garland turned the cases over to Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought indictments. But it was too late. With time running out and a Supreme Court ruling in favor of broad presidential immunity, Trump emerged unscathed. And then came the sad final chapter of Bidens presidency, which may well overshadow everything else.When he ran for president in 2020, Biden described himself as a transition candidate and a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But instead of stepping aside for those younger leaders, Biden chose to seek another term, despite the growing evidence of his decline. With the future of democracy at stake, Bidens inner circle appeared to shield the octogenarian president. His team didnt just insist that voters ignore what was in front of their eyes; it also maintained that the aging president could serve out another four-year term. Some Democrats clung to denialand shouted down internal criticsuntil Bidens disastrous debate performance put an end to the charade.Even then, Biden stubbornly tried to hang on, before intense pressure from his own party forced him to drop out of the race in July. Now he is shuffling to the end of his presidency, already shunted aside by his successor and still in denial.As the passing of Jimmy Carter reminds us, presidential legacies are complicated matters, and it is difficult to predict the verdict of history. But as Biden leaves office, he is less a transformational figure than a historical parenthesis. He failed to grasp both the political moment and the essential mission of his presidency.Other presidents have misunderstood their mandate. But in Bidens case, the consequences were existential: By his own logic, the Prime Directive of his presidency was to preserve democracy by preventing Donald Trumps return to power. His failure to do so will likely be the lasting legacy of his four years in office.","title":"Bidens Tarnished Legacy"},{"text":"I'm all for the government identifying and removing Russian disinformation and disinformation campaigns from social media.","title":"Biden calls Meta's decision to end fact-checking 'really shameful'"},{"text":"Welcome to the libertarian movement, if you are somewhat new. When I see posts such as yours about finding the libertarian movement after being disillusioned by the left and right, it makes me glad to see you. But it also makes me want to make a few suggestions and observations.First, libertarian is not the part of a Venn diagram where the circle of the left and the circle of the right overlap. Instead, it ought to be considered as a completely altered way of thinking about the relationship between individuals and their relationship to government and the state.I would suggest that the basis of that thinking can loosely be defined as the non aggression principle, or NAP. But the NAP is not an absolute nor is it a perfect defining principle. But it ought to at the very least be considered a guide to how we all should think when considering those relationships described in the previous paragraph.For this reason, the libertarian movement is not a solid block of political principles. It contains a broad spectrum of thought that includes anarchists, voluntaryists, minarchists, monarchists, conservatarians and even some socialist-leaning libertarians, and probably more.Also, there is an economic aspect to the libertarian movement that often embraces the idea of free markets with little to no intervention in the market by the state. I would suggest that two schools of economic thought are the most common ones that are embraced by libertarians. These schools of economics are the Austrian and Chicago schools of economics but by no means are libertarian limited to these two schools of economics. The Chicago School is epitomized by economists such as Friedman, Stigler, maybe Sowell, et al. The Austrian School is epitomized by economists such as Hayek, Mises, and many more.Welcome to the libertarian movement and I would urge a deep dive into its history and guiding economic and philosophical principles.","title":"When the government has their boot on your neck, does it matter if its the right or left boot."},{"text":" Its too late for changing.It is not.

Not only does this mean more potential danger, but more smoke spreading across the county/state/country. The Palisades Fire was already climbing towards the I-405 to the east and Encino to the north, so evacs in those areas. Its very likely these are done as a massive precaution due to how the infrastructure of that area can only handle so much in a sudden evac situation, but the fact the flames and glow can be seen from the Valley is troublesome. It seems to be quickly making its way toward the Calabasas area as well. UCLA is on high alert. No news about either Getty building. As for the Eaton fire, the fuel is still plentiful and the canyons make it hard to strike easily. A lot of folks are worried about Mount Wilson Observatory, its possible it might not be there anymore. Over 7000 structures damaged with Eaton alone. Eaton is at over 14k, Pailsades at over 21k.Now, some good news: containment. WEVE REACHED DOUBLE DIGITS. Eaton is at 15% and Palisades is at 11%. Progress is being made. Multiple copters and other aircraft are basically crushing it with their attacks and preventative measures, especially over night. Westward progression seems to have slowed down as well. As for Eaton, numerous evac orders downgraded or lifted to the west and south (though outages and dont drink orders still in affect). The line has been held around communities well.As for other fires, great news around. Archer Fire 100% containment at 18 acres (no structures damaged if Im not mistaken). Lidia Fire 100% contained at 395 acres. Creek Fire 80% contained at 3 acres. Hurst Fire 76% contained at 799 acres. Kenneth Fire 50% contained at 1052 acres.Was a rough night for me trying to sleep, Ill say that. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We are all so very tired and just want to get on with our lives.

However, doesnt square with the history. Democrats have won national elections 3 times since Trump first stepped off the Golden Elevator. First, they won the House in 2018, when they promised bold action to hold a crackpot accountable. Second, they won the Presidency, House, and Senate in 2020, when they promised to: (i) employ incredible government action to end a once in a century pandemicwhich they beat, but didnt quite manage the economic fallout; (ii) attack student loan debtwhich Biden did an alright job despite the illiberal unelected 6 Justices blocking his attempts at every turn; (iii) employ broad government action to hold a man and party accountable for trying to overturn an electionwhich they miserably failed at; and (iv) a steady hand transition president who would for the first time in our lives cede power to a younger generationin hindsight, quite revolutionarybut he fell back on that promise until too late. Third, they kept midterm incumbent losses to a minimum in the House and held the Senate in 2022upon the promise to employ big government to address inflation and to protect individual freedoms, such as abortion. 21st Century Democrats succeed when they go big. Harriswho I quite admirecould not escape the establishment criticism from within the Party to draw together the Biden 2020 Coalition. Unfortunately, she was Biden-lite. Had she run on her quite successful imaginative and liberal experiences in the Senate and big government New Deal progressivism, as opposed to her record as an establishment Californian politician, as well as a Vice President to a very unpopular President, I do think she would have won.

The wealthy already pay the majority of income tax, and demanding they then hand it out to the \\"less fortunate\\" is basically asking them to be successful elsewhere. I'm self employed, I worked my ass off for 4 years while I watched my friends who enjoyed a salary working for someone else go on vacations, buy nice cars, live in nice homes, spoil their spouses and their children. No one was there for me during those 4 years offering to pay my hydro when my power was shut off, no one offered to pay for  my wife to go to the salon, no one offered to work 4 or 8 hours of the 16 hour work day I was working, and no one offered to work weekends for me when I wanted to spend time with my son. So what makes you entitled to share ANY of the profits I make or any other business owner? We worked our asses off, we suffered for years while you were enjoying your time off. Did you offer anything to a struggling business owner? Very unlikely.","title":"Gavin Newscum fakes a failed Joe Biden call to try and dodge a wildfire victim's questions."},{"text":"Holy shit what a fucking pick ??","title":"Tim Walz supports David Hogg for DNC Vice Chair"},{"text":"Dictators HandbookSeeing like a StateIndia after Gandhi","title":"r/neoliberal reading recommendations?"},{"text":"Trump should have been held accountable at either of his impeachments, and then in the courtBut Republicans have put party over country, and what George Washington warned us of has come true","title":"Biden says still pondering preemptive pardons, believes he could have beaten Trump in 2024"},{"text":"Not guns Germans and steel","title":"r/neoliberal reading recommendations?"},{"text":"It is a better book but The Selfish Gene is important in a historical way for science.

If further defence cooperation is even hinted by government as a possibility, it's extremely easy for opposition to use rhetoric essentially mounting to 'the founders of this nation didn't fight and die only for this to happen'. This is also emphasised by the fact that the early-20th century Irish republicanism movement was also somewhat entwined with various socialist movements so the rhetoric becomes even more opposed to UK-inclusive military alignments. But of course beyond that, it's simply more popular for a government to not spend money on defence if the public perceives they can do without it. The geographic convenience of being located as far as possible away from the EU's main adversaries and the general European complacency has added to a very docile stance in Ireland in terms of defence. In general, it's hard for any government to not kick the can down the road when it comes to addressing a long-term, complex problem, it's even harder when you can't sell the population of the benefits of doing so and it's even harder when it's antithetical to powerful emotional rhetoric.Of course, as an Irish person I don't agree with that and believe we should be doing more. A silver lining is that the awful state of our Defence Forces is becoming more widely acknowledged to the point that even the typical Irish citizen is finding it a farce.","title":"Ireland condemns NATO budget despite relying on its support"},{"text":"I'm sure they met up with their mutual friend Ari Emmanuel after","title":"Trump says he and Obama 'probably do' like each other"},{"text":"Its like Chappelles Show: Asteroid ComingBlack Presidents Fault","title":"Biden says still pondering preemptive pardons, believes he could have beaten Trump in 2024"},{"text":"Nice Futurama joke.","title":"U.S. Increases Reward For Venezuela's Maduro to $25 Million As It Condemns 'Repression and Illegitimate Claim to Power'"},{"text":" They could bomb the fires to try to take away their oxygen.Jesus you reminded of somethingWhen Australia was burning in 2020 the trees exploded like bombsIIRC eucalyptus were the worst","title":"Biden just authorized $500 million in aid to Californians who lost everything in the fires.

Time kill it and let it sit for months, years, and itll be so dry that you could set it off with a match stick.2. Heat. The hotter the heat, the faster the water inside the tree is evaporated, and the sooner the wood can burn.Know what a good source of heat is?Fire. Know what a good source of fire is? Dead, dry underbrush. If all that shit wasnt there to start the fire, either the fire wouldnt spread at all, or at the very least, fire crews would have time to contain it. Or, maybe it wouldnt start in the first place.I can throw my used Christmas tree in my fire pit and the fucker wont burn at all UNLESS I have a super hot raging fire already going, and even then it takes time for the water to boil out and the wood to dry enough to light.

But then-President Donald Trump reportedly nearly declined to approve federal aid because of the states political makeup.\\nTrump changed his mind, however, after he was shown voter registration data from Orange County where Republicans then had an edge over Democrats, Politico reported.\\nIn a phone call Thursday, Mark Harvey, who served as a special assistant to the president for matters related to domestic crisis at the time, confirmed to the Southern California News Group the exchange reported by Politico. The former National Security Council employee is among the more than 100 former Republican national security officials who have backed Vice President Kamala Harris in this election.\\nIn all, nearly 2 million acres burned in California in 2018 and 100 people died, according to Cal Fire. While Northern California was impacted the most, Southern California was hit with the Holy fire in August of that year, burning more than 23,000 acres in Orange and Riverside counties and destroying homes and cabins.\\nWe went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas  to show him these are people who voted for you, Harvey told Politico.\\nIn October 2018, 541,665 people (34.72%) in Orange County were registered Republican voters, 523,624 (33.56%) were registered Democrats and 429,675 (27.54%) were no party preference. Statewide, however, nearly 8.6 million (43.45%) registered voters in 2018 were Democrats, 5.4 million (27.52%) no party preference and 4.7 million (24.04%) were Republicans.\\nAs of Sept. 6, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in Orange County, 37.03% to 33.99%, with 22.77% of voters registered as no party preference. Southern California, and Orange County particularly, is home to multiple tight congressional races this year that will determine which political party controls the House in 2025.\\nA campaign spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.\\nBut last month, while in Southern California for a campaign fundraiser and press conference, Trump threatened to withhold firefighting funds from California if hes elected to the White House again.\\nIn 2018, he was also highly critical of California and its handling of wildfires.\\nI think California ought to get their act together and clean up their forests and manage their forests because its disgraceful, Trump said during an August 2018 Cabinet meeting.\\nSo I say to the governor or whoever is going to be the governor of California: You better get your act together, Trump said. Because California, were just not going to continue to pay the kind of money that were paying because of fires that should never be to the extent \\nThe Washington Post in 2018 reported that the then-presidents response to disasters was colored in red and blue, comparing his trips to the Gulf Coast and North Carolina after hurricanes to his criticism of California post wildfires. The report noted that Trump took to social media to criticize what he called Californias gross mismanagement of the forests, only acknowledging the victims 14 hours later.\\nAfter initially angering California officials with his social media response to the fires, Trump ultimately approved an expedited disaster declaration request.\\nRep. Katie Porter, D-Irvine, called the report about Trumps initial leanings on disaster relief for California abhorrent.\\nWhen Orange County needed help, Donald Trump left us to fend for ourselves, Porter said on X, formerly Twitter. Our leaders should look out for every person they represent, not just the people who voted for them.\\nIn recent days, Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration, including Harris, for its handling of the destruction in the southeast caused by Hurricane Helene.\\nHe has said, without evidence, that the Biden administration and Democratic officials were not helping people in Republican areas. At a rally in Michigan on Thursday, he claimed that the administration had no money to deal with the disaster because it had spent too much on migrants.\\nPresident Joe Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, lambasted Trump on Thursday.\\nYou cant only help those in need if they voted for you, Biden said on X. Its the most basic part of being president, and this guy knows nothing about it.\\nA glimpse into the future if we elect (Trump), said an X post from Newsom.\\nLast month, Trump was critical of both the state and federal governments for their handling of the reactivation of an ancient landslide complex on the Palos Verdes Penninsula. Speaking to reporters from his golf course on the cliffs of Ranchos Palos Verdes, Trump said officials were missing in action and called California a mess.So now what will be your excuse for plugging your ears and running away?","title":"Since the war started, the Biden admin and the Congress have sent more than $106 billion in assistance to Ukraine ($70bn in military aid and $33bn in financial assistance). \\nThe photo is Los Angeles, not Kyiv"},{"text":"Lots of democrats have shifted to the right recently, you're not alone.

If you cant objectively prove it was issued while you were serving as president, theres an excellent chance it wont be considered valid when you actually try and rely on it.Back in 2020, a few commentators floated the idea a secret Trump self-pardon. The problem was, Trump could just lie about it and write out a fake one on a napkin and claim it was written while he was on the toilet at the White House and he just forgot about it.Hell, Trump claimed in interviews that he declassified the documents he stole with his mind. Problem was, telepathic mind powers diverge *just slightly* from established procedure. So even if he could declassify them, he could never prove he did while president.Any gimmick you think of to help prove its validity while maintaining secrecy is going to be inherently flawed in some way. If youre relying on the self pardon to possibly stay out of prison, you want it to be bulletproof. Youd normally have no political future to think of, so why wouldnt you just do it out in the open? Youre already gambling by hoping to rely on a *self* pardon.

Furthermore it brings up in its China focused chapter how historically China never needed to care much about seafaring because of the grand canal providing the shipping route in the interior when united, though even more interestingly it brings up the point about the Song dyansty of how its economic prosperity and innovation can be tied to the fact that the Song after losing northern China had to maintian a much larger army and fortifications network against the new Jin dynasty in the north than if they had united all of China; which in turn meant the Song had to raise much more funds from a smaller less developed tax base, which in turn pushed the Song to invest in the Merchants and their martime trade to expand their sources of income to find the funds for their now necessary northern frontier defenses. Basically when China's Song dynasty came under the same pressures that under the multipolar system of Europe led to military and societal innovation out of necessity enduring, the two rival Chinese states now were forced to invest in continued innovation and tax collection improvement, where under unified Chinese dynasties there was a push for the ruling dynasty to basically lower tax revenues because the biggest enemies became itself where tax excemptions and such were a good source of political influence, because there was no longer a credible military threat able to threaten the hegemon's existence, as the hegemon basically controlled all the resources it could ever need such that it had no incentive to innovate because it could keep throwing resources at a problem. This is unlike smaller competitive states where limited resources need to be used as efficiently as possible.   \\n Also this Song Chinese sections of the book has made me absolutely hate the Mongols and Kublai Khan, because they ruined China by reuniting itThere is also the interesitng point of how exploration was driven by competitive multi state political environment, as where the Phoenecian city states established massive trade networks in the Eastern Mediterranean and supposedly sailed around Africa. The Greeks city states took over this trade network and in turn set up colonies in both the Western Mediterranean creating the foundations for Rome, as well as the Black sea, compared to Rome which in its hegemony had no desire to invest in the navy after defeating the Carthagenians due to there being noone able to compete with it. In addition it brought up how Rome had more than easy access to spices from India because through its sheer size it was able to bully a red sea coastal kingdom into letting it trade through the Red sea at a reasonable price so Rome had no need to sail around Africa to get access to spices, compared to early modern Europe where the Venetian monopoly over the spice trade in the aftermath of the fall of constantinople (The Genoan route via the Black sea was now in not subject to Ottomans control) resulted in the Portuguese and Spanish deciding to search for a new route to India via two separate routes that led to human history's two most significant naval expeditions, which was because the Europeans competed with each other. Furhter more to this the fact there were competing European states meant ideas and such could move between states and it was due to this that Columbus in the first place was able to present his idea to several monarchs until the Spanish decided to sponsor him following several rejections. That's basically a sumamry of the entire book in good part, but I 100% recommend reading it as it provided me alone with a whole new perspective on history, as well as proving a great source of inspiration for my worldbuilding of an Earth that spins the opposite direction resulting in quite altered climates (the US south being a desert with the Mississippi being one of two new nile rivers, while Sahara and Arabia are just green)","title":"r/neoliberal reading recommendations?"},{"text":"Shhhh israel needs more sniper bullets to kill children with","title":"Biden just authorized $500 million in aid to Californians who lost everything in the fires.

One notable point of the book and the reason why I found this book in the first place (r/AskHistorians question about Roman bureaucracy) was because is the fact that Rome never built a robust bureaucracy like China which helps explain the inability of Roman successor states to reunite Europe, as there simply wasn't much bureaucracy to just take over as result of Rome never establishing anything concrete, with based on my further reading Rome being an empire built around a vassal state structure that emerged from the Roman origins of winning over Italian states by vassalizing them for mainly manpower rather than a centralized bureaucracy like China built around the need to support an army able to oppose the nomads.","title":"r/neoliberal reading recommendations?"},{"text":"Nah.

The first symptoms of disinformation are emerging on the social media network Bluesky, with echoes of the pro-Russian \\"Matryoshka\\" campaign that flooded Elon Musk's X -- but with a few twists. The @antibot4navalny collective, which specialises in tracking influence operations, revealed the extent of the so-called \\"Russian doll\\" campaign last year. In recent weeks, there are indications of a similar phenomenon on the new US network Bluesky, which claimed to have some 26 million users by the end of December last year, many of them disillusioned former members of X. The data, analysed by AFP, show dozens of posts with a similar pattern, consisting of calling out media asking them to verify disinformation. The twist is that on Bluesky, as well as sometimes imitating content from media outlets, certain posts use artificial intelligence to impersonate universities. In essence, the aim seems always the same: to present Russia in a favourable light, while criticising Western support for Ukraine and often castigating a favourite target -- French President Emmanuel Macron. The accounts used have all the characteristics of pro-Russian \\"bots\\" -- fake profiles used to artificially increase the visibility of posts, argued Eliot Higgins, the co-founder of open-source investigation group Bellingcat, last month. **- Academic deepfakes -** Using data collected by @antibot4navalny, AFP pinpointed about 50 \\"Matryoshka\\" posts. Most simply republished messages already on X but the collective also spotted posts first on Bluesky, which has become a haven for many users unhappy with the former Twitter. Valentin Chatelet, research associate for security at the Atlantic Council's digital forensic research lab, said: \\"The operation is trying to test its efficacy in reach and assess how much and how fast it is going to be taken down.\\" Peter Benzoni, investigative data and research analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, said the aim of pretending to be universities could be \\"an appeal from authority... adapted to Bluesky's audience\\". In one doctored video, a professor at Aix-Marseille University in southern France talks about \\"numerous errors in the organisation of the Olympic Games\\" linked to difficulties of \\"the French economy\\". The caption suggests it is because of \\"sanctions against Russia\\". The video is a deepfake whose audio has been manipulated. AFP found the original video that was broadcast at the end of October on the university's Instagram account. The law professor makes no mention anywhere of the French economy and was reviewing his university department's year in 2024. Dozens of other videos use a similar staging, with an expert facing the camera and the logo or the name of the university. After a few sentences, illustrations follow using images from the media or stockshots. In another example shot on the campus of Sunderland University in northeast England, students and teachers supposedly give their opinion on Russia in glowing terms. The video is again fake. In the original, which AFP has seen, Russia is not mentioned at all. **- 'Industrialised' fakes -** \\"This indicates that the campaign has managed to industrialise its manufacturing of deepfake voiceovers, which echoes a trend that is common among various Russian-sponsored disinformation operations,\\" said the Atlantic Council's Chatelet. He likened it in particular to influence campaigns such as \\"Doppelganger\\", which works by copying Western media internet sites. The @antibot4navalny collective has shared a list of accounts spreading disinformation on Bluesky, and called on users to report them. AFP noted that the majority of publications singled out were deleted from the platform, which encourages users to report problematic content and claims to be actively committed to tackling disinformation. In 2023, Bluesky moderators said they had processed more than 358,000 reports. Chatelet said that the social network, which did not respond when contacted by AFP, was \\"aware of the problem and that the community of fact-checkers and open-source researchers is already investigating and reporting this content to prevent its virality\\". Its efforts \\"are rather efficient at deplatforming the operation\\", he added but said it remained \\"very much 'reactive'. \\"Bluesky has yet to prove that it can proactively take down this operation,\\" he said.!ping FOREIGN-POLICY&amp;EUROPE&amp;TECH","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Id argue that American voters have been falling for lies since 1796. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1796_United_States_presidential_election?wprov=sfti1","title":"CMV: the world is fucked and I'm all here for it."},{"text":"Just look up the term ͥư (home bar) on Dianping.For those of you playing at home, Dianping is Chinese Yelp.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Theyre not.

If more people continue to choose apathy, American fascism, which is a belief a minority of Americans voted for and a much smaller minority of Americans understand they voted for and actually want, will continue to take root and grow strong. Now is not the time for apathy in those Americans who see this issue for what it is. We must not join the apathetic because the consequence is not \\"watching the world burn.\\" It is burning.

On DEI/Woke firefighters - Queer, brown, immigrant, intersex, Muslim and hijabi, natural hair or pink, disabled, whatever. If they're a warm body with a pulse, can pick up a hose and slip into fire retardant, or co-ordinate a Cordon... They're needed. A person who can only do one job, a deaf stocktaker, a blind waterboy handing out sandwiches and water bottles, a paraplegic dispatch caller, if they're filling a role, what does that mean?That means one more role is filled and allows another full bodied person can be shifted for another, more responsive and reactive duty in a wildfire.The fire won't care, why should we?2. Privatised firefighting units... what the fuck? And not merely the dystopian exclusivity classism element. Leave that aside for a moment. my opinion is this - the flames don't give a shit about your assets, liquidity or credit score or balance sheet. Paddock, bush, mansion, shack, unless it's contained and smothered, the fires come for everyone from rough wild bush to manicured hedgerowed lawn. It comes for everyone, so everyone with a pulse is needed for it, down to the person doing 10 hours evacuation notice runs and the people holding a hose for 8 hours straight and the high schoolers and college boys and girls establishing fire breaks, cordons and controlled burns.Before the blanket of ash, REALLY rip through, and when it hits that critical mass that embers pick up in the wind, it leapfrogs postcodes and outruns evacuating convoys and sprays on everything dry and flammable, and when the embers collectively falls, it heats the surrounds and dries it like an oven and falls down on somewhere that's been baking for hours or days from radiating heat and the columns of rolling smoke arrives... It won't stop until it hits the coast and riverbanks, if it doesn't outright fly over it, the wind dies down and more fronts are contained, or it starts to rain and thunder hard... or simply burns and eats through everything that could be burned. !ping AUS","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"What makes you think we all know that 99% of reddit is super liberal?I only realized when I started using it regularly.

Im not disputing the reality of the state of gender dysphoria or the medical recognition of its treatment. The issue I'm raising is whether gender identitya subjective self-declared experiencecan or should be treated as legally interchangeable with biological sex in frameworks designed specifically around objective, immutable characteristics, like Title IX protections.\\nAutism has been medically recognized since the?1940s?and has undergone?decades of scientific research?with?observable diagnostic criteria?based on neurological patterns. It's classified as a?neurodevelopmental condition?with standardized diagnostic tools like the?DSM-5?and?ICD-10, making it objectively measurable.In contrast,?gender identity?is a?self-declared, subjective experience?that lacks the same objective diagnostic framework. While gender dysphoria is a medically recognized condition,?gender identity itself?(as a personal sense of one's gender) does not have the same measurable, neurological basis as autism.?\\nThe idea that this position \\"feeds conservative fear narratives\\" misrepresents the point. Protecting sex-based rightslike women's spaces and fairness in sportsdoes not equate to erasing trans rights. Both groups deserve protections, but merging subjective identity into laws originally meant for biological protections creates conflicting outcomes that need to be addressed, not avoided.If cis women are being falsely accused of being trans, that's an enforcement failure, not a reason to dismantle the clarity of sex-based protections. My position is focused on legal stability and fairness for all, not exclusion or fear-mongering.","title":"Judge strikes down Biden's Title IX expansion to LGBTQ+ students"},{"text":"Danes might actually like the idea of having a tropical destination they can vacation in without the hassle of customs, passports, currency exchange, etc., kind of like how Canada has occasionally flirted with the idea of incorporating Turks and Caicos.(But that being said, the whole Canada/T&amp;C thing has mostly been idle talk, so maybe the benefits don't outweigh the costs)EDIT: oops, just noticed someone else made this exact same point further down in the discussion ...","title":"Why a Danish purchase of the US Virgin Islands could be the deal of the century"},{"text":"On the contrary, I think it is.

They lost two winnable elections and watched the party apparatus press their thumb on the scale since 2016. Im not going to turn this into a Bernie Bro lamentation, but its quite rich and ironic that the Democratic party, keyword: Democratic, is less internally democratic than the Republican Party. You didnt see the Republican internal caucus throw super delegates into the mix or have every 4+ candidates drop out on the same day before Super Tuesday to endorse one candidate. Im relatively young, in my 20s and Ive never voted for an R ever. Midterm or not. I voted for the liberal candidate I didnt want every time. My state is also late in the primary cycle and its always been decided by the time I get to vote, but thats another gripe I have with the primary system. Going full circle, Democrats have lost two winnable elections to Trump both times. Alright, we cant change the past. How do Democrats self-reflect? They go on and elect an old man with lung cancer to a committee seat over a young woman and go on as if they scraped their knee. Rest assured, Democrats will stick to a losing strategy.

The government always seems to have billions of dollars ready to send abroad  to Ukraine, to military operations, to foreign governments. But when it comes to helping its own citizens during disasters, suddenly the budget is 'tight,' and the aid is 'complicated.' Why is that? Could it be that there's a bigger agenda at play here?**Think about it. For decades, the U.S. has been involved in conflicts and crises around the globe. It's not about peace, democracy, or humanitarian aid  it's about control, influence, and power. The government prioritizes countries that serve their geopolitical interests. Ukraine isn't getting $500 million for 'freedom'  they're getting it because of the chessboard of global politics. Meanwhile, Californians who lost their homes to wildfires are left with nothing but thoughts and prayers.And heres another theory to chew on: what if natural disasters like these wildfires aren't entirely 'natural'? We've seen a rise in talks about weather manipulation technologies, like HAARP and other secret government projects that supposedly have the power to influence weather patterns. Could it be that some of these disasters are intentional? A way to push people out of certain areas, control land, or even distract the population from larger issues?Its easy to dismiss these ideas as 'conspiracy theories,' but the patterns are too consistent to ignore. The government always finds money for war and foreign influence. But when it comes to helping Americans in need? Suddenly, there's nothing left in the budget.

The research demonstrates that when Americans trade gas-powered cars for electric ones, everybody breathes cleaner air. The University of Toronto team looked at two possible futures. In one, we keep driving regular cars that get more efficient over time; in the other, all new vehicles sold by 2035 are electric, matching goals set by several countries, including Canada. Electric cars cut down on nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and tiny particles that hurt our lungs and hearts. These pollutants hit lower-income neighborhoods particularly hard, so switching to electric vehicles could help create healthier communities across the board. \\"Internal combustion vehicles produce many air pollutants that have a significant, quantifiable impact on public health,\\" said Professor Marianne Hatzopoulou, who helped lead the study. \\"When we talk about electric cars, people often think about fighting overheating first. But clearing up other types of air pollution matters just as much for our health.\\" The money saved from fewer doctor visits and hospital stays adds up fast: between $84 billion and $188 billion by 2050. That's real cash back in American pockets, plus the gift of cleaner air for our kids and grandkids. But we need clean electricity powering those cars to see the full benefits. If power plants keep burning dirty fuels, we could lose anywhere from $32 billion to $71 billion. Thankfully, the U.S. is already moving toward renewable energy, making electric cars an even more intelligent choice for our health and wallets. The researchers point out that electric cars work best as part of a bigger picture. Walking more, biking, public transit, and building homes closer together help create healthier cities. But right now, choosing an electric car is one of the simplest ways families can save money while making their neighborhoods healthier.!ping ECO&amp;HEALTH-POLICY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"NATO should switch the SU-57 call sign to Donald Trump","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Lol this NCRI \\"study\\" is the biggest bullshit ever.

Here are my completely anecdotal input:The country is way more conservative and old-fashioned than most would realize. At the same time, it has way harsher working conditions than most realize. It has absolutely insane standards for both men and women. Women are sexualized to a pretty wild degree (not quite as much as, say, something like Japan, but still pretty out there).It's really both genders having pretty crazy, and dare I say mostly unrealistic, wants for their partner. Men are supposed to be tall, super good looking, gentlemen, popular, and very wealthy. Women are supposed to be even more crazy good looking, sweet and innocent, still wild in bed, and also come from an upper class family. These seem to be the standards no matter what standard the person looking for a partner themselves live up to.There is a crazy amount of plastic surgery going on. There is so crazy much focus on wearing the correct popular type of clothes (to the point where you can really see people walking around in almost exactly the same outfit as others, pretty constantly). Money and status seems very important. Saw so so so many would-be influencers and people taking Instagram photos (of themselves, of friends, etc.).The objectification of women was pretty wild. I don't think I really saw any representation of a woman that wasn't basically \\"you're supposed to be thin, beautiful, big tits, tiny waist, perfect skin, charming and sweet, fashionable, and subservient\\". The whole K-Pop industry only seemed to fuel this even more - which, by the way, is everywhere.South Korea has done a really really good job at fixing it's image for internationals. But dive into some of the scandals the country has had, and you'll find some absolutely extreme cases of insanity - such as a grade schooler getting raped by 30 classmates, while younger brother was beaten up next to her, and only 3 people convicted, and her own name leaked to the press. Was around 20 years ago. Or the woman from Tibet (I think? Can't quite remember) who was locked up in a mental asylum because she couldn't speak Korean, and didn't have her ID on her when police stopped her, so they assumed she was insane. She got 20k USD in damages, after being locked up for 6 years. There are just so so so many cases of women being treated pretty horrifically.I saw extremely few foreign/Korean couples, and the foreigners I talked to mostly didn't have good luck in dating. There were a few exceptions, but generally speaking, there didn't seem to be a lot of romantic mingling going on.Dating seemed... strange. It was like everyone just wanted to a prize to show off in public. Hell, one Korean dude even literally told me that's what \\"women here want\\".All in all, dating seemed pretty toxic for a lot of people. Obviously not for everyone, but for a lot. Massive gender gap in a lot of areas, with generally unrealistic expectations from both sides.The low birthrate started making a lot more sense.","title":"Korean men are one factor in low birthrate, says demographics expert"},{"text":"this is so funny to watch, I hope this is real that they had a healthy conversation","title":"AI enhanced accurate lip reading of Trump &amp; Obama"},{"text":"The only way I could hate this any more than I do is if he'd backed a conservative instead","title":"Tim Walz backs David Hogg for DNC vice chair"},{"text":"Make Cost-U-Less great again.","title":"Why a Danish purchase of the US Virgin Islands could be the deal of the century"},{"text":"Yup, blame all on \\"Ukraine\\" and keep the fire hydrants dry and water supply being owned by private companies, with underfunded and understaffed fire department in the area that even insurers try to get reinsured and you'll see even bigger fires, I guarantee you.
