If not, the first link is to the study itself. Researchers are continuing to research this topic but Florida and Ohio were honed in on because of the availability of voter data, which is less accessible elsewhere. Now, personally, I'm not suggesting that its true or I buy into the idea that it will affect this election. My opinion is strictly, i don't know one way or the other but based on the available data, it's not a topic that can be discounted by any means. The reasons why deaths weree higher in these states were the same reasons that deaths were higher amongst republicans across the country and that is 1, republicans weree far less likely to be vaccinated when it became available. And 2, they also had very different behaviors regarding the pandemic, specifically around social distancing, wearing masks and washing ones hands regularly. There is other research out there to corroborates the first stufy I linked above. As I'm not making this argument, I'm not going to pull it all up, but I promise a few Google searches will get you there. However, in my search to find that last paper, I did find another interesting study, which I'm happy to share. This is from the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/political-ideology-of-u-s-elected-officials-linked-with-covid-19-health-outcomes/) and here are their key findings. Higher exposure to political conservatism (measured by voting records of federal elected representatives and state-level political power) was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates and greater stress on ICU capacity.Republican-led states with political \\"trifectas\\" (governor, house, and senate under Republican control) had 11% higher mortality rates compared to Democratic trifectas. Conservative-leaning districts saw 26% higher mortality rates, even after adjusting for factors like vaccination rates and social characteristics.The study highlights that beyond individual political leanings, the political environment and decisions made by elected officials contributed to worse health outcomes in conservative regions.The relevance of these studies to swing states lies in the fact that political ideology, particularly the divide between conservative and liberal approaches to public health, had significant effects on COVID-19 mortality rates and vaccine uptake, even though the studies did not focus specifically on swing states.Swing states often experience intense political competition, which can amplify the effects of political messaging and polarization. In these states, the difference between Republican and Democratic approaches to public health (mask mandates, social distancing and vaccination) can lead to more pronounced disparities in health outcomes. As seen in the Harvard study, areas with higher exposure to conservative political environments had higher COVID-19 mortality rates, a dynamic that could be mirrored in ideologically split swing states?Swing states often have significant populations from both political spectrums, which can lead to variability in vaccination rates and adherence to public health measures. Studies like the Ohio and Florida research showed that lower vaccination rates among Republicans led to higher excess deaths. In swing states, where both parties have strong footholds, these divisions could impact not just public health but also voter turnout and political attitudes, especially if higher death rates disproportionately affect one side. Higher mortality rates and lower voter turnout in Republican-leaning areas (as a result of COVID-19 outcomes) may influence the electoral dynamics in swing states. For instance, in states like Florida, Ohio, or Pennsylvania, where margins are tight, demographic changes caused by excess deaths could shift the political landscape. In swing states, where every vote counts, the politicization of public health (vaccines, mandates) could have a polarizing effect on voters. Swing state residents may face conflicting messages from state and local leaders, creating confusion and contributing to lower adherence to health guidelines, as seen in areas where partisan divides are sharperAgain, I'm not making that argument. I'm only asserting that the idea is both relevant and cannot be discounted. Specifically because these trends know no boundaries. They didn't affect the entire country except for the 7 pivotal swing states, rather it applies to the country as a whole. Like you, I'd love to see data from the swing states but voter data is harder to access iiuc. I'm not suggesting research from those states don't exist either, only that if they do that I'm not aware of them. At the same time. There is enough data from around the country that makes a pretty compelling argument that the data from swing states would likely be similar.","title":"Kamala Harris campaign is falling rapidly behind Donald Trump, 3 new polls show"},{"text":"Funny how he is campaigning in California then left his supporters stranded in the desert in the night for a few hours.

And legal tests being unable to discern real from fake is the only way that a video showing an event could be fake even when it's real (thus creating plausible deniability). So long as real videos can be verified as real and fakes can be identified, then so long as the video in question has undergone investigation, there is no plausible deniability. Put simply, if those legal tests work, there is no plausible deniability. Only if they can be fooled is there plausible deniability.I mean, imagine a 17 year old kid who has means, motive and opportunity to kill their stepdad and the only indemnifying evidence is a video they filmed of themselves at the time of the murder that _cannot be verified to be real,_ getting put away for most of their life based on circumstantial evidence and the testimony of their mother who wants them gone.Or a rapist going free because he left no forensic evidence that was still present at the time the victim came forward and the only evidence placing him anywhere near the crime scene or the victim is video footage, which again, _cannot be verified to be real._ I don't think it's going to happen, but if it does, it'll be a very bad thing. Far more people are victims, culprits, suspects or witnesses of crimes where video evidence is used at trial than are victims of revenge porn. Overall, it'll cause more suffering than good.

Isn't that an argument for disregarding polls this year?","title":"Kamala Harris campaign is falling rapidly behind Donald Trump, 3 new polls show"},{"text":"ChatGPT even calls you hyperbolic, hilarious:1. The Party of Slavery and Party Switch\\t?\\tConservatives and slavery: Its true that Southern Democrats in the 19th century were generally pro-slavery, but its misleading to label them simply as conservatives without noting that the conservative-liberal divide of the time does not align cleanly with modern definitions. The Democratic Party of the 19th century (particularly in the South) was deeply conservative regarding social issues, especially slavery, but the labels of Democrat and Republican didnt have the same ideological connotations as today.\\n\\t?\\tThe shift in party ideologies: The transformation of the Democratic and Republican parties was gradual. The Southern Democrats were, indeed, pro-slavery, but following the Civil Rights era, there was a shift, with the Republican Party appealing to Southern whites through the Southern Strategy, leading to a realignment. However, this doesnt mean the parties switched entirely but rather that certain voting blocs realigned. Republicans of Lincolns era favored a strong federal government, but they werent modern liberals.\\n\\t?\\tThe Southern Strategy: This was a critical factor in the Republican Partys shift to appeal to Southern white conservatives post-1964, but it didnt represent the totality of the Republican Party at the time. Nixon, for instance, pursued policies that supported civil rights, even as his rhetoric appealed to racial anxieties.2. Conflating Evangelicals, Confederacy, and Modern Republicans\\t?\\tConfederate symbols and the Republican Party: While its true that some conservative elements, especially in the South, have embraced Confederate imagery, this is not universally representative of the Republican Party. Many Republicans and conservatives oppose Confederate symbols as well. Be cautious not to overgeneralize this point.\\n\\t?\\tEvangelicals and the moral majority: The rise of the Christian right and groups like the Moral Majority in the 1970s played a significant role in aligning religious conservatives with the Republican Party. But evangelical support for conservative causes doesnt equate with Confederate sympathies. The linkage is more about religious and social conservatism than any pro-slavery sentiment.\\n\\t?\\tModern conservative policies and racism: You mention that Republicans have revived Jim Crow-era policies, which is an extreme claim. While its true that some conservative policies on criminal justice, voting, and economic matters have had disparate impacts on communities of color, drawing a direct line to Jim Crow laws is likely to be seen as hyperbolic. Policies around race and economic inequality are complex and often reflect broader socio-economic dynamics rather than explicit racial intent.3. Law and Order, Crime, and Racial Dog Whistles\\t?\\tDog whistles and conservative rhetoric: Youre right that phrases like Law and Order and tough on crime were often used as coded language to appeal to fears about race. However, these policies were also supported by many Democrats in the 1990s (e.g., the 1994 Crime Bill). Overstating that only conservatives or Republicans used this rhetoric could weaken your argument, as figures like Bill Clinton were heavily involved in promoting tough-on-crime policies.\\n\\t?\\tRace and the criminal justice system: While many conservative policies exacerbated racial disparities, its worth noting that bipartisan support for some of these measures complicates the narrative. For example, Democratic leaders also played a role in shaping the War on Drugs and other policies that disproportionately affected black communities.4. Economic Policies and Race\\t?\\tRace-based economic disparities: Your point about economic policies contributing to racial wealth gaps and redlining is valid. However, its important to acknowledge that these policies were enacted over many decades by politicians from both parties, not exclusively conservatives or Republicans. Redlining, for instance, was rampant under both Democratic and Republican administrations.\\n5. Historical Oversimplifications\\t?\\tSlavery and the Bible: While some southern pro-slavery advocates used biblical justification, many northern Christians and abolitionists also used Christianity to argue against slavery. The religious argument was not exclusively pro-slavery.\\n\\t?\\tThe Republican party in the early 20th century: Its worth noting that the Republican Party, up until the mid-20th century, was actually quite progressive on civil rights issues (e.g., Eisenhower sending federal troops to enforce desegregation). The full shift of the parties on civil rights wasnt complete until after the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.6. Republicans Today and Black Voters\\t?\\tBlack voters and party loyalty: You mention that Republicans have been inattentive to the needs of black communities, which is a widely accepted argument. However, its worth noting that some prominent black conservatives argue that Democratic policies have harmed black communities by fostering dependency on social welfare programs.\\n\\t?\\tVoter suppression: Your argument touches on voter suppression (although not by name), a major topic in discussions about Republican strategies today. Republicans defend their voting laws as measures to ensure election integrity, while critics argue they disproportionately affect minority communities.7.

The advice I have received, unsolicited, in the past week:* Join a dance class for a style of dance that you hate, this will help you meet women. No, not salsa, bachata, or swing, which you like and already go to classes and socials for- go to hip-hop classes. Hip-hop, which I dislike, and which can only be done in a club- a place which I dislike. This is the awful advice of \\"go to dance class to meet women\\" which never works out. * Flirt with bartenders. I know a couple of the bartenders at that bar outside of their jobs, and one of them told him \\"that's not a good idea,\\" which I agreed with. Every bartender that I know dislikes being flirted with. Also, I don't believe in flirting with people whose jobs require them to be nice to me while they're at work.* Don't wear flannel anymore, even though I've been told that I look good in it and I like wearing it. The girl who told me this lives in Vegas, not the Midwest, and she has a preference in men who look different than me. Which is fine, but I'm never going to be a \\"light-skin pretty boy\\" (her words) like the men she prefers so I'm not sure what her advice matters for. (She's black, which i think makes \\"light-skinned\\" more appropriate for her to say? Not sure, kinda don't care much tbh.)* Don't ever bring up that I play the banjo, even if it's relevant. It makes me \\"seem like a dweeb.\\"* When asked if I had a type and replying \\"no, not really\\", being told \\"I should find a type and be more picky.\\" I still don't know what the fuck that means. From more than this past week:* This one is from a year ago, but getting told that you \\"have to be meaner to women\\" if you want to date them. Be intentionally mean at times in order to get them to be interested in you. He said you \\"have to treat them like crap sometimes at first.\\" I don't talk to this guy when I see him out, I lost respect for him after that.* Go to a dance class. I already do this. It is fun, but women don't dance as much as men do. Also, I don't do this shit to meet women- if I did I would have quit by now, since I've been doing it over a year and haven't met any women from it (which again, wasn't the goal). If someone had given me this advice as a way to meet women, then it would have been bad advice.

Him saying I should flirt with bartenders, when I personally know two of the bartenders (we have interacted outside of their jobs) and the one in front of us hates being flirted with at work. I told him \\"I dont flirt with anyone who is required to be nice to me,\\" to which the bartender says \\"yeah, smart.\\" He says \\"well, not flirting in that way. You're such a nice young man.\\" And I'm thinking... dude, can you stop with this shit? Flirting with serving staff is dumb and kinda rude and disrespectful. Edit: Also, I'm not going to take dating advice from a man who is going through a divorce.The next night I had a woman who I had started flirting with (and eventually stopped flirting with when I realized that we were incompatible in many ways, including having incompatible views on relationships) give me unsolicited dating advice. Asking \\"what is your type?\\" And telling me that I should \\"be more picky\\" when I said that I didn't have a type. She also said that I shouldn't wear flannel, which ticked me off since it's just her generalizing a preference. Edit: Also, I'm not going to take dating advice from a woman who claims that she can never get out of the \\"talking stage\\" after 3 months and who talks about how men don't want to pay for her to get nails done- that is such a strange experience which tells me that she's dating people who are so alien to me that we live in different worlds. And that's me being charitable.I straight up do not bring up dating in conversations with random people at all. I know this is hard to believe, but I don't.

For example, he was *actually* selected by the king instead of the current legal fiction where the monarch just happens to always pick the person who has a majority in the Commons. Likewise, the king selected the other ministers in Walpole's government. Similarly, now the PM is always First Lord of the Treasury, but Pitt (1766-68) wasn't. Grenville (1763-65) was straight up dismissed by the king, it didn't have anything to do with losing a confidence vote.

I do not deny that. We see very clearly which populations in the world are the most suited for develop liberal social democracies. Time and time again do nations without an Indo-European majority fail to produce a successful liberal social democracy. East Asia as a whole also cannot be called a liberal social democracy, as they diverge in several way. It is for the best that people thinking doing the same thing will result in a different outcome. Sameness is indeed not the full scope of the issue. Some genes are a lot more important than others when it comes to determining which populations will have the right mindset and inclinations to develop a specific type of society. But each population cluster will still have its own optimal society, and *on average*, having the same genes will result in it being better to develop a society with more cohesion and prosperity. While oil does help the Gulf Nations a lot, it is their systems of absolute monarchies and rigid social order that has allowed them to convert their natural resources into tangible wealth and economic activity within their nations, which many resource rich nations have failed to do. What works in the Gulf may not work in Europe or Africa. Ideally, genetic homogeneity should be promoted using non-coercive measures. Awareness of the fact alone would do much to meditate the issues faced by minorities in Western Nations. Immigration to more genetically similar nations should be encouraged on the basis of improving those nations. Developed nations should cease to interfere with the affairs of Developing Nations unless specially asked to do so.","title":"CMV: The effectiveness of public policy within a society is dependent on the collective genetics of the inhabitants.

Actually, yeah, holy shit the afterlife is horrible.But I guess only some people stay there indefinitely? Like, the ultimate destination for everyone except suicide victims (and maybe some others, unclear) is to get shipped off to hell or Elysium or wherever youre sorted to.Wait, is the *entire world* we see in the afterlife just one big waiting room? That would explain why there are always only a few people in the waiting room we see even though theres a looooooong wait to be seen. Some new arrivals tend to kind of hang out in the mini waiting room for a bit because they dont know what else to do yet, but they eventually wander off into the wider world to get a job or something and are replaced by other new arrivals. So weve never actually seen anyone from any of the final afterlives. Theyve never come back. So yeah, pretty much everyone except the civil servants who committed suicide do eventually move on from that world. Or maybe some can choose to stay behind indefinitely if they want to and are capable of providing for themselves. Maybe thats the case with Betelgeuse himself. Or maybe the wait time is just that long, so long that a guy who lived through the Black Plague, along with some ancient figures from even older periods of history iirc, is still in line, and the ending of the first Beetlejuice was just him getting sent to the back of the line for dying again.And thats only the ones that for whatever reason dont stay on Earth for a while as ghosts (surely not every dead person has to stay behind and haunt for a hundred years of whatever, or there would be a FUCKTON of ghosts EVERYWHERE doing ALL SORTS of highly noticeable shit). Ghosts that are required to haunt a place only visit the afterlife we see on an as-needed basis, and when their haunting assignment is finished, they move straight to their final afterlives.Am I on to something?

This is based on the time when I was a trump supporter, this was in 2015-2016 when I was 15/16 and I got super influenced by online memes and YouTube videos, as well as my teachers/community which was quite right wing. I know it may seem like a bad comparison but I don't think it's unfair to compare the intellect of most trump supporters to teenagers. Anyway, when I was 17, I was more and more exposed to other worldviews both online and in life, and I started to turn away from the conservative policies I'd picked up. But the very last thing to go was my loyalty to Trump and my feeling that he was constantly and unfairly treated by everyone. The feeling that the media lied nonstop about him. This was despite the fact that even when I was in full throated MAGA mode, I could almost never watch any clips of him talking because it gave me such strong cognitive dissonance from what the MAGA community said about him.At this time I was able to acknowledge his flaws more and more, but felt this strong sense of injustice with regard to him. Which is why I think once Trump is gone from politics, Democrats could convince former supporters by simply praising him.Something like \\"Donald Trump is sometimes unfairly painted as a bad guy, I dont agree with lots of what he has said and done, but I believe he had his heart in the right place when he said we have to think about the forgotten workers of America\\"Some BS like that. But it requires the broader left to understand lip service and doing what it takes to win, which is the more unrealistic aspect and would put dems off trying it. This also really really relies on Trump being totally uninvolved in politics and not making any endorsements/political comments.","title":"We have had Reagan Democrats, and also Biden/Harris Republicans.

But I also see conflicting information which states that only 2/3rds of Uganda is ethnic Bantus. We will also need evidence that the Bantu groups themselves do not have significant admixture with other groups or have other forms of significant genetic divergence. As for the UK, it could very well be that the greater levels of agreeableness and openness among those Indo-European groups make them more able to assimilate groups that are not too distant.  But it is well known that the early years of Britian were anything but peaceful, and those various ethnic groups warred with each other incessantly before settling down after several hundred years. So tell me in your opinion what does Uganda need in order to be a successful nation? A trillion dollars? Billions of tons of natural resources? More globalist lobbying telling them how to run their nation? Mass immigration of Europeans or Asians? Eugenics? Or should the entire population of Uganda be transplanted to the United States?

You work, you get taxed 15% on your earnings that fiscal year, what you believe is your fair share. What you do with your already-taxed money, is none of my business. Its not my place to tell you what you can or cannot do with it. You put it in a high yield savings which grows &amp; compounds onto yesteryears money, and onto the money you put in two years prior, year after year. Bravo, Im very happy for you. I work, I get taxed 15% on my earnings that fiscal year. I just happened to earn 300x more than you, but I was still taxed 15% just like you, so I too paid my fair share to the IRS. What I do with my already-taxed money, is none of your business. Its not your place to tell me what I can or cannot do with it. Say I [too] put it in a high yield savings which grows &amp; compounds onto yesteryears money, and onto the money I put in two years prior, year after year. At the same bank as yours, in fact, and earning the same interest rate 5% APR same as your account. Over the course of many years, sure our bank balances appear very different, and **neither of us** have withdrawn any funds up to this point. But for some reason  **you think its FAIR** to advocate for for a policy allowing the IRS to target my account IN PARTICULAR to be subject to [premature] taxation **simply because** my account has more?But NOT yours?bYour account is exempt? No. Seems a bit unfair to me. You want fair? Okay, tell ya what, if allowed on my account, then yours should be subject to it as well. Thats called fair. Afterall, both of us are **just hoarding wealth** anyway, right?So okay were both taxed, because fair, and at the rate of 5 to 10 percent annual wealth tax which YOU advocated for. Well, gee isnt 5% the amount of interest the bank is paying on BOTH our accounts anyway? And at say 10%?? Sheesh, thats even worse! Who would EVER deposit money into that bank to earn 5% interest per year, only to have to pay 10% wealth tax that same year? Wed both be LOSING -5% in our balances each year. Yikes, wed both be rushing to take our money out of that bank to contain the bleeding. And everybody else will follow suit soon after, leading to a run on the banks. And within months, this causes the entire banking industry to simply collapse. What I think youre proposing is if my $1M bank account earned 5% interest that year, the $50K unrealized gain would be subject to a 5% tax (or $2,500) to a 10% tax (which is $5,000). But again, you dont believe in taxing that income you perceive me as having earned. No. What YOU wanna tax is my balance [itself]. You want my account BALANCE to lose 5 to 10% annually. So what good is earning $50K bank interest, if I have to pay $50K or $100K wealth tax that year anyway? Who would EVER put their money in a bank? And without depositors, banks wouldnt have money TO EVEN lend in the first place. This is why we tax EARNINGS and that includes profits from capital gains, when liquidated (realized). What we dont do is tax peoples **HOLDINGS** because its dumb, solves nothing, and poses more danger IRL than the solution you imagine it stands to offer.The consequence of your proposed solution will turn out to be **far worse** than the very problem you perceive.","title":"CMV: A wealth tax to reduce the income inequality is integral in improving the current economy"},{"text":"California is a dead blue state.

This negates the argument that every nation needs certain policies to adapt to their unique homogeneity, enforcing the idea that some really are better than others. Im not seeing evidence that nations and populations have a natural genetic similarity that can be adapted to just as well as another. And yes I specified that it establishes causation for genes impacting this. What I said was that it doesnt establish causation for homogeneity being the *cause*.

Now, many in the DNC are saying to not call the Republicans weird and to be way more scripted. Her numbers increased when she, and Walz, were shooting from the hip and being more real. These strategists she has around her now are trying the strip the ticket into a platitude machine (think its her turn 2016 platitudes). 2.

A couple of things- 1, as a side note we have to consider the reason?*why*?these places share more genes with Danes. This genetic similarity quite literally derives from the history that defines these nations as they exist today. Hence, correlation does not equal causation (the same issue with your claim that more violence existing in genetically diverse places means genetic diversity is bad) and while I have no doubt that this study has found causation that these genes cause happiness, it is not proof that homogeneity itself causes stronger societiesThe evidence of the causation is found in the study that accompanies the article. They use three kinds of evidence to back up their findings. See Page 4 and 5: [https://docs.iza.org/dp8300.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp8300.pdf)One thing that you can argue here is bias in the definitions of what makes a nation happy. Your argument is for homogeneity making a country more successful, so what if a country has homogenous genes that make its people more sad or aggressive?

Hopefully there are no banned words in it. \\nKeep in mind that Patrick Byrne is no friend of Trumps.

Perhaps hes a republican with a small r, not a capital R. A Frederick Douglass type of Libertarian/Republican. \\nNew Complaint Filed Alleging that US Postal Service (USPS) Committed Electoral Fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election | The Gateway Pundit\\nA new development that merits attention. A complaint was filed on Friday before the U.S. District Court in Maryland presenting evidence that the USPS acted illegally in shipping at least one million mail-in ballots from a facility in Bethpage, New York to Pennsylvania on October 21, 2020. The suit was brought by attorney Brian Della Rocca, but the critical evidence was collected by two friends of mine  John Moynihan and Larry Doyle. Full disclosure, I have known John since 1998 and we were partners in BERG Associates, LLC. John, in my opinion, is one of the best financial and forensic investigators in the world. Hands down.\\nHere is the bottom-line  the truck driver, Jesse Morgan, picked up a container filled with 20 Gaylord boxes. There were mail-in ballots in each of the Gaylords. A Gaylord can hold from 50,000 up to 100,000 ballots. Do the math  Mr. Morgan was transporting at least one million mail-in ballots (already filled in with signatures on the envelopes). So, what you say? The mail-in ballots are First Class mail. Every piece of First Class mail is supposed to be imaged per USPS regulations. The facility where Morgan picked up the load of ballots is ONLY certified for handling packages and Express Mail. There is no legal justification to account for those ballots to have passed through that warehouse.\\nLet me give you the highlights of the complaint and Johns affidavit.\\n4. As a result, allegations of problems with the delivery of mail-in ballots by the USPS were rampant and continue, to this day, to be challenged. As time passes, the allegations are not being disproven but, in fact, many of the allegations have turned out to be true.\\n5. These allegations include, but are not limited to, lost mail-in ballots (which were subsequently found after the elections), late delivery of mail-in ballots, improperly post-marked mail-in ballots that were still allowed to proceed to their destination despite postmarks being provided on valid mail-in ballots, and fraudulent mail-in ballots being sent via USPS.\\nJohns affidavit gets to the heart of the matter:\\n3. On November 21, 2020, Doyle and I participated in a phone call with a contact (NC) who notified us of allegations that the United States Postal Service (USPS) experienced certain failures involving mail-in ballots during the 2020 Presidential Election and wondered if we would assist with the investigation.\\n4. On November 24, 2020, Doyle and I met with NC and others in Arlington, VA to discuss the investigation and learn about the whistleblower, Jesse Richard Morgan, a truck driver employed by a contractor for the USPS who alleged he carried mail-in ballots among USPS facilities in Bethpage, NY, Harrisburg, PA, and Lancaster, PA (Affiant Morgan).\\n5. On November 25, 2020, Doyle and I began our investigation in earnest and identified a few companies of interest and, within those companies, employees who may have information.\\n6. As a result of Affiant Morgan, Doyle and I focused our investigation on the USPS facility on Grumman Road in Bethpage, NY (Grumman Road Facility).\\n7. On November 27, 2020, I enlisted the assistance of former colleagues from the DEA who are retired and live near the Grumman Road Facility.\\n8. On November 30, 2020, after learning the identities of several USPS employees within the Grumman Road Facility with whom Affiant Morgan had contact, Doyle and I conducted an interview with one such USPS employee (CI-1).\\n9. CI-1 stated the following facts:\\na. CI-1 is involved with loading trucks at the Grumman Road Facility C known as an expeditor.\\nb. CI-1 told us that the Grumman Road Facility has never processed firstclass mail and still does not process mail because the facility does not have the proper equipment to do so (allegedly known as an Oregon Machine).\\nc. CI-1 stated that mail-in ballots were in the gaylords with signatures on the outside envelope at the facility on numerous occasions and asked a supervisor about what to do with them.\\nd. CI-1 was told to just get them loaded onto the trailers for delivery and to get them to their destination.\\ne. CI-1 told us that the Grumman Road Facility is only equipped to process packages and express mail, not first-class mail.\\nf. Doyle and I asked a few more times if CI-1 was sure that ballots were seen at the Grumman Road Facility and CI-1 confirmed each time.\\n10. On December 2, 2020, after having spoken with a Postal Inspector with knowledge of the Grumman Road Facility (CI-2), I asked if the Grumman Road Facility would receive and process first-class mail. CI-2 told me the following:\\na. The Grumman Road Facility only handles parcel post.\\nb. Mail-in ballots should not have been delivered to the Grumman Road Facility because the facility does not have the processing machines (the Oregon Machine) required to handle the processing of first-class mail or bulk mail.\\nThe goal of this lawsuit is to prevent the USPS from interfering in the upcoming election. It is important to note that the shipment picked up by Mr. Morgan was not the only one. It is the only one where John Moynihan and Larry Doyle obtained corroborating evidence.","title":"I voted early, I'm worried"},{"text":" Think about alternatives to a democracy.

Who the  even is \\"white\\" or \\"black\\"? It is incredibly subjective. What I will admit, is the exact genome of an individual as well as the collective genomes of the inhabitants of a nation is what matters. Skin color does not determine if a person has a 50% chance of shooting or stabbing someone and commit repeat violent crimes; [it is the 2 Repeat Allele of the MAOA gene that does that.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11126-013-9287-x)There have been countless battles, war and societal decent as far back as our history can track and the further back you go the closer you get to local genetic similarity.And you would notice a pattern emerge in which the most heinous and large scale wars are fought when two distinct genetic clusters come into conflict with each other. None of the inter-tribal wars of the Native American could come close to the genocidal outcome of the Manifest Destiny. I would like to know how on earth you are quantifying this.What do you mean by \\"this\\"? If you are talking about genetic similarity, I typically use [Principle Component charts that measure genetic drift by analyzing the frequency of distinct single nucleotide polymorphisms found in differing regions](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/PCA-clustering-Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-plot-of-20-populations-from-1000_fig1_331592466). [You can even see patterns emerge within a region.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_Europe#/media/File:European_genetic_structure_(based_on_SNPs)_PC_analysis.png)What is the % of similarity you think needs to be there and how would you combat the side effects of incest?The % similarity threshold is subjective. I think paying attention to specific alleles of genes would matter more. As well as mutations that are associated with a change in personality, habits, interests, and academic achievement. A black Sub Saharan African that coincidently has all the correct alleles for the genes the matter, but is still overwhelmingly black by phenotype would be a better communal fit than another European that is genetically similar except for all the genes that do matter. Understand that academia has not come far enough to make a comprehensive list of this. In regards to incest, genetic deformities emerge when an individual is homozygous for at risk alleles for a gene. It is not caused by genetic similarity itself, but by the amount of potential bad combinations that could occur within a population. One extended family could go 20 generations without seeing harmful effects from incest while another extended family could see harmful effects emerge within 2 generations. when you look beyond your countrys borders I think youll find examples of similar genetics that fail and wide spread genetic populations that thriveI looked at the entire world in my OP","title":"CMV: The effectiveness of public policy within a society is dependent on the collective genetics of the inhabitants.

We are able to neatly determine the genetics of varying populations into Principle Component charts that measure genetic difference. Ah, sorry, we're talking past each other here. Let me rephrase. There is much more variation in qualities within a group than between groups. E.g. within a specific racial group, the variation in openness is significantly more than the variation in openness between that racial group and other racial groups. This is true of things like IQ, as well. Because of this, it rarely makes sense to take broad racial demographics and compare them to other broad racial demographics by pointing to things like genetic differences that are much more variable within the groups than between groups. The same cannot be said for populations who have significant genetic differences, as in South Africa. Despite the same amount of time elapsing, South Africa has gone backwards.Why do you believe specifically that this is genetics, as opposed to cultural differences, a history of bad blood, or just bad policies because of bad policies, and not the specific reason of \\"bad policies because bad genetic diversity\\"?I think that's I really struggle with about agreeing with your argument. There's maybe some tiny sliver of Truth to it, but why would something like the small difference in genetic predisposition to openness between black and white South Africans be the main, or even a large, reason for lack of success in South Africa, when there are so many other variables that logically account for so much more of the difference?","title":"CMV: The effectiveness of public policy within a society is dependent on the collective genetics of the inhabitants.

The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone. The area must be evacuated immediately via Salah al-Din Road to the humanitarian area.\\"\\"A map is attached with a large yellow arrow pointing from block D5 down to the south of Gaza. Salah al-Din Road is the main north-south route.

Phase One will be to take southern Lebanon -- to take possession of the Litany River and its precious water resources. Here is a map with Hebrew names inserted where Lebanese towns and villages will be obliterated and settled: https://i.imgur.com/9jLT35u.pngThe bottom area is Israel.

East Germany was alot poorer than West Germany for a long time, but once they reunited, they quickly assimilated. The same cannot be said for populations who have significant genetic differences, as in South Africa. Despite the same amount of time elapsing, South Africa has gone backwards. While the rest of Africa is steadily climbing past them by choosing a different set of policies. Differences in genetics between groups are significantly smaller than differences within a group. I think it makes a lot more sense to look for other reasons as to why some countries work in some countries don't before looking to genetics.This is just flat out wrong.

These studies indeed agree with that, but they provide no stance that genes are THE most powerful deciding factor in the well being of a society.To talk about the Denmark thing, it's really very interesting! A couple of things- 1, as a side note we have to consider the reason *why* these places share more genes with Danes. This genetic similarity quite literally derives from the history that defines these nations as they exist today. Hence, correlation does not equal causation (the same issue with your claim that more violence existing in genetically diverse places means genetic diversity is bad) and while I have no doubt that this study has found causation that these genes cause happiness, it is not proof that homogeneity itself causes stronger societiesAnother note- genes can make someone more likely to be happy than others of course. Genes can also make someone more likely to be depressed or violent. Your argument is for homogeneity making a country more successful, so what if a country has homogenous genes that make its people more sad or aggressive? Would the solution not be to introduce more genetic *diversity* to remedy it? Or is your argument to do eugenics on countries to make the people have these Danish happy genes? In other words, is it homogeneity, or is it the presence of a few specific genes that actually can and do coexist with a lot of genetic diversity, which has its own strong benefits for society?","title":"CMV: The effectiveness of public policy within a society is dependent on the collective genetics of the inhabitants.

Claiming that Democrats are the *real* racists, and that democrats are \\"the party of slavery and the KKK.\\"This is obviously revisionist BS I've even heard from some alleged black voters that they're frustrated because Democrats just \\"expect\\" them to vote blue.But that's not the case. If there's any expectation, it's one that asks American voters of all backgrounds, races and ethnicities to understand an important history, and not just the history of the civil war era, but one that sheds light on the modern Republican party's roots in a conservative movement that exploited racial tensions to thrive. The conservative platform since the 60s and 70s, has contributed to many of the widespread sociocultural issues that have been plaguing black communities for decades.But let's start with \\"Democrats are the party of slavery\\"It's much more accurate to view the history of our country's changing political landscape as shifting along a conservative-liberal spectrum. Party platforms and ideologies can be more correctly characterized by where they fall on that spectrum.Our first party system emerged with the national politics of its time. The issues that split the two major parties, the Federalists and the Democrat-Republicans, were issues steeped in a divide over early questions about federal powers, economic policy, the constitution, social topics etc... in other words, it was grounded in the context of the past.Between then and now, that context has changed dramatically, and our major party's platforms have transformed to reflect this change.In the early 19th century, the first party system began unraveling in response to a split within the Democrat-Republicans party, among other things.Several new parties emerged in response to changing ideas and a changing country.But what remained relatively constant, was where Americans fell on that ideological spectrum.This is why calling democrats \\"the party of slavery\\" is extremely dishonest.It was, in fact, the  *CONSERVATIVE* party that was largely pro slavery, made up of many southern whites and biblical literalists who defended their God given right to *own* black people, who later obstructed reconstruction efforts and facilitated the Jim-Crow era and the \\"black codes.\\"It was largely southern white *conservatives* who argued in favor of slavery. Promoting ideas of paternalism, and using the Bible as a justification for slavery.Remind me which party today proudly brandishes their Confederate banners and memorabilia? Which party appeals most to evangelicals, biblical purists, white supremacist groups? Which party paints the South red on an electoral map? Which party proudly identifies with their \\"southern heritage,\\" and which party throws a fit every time a confederate icon's statue is taken down? Hmm?Today's Republican/conservative party has its so called \\"values\\" steeped in limited government policies, religious doctrine, chauvinism and over-the-top nationalistic and nativist attitudes. A party that insulates itself, is intolerant of out-groups and foreigners, and has grown increasingly obsessed with its own culture wars. The Republican party of today doesn't resemble, at all, the Republican party of *strong federal government* founded during the antebellum period.So what happened? Did the parties \\"switch?\\" Well, I prefer to call it a realignment of sorts.In the 19th and 20th centuries, as a result of shifting ideologies and political platforms, the Democratic party began departing from its earlier policies. This realignment involved Democrats supporting social justice reforms and the role of the federal government in helping to establish these changes, it also involved new deal Democrats who sought to expand federal power to address economic crisis, labor rights, banking reforms and the emergence of social programs. For all intents and purposes, the Democratic party began adopting more liberal policies. By the mid 20th century, Republicans began shifting towards conservative social policies and staunchly supporting policies of limited government, deregulation.Democrats on the other hand, became more and more associated with liberal policies, civil rights, welfare, and a stronger federal government.The southern strategy was employed by Republicans, starting in the 1960s, to draw white, southern conservative voters to the party who felt alienated and disarmed by civil rights movements and desegregation policies. The strategy was also successful in appealing to racial tensions and promoting conservative and religious \\"values.\\"The strategy proved very effective for Republicans.By the 1980s, a new conservative movement had formed. Over the course of two decades, conservative figures like George Wallace, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan of course, used \\"Law and Order,\\" \\"tough on crime\\" rhetoric and campaign talking points to engage with aggrieved white conservatives in the south particularly. This language was riddled with dog whistles meant to inflame racial tensions and inculcate conservatives with fears of racial violence and crime in their neighborhoodsOut of this movement also emerged the formation of the \\"moral majority,\\" and a Christian fundamentalist revival that drew more and more conservatives to the Republican partyThey also attracted white conservatives to the party by appealing to their grievances around how these deep societal changes were challenging the heteronormativity of a pre racial America and a dominant white culture.The Republican party began ramping up its \\"culture wars,\\" and \\"holy wars\\" that sought to establish a fight between the forces of good and evil, a war threatening the White, Christian hegemony.Now, politically, the Republican party around this time also began reviving and refashioning for the modern era, policies that previously brought about the Jim Crow era. Including policies that widened the racial wealth gap, that contributed to racial injustice, disparities in generational wealth, that reinforced race-based housing discrimination, policies meant to sequester and neglect black communities, and policies that disproportionately jailed black people and denied loans to black families, farmers, business owners, etc...The Conservative party today has deep roots in this movement and has grown increasingly more ethnocentrist as a result.We don't *expect\\" black people to just vote for Democrats. We just understand that Republicans have been deliberately inattentive to your needs and your problems by undermining efforts to address them.That Republicans *and* conservatives have been demonizing you and your communities for decades, highlighting crime in your neighborhoods to push their agendas, using you as scapegoats, and dismissing the ubiquitousness of race related problems through \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric.Not to mention, minimizing your own experiences by claiming that racism is over, that anti-white discrimination is more prevalent than any other kind of discrimination. That black people have been overly catered to, that any talk of racial injustice is simply the curse of \\"wokeness.\\" We understand that Republicans/conservatives have historically contributed more than most, to the ongoing generational issues that impact black communities in particular. That theyd prefer if you didn't vote at all, and are doing everything within their power to try and make that happen.","title":"Obama calling out black men for lack of support for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I apologize, I don't understand your comment","title":"CMV: The Founding Fathers of The United States came from an Honor Culture and meant for \\"Free Speech\\" to be interpreted through that lens."},{"text":"[Beat the Mets](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcx_4i_9pB0&amp;pp=ygUNYmVhdCB0aGUgbWV0cw%3D%3D)","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 13, 2024 - 23 days until election day!"},{"text":"I'm usually very forgiving of the Left and their craziness, but I think agitating for ignoring the constitution should be punished by caning like they do in Singapore.","title":"No Kidding!

But the collective will of every single African nation besides two, have decided to reject the acceptance of homosexuality within their nation. While East Asians, under their current environmental conditions, have decided to be much more open to those ideas. If, as you claim, genetics are so important they can shape public policy, it shouldn't matter if western missionaries promoted anti-LGBTQ ideas or not, Africans would have a genetic tendency towards one or the other.Missionaries still require the receptiveness of the population to adopt their ideals. If the population doesn't like it, they will reject it. The missionaries in the 80's and 90's came with books and sermons, not guns and chains. Speaking of which, how is it possible that countries that are today pro-LGBTQ rights used to be anti-LGBTQ rights?Genetics does not operate alone. Genes interact with the environment to give the behaviors we observe today. It is very much possible that Europeans would eventually be destined to abandoning religious dogmatism when enough of a ideological spark reached them over a period of generations. Mind you, Christianity was also forced upon the Europeans by the sword. And Northern Europeans were historically very well known for homosexual behavior prior to Christianization. On the other hand, much of Sub Saharan Africa has rejected Christianity when it was forced upon them, but adopted with enthusiasm it as soon as they started reach a new phase of social-economic development.","title":"CMV: The effectiveness of public policy within a society is dependent on the collective genetics of the inhabitants.

Despite the successes of the Right in mobilizing and militarizing young white men, the youngest generation is overwhelmingly progressive and the older generation of conservatives die out every day.The key is to protect the institutions of democracy. We must ensure districting remains fair and is not excessively gerrymandered. We must ensure that voters are not disenfranchised by attempts to increase the voting age or require ID or other measures used to prevent rightful voters from voting. We must ensure that votes are properly tallied and counted, and electors are properly awarded.  All of these are potentially under siege.We must also ensure that voter turnout is maintained. I believe that the 4 years of a Trump second term would be enough to fire people up, but apathy could sink in if things get especially dire or people lose faith in the system, especially if Trump were to take power illegitimately.We must also prevent a war from breaking out. A draft and bloody war would decimate the young and potentially change the demographics enough to counteract the political shift.We must also prevent mass deportations or imprisonment of rightful immigrants and first-generation Americans if the rhetoric against illegals continues to ramp up.In terms of messaging, I think we would be able to point to Project 2025 and other policies that would take the US in the wrong direction. The tariffs proposed could hit the pocketbooks of the average American hard. I believe that the results of a Trump presidency would speak for themselves as to why we need to move in a different direction.I am also very interested to see who could fill the power vacuum in the Republican Party if Trump were to finish his second term. Even if Trump yields power to another Republican, we could see a Putin/Medvedev kind of situation where Trump still pulls the strings.","title":"If Kamala Loses this election, what does the Democratic party change?"},{"text":"Laugh while you can, the mets just gerrymandered all the dodger runs into one game.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 13, 2024 - 23 days until election day!"},{"text":"She has literally said this verbatim herself on national television?","title":"Why is Biden throwing Harris under the bus?

Those polls  most notably from Emerson College, Marist College and The New York Times, three of the most prolific pollsters in America  show Harris and former President Donald Trump tied in the northern battlegrounds and Harris trailing heavily in Florida. But our forecast came to a different conclusion: Currently, our model gives Harris a 53 out of 100 chance of winning the majority of Electoral College votes, up from the brink of 50-50 on the evening of Oct. 9.The difference boils down to one thing: trends, not levels. If you compare Harriss margin over Trump in polls released Oct. 10 to the results of previous polls by the same pollsters in the same places, Harriss margin has increased by an average of 0.4 percentage points. And according to our election model, which looks at differences in results among all pollsters to identify whether a firm leans to the left or the right, the polls from Emerson in particular have tended to underestimate Harris compared to polls with the same methodology (a mix of robocalls and online interviews) in the same geographies. This means our starting point when looking at these new polls is that Harris is doing better than they indicate, by about a point on vote margin, and that she is either holding steady or gaining ground.This from 538","title":"Kamala Harris campaign is falling rapidly behind Donald Trump, 3 new polls show"},{"text":"This is a great impression of a wrong person!","title":"Kamala Harris campaign is falling rapidly behind Donald Trump, 3 new polls show"},{"text":"I was younger and dumber and not really into politics then, so I didn't know.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 13, 2024 - 23 days until election day!"},{"text":"Based on your passive-aggressive Obama the Savior comments, I reckon you havent had legit democratic policy leaning in ages, if everVoted for the savior both times.

I would argue that it's the fact that they each are striving for different things that helps keep society stable. (I highly recommend the work of Jonathan Haight, The Righteous Mind, for more on that). Society needs people to be willing to push the frontier and try new things, and society also needs people to keep stable what works. I would argue that without both of these things society can't function well. Sure, you can have too much disagreement between progressives/liberals and conservatives, and i would argue that we're getting to that point now in America, but that's clearly not a genetics issue because genetics haven't changed significantly enough in the last 50 years for that to be the cause. That's very nice. You have two just two cities. I'm sure that is very reflective for the rest of the world. This deals not only with the quality of life, but the mindset, beliefs, customs, and habits of the population themselves. I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make here, the point I was trying to make was that institutions matter significantly more than any sort of genetic differences, or even mindsets, beliefs, customs, or habits, because those were largely the same between these two cities. You seem to be seeing poorly functioning societies and pointing to bad institutions and the poorly functioning society as a *result* of bad genetics. However, I think it makes significantly more sense to point to the bad institutions as the (main) *cause* of the poorly functioning society. Differences in genetics between groups are significantly smaller than differences within a group. I think it makes a lot more sense to look for other reasons as to why some countries work in some countries don't before looking to genetics. There was another CMV posted earlier today about genetics and race, and basically argued that in the absence of any genetic differences, you should expect different societies to end up the same, which isn't at all reasonable. Some societies have access to more navigable waterways than others (Europe versus sub-Saharan Africa), some societies have easier access to information and trade than others (mountains/Islands versus plains/mainlands), some societies have different age demographics than others (Jews in America are something like 20 years older on average than blacks in America, so all else being equal it would be ridiculous to assume that net worth would average equal between the two groups). Basically, there's no reason to expect that, in the absence of [genetic difference], two societies would end up similarly, because there are so many other things at play as to why some societies succeed and why some societies fail, and I don't think looking to differences in genetics between populations is an amazing lens when It doesn't have as much explanatory power as differences in institutions or differences in culture. We are not as successful as you think we are when it comes to social cohesionWhat specifically do you mean by this? Democrats and Republicans don't get along? There's an urban rural divide? There are racial tensions? There's a lot of things you could mean by this that I'm not sure how to respond without understanding more what you mean. we have immense amounts of ethnic segregation. Are those desirable to you?A lot of this is self-selected. Even early immigrants to the United States moved to places near other people of the same city as them. There is some degree of historic discrimination behind this, but that's been illegal for years. Ethnic segregation isn't inherently desirable or undesirable, As long as people have the freedom to choose where they want to live and with whom.","title":"CMV: The effectiveness of public policy within a society is dependent on the collective genetics of the inhabitants.

It talks about what specifically differentiates institutions in consistently successful countries from institutions in unsuccessful or inconsistently successful countries. In the prologue, it talks about two cities, right next to each other but on either side of the American Mexican border, with almost identical culture and genetics on either side. However, on the American side most life outcomes you look at are significantly better than the ones on the Mexican side. This implies that It's nothing to do with the culture or genetics of the people, but the institutions of the respective countries. For that matter, why is the United States so successful if it has such genetic diversity? I'm sure you can find other areas that have more genetic diversity, but the US is a huge country with mostly immigrant populations from Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, etc. Isn't the pure existence of a country with such genetic diversity having sufficiently successful public policy a nail in the coffin against your argument?","title":"CMV: The effectiveness of public policy within a society is dependent on the collective genetics of the inhabitants.

It's unfair, but Trump in pure political fashion went within two days of the event, Harris in order to stay out of first responders way, waited five days.  They've said she was absent.

Democracy is simply people choose the leader(s).\\nWe could elect essentially a king if we wanted to. No legislative bodies, just an election every few years for a supreme leader. There's nothing about democracy that prevents this. Democracies have diffusion because most democracies were formed to provide stable governments where people feel like they have a voice and to prevent corruption as much as possible. The two ideas are very simpatico. Typically if you care about giving the people a voice you also care about suppressing corruption.?\\nThe *actual* benefit and point of democracy is that the losers have reason to stay. When you lose an election you can say to yourself, \\"We'll get em next time.\\" Elections are regular and as long as they are fair and seen as fair that incentive will continue. In dictatorships there is no such incentive. Change occurs only on the whim of that leader or a coup or a full on rebellion. People who dislike the way society is going know that. They know there's basically no way to effect change other than violence. And either there's enough unhappy people to resist or there aren't.?\\nYou are seeing what happens in real time when that faith erodes. Conservative Americans are too stupid to realize that our elections are free and fair. They buy all the baseless conspiracy theories spouted by a deranged conman. When they no longer believe they can vote their way to the world they want they will do what they already did on January 6th.?\\n**That** is the gift of democracy.

But the idea of \\"Ancient Greece\\" (in anything approximating today's understanding) did not exist, and the writers of Ancient Greek texts did not intent for them to be interpreted through the lens of \\"Ancient Greece\\" since that idea did not exist for them or their audiences. It's not just that the English label \\"Ancient Greece\\" did not exist, but that the conceptual category it corresponds to did not exist.To my knowledge the Founding Fathers wanted to create their own thing separate from the English standard at the time.The legal system the Founding Fathers produced was very heavily based on Common Law, and pretty much imported the whole of Common Law as a basis. This makes sense, because the Common Law was what was being practiced already in the Colonies, and was already the established basis of the law in the States.

Its why Democrats considerably over performed their polling numbers in 2022.Take a look at the polls showing Harris losing. Most of them are being done either by legitimate pollsters only conducting their surveys via live phone calls or by bias pollsters who dont reveal the internals of their methodology at all.For the first group, I think phone calls alone are just a bad method of surveying, and we see this in the cross tabs. Most of them have completely fucked up age numbers, with younger people voting Trump and older people voting Harris. Im 24 and in grad school, if the seismic shift among young voters was actually happening, I would be able to see it. Spoiler: I dont see it.That leads me to conclude that there is no such shift among young people, and if those numbers are fucking with the top-line numbers, the poll will be off.For the second group, theyre just trash polls that fucking idiot election modelers havent caught onto yet. The justification from people like Nate Silver is that those pollsters were good in terms of margin in 2020. He ignores the fact that:1. They literally do not publish their methodology, so you dont even know if theyre legit polls.2. They just spit out the same +1-3 Trump leads every time. Its a cycle at this point that when Harris gets a round of otherwise good polling, a round of cope polls get published to level averages again in Trumps favor.3. Even if they happened to get closer results in 2020, that does not justify elevating them in your models if you dont know the methodology. If the polls are just straight up fake, the fake data isnt gonna actually help your model. It will just either make it more or less wrong depending on what the actual polling error is on election night. If Biden did win a landslide in 2020, these pollsters would be rated as dogshit right now.Overall, I still think this is a close race and that Trump has a real chance of winning. However, Im pretty confident in Harris chances. Additionally, I wouldnt be very surprised if she wins Bidens same coalition, maybe with North Carolina added, and simply expands in his margins a bit here and there. The polls, even with all the fucked up ones, show a competitive race with Harris generally beating Trump a good amount of the time.","title":"Harris vs. Trump analyst tells panicky Dems: GOP is creating fake polls | Desperate, unhinged, Trumpian"},{"text":"The history books about this era are gonna be wild.

I'm honestly getting a lot of 2016 flashbacks looking at the polling right now. Even Kamala's rhetoric seems to be stuck in the centrist Clintonian trap, despite the fact that we know that Americans are not down the line ideological on everything. The average voter is far left on some issues and far right on other issues, but every democrat feels for some reason the need to moderate in the same exact bland, uninspiring way that feels like it kills any and all momentum and just makes them seem like a flipflopped instead of Moderate. Walz had to walk back his take on abolishing the electoral college, despite that being a super popular position. Also Kamala has literally stopped talking about any and all economic policy, which she has many actually popular policies she could tout, or attack trump on tariffs, instead of just running scared on that issue. I get that the dems need to move right on immigration, but some of these moves just seem counterproductive. Also her 100% sticking with Biden on backing Israel to the hilt seems crazy. I feel like she could obviously signal that she would put more pressure on Israel, while still promising to defend it from Iran, and gain a lot of protest or third party votes. I also don't buy that this would alienate jewish voters, because most jewish voters are liberal on israel and are anti-netanyahu anyway. the ultimate hardcore pro-israel people are probably going to trump anyway.","title":"If Kamala Loses this election, what does the Democratic party change?"},{"text":"I keep forgetting this ridiculous man is currently our President.He's utterly forgettable.","title":"What Joe Biden Just Told Hurricane Victims in Florida Is Deplorable"},{"text":"Where are you seeing that ?

Allred's policies are still very left leaning on most issues, but he's a bit more grounded in traditional Texas culture than Beto tended to be. Beto didn't make his infamous gun comment until after his 2018 Senate campaign, but Allred has been much more careful on that issue and focuses more on personal freedom, which seems to resonate better without compromising the rest of the Dem platform. He's also gotten a lot more national attention these past few weeks, which is really helping.\\n2. Beto fired up young progressives in a very strong way, while Allred appeals to an older coalition as a whole. That's not to say they aren't allies, or young people aren't supporting Allred, they are, but I'm seeing better reach among older voters this cycle compared to Beto's last 2 races, while younger voters as a whole are just more excited to support Dems across the whole ticket.\\n3. Our cycle starts a few weeks later (Early voting starts the 21st), and our election registration drive hit new record numbers of 18 million registered voters total, about 1 million more than even 2022's election total if I recall. That was our primary focus first up to October 7th, while ground game to turn out the actual vote will be the next key starting this next week. The debate (on the 15th) is likely to drive things if Allred can keep Cruz at bay, and once that wraps on Tuesday, I expect a new surge of GOTV efforts to take off to even higher levels. Cruz does not appear to have any planned infrastructure for it (and doesn't even seem to be running many ads with his name on it), so that gives us a major point of vulnerability to attack starting partway into next week. Also, we've still had a late fall heatwave that will finally break starting Wednesday or so, so canvassing efforts should hit their peak over the next 3 weeks, when the most important thing will be making sure people know exactly how, when, and where to vote.For example, I want to take as much time as I can the week of the 21st to canvass, and I plan on early voting as soon as possible to get that out of the way and free up the rest of my spare time to help.Hope that gives you some ideas of where we're at.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 13, 2024 - 23 days until election day!"},{"text":"Republican internal finding Baldwin up means clearly Baldwin is favored","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 13, 2024 - 23 days until election day!"},{"text":"But who protects them from him?","title":"Donald Trump, \\"protector\\" of women: This deeply sexist notion has a long legal history.

Americans don't care about the dirty details, they care how you message it. Idk where this idea comes from, \\"messaging\\" isn't some magic wand and frankly it's hardly clear Dems are even bad at messaging at allHalf the reason Republicans are so successful is because historically they've actually been pretty at branding their own ideas and smearing Democrat's ideas. **That's why people love the \\"Affordable Care act\\" but hate \\"Obamacare.\\"**This talking point is outdated (\\"Obamacare\\" has been quite popular for like over half a decade now) and was never even all that accurate to begin with. There was [early polling after Obamacare was passed](https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/26/whats-in-a-name-lots-when-it-comes-to-obamacareaca.html) that showed that the ACA was in some cases \\"more popular\\" than \\"Obamacare\\", but it wasn't as big of a deal as some act like - \\"Obamacare\\" was both more disliked *and* more liked than \\"The ACA\\", and in both cases there were sizable amounts of undecideds, and the ACA was still deeply underwater in both cases - \\"Obamacare\\" being at -17 approval, but \\"the ACA\\" being just slightly less negative, at -15 approval A series of Late Night TV interviews with random people online helped popularize this talking point, with them using some especially vivid examples of idiots not understanding the differences here, but at the same time, those were just anecdotes and seemed to be spread around and interpreted by liberals to assume \\"the reason why people dislike the ACA is messaging, since Obamacare isn't popular but the ACA is\\", but the reality is, \\"the ACA\\" wasn't popular either. The \\"messaging\\" aspect made only a minor difference (again -15 rather than -17)Progressives' problem is they have ideas that could appeal to people but they lose on their messaging. Medicare for All could be a winning issue, but the moment its packaged with the \\"all cops are bastards\\" and \\"defund the police\\" stuff people balk.Medicare for all is horrendously shit policy that Bernie never was able to explain how it could be paid for. You literally can't raise taxes enough on the rich in order to pay for it with just the money of the rich alone, it would take big tax hikes on the middle class too. You can't have Euro style benefits without Euro style \\"regressive\\" taxation... Plus it would risk putting a lot of hospitals out of business due to lower Medicare reimbursement rates. It could be an utter disaster to enact such a policy, to the point where it could give the GOP a very long period of political dominance after passage of such a bill, where the GOP could quickly repeal the lawMedicare for all is basically the crown jewel policy of the progressive agenda and it's a frankly nightmarishly bad policy.

You're a worthless sack of shit.I grew up in the environment you describe and while people were capable of violence they were also civic minded and did right by others as long as there was no disrespect involved.

The campaign is being run by people who've never really touched the \\"American reality\\" or have had their ideas at all challenged. Frankly, if I were running the Harris campaign, I'd try to have a Republican (of the non-populist, Haley vein) in the room whenever an ad was drafted and/or a proposal launched, just to have some sort of contrary opinion that might tell you if an ad is a stupid fucking idea (like the recent one with men).

Put together teams of marketing students from Big 10 schools and tell them their only goal is to *win*, not to have any sort of ethics or ideology about it.\\nAlso I think Democrats *badly* need to improve their performance on security issues and Harris and Biden haven't done anywhere near enough to alleviate most Americans' concerns; there's been tons of missed opportunities on the trail.

The constant internal warfare within a system makes governance inefficient, rendering lawmakers more concerned with defeating their institutional rivals than serving the public good.Political economics, public choice theory, or any other framework can only justify so much gridlock before the system collapses under its own contradictions. Agencies and institutions are not designed to tear each other down but to cooperate with constructive tension. Without that cooperation, all you're left with is a government spinning its wheels in an endless cycle of conflict, while the actual needs of the people - those public incentives you claim to protect - are ignored.Decentralization for the sake of decentralization is no virtue.

Reactionism is a political stance that aims at reverting political system and the society to it's previous state. The so-called Alt-right obviously isn't your typical reactionism in that sense, but similarly with other \\"ideologies\\" present within the US \\"political spectrum\\" it takes just enough from a classical \\"ideology\\" to be associated with it, but it does so in a utilitarian way, while differing in its ultimate goal, thus the common prefix \\"neo\\".\\"Conservatism is a political ideology that promotes free speech, free marketing, and loving America\\" Where in the hell did you get that from? Conservatism, by its classical definition, is a ideology that aims at preserving political and social status quo. In the US the \\"neo-conservatives\\" of today and recent past might use slogans of \\"free speech\\" or \\"free marketing\\", but it is in the manner that I've previously mentioned and with goals that differ both from preserving current status and embracing the (liberal, by nature) values of those slogans. Anyway, I do not see how do you diagnose those two as primary agenda of the US \\"conservatives\\"?The \\"love of America\\" here is the funniest part. A state of \\"love\\" with one's nation is called nationalism and is a doctrine, which after being born on the \\"left\\" and \\"liberal left\\" and then slowly began to grow perpendicularly from the left-right axis. At certain point in the interwar period a certain breakup of the nationalist movement into 3 parts can be observed - one, which has most in common with modern movements whose nationalism is primary ideology, has rapidly pushed out classical conservatives and took over the \\"right\\" side on \\"the political spectre\\", one that was hijacked by petit bourgeosie and made into it's own ideology that instead of accomodating with \\"either\\" \\"side\\" declared itself a third way and became known as Fascism, and one that stayed aside with radicals and largely merged with various social-democratic and similar movements that relate to the \\"patriotic left\\".\\nIn no way nationalism is inherently conservative, and might only be regarded as such only under over-simplificative premises that \\"conservatism\\" is interchangable with \\"right\\", \\"liberalism\\" (which in this case also contains progressivism) is interchangable with \\"left\\" (which is even more absurd) and that the sole axis of this division is \\"localism\\" and globalism. I wouldn't want to turn this comment into an argument that US Conservatives aren't actually conservatives, so let's just focus on the principles that US Conservatives do want to *conserve* if not push forward - the economic model based on superiority of the capital(owners), increasingly mercantilistic (in the broad, political sense, not just economic) relations towards other countries, which could be regarded as isolationist tendency, the \\"traditional values\\" of the US society. They do also want a strong state in terms of e.g. law enforcement.The so called American \\"Alt-right\\" wholeheartedly supports the largest owners, just not the particular ones, but \\"their\\" counter-elite ones. They do want to shut out US allies and want inward-focused politics. They want maximum mercantilism and an industrial policy (this doesn't mean \\"socialism\\" - they still hate the unions and don't see the need for economical emancipation of the working class, they just hold a nationalist stance towards foreign countries), and in terms of \\"'social' values\\" they want the same, just turned up to 11.As much as I would personally disagree, clasical reactionism could be labeled as extreme of conservatism on the simple logical basis - conservatism wants to support the status quo, and reactionism wants to return to status quo ante, which is, on a single-axis graph, the extreme of the former. Similarly the US \\"Alt-right\\" movement would be the extreme of US \\"conservatism\\".Unless, of course, by \\"conservatism\\" you meant the old Neo-conservatist US imperialists that still think that the US should have a global presence and impose their terms of \\"free trade\\" on the rest of the world, then sure, \\"Alt right\\" is not that, but then again no sane person claims so, thus it's a void argument. Interestingly the former are being replaced on \\"the right\\" by the later in a manner very much similar to how nationalist movements have replaced conservatives in the early 20th century.","title":"CMV: Alt-Right Ideology Is Not Conservatism"},{"text":"Honor culture makes sense in 2 scenarios1) You're constantly at war.

In my opinion Honor culture actually protects the small man from the big man. In a culture without in that sense the most powerful in a particular context will always prevail because there will be no incentive for the smaller man to respond, sometimes disproportionately. Honor cultures put societal pressure on people to respond to insults and wrongdoings in order to teach people that there is an inevitable consequence to disrespect or any other unethical aggression against another person, with the idea that people will be a lot less willing to engage in that behavior with those they don't know.It may not be the person they insulted physically fighting them then and there it could even be them coming back with their bigger cousin at a later time.

They get their power from supporting the people and structures that give them power. They have no interest in the people below them and theres no reason to think all people below them have any power much less an equal access to it. Obviously, its possible for power to be evenly distributed right? A large part of building a dictatorship requires minimizing that surface of others who have power. This is why dictators seek to control media and manufacture opinion. This is why Putin engages in disinformation. , as was stated this doesnt preclude that they could get their power by aligning with the interests of the majority.It wasnt stated. And what you just described would be called a democracy.  Now you have given reasons why you think this will not practically happen, but I dont see how it inherently follows that they should be opposed.Okay  give me examples of it happening the way youre conjecturing.  You say that by electing a dictator the people have given up their power, and so that is why they are opposed. \\nWhat do you mean by are opposed? Im saying this is why we dont have longstanding historical examples of benevolent dictators. \\n I think this might be semantics about the word dictator which might imply its inherently anti democratic. Yes. Are you saying it isnt? What would the word mean then? \\n As you probably know in the original context a dictator was elected. I think we can just substitute the word ruler or executive here.To be clear are you taking about a democracy or not? Because the OP title is about rejecting democracy right? Because people are too stupid for it. So if youre talking about some kind of majority elected leader where the majority maintains the ability to overturn the leadership to a new ruler or executive rather than one in which the majority *doesnt have that power,* arent we still talking about the same people who OP is saying are too stupid to do this? Giving someone else permission to make choices for you is not giving up your power, or else all Republicanism is inherently anti democratic. Maybe you agree that is so, then very well.Then you are off topic.  However, the problem still remains that if this is the case, then the other keys of power in this scenario also are giving up their power.?What?They arent because they arent like the majority here. They still have power.  This is the more substantial rebuttal I think. If the ruler is dependent on the military, tax collectors, etc., then they dont need him. They are better served in their interests by directly making their own decisions.Why would that be the case?

I would say I agree with you on just about everything here.  I, and probably the majority of people, probably agree that you can only help someone that wants to help themselves.  In any situation, really.  My father loves to use the phrase, \\"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink\\".  I believe in that wholeheartedly.I often ponder what a solution would be to motivating people.  I understand most entry level jobs are rough and the pay isn't better.  So people are often unmotivated.Another problem for some people is that they're incapable, by some way or another, to work a higher position that pays a sufficient wage.  So, they're stuck taking a lower paying job and they can't afford to move to an area with a better job market.  Maybe just enough money to pay for food, electricity, and shelter.  If the government is willing to pay all of that for someone, that would absolutely create dependency in some people, but denying them money for food and shelter creates desperate people willing to do desperate acts.  It's a double edged sword.  Honestly, I'm not terribly concerned about the few abusing food stamps and subsidized housing as much as some of the other problems in the US.  Not to down play it!  It's a serious issue that needs investigating.  I bet there's a company or two that are evading more in taxes than the amount of welfare abusers, but I could be wrong lol.  Anyway, sorry for the tangents.  I think the Bible was pretty darn accurate when it comes to how we should handle those in need.  It's just a tough battle with those that are lazy.  I wish some people held themselves to a higher standard.  I have a pretty low bar, but I have the dignity to want to make something out of myself, instead of relying on others to take care of me.  I don't plan on reinventing the wheel, but I want to contribute lol.  I agree about FEMA and really any other government agency.  Don't hate me too much, but I like the idea of a social democracy.  Ideally, you and I would own the means of production, like a co-op, and help each other out.  Almost like community work.  I don't find many needs for the government to butt into our lives.  I'd like to see local communities being as self-sufficient as possible, but still being open to their neighbors.  Idk, we obviously need the government for the military, major disasters, and maybe to aid the states/counties with their needs, but I wouldn't mind if they kept to themselves for the most part lol.  I like the idea of \\"social democracy\\" because I think we deserve more as workers.  That's a whole other discussion I'd like to discuss if you're up for it!

As I've said before, I live in his district. He's my house rep. He's responsive to the issues when you write to his office. He beat a GOP incumbent who had underestimated him before, and even the current wack-ass polling gives him a better chance than some think of closing the gap.For those who need to know this guy, and get a feel for whether he's ready for the debate? This shows it. Cruz is slimy and will be tough to tackle, no doubt, but Allred shows some spine here and is ready to take the guy on, it seems.Hopefully, he delivers on Tuesday night. Nearly 30 million people live here. 18 million are registered to vote this cycle, and our early voting starts in 8 days. Despite us starting a bit later, they are making a strong last minute push while I see real weakness from Cruz's campaign in general.If you don't yet know Allred like we do, watch this video.

Have you ever looked at entrepreneurship numbers in Europe?  Look at Italy, which basically doesn't have a startup industry at all.  Look at [this list of the top 10 most entrepreneurial nations] (https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/rankings/entrepreneurial); EU nations only make up two of the top 10. I'm not at all convinced that gini coefficient tells us anything about these countries. The billionaires and 100+millionaires use a lot of their money on relatively risky investments and they decide what to do with their money and there is no form of supervision or control over them. And the result in the United States, at least, is the strongest economy in the world. They have too much power with this amount of financial power. This isn't power at all, though.  Staying within the United States, the richest man has around $200 billion in total wealth.  The yearly GDP? It could be $30 trillion for the next fiscal year.  The richest person's *total assets* are less than 1% of an entire nation's *single year* of GDP.  That's the weakest power I've ever seen. The government is not correct but they have many different branches and departments and there is a democratic creation of the budget. There's *democratic representation* in creating the budget, you mean.  The budget, however, is simply one aspect of the government; most day-to-day operation is done through unelected administration of which we basically have no input. So I would rather trust the government with the money than the billionaire. It is more of a I have more trust in the process than would be comfortable with the billionaire having so much power. Thank you for saying this, at least.Here's food for thought: Elon Musk has done more with his wealth to combat climate change and improve the future than the government has.  His investment in electric vehicles long, long before the government deemed it a viable market has done more for the environment than any policy can. Elon Musk is not the barrier, the government is.  If the government had a bigger say in winners and losers over the last 20 years, we wouldn't have the electric vehicle marketplace we do today.This repeats itself over and over and over again.  Wal-Mart and Amazon's economy of scale has kept prices lower than they would be under the piecemeal mom-and-pop corner markets from 50 years ago. Minimum wage hasn't increased in a long time, but [total compensation is up close to 33% over that time period] (https://www.statista.com/statistics/243846/total-compensation-per-employee-in-the-us/).  At every turn, societal progress has been driven not by the government deciding it to be so, but the market doing it.  Your trust in the government is utterly misplaced. The wealth tax will only be applicable to wealth over 100 million so ideally we will not be having people over 100 million after a long enough time.Okay, so how do we scale from there?Here's an example, let's go back to Elon Musk. NASA paid $1.6 billion for every space shuttle launch.  Elon Musk, in 2022, [had Falcon 9 launches under $70 million] (https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/space-launch-costs-growing-business-industry-rcna23488).  The *only* way that price comes down is through his investments in SpaceX. Period. When I hear \\"we will not be having people over 100 million,\\" I hear things like \\"SpaceX exponentially decreasing the cost of a rocket launch is actually bad for humanity.\\"  I hear \\"[we were better off having 29 launches in 2010 instead of nearly 1,000 in 2020] (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space).\\" (By the way, those low gini coefficient nations you cited earlier? 10 launches in 2010, 11 in 2020.  Those nations you uphold as the model are getting absolutely left behind in future technology.)You don't have to like Elon Musk.  I kind of wish he'd shut his mouth and just keep making rockets and cars.  But the world is better with him in it across the board, and that's not up for debate.  His investments and priorities have proven, time and time again, to be superior to the government's.   Even 100 million gives a lot of financial flexibility to the rich. The rich would then be people who have 10-100 million and middle class would 1-10 million and the poor would have 100,000 to 1 million. Okay, so you're making a *very* specific claim here.  Let's say, for the benefit of your argument, that a $100 million cap does not have any negative knock-on effects; that investment and activity and what have you remain the same as they are now.You are now arguing that the middle class, which currently makes less than $100k/year per household, will see a 10x to 100x increase in their finances.  That a poor household will see a similar increase in income.How?   You are arguing for the money to be collected in taxes, not as a redistributed commodity. Where is the 10x income coming from?  It's not from their jobs and wages, under your plan we're siphoning that wealth from the companies into the government coffers.  It's not lower prices, because we're reducing our ability to scale growth and create additional volume.  Even if none of those negative occur, that doesn't account for a 10x multiplier.Plus, *no wealth tax has ever resulted in this*.  The total revenues are too low.  [The United States only has approximately 10,000 people who have more than $100 million in assets] (https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/10/number-of-people-with-100-million-has-doubled-since-2003.html).  Let's again be generous to your position here and assume that all of those people actually have a billion in assets, okay?  That's $10 trillion in assets.  You proposed a 5% wealth tax on these people - that's only $500 billion.  If you just handed that money out equally to every man, woman, and child in the United States, do you know what that amounts to?  Less than $1,500 a person.  Even if you repeated that 100 times with no other asset depreciation, you're not coming close to your income equality estimates.  Your proposals aren't going to improve income inequality as much as they're going to kneecap the rich with no meaningful benefit to the lower classes in exchange. I realize that there are other ways to decrease income inequality but this is the most direct method.Except it's not.  Unless it's confiscatory in nature, it doesn't have anything nearing the impact you want it to, and that's even before factoring in the negatives.  The rich are super rich, yes, but they're not nearly as rich as you think they are. Most people are concerned that the billionaires will just leave but they will not atleast not for a tax as minor as 5% on amount higher than 100 million, is an important point. Maybe so.  Perhaps every time this has been tried and failed, *this time* will be different.Even so, it's diminishing returns.  Even a 5% tax reduces the value of the investment over time - 5% of $1 billion is $50 million.  5% of $950 million is $47.5 million.  5% of $903 million is around $46 million.  To use the Haas Institute example, doubling the minimum wage (again, assuming no negatives and being generous to your position) would [increase wages by $107 billion] (https://www.epi.org/publication/minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-by-congressional-district/).  Compare that to the one-off injection of tax dollars, and it makes a lot more sense to simply double the current minimum wage for immediate impact if your concern is helping the poor.(Of course, it needs to be said that even the CBO sees fewer people employed with a hike of that magnitude, and there's not a lot of good economics in favor of increasing the wage, but, again, steelmanning your position).","title":"CMV: A wealth tax to reduce the income inequality is integral in improving the current economy"},{"text":"Your argument rests on several weak assumptions and ignores critical realities:1. Idealization of Monarchy and DictatorshipYou assume that a benevolent dictator will always be better than a democracy, but this is naive. Benevolent dictators are rare, and even when they exist, their power is often temporary. Dictatorships frequently descend into corruption or brutality when power changes hands, as theres no accountability mechanism. Without democratic checks and balances, nothing stops a benevolent ruler from becoming authoritarianor a cruel successor from taking over.2. Selective Memory and Lack of NuanceYou idealize your countrys past under previous rulers without addressing whether those conditions were truly sustainable or universally positive. Many authoritarian regimes prop up the economy for a time or maintain international relationships through coercive means, but these are often short-term successes that come at a costlike suppression of dissent or human rights abuses. The absence of public input means that when things do go wrong, the populace has no say or recourse.3. Flawed View of DemocracyDemocracies are messy and imperfect, but they allow for adaptation, accountability, and the potential for change when leaders fail. You claim democracies inevitably become flawed, but you provide no evidence to show that monarchies or dictatorships are immune to decline. History shows that they are just as, if not more, likely to deteriorate. Democracies, despite their flaws, have mechanisms to self-correct through elections, legal processes, and civic engagementsomething dictatorships inherently lack.4. Oversimplification and GeneralizationBlaming stupid braindead religious revolutionaries is overly simplistic. Revolutions usually arise from widespread dissatisfaction and systemic issues, not just the ignorance of the masses. If your countrys previous rulers were genuinely great, people wouldnt have felt the need to overthrow them. You ignore the possibility that these revolutions were responses to oppression, inequality, or other genuine grievances.Your argument depends on the unrealistic assumption that benevolent dictatorships are stable and sustainable. It overlooks the complexity of governance and the value of democratic mechanisms in holding power accountable and adapting to changing circumstances.","title":"CMV: people are too stupid for democracy"},{"text":"Aging nepo-baby misogynous desperate-for-attention assholes who failed their way up the ladder?","title":"Fetterman says Musk has an appeal to a demographic that Democrats struggle with"},{"text":"fhrious*2 Fas(cis)t 2 Fhrious*","title":"Trumps New Post on Obama Proves Hes Losing It"},{"text":"This needs to be higher.\\nAnd when Trump is gone, they put all the blame on him.","title":"Trumps New Post on Obama Proves Hes Losing It"},{"text":"Honestly the facts of Snyder are way worse than this issue.Nobody knew this was on the table in 2020 and there is no reason to believe it will ever be on the table again.

Thats like a nice bonus if it happens. The core mechanism that makes democracy valuable is that democracy diffuses power effectively.Power corrupts. And democracy works by diffusing the corrupting influence across many millions in order to retard the inherent corrosion of a societies institutions. Democratization of a system isnt the aspect of putting things to a vote, rather it is the diffusion of power. Voting is just a means to an end and sortition or even pure randomization among a population is just as effective (but people find it scary/weird to make decisions randomly so we tend not to see it in modern democracies even though many Greek democracies used it).Think about alternatives to a democracy. In any alternative system, to varying degrees power is concentrated to either a smaller group within the population or to a limited group or individual. But what is power and why cant we have a benevolent dictator?Theres a reason you dont actually see the benevolent dictator system in the real world. Political Power is essentially the quality of having other powerful people aligned to your interest. And those other powerful people get their power in turn from people further down the chain being aligned to them.In order to keep those chains of alignment of interest, you have to benefit the people who make you powerful. But you have no need to benefit anyone else. In fact, benefitting anyone else comes at the cost of benefitting those who make you powerful. Its a weak spot that can be exploited by a usurper. Right?If youre going to be a benevolent dictator whos selfish interest do you need to prioritize in what order?- ?tax collectors? \\n- military generals?\\n- educators?\\n- farmers?\\n- engineers?\\n- doctors?Well without the military, youre not really in charge and you cant defend your borders or your crown from other potential rulers. And without the tax collectors you cant pay the military or anyone else for that matter. But you can probably get away without educators for decades. So your priorities are forced to look something like this:1.\\t?Military\\n2.\\t?Tax collection\\n3.\\t?Farming\\n4.\\t?Infrastructure projects\\n5.\\t?Medicine?\\n6.\\t?Education??And in fact, any programs the benefit the common person above the socially powerful will always come last in your priorities or your powerful supporters will overthrow you and replace you with someone who puts them first. So it turns out as dictator, you dont have much choice.But what if we expect our rulers to get overthrown and instead write it into the rules of the government that every 4-8 years it happens automatically and the everyday people are the ones who peacefully overthrow the rulers?Well, thats called democracy. Its totally unnecessary for the people to make the best choice. Whats necessary is that in general, the power to decide who stays in power be diffused over a large number of people. Why? Because it totally rewrites the order of priorities.Now you have a ruler who prioritizes education, building roads that everyday people use, keeping people productive and happy.Furthermore, nations who prioritize those things tend to be richer and stronger in the long term. Why? Because it turns out education is good and science is important and culture is powerful. It turns out whats good for the population is better for the country as a whole even though its bad for a dictator.We can demonstrate through studies just how clearly democracies retard corruption.For more on the basic principles behind why democracies are so much more successful than other forms of governance, see [GCP Grays rules for rulers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs)","title":"CMV: people are too stupid for democracy"},{"text":"They arent wrong.

You only get $2.375 assuming the value of the asset doesn't drop even more due to the wealth tax.Eventually, what's left?  \\nThe wealth tax will only be applicable to wealth over 100 million so ideally we will not be having people over 100 million after a long enough time. Even 100 million gives a lot of financial flexibility to the rich. The rich would then be people who have 10-100 million and middle class would 1-10 million and the poor would have 100,000 to 1 million. It just significantly decreases the gap between rich and poor. Also the government can use this money to help the average citizen in a way the billionaires do not.   \\nI realize that there are other ways to decrease income inequality but this is the most direct method. Most people are concerned that the billionaires will just leave but they will not atleast not for a tax as minor as 5% on amount higher than 100 million, is an important point. I want to say. But I do agree some of the other method like what were mentioned in the Haas institute should be implemented.","title":"CMV: A wealth tax to reduce the income inequality is integral in improving the current economy"},{"text":"Right but he's basically saying he has no choice but to go, but he's gonna bitch like it's biden's fault.\\nThat was my point.You acknowledge it's a problem but you're bitching anyways?If biden is dawned no matter what, then maybe you shouldn't, yknow, damn him","title":"Biden arrives in Tampa to tour Hurricane Milton damage"},{"text":"They support policies until actually told what they entail","title":"If Kamala Loses this election, what does the Democratic party change?"},{"text":"Considerably to the right.Yeah, no.

Your mind has over vilified partisanship at the cost of a rational worldview.  Democracy does not exist without aggregation.  Only delusions of autocracy are premised on such extreme individualism. Personalism, citizen assembles, direct democracy and all that other garbage are just the false promises of anti-democratic populism attempting to don the style of democracy.The many streams argument is asinine.  There is only one electorate.  What matters is that its representation be proportional.  The \\"many streams\\" fallacy leads to self-defeating obstructionism at the hands of too many veto points.  The American founders were hopelessly naive on this point, and their fallacy been repeatedly on display through the chronic disfunction of American governance.  Nor does separation of powers depend on \\"many streams\\".  Checks and balances define separation of powers, and appointment of one body by another is a basic check and balance.  Radical separation of powers as espoused by presidentialism is no separation of power at all because only the executive branch wields the state's monopoly on violence.  The executive branch **must** be subordinated to the other branches, or else we by default have two branches ultimately subordinate to the executive branch.The vast vast majority of citizens do not nor can not conform to your definition of a model \\"better  citizen\\" - they are too busy trying to survive or just live their lives - and the overburden of direct participation you would compel upon them merely leads to their non-participation - which means that those offices and decisions are left to the control of those special interests with the knowledge and privilege to decide them, thus capturing them.The irony is that the proper outlet for your \\"better citizen\\" is not through any of these useless populist innovations, but rather by active participation through political parties - the true vehicles of liberal democracy.","title":"What is the solution to Americans voting too often (too many elections) ?"},{"text":"But but but both sides need to calm the rhetoric!

What makes this ideal and not between 0.05 and 0.15, or 0.50 and 0.70? A coefficient lower than that would suggest extensive government intervention, lack of innovation, etc. A coefficient higher than that would suggest wealth concentration, lot of poor people, etc. What are you basing this on, exactly? A wealth tax would be good as it will help take part of the money they have and the government will be able to use it for better use. When has this ever been true?  What is the evidence you're using to support this?Why does the government know better than the people who it represents? The primary reason why I support the wealth tax ideology is because it targets the assets which the very rich people have and they are forced to pay taxes on them. Why do you want to target assets?  If your goal is to reduce inequality, how does the government reducing market investment achieve that goal?  If the government is taking 5% off the top of any investment, how will that not lower the value of that investment?  How will that not negatively impact the poorest in the country who rely on that investment for jobs, for goods, and so on?  Also this will specifically target the ultra rich like people with more than 100 million because I think those are the people who own so much in investments and stuff that they have just an insane amount of money Define \\"insane amount of money.\\"  You use Amazon as an example, but they have very small profit margins despite their valuation.  Who benefits from reducing Amazon's value? If they have like 50 billion in assets, they would not be willing to uproot their lives and move to another country if they have to be pay 5 or even 10% of them as taxes is my belief. It's not just 5% of them once.  It's 5% of those assets on a yearly basis.  Assets that you are devaluing by virtue of putting a needless government surcharge on them, and assets that will continue to spiral and lose money as time progresses - you take $2.5 billion of that $50 billion this year, and next year the asset is already down to $47.5 billion. You only get $2.375 assuming the value of the asset doesn't drop even more due to the wealth tax.Eventually, what's left?\\n Complications with the calculation - It is not that straightforward to calculate the assets of these ultra rich people. We will have to assign government officials or someone to make valuations on assets which are not very clear with respect to their value. We can also look into how countries with existing wealth taxes have implemented this. Only five countries currently have a wealth tax, which is down from twelve 30 years ago.  We know what happens when a wealth tax goes into effect: money flees from the country that implements it.  This happened in [France] (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1268381): Capital flight since the ISF wealth taxs creation in 1988 amounts to ca. 200 billion; The ISF causes an annual fiscal shortfall of 7 billion, or about twice what it yields; The ISF wealth tax has probably reduced GDP growth by 0.2% per annum, or around 3.5 billion (roughly the same as it yields); In an open world, the ISF wealth tax impoverishes France, shifting the tax burden from wealthy taxpayers leaving the country onto other taxpayers. [Here's a broader EU-based study] (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1475-5890.12278): Among these justifications, the most common economic arguments (i.e. the negative impact\\non wealth accumulation and international migration effects) have found little empirical support.94\\nRegarding wealth accumulation, studies point to limited real effects, and greater effects on wealth\\nreporting and tax avoidance and evasion, which is partly a consequence of how wealth taxes were\\ndesigned and the ease with which they could be avoided or evaded. Regarding migration effects, very\\nfew studies exist and these generally focus on within-country mobility. The limited empirical evidence\\nbacking these arguments against wealth taxes suggests that political economy factors, including the\\nrole of special interests and shifts in ideas, played an important role in the way in which C and the\\nextent to which C these economic justifications were used. The arguments emphasising widespread avoidance and evasion, however, have been corroborated\\nby significant evidence. Wealth tax bases have been narrowed virtually everywhere by tax exemptions\\nand reliefs, and there is evidence that these have been used by wealthy taxpayers to minimise\\ntheir wealth tax burden. Importantly, however, the design of wealth taxes was partly the result of\\npolitical economy dynamics, with evidence that interest groups were influential in obtaining special\\nexemptions, for instance. There has also been evidence of significant tax evasion, particularly by the\\nwealthiest households, largely permitted by the lack of measures to ensure tax transparency. Finally, the administrative and compliance costs that wealth taxes have involved have indeed been\\nsignificant, in particular in relation to regular asset valuation, and have been higher than in the case of\\ntaxes on wealth transfers, which are only levied once, or income taxes. However, this section has also\\nhighlighted how some of these issues could have been addressed through better tax designThey fail at handling income inequality in a meaningful way, they fail at providing major government revenue boosts, they're expensive to implement, and they increase avoidance and capital flight. But my main argument is that it is a vital step in the correct direction of the economy.Here's the problem: you *appear* to have a specific goal of reducing income inequality.  Let's put aside all other arguments here (whether income inequality is a problem, whether it needs to be reduced, whether it's currently too high, etc.) and look solely at this result: Income inequality is X, and you want it to be &lt;X.  The Haas Institute at UC Berkeley, which is a group focused primarily on a \\"fair and inclusive society,\\" [details six ways to reduce income inequality] (https://belonging.berkeley.edu/six-policies-reduce-economic-inequality).  Do you know what policy *doesn't* get proposed?  A wealth tax. They instead look at things like the Earned Income Tax Credit and higher minimum wages (things that put more dollars in the hands of the bottom), and higher capital gains and tax progressivity (which doesn't harm the value of assets along the way).  If your goal is to address income inequality, there are many better tools in the toolbox.  While income inequality should not be an issue for you in part because you have no real justification for believing it should be an issue, a wealth tax is probably the worst way to go about it if you insist on caring anyway.","title":"CMV: A wealth tax to reduce the income inequality is integral in improving the current economy"},{"text":"The post is bs and dangerous and you know it.

The Heritage is foundation is a conservative-leaning think tank of 140 former Trump staffers who put together Project 2025  a roadmap for how to replace the rule of law with right-wing ideals, during the next administration (officials in the Heritage Foundation **are recorded on video saying so)**. [https://www.aclu.org/project-2025-explained](https://www.aclu.org/project-2025-explained)Many (if not most) of the writers of Project 2025 are members of Trump's campaign or his former presidential cabinet, and it is a well known fact that J.D. Vance wrote the introduction for the head of Project 2025's manifesto. ?The main tenants of the project simply reflect plans that Trump has already articulated publicly; that is, the deregulation and privatization of many aspects of the government, including the departments of education and Justice; the centralization of power; shifting the tax burden from the wealthy onto the middle class; the deprivation of life-saving health care for women. ?When the Iranians hacked the Tump campaign this summer, what they found, and subsequently leaked to the press, was precisely Project 2025 training sessions and internal documents, which detail, among other things, strategic plans for a Trump election and presidency. (These leaked documents and training videos can be accessed easily online.) ?In July, Project 2025 co-author Russell Vought met with two people he believed to be relatives of a wealthy conservative donor interested in funding the effort. In fact, he was meeting with two reporters with the U.K.-based Centre for Climate Reporting as part of an undercover sting captured on video. Over the course of two hours, Vought described Trumps disavowal of Project 2025 as mere theater and laid out plans for mass deportations, restricting abortion, gutting independent government bureaucracies, using the military against racial justice protesters and more. You can watch this interview yourself here: [https://www.democracynow.org/2024/8/16/project\\\\_2025\\\\_undercover\\\\_video](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/8/16/project_2025_undercover_video)Anyone denying exactly what *Project 2025 is, and Trumps connection to it* in the face of this information is thus very obviously spreading propaganda and lies.","title":"Jim Clyburn calls Trump's Project 2025 a Jim Crow 2.0\\n"},{"text":"Hitler-ious","title":"Trumps New Post on Obama Proves Hes Losing It"},{"text":"Every time.

Personal voting is fine, but when electing assemblies it should be proportional. You should be able to split your vote between different offices, assemblies, vote across party lines, do panachage. The less tribal it can become the better. While elections should not be too personal (an argument to make more offices multi-winner), presidentialism as in stricter separation of powers is good.

This is not even remotely close to free market, this is an oligarchy (at best) or a plutocracy (if you are being honest with yourself).Those people who are worth billions of dollars often got that fortune by breaking laws and abusing loopholes that the largest majority of people will never ever be within a margin of money to be even capable of using anywhere close to within their lifetime, such as being able to avoid paying taxes because they lump of cash they just got wasn't from selling assets to settle a fine, fee or other payment, but rather, it was a loan against those assets, where now they just have to increase their RoI payments just barely enough to cover the new interests, along with whatever other things they like to do.I need to insist: Breaking laws is a huge part of it, as a lot of them are often caught breaking safety regulations (such as needing adequate and sturdy railing on dangerous catwalks) and federal and/or state workers' laws (such as union busting). Those are usually shrugged off as a \\"pay fine and move on\\", or sometimes, when things get a tad spicier, blame your contractor for relaxing those safety regulations.Those people are objectively treating the people who work for them like one would see an expendable bee in a beehive.Which is where I get to my conclusion: There's nothing wrong with some wealth inequality. There is something wrong with enough money to decide the laws without being elected. There is something wrong with enough money that your employees dying because of your work policies isn't anything more than a mild inconcenience. There is something wrong about receiving federal grant money, bailouts by the billions, and managing to skirt all the way around paying taxes with loopholes that only exist to you, then complaining that your tax rate is somehow still too high.The population should not HAVE to shoulder the cost of the moral lackings of billionnaires who shit all over us, and keep trying to sweeten us with \\"trickle-down economy\\", something we've tried a lot, and has yet to even try to happen.If society's needs were met, and we still had billionaires, I sure the \\"tax the rich\\" camp would be much smaller. But it's not. And instead of tackling the trickle-up economics that those billionaires are trying to play up, the people who are \\"so concerned about the state of our society\\" will instead add jus shy of 8 freakin' trillion to national debt by cutting taxes from the people who should be able to afford it.Come and tell me why that level of income inequality.

But on some points I will be arguing from what I think are quite centrist positions against the points you raise.Starting with Part 1, I'm not sure I know what you mean when you say it's an established fact that a GINI of between .25 and .35 is ideal. The GINI is one of many ways of measuring inequality, so I don't think you can pass moral judgement on a society just by looking at it. For example, if there were a society where 99% of people lived the lifestyles of millionaires today, and 1% were quadrillion (or insert some absurd number here)-aires, surely that would be better than any society existing now? Not saying it's realistic - but it illustrates the issue.I get completely why lots of poor people is bad, but why is inequality specifically bad in and of itself? (I think you just stated this was true). Would you rather that, say, the poor were poorer, provided the rich were less rich? If not, then there is something else valuable apart from reducing inequality, surely.(Side note - I also think excessive inequality is bad, I just disagree with many actions people suggest to tackle it. But that's a somewhat separate issue).Now, onto Part 2. You begin by listing some methods of taxation, I broadly agree with what you say here (progressive taxation is good, even with low taxes overall you've got to get it from somewhere so might as well be the richest imo). Then you say:The main problem with all 3 methods according to me is that it harms the moderately rich like the ones in 1-100million range. They are not the main problem of the economy. The main problem are the 10,000 or so individuals with a net value of more than 100 million.I'm not sure why you consider these people a \\"problem\\" in the economy? What do you mean by that? Regardless of whether their current wealth is excessive, I think it's clear most of them have amassed it by doing something that provides value to others. For example, Bezos set up Amazon which is now used for convenience by hundreds of millions of people. So economically, it seems the world is better off for his existence.Further, even if you consider this wealth excessive on some moral level, how are they a problem for the economy? If all these people disappeared now, would other people's lives get easier as a result? I'd like to know what you mean by that. Certainly I would argue that 90% of people in both categories (600k ish to billionaire) are good for the economy, as they are likely to be highly effective business people or well paid professionals who provide valuable services to many people.Finally, onto the issue of wealth tax. I am not going to argue this from a moral standpoint (as I say, tax has to come from somewhere, so if a wealth tax led to other people taxes falling, I wouldn't be *morally* apposed to it), but from an economic one.Firstly, I think it's quite uncontroversial in mainstream economics that wealth taxes are probably a bad idea. They act as a disincentive to create and hold wealth; if you're a billionaire, that either means you have less incentive to grow your business, or more incentive to spend the money on non-assets (like holidays I guess). This is bad because it may lead to the business growing slower (thus providing less services to customers, tax to the government, and value to other shareholders, many of which will be pensions etc. so this would affect normal people planning for retirement). More spending on non-assets will raise the value of the luxury goods/experience market, which will be great for other rich people but will not help the average worker as our economy would become more focused on producing things for the more frivolous rich.The above is an account of the general economic effects of a low (&lt;1%) wealth tax. But you suggest a 5-10% tax here which as far as I know is radically higher than in any country that currently has one (eg. Switzerland is .3% I believe). Taking the lower end of 5%, consider what would happen if this tax was implemented now in the US. If Elon Musk is worth around $200bn dollars, then he would have to sell 10bn of Tesla (or other) stock per year just to pay the tax - this would put a downward pressure on Tesla's share price, which would reduce its growth long term. This would happen to all stocks with high net worth owners. Why is this bad? Well it discourages investment, which is bad for the economy as companies need to be able to raise capital to grow, and a big part of this is through the stock market. So in future it will be harder to start and grow a business in the US.My final point is on the effects of government using this money - consider what would happen with a 5% tax again. A tax was proposed by Elizabeth Warren in 2021 with was a 2% on 50m to 1bn and 3% above that. Given wealth has gone up since then and we are talking 5%, I'm going to assume this tax is lower than what you're proposing. It was claimed Warren's idea would raise at least $3tn over a decade - so $300bn a year. Current US government spending is about $6tn, so this is an increase of about 5%. This is money that otherwise would've stayed as capital and not been spent (probably). So this is very likely to cause inflation to tick up as the amount being spent, and competing to buy stuff goes up, while investment and money in the business world trying to make business more efficient goes down as above. i.e. sustained growth in demand without a sustained increase in supply. Inflation is obviously bad for the average person.The alternative to the above is that the government endeavours to *invest* all the money raised under this tax, i.e. keeping it as capital. This would avoid the inflationary impact, but now we are just into a situation where we are letting the government allocate business resources, which I would argue the private free market is generally a lot better at.A final point which is somewhat separate; why do feel there is someone very wrong with the US economy? I am from the UK, and we are falling further behind the US every year, and in historic terms, the US economy is doing very well these past few years (and decades). One thing I worry about is that someone will actually institute some of these radical policies in the US to 'fix' the problems, and in doing so ruin a great economic run of success. Changes should be small and cautious when things are going economically well imo; even if you are in favour of much higher taxes, trust me you don't want to ruin what you've got going well already.","title":"CMV: A wealth tax to reduce the income inequality is integral in improving the current economy"},{"text":"Fuck the polls.
