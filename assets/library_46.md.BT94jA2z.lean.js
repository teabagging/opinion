I can only speak for myself  but as a Republican at this point in my life , I do believe people have the right to express themselves to wear what they want to live and love how and who they want. In a consensual manner, of course. In the same breath, however, cannot say the decisions a 25-year-old makes with their body for procedures and hormone therapy, should be considered for anyone under the age of 18. I also believe freedom of expression should be appreciated for everyone so the pronouns a trans person would use for themselves should not be Mandatory for everyone to use some people will simply not want to use them and that is OK. That is that persons prerogative to not use the pronouns just as it is the trans persons prerogative to use them on themselves. \\nI do believe people should not give up their love of being an athlete or competing. I believe sports brings everyone together. But I believe individuals must compete against one another in the same biological divisions, they have been born in.Lastly, when it comes to the military I thank and respect all members of service across all branches of the military. I do not have anything against an individual wanting to be members of our troops, but when it comes to figureheads that represent our military on a White House level I do believe in order to gain the fear and respect of other countries we need someone with a tough exterior. I say this with all due respect, but for centuries, the best way to prevent war has been a dick swinging contest intimidating, the enemy at this point in time there are still underdeveloped countries that simply do not feel intimidated or respect women let alone, trans women or trans men.  Having trans people represented as a figurehead in a totally different area is one thing , like urban housing or agriculture but with the military it is extremely important to display strength!","title":"Hi Im a member of the lgbt community and I voted for trump."},{"text":"It reads like it was written by a 4th grader, lol.","title":"Go look at what they did to Trumps Wikipedia page and the Wikipedia page about this election"},{"text":"It's an honorable way to go and your legacy would live on","title":"Project Blue Beam Last Resort for N.W.O"},{"text":"Anywhere from $79,999 for 1 person for 1 year to $79,999.50 a year for a couple x 4 years.[https://villavieresidences.com/tour-la-vie/](https://villavieresidences.com/tour-la-vie/)# 1 Year$49,999  \\nper person (double)$79,999  \\nsingle occupancy# 2 Years$93,999  \\nper person (double)$150,399  \\nsingle occupancy# 3 Years$129,999  \\nper person (double)$207,999  \\nsingle occupancy# 4 Years$159,999  \\nper person (double)$255,999  \\nsingle occupancy","title":"Cruise company offers Americans a four-year escape from the Trump presidency"},{"text":"Check out the chart: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/strategic-bitcoin-reserve/","title":"President Trump may create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to pay off the entire US debt and effectively END the FED"},{"text":"No worries at all, I gave you a serious answer.

So why is this an issue? Because you need to be told no sometimes, and accept it. If not, you'll only attract grifters who'll leech off your business/administration and in so doing hurt others just to make a buck.After Trump rails against people who he feels slighted him, I think he'd rather spend 5 days a week golf in Florida and inflating his ego by meeting important people. The biggest danger is that only the most radical of Republicans, the most conniving of businessmen, and the slimiest of opportunists are seeking his approval and thus a place in his administration.

It was boring then. I'll give you the point that Trump brought incivility in politics by being brash and loud. And while it can be argued that was for the good (again, I'd rather deal with the devil I know than the one that operates vastly differently behind closed doors), we've had tonnes of politicians sweet talking and not following through so that was a breath of fresh air, but the point still stands that it brought incivility. The content of what he was saying regarding immigration, trade etc were valid. You must look at these things objectively discarding emotions. If Obama had brought change to them, I'd have supported him so clearly it's not just cos of Trump. Trump complained about illegal immigration but he didn't vilify them like Hitler did with Jews as the \\"history\\" you're referring to, and yes I'm a history nerd. That's a gross simplification and assumption that distracts us from the actual problem at hand. \\nDuring COVID, Trump was not antivax nor pushed it's agendas. He left it up to states and even got vaccinated himself. That's not what a science denier does. Again, this is hard for me because we're operating on different realities but I haven't even heard of other things that they actually operate on that are unscientific. RFK *questions* a lot of things and I've said in other comments that we shouldn't blindly look at that as anti science. We keep using cheap easy methods to label things that don't help anyone. I'm going to ask you, what if it was found out that COVID vaccines were in fact NOT thoroughly tested and we took a giant risk on people's lives?\\nAre you open minded enough that, that revelation could change your mind? Especially knowing that USA is number 1 propaganda machine in the world? We need to get back to due process brother.In relation to your comment about \\"succeed at what\\", illegal immigration, if successfully stopped and reversed, would impact all of us positively. Have you heard any stories of businesses paying the illegals extremely low wages to get their work done? We don't just lose jobs but also revenue in taxes. How is the illegal alien working for dog wage any humane? Plus, why should we accept them at all? There's a legal way to do things, you're more than welcome, but illegally it hurts us all. We HAVE to agree on this basic point. Same with trade. Trump's trade war hurt China more than US, because although on paper the numbers look similar, let's use common sense for a second. Would you do business in China or anyplace else if it costs similar to do in US? No. So we prevented a lot more businesses from outsourcing in other parts of the world, led to job growth locally, and came out much better off. I can understand your hatred towards the administration with the viewpoints you occupy and perhaps I'd feel the same, all I'm asking for is you keep an open mind and research from the other side's point of view as well. Or have patience. He's the president regardless, we can hope that he at bare minimum succeeds at common sense policies. This is another case of occupying different realities but have you heard Kamala insinuating he was Hitler and his supporters were Nazis? Sure she won't outright say it because sweet talking is the only thing going for her, but as a well researched guy, you could do your due diligence to find that she's not exactly crystal clear either. They didn't campaign ON Trump being Hitler but made sure to keep reminding the public that he is. All their propaganda machines (CNN, MSNBC, etc) couldn't stop with the rhetoric that almost got him killed. They also couldn't stop with the race baiting which in itself is immensely racist. Why does Harris' sex/race need to be mentioned? We want a competent leader not one of particular colour. When was the last time you heard Trump refer to Biden as Caesar or anything scary as such? Partly because Biden isn't nearly as competent everyone knows that but also because he always focused on the problems this country has. Even in Kamala debate, Trump didn't say she was Hitler or Mao but defended himself saying they (Kamala and her friends) weaponised politics not him. Which is true. When did you hear Trump and his propaganda machines (X, Fox etc) say you should vote for him cos he's a white male? Never. Trump held public meetings in office with Pelosi and Schumer for being transparent. Got nowhere, but how often have you seen that? Would you not deal with the devil you know? Let's not pretend Democrats are white as milk.On abortion issue, all power to the states! But I'd argue most of country is infact against it. You're forgetting the 'No' votes in blue states. Regardless, that was the biggest issue Kamala ran on, spent 10billion$ and is now 20mil$ in debt, enough said why she was a poor choice. Trump spent a fraction of that money, was heavily distracted from all these politically weaponised cases, and ran on dozens of issues nearly getting himself killed. Do you never question why everyone hates this guy so much despite him not ending the world during his first term, bringing stability to NK, Middle east etc, not being convicted of anything and media loving him before he ran for President? Do you not question how biased it'd be if Obama had to go through the same? You'd see race cards flying everywhere and statues of him built. On your last point, I think you're misunderstanding the right wing media reporting Kamala Harris ran on trans inmates rights. They reported that that's what she ran on in 2020 and suddenly she's flip flopped on so many policies. Do you not see that as well? At least Trump is consistent (or consistently inconsistent however you wanna see it) but she's not. That should really scare you. You can hate the Republicans, love the Democrats but can honestly never tell me that you think she was perfect brother or anywhere close. Don't tell me she was a better choice than Bernie. She didn't win anything in primaries, and only got hired as DEI for VP after Biden was told by a certain governor he wouldn't get his endorsement unless he gets a black female for the job. She was nothing competent. Couldn't sit a decent unscripted interview in her life. Her plan was written by others good at writing, she couldn't come up with anything herself in her speeches, interviews and debates. How do you not see past any of that? To end this, I'll just say, if Russia hoax was founded to not be a hoax, he'd be in jail already. They haven't found anything conclusive that's why he's not in yet. They've found more dirt on Hunter Biden than Trump, yet he's immune. As an act of bipartisanship, Trump however has come out saying he'd pardon Hunter so there's that. I just hope you can be brave enough and put some effort into reset the other side. I come from the left and Ik how you think but definitely nothing is black and white. And as I said in other comments, corporations love nothing more than to keep you trapped in their news ecosystem, to give a middle finger to them alone is enough of a reason to reach out to the other side","title":"Bill Maher says 'my head's not exploding' over Trump picking RFK Jr. for HHS: 'We do need shaking up'"},{"text":"I'm betting on his confirmation at this point.

Another thing that encourages me: renewable energy is being deployed in many community-scale installations in developing nations such as in Africa, the idea being that the energy needs of such places can be met with renewables from the start instead of having to transition from fossil fuels to renewables down the road.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 17, 2024"},{"text":"Privatize the ATF and make it an Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms storefront that provides INCOME for the federal government.

He decided to go to Jonestown on a fact-finding mission. He addressed the members of the Peoples Temple the night of Nov. 17.Ryan had wanted to bring then Congressman from Indiana Dan Quayle, the future vice president, with him. Flynn says Quayles baby may have saved his life.He encouraged Dan Quayle to go down because he knew the temple had an Indiana connection and Quayles life was basically saved by his daughter, who was born around Thanksgiving of 1988.The next day Ryan was ready to leave. But, he was taking several people with him who wanted to leave the Temple. When they got to the air strip at Port Kaituma, several men were waiting on them. The men were Peoples Temple security. They ambushed the group and killed Ryan, one of the people leaving the temple, and three journalists. One of those journalists was Bob Brown, who caught some of the murder on tape as he fell with his camera.Later that day Jones convinced 918 people to take a combination of chemicals.The adults took injections.

It is a common and easy way of expressing dissatisfaction with the policies of the government by being angry with the king even as the king was not involved in the making or implementing of those policies.I am not sure about your flex argument but it may very well be true. One might have to go back to the debates in Parliament to make such a determination.It has been years since I read excerpts from Edmund Burkes arguments in Parliament from that era. He recognized, early on, the dangers of the policies being enacted and spoke against them.

This leaves a lot of room even inside its most egregious rulings for interpretation by lower courts.Additionally, courts of appeal typically review the rulings of the lower court and their interpretation of law, but not the merits of the originally presented evidence. This means that the courts of the initial hearing have significant influence over the outcome.Ill also leave [this tidbit](https://ballotpedia.org/SCOTUS_case_reversal_rates_(2007_-_Present)) as a frame of reference: In its 2023 term, SCOTUS rendered opinions on 62 cases. Of those, 44 cases (70%) overturned the lower courts opinion. Yes, these were probably significant cases that shaped future precedent.

A common one cited was inflation. Which was back down to 2.1% before the election from the highs after pandemic spending.  2% is the general target. And while this had the strongest pandemic recovery of any country in the world, it has been labeled as a failure. Just because you say something is true doesnt make it true. 3) Who has reported that she had a full on crying fit election night?  That really sounds like the same kind of reality that says that inflation is out of control at 2.1%. TBH, I would far rather see that response than a brazen attempt to undermine democracy and to prompt an insurrection. 4) .#metoo and #believewomen has done very little in this country other than reduce the stigma for women to report crimes. If you think that people had fair treatment before and lost that now, you are definitely living in the land of make believe. False accusations have always been devastating to those accused when made public. But true accusations have often been ignored, particularly in the business world. But when you have multiple women coming forward with the same claim, it becomes far more likely that there is a pattern of behavior there. If you believe that women have not been abused by men in power positions over them, you are disconnected from reality. How should these accusations be fairly evaluated?

Consider:1. The renewable transition and the electrification of transportation and other sectors is well underway, with significant momentum behind it. There is lots and lots of money being made right now on this and there are very powerful interests that have no intention of slowing down. Solar and wind power are everywhere (even Texas is building it like crazy), batteries are taking over the electric grid, and auto manufacturers are rapidly transitioning to EV manufacturing (also EVs are cool and sexy, people *really* like them). None of this is gonna change just because Trump picked an idiot oil industry crony to run DOE.\\n2. The US is not the entire world. And the rest of the world is very serious about renewable energy and decarbonization. Many developed countries have already achieved decoupling between CO2 emissions and GDP growth, and smaller developing countries are skipping the fossil fuel phase entirely and jumping straight to renewables. Not much Trump can do about that.\\n3. I know he promised to \\"drill baby drill\\", but, uh, *we're already doing that*. The US is currently producing more oil than it ever has in its entire history - I believe more than *any* country has ever produced in history. I suppose it's possible for us to produce more, but oil companies don't just drill for fun; they do it so they can sell it. Oil is a global market, and global demand has peaked. It's only going down from here. Nobody wants to spend money extracting a resource unless they can sell it for a profit, and as oil demand falls, excessive drilling will not be profitable. You can drill more, but you can't manufacture demand. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying another Trump term will be great for the environment. I'm sure there will be loosening of regulations resulting in more environmental damage, and he'll probably interfere with renewable energy development in various ways.But in the grand scheme of things, this train ain't stopping. We've already made enough progress to cut expected warming by the end of the century in half, avoiding the apocalyptic scenarios predicted 10 or 15 years ago. And that progress is accelerating rapidly.

People just werent going for that anymore as is evidenced by the landslide win. So thats not really up for debate and I will not debate you on that, the people have spoken. All I can tell you is that if there is some type of catastrophe that cannot be handled when people begin to lose confidence, then the pendulum will swing over to the left. If the Democrats can get their message in a more appointed NonWolk direction and focus on the issues that really affect people versus identity politics and get back to your core and stop Succumbing to Big corporate interest through the media, etc. I think the media that youve sadly been brainwashed with like CNN or MSNBC are going to fall by the wayside, because people are too smart to listen to their lies and rhetoric. But lets say in 2036 you can get your messaging on point and focus on more moderate positions, then you would definitely have a chance to win.","title":"CMV: Republicans will continue to win both the Presidency and Senate continually till 2036."},{"text":"Anyone else think voting in California is fraudulent?","title":"Schiff: Trump Wants to Use the Military Against Me"},{"text":"If you want Bush or Reagan style Republicans you can always vote Democrat.","title":"\\"Makes us look like Nazis\\": Trump allies asked to stop talking about mass deportation \\"camps\\" | \\nThe president-elect's advisers worry about how the word \\"camp\\" plays as they plot mass deportation schemes"},{"text":"Feels like it lol","title":"I love you guys.

I'm just tired of everything being so hostile.  But I also believe that people want an excuse to be hostile.  If we didn't want it to be like this it wouldn't be like this.  People want to have a socially acceptable target for their aggression.I know a lot of it is just primitive tribalism manifesting in people cloistering themselves off in different groups due to this need to feel like they belong somewhere, and a lot of the snarky bullshit is just virtue signaling to their chosen group.  It's all to be expected, sadly enough.  But I'm more accepting of it when it comes to smaller things that don't matter.  Fuck it, kill each other over which sports team is better.  Get into a shouting match over what loadout is best in Black Ops 942.  Curse each other's names over a difference of opinion in what the best way to clip your toenails is. But when it comes to the future of the country.  The way it's run.  The economy and general larger society we all have to live in.  That's when people need to chill out, set feelings aside, and talk. I've seen a lot of comments from Leftoids saying Rightoids don't understand the economic policies they voted for.  Okay, that's fine.  Have you tried explaining your position to them without condescending to and insulting them?  Or have your interactions with 'the other side' been nothing but condescension and insults? I've seen a lot of Rightoids saying Leftoids don't understand their positions on various issues.  Okay, that's fine.  Have you tried explaining those positions to them without just mindlessly plastering memes everywhere and trying to bait rage out of Leftoids?I think we could all do better as citizens, and as human beings in general.  That being said, I honestly don't *expect* better.  Again, if people didn't want it this way, it wouldn't be this way.

I worked during junk removal at my dad's company for a few years after dropping out of college but I soon learned that this was just going to affect me physically as I got older seeing my dad's body deteriorate slowly. I learned web development on my own and eventually got hired after about 3 years of struggling to get hired (Pre-COVID era).I went back to college because I know if I want to get picked for certain positions, having a degree will help me. I could have been totally fine not going back, but I felt like my choices would be limited (Whether that is true or not is debatable) and plus, I really wanted to go back to school since I feel motivated and I also want to say I went and got a degree.Basically, things change and you should learn how to adapt to it. Here comes Haitian immigrants who are motivated to help revive a community. Are they going to make Springfield a bustling metropolis? No of course not, but they could bring a new chapter to the community and these people just spit on them and refuse it. It's not like they couldn't get any help, they *rejected* it. And I am supposed to feel sorry for these people, who will think of me as subhuman because of ethnicity since I am a \\"lazy criminal\\"?

The burden is on them when youre the incumbent party to prove why voters should let you stay in office. A lot of metrics like inflation and unemployment, and are great yeah. But wealth inequality is still growing immensely. Poorer incomes saw some wage increases after the inflation spike, but the median incomes across the board didnt really change significantly. The distribution of incomes as a measure of how much all workers are getting back in terms of wages and benefits is still extremely unfavorable to most people because it caters too much to the extremely wealthy. A lot of people saw wage increases, but their overall purchase power is still declining despite that, due to the cost of living increases, and the fact that a lot of the economic output that fueled the recovery was concentrated in large businesses and corporations, and relatively little of that improved output actually directly benefitted workers. Most of the new jobs in the last few years that brought the unemployment down, nearly 2/3 of them, came from small businesses, ffs. But the big corporations have been making a killing, and who tend to stifle competition, something that  also makes it really hard for those small businesses to grow and thrive. Many of those small businesses failed  but so many of them have been being created elsewhere that they are still driving the majority of new job growth. Meanwhile, top corporations everywhere just cut, and cut, and cut, and only a handful of them are actually helping to grow the job market. No wonder people didnt like the messaging that the economy was supposedly great. They sure as hell tried to talk about a lot of this stuff in some measure, but they didnt do enough to really point at those issues and promise to make the next term all about fixing the economic inequality itself to set up for a future that people would want to vote for.","title":"Republicans suddenly think the economys great and the election wasnt rigged"},{"text":"He also knows Trump is the only guy that can end the war.

While European leaders have started discussions to see whether they could fill any funding gap for Kyiv if the incoming Trump administration cuts off support, officials in many capitals recognize that an off-ramp to the conflict appears increasingly necessary. They note how Russia is gaining ground as Ukraine struggles for troops and weapons. In the latest assault, Russia launched about 120 missiles and 90 drones at targets across the country early Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, in what appeared to be an attempt to knock out power infrastructure in three key regions. Dtek, Ukraines largest private energy company, said the attack caused severe damage. Ukrenergo, the state energy company, said energy workers were killed. It was the 10th attack on energy infrastructure this year after a series of barrages in the spring and summer knocked some 80% of Ukraines thermal-power generation and destroyed a third of its hydropower generation capacity.","title":"Trumps Push for Ukraine Peace Finds Growing Acceptance in Europe"},{"text":"Bluesky is pretty cool","title":"A study found that Xs algorithm now loves two things: Republicans and Elon Musk"},{"text":"Then what are you talking about ?","title":"Kamala didn't lose because she's black or a woman.

They started with ghettos, frank theft of Jewish wealth, forced labor camps, and eventually, when no more wealth could be wrung out from their Other, instead of admitting that Slavery was already a disproven economic model, they started killing their slaves en masse.This time, it wont be labor camps, it will be private prisons to skirt the 13th amendment. And when those non-people (in a future legalist sense), without rights or hope, stop working, a reason will have to be found to justify why their food and housing is worth the failure to produce. And when it still doesnt work and the economy is in the shitter, it wont be the case that they all fess up to being wrong, they will instead start killing those undocumented or close enough immigrants or close enough.","title":"Mexico and other countries can't handle millions being sent back."},{"text":"never saw it, might check it","title":"So, on september, putin warned if the long-range missiles approval would put NATO at war with russia, and today they were approved by the US."},{"text":"Since US will ally with Russia or just let them be.\\nYeah.. the war will end under Trump.","title":"Trumps Plan to End the Ukraine War Before Hes Even Inaugurated"},{"text":"But see this just implies that American Latinos are ubiquitous which simply isnt true","title":"Kamala didn't lose because she's black or a woman.

And then replace all the military leadership with Ultra MAGAs. At least that's probably how he thinks it can work. .... After some googling, there doesn't seem to be any guard rails against a military purge. The executive branch seems to have the authority to fire any person in the military at will, re-assign them to desk duty in the middle of no-where, or ask for their resignation. Either way there are multiple ways to side line apolitical officers. The process for promotion is fairly straight forward. The military recommends to the president who should be promoted. And the president usually rubber stamps it, and sends it to the Senate who usually rubber stamps all the recommendations in like 30 mins. The military is trusted to promote their own successfully. But there doesn't seem like there is anything stopping Trump from doing fast promotions of MAGA military members or Proud Boys who join the military. It's just a matter of if the Republican controlled Senate will go along with it, which I suspect they will. The Democrats could try to filibuster the worst promotions. But that only works up to a point. Democrats probably could get away with filibustering any member of the Proud Boys. But they couldn't get away with filibustering an overall competent officer just because his home has a Trump flag on his private property. And I wouldn't be surprised if Trump urges the Senate to do away with the filibuster.","title":"NBC: \\"The Trump transition team is compiling a list of senior current &amp; former U.S. military officers who were directly involved in the withdrawal from Afghanistan &amp; exploring whether they could be court-martialed for their involvement, according to a U.S. official &amp; a person familiar with the plan\\""},{"text":"Wouldn't r/politics or r/pics be a more appropriate place for this?","title":"Trump gives RFK Jr McDonalds that the next health secretary prvciosuly described as poison to eat on private plane"},{"text":"Same here, I secretly wish that he implements them and in doing so, destroys the entire economy And causing more people to turn against him","title":"Trumps authority to impose sweeping tariffs to be put to the test"},{"text":"You scream, I scream, we all scream for ice cream! \\nI'll see my way out.","title":"Biden just approved western missile strikes deep into Russia."},{"text":"however she lost, thank goodness she's gone....","title":"A clarification on Trump"},{"text":"The very vast majority of Christians have no Christian values.\\nThere is a reason you tend to see the church in a decline.?","title":"Haitian immigrants flee Springfield, Ohio, in droves after Trump election win"},{"text":"Its maga lol","title":"Whenever you see supposed nazis or any group marching somewhere and they all have their faces covered,  those are ALWAYS establishment plants trying to create the perception that racism in America is a thing."},{"text":"Good thing Biden waited 3.5 years to slow walk this decision, just like when he slow walked the Abrams, Bradleys, Patriot missiles, and F-16s...","title":"Biden Allows Critical Aid to Ukraine Ahead of Incoming Trump Administration"},{"text":"Let them eat each other","title":"Fox News host confronts Mike Johnson with GOP demand for Matt Gaetz report"},{"text":"What is \\"x\\"?

However, just because corporations do that does not imply that an entire country is not racist. Racism exists around the world, in many forms. Just because corporations denounce it, does not mean that an entire country isnt racist. They have nothing to do with one another.If a country werent racist, thered be no racial discrimination, slurs, hate crimes, etc. Regardless, America was founded with equality for white men and only white men.

They simply must recognize that several planks of their platform are thoroughly rotten.Identity politics is over. No one wants it. Latinos and blacks don't even want it, as witnessed by the fact that they moved to Trump in record numbers. Trump got a majority of Latino men nationwide, and in some counties he got a majority of Latino men and women, even with all that he has said about immigrants from Latin America over the yearslike that they're poisoning the blood of our people, which is straight out of Mein Kampf. A comedian called Puerto Rico a pile of garbage at a Trump rally, and the entire democratic machine, and all of liberal media, seized upon it, as though a nuclear bomb had just vaporized an American city, and no one cared.Identity politics is dead, and we have to bury it.There's one species of identity politics that had an enormous effect on this election, and most Democrats don't seem to realize it: Around half a percent of American adults identify as transgender or non-binarythat's 1 in 200 people.  And yet the activism around this identity has deranged our politics for as long as Trump has been in politics. One lesson that I would be quick to draw from this election is that Americans aren't really fond of seeing biological men punch women in the face at the Olympics.1 And if that sounds like transphobia to youyou're the problem. Political equality, which we should want for everyone, does not mean that trans women are women.Trans women are people and should have all the political freedom of people. But to say that they are womenand that making any distinction between them and biological women, for any purpose, is a thought crime and an act of bigotrythat is the precept of a new religion. And it is a religion that most Americans want nothing to do with.I want to be very clear about this: I have no doubt that there are real cases of gender dysphoria, and we should want to give such people all the help they need to feel comfortable in their own bodies and in society. How we think about this, and how we understand it scientifically, is still in flux. But there are four-year-olds who, apropos of nothing, claim to be in the wrong bodyfor instance, they were born a boy, but they insist that they're really girlsand they never waver from this. It's pretty obvious in those cases that something is going on neurologically, or hormonallyat the core of their beingand that it is not a matter of them having been influenced by the culture. But, conversely, there now seem to be countless examples where the possibility of social contagion is obvious. Where, due to the influence of trans activists on our institutions, these kids are effectively in a cult, being brainwashed by a new orthodoxy.  These are radically different cases, and we shouldnt be bullied into considering them to be the same.I've spoken to many Democrats in recent years, and over the course of this election, and a shocking percentage of them imagine that all the controversy about trans rights and gender identity in kids is just a product of right-wing bigotryand that its a non-issue, politically. Whereas it is obvious that, for millions of Americans, it might as well have been the only issue in this election. Not because they are transphobic assholes, but because they simply do not accept the new metaphysics, and even new biology, mandated by trans activists and the institutions that they have successfully bullied and captured. And it's important to say that not all trans people agree with what these activists say and do.Having the thought police suddenly proscribe the use of the term woman, and demanding that we speak instead of birthing person, or menstruators, or people with ovaries, or some other Orwellian construction designed to test everyone's patience and sanity the sight of people being deplatformed on social media or fired from universities for merely stating that there are two biological sexesI actually know a professor who lost her job at Harvard over this witnessing an epidemic of gender confusion spread through our schools, when people with their own eyes could see that this was a social contagion being encouraged by the schools themselvesthe ultimate fruition of which, in many cases, is irreversible medical procedures We've got an epidemic of teenage girls wanting double mastectomiesand some are actually getting them, based on ideas being spread on TikTokand any parent who resists this trend gets demonized and, under certain conditions, could lose custody of their kids?Congratulations, Democrats.

These are radically different cases, and we shouldnt be bullied into considering them to be the same.I've spoken to many Democrats in recent years, and over the course of this election, and a shocking percentage of them imagine that all the controversy about trans rights and gender identity in kids is just a product of right-wing bigotryand that its a non-issue, politically. Whereas it is obvious that, for millions of Americans, it might as well have been the only issue in this election. Not because they are transphobic assholes, but because they simply do not accept the new metaphysics, and even new biology, mandated by trans activists and the institutions that they have successfully bullied and captured. And it's important to say that not all trans people agree with what these activists say and do.Having the thought police suddenly proscribe the use of the term woman, and demanding that we speak instead of birthing person, or menstruators, or people with ovaries, or some other Orwellian construction designed to test everyone's patience and sanity the sight of people being deplatformed on social media or fired from universities for merely stating that there are two biological sexesI actually know a professor who lost her job at Harvard over this witnessing an epidemic of gender confusion spread through our schools, when people with their own eyes could see that this was a social contagion being encouraged by the schools themselvesthe ultimate fruition of which, in many cases, is irreversible medical procedures We've got an epidemic of teenage girls wanting double mastectomiesand some are actually getting them, based on ideas being spread on TikTokand any parent who resists this trend gets demonized and, under certain conditions, could lose custody of their kids?

No one is stupid for voting differently.Because the type of shit Trump/MAGA espouses isn't normal rational sane or genuine politics.Nobody called George Bush or Mitt Romney voters racist or nazi-supporters or what have you because those guys campaigned on real policy, and/or held office in a respectable fashion. They didn't use stereotypical fascist tactics such as blaming and attacking immigrants and LGBTQ and so on instead of running on actual policy. These are blatantly transparent ploys for anyone who has read a history book.The MAGA movement basically adopts any and all anti-science fringe conspiracy theory positions in order to manipulate voters with manufactured issues. Anti-vax, anti-climate change etc - stuff that shouldn't be politicized at all, or wasn't until MAGA showed up, and is only politicized to manufacture wedge issues. This is dangerous an irresponsible, because mainstreaming this kind of nonsense could and has lead to serious harm. And that sort of thing has nothing to do with either conservative or liberal political policy.So continuing to vote for these type of MAGA lunatics, despite years of not only warnings but very specific evidence as to why this was a terrible idea, well there's not really any good explanation for doing so at this point. Outside of malice or ignorance. It's in ur interest whether u like the president or not that he succeedsSucceeds at what though? Deporting the immigrant workforce and leading to massive price increases on all sectors dependent on immigrant labor - such as food to housing?Succeeds in passing catastrophic tariffs that would mirror or eclipse America's slide into the 1929 Great Depression?Succeeds in acting out his priority task of promised threats to go after his various endless list of enemies? A task that has no practical value to average citizens just living their lives and working and going about their business?The best outcome I can hope for is the administration is so distracted by infighting and poor decisions that they are unable to carry out their worst plans. That would be the closes thing to \\"success\\".Unfortunately the institutional guardrails won't be in place for this second Trump administration, such as more sane cabinet picks that helped curbed Trump's worst instincts.In fact you have to face that Kamala got 70mil votes because they threw 3-4x the cash on campaign advertisement and most of their strategy was 'trump Hitler', 'abortion yes' and 'im a black woman'. The Harris campaign did not campaign on Trump being hitler. Random idiots like me online might be saying it, but the campaign certainly didn't.Harris also notably avoided mentioning her race or gender, or making any sort of deal about it. The campaign was very consciously avoiding anything that could be interpreted as \\"identity politics\\", to the point some liberals were complaining about it. This was starkly different than Hillary Clinton's campaign that did make a big deal about \\"first woman president\\" and \\"I'm with her\\" and all that. (Which is hardly something that anyone should take offense to that anyway, but it's an easy thing for some people to complain about)Abortion is a real issue - you will notice that freedom of choice ballot initiatives passed in certain red states where Harris lost even. It's a huge issue that generally the majority of the country is in favor of. It's an actual policy position.I'm of course aware that right-wing media all day long *claimed* Harris was running on all this stuff - Trans inmates and what have you, in order to mislead people, but that's absolutely not what was campaigned on by Harris. You can review the campaign website and positions, as well as any official campaign advertisements. Imagine if Russia hoax wasn't propagated for the first 4 years and what America could've accomplished. Have an open mind.The Russia stuff wasn't and isn't a hoax. There's reams of evidence to support it, including the contents of the Mueller report. I know Trump likes to claim it's debunked, and all that, but that's factually not the case.","title":"Bill Maher says 'my head's not exploding' over Trump picking RFK Jr. for HHS: 'We do need shaking up'"},{"text":"Weird","title":"Republicans suddenly think the economys great and the election wasnt rigged"},{"text":"Stop feeding the troll, please.

Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.  \\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century  \\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. Youve already done this, havent you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.  \\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of our institutions unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions dont protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.  \\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.  \\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of terrorism and extremism. Be alive to the fatal notions of exception and emergency. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.  \\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Dont fall for it.  \\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Dont use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps The Power of the Powerless by Vclav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes?aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.  \\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.  \\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.  \\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.  \\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.  \\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.  \\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.  \\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.  \\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.  \\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.  \\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.  \\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.  \\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)  \\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.  \\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.  \\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.  \\n?

I don't even disagree with him on the actual issue, but this is an issue that impacts less than 5% of the public. Democrats lost because for 30 years, they've abandoned the working class. They've pursued free trade agreements like NAFTA, which have decimated the working class and cozied up to big donors and Wall Street. Kamala even had a Wall Street approved campaign. Instead of actually looking at why working people are abandoning the Democratic party, he's explaining the results by saying trans issues were the reason Democrats lost. Shifting right on trans issues won't hurt the donor class and economic royalists, which have destroyed this nation. Actually taking on power and standing up for the working class does take courage. And it's the right thing to do. Moulton believes that Democrats should shift right on these issues and continue to run a corporate friendly party.

A son learned his father's trade by example -- every day was \\"take your son to work day\\".  Along with a trade, a son learned what it meant to be a man.  Starting in the 19th Century, most men went off to work in factories and mines, and sons were left at home to be raised by their mothers.  Later they went to school, to be taught mostly by women.  Without the constant presence of a father, sons did not learn first-hand what it meant to be a man, leaving a gap in their psyches.It's an interesting argument.  I don't buy it, but I was raised more by women than by men, though dad did spend a lot of time with me.

My great grandpa raised 4 kids working as a union foundary foreman and great grandma stayed at home, went to church group, led the knitting club, etc. Great Grandpa was a die hard dem and stopped going to his barber when the guy trashed JFK.

But Trump is very much wanting to be nationalistic and divorce America from Europe (he's not a fan of NATO). Boris Johnson discovered how little Trump cared and welcomed Biden since he was far more cooperative, even though you'd expect Biden and Boris to hate each other. But no, Obama and Cameron were cordial with each other, as were Biden with Boris and Sunak. Really, the people Trump consistently praise aside from sycophants (I originally wrote psycho-phants because there has to be a name for this new breed of them) who incessantly praise him are Putin and Xi.

This marked a historic turn by Riyadh toward Tehran-Israeli conflict, and away from US-supported normalisation with Jerusalem.-Saudi Arabia accused Israel for the first time of committing genocide in Gaza. MbS told the leaders who gathered in Riyadh, that the kingdom renewed its condemnation and categorical rejection of the genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people-Trump has been put on notice that hes meeting a radically different geopolitical landscape in West Asia compared to his first term as president.-Meanwhile, Tehran is also deepening its cooperation with Russia, which adds a giant new Ukraine-sized complexity to Trumps Iran policy. While in Eurasia, the US has allies, Trump is navigating in West Asia pretty much alone.-The summit in Riyadh witnessed the African Union joining hands with the Arab League and OIC to sign a tripartite agreement on Tuesday to establish a mechanism to support the Palestinian cause, which will be coordinated through the three organisations secretariats as a game changer to strengthen their influence in international forums. -MbS initiative to re-invigorate his conversation with Putin can only be seen against the backdrop of the profound misgivings in Riyadh regarding the Trump-Netanyahu bromance and the spectre of a possible regional war haunting the region stemming out of Israel drawing encouragement from the seamless US support expected through the coming 4-year period for the Zionist cause.","title":"Ray McGovern: Trump Caught Between *Two Worlds* in the Middle East &amp; Ukraine!"},{"text":"I do that all the time.

We got lobbiests, billionaires, corporations all deciding how it should be here. And it's fine I guess but that's not what we were taught in school.

Russia's strategy shifted from a tactical war on a regional scale to a strategic war on a global scale.Look at what Russia has been doing.  They are throwing mostly old, Soviet-era equipment and non-Russian lives into that grinder.  They're expending stuff they consider expendable.  In return, the US and EU have dumped nearly a trillion dollars into propping up Ukraine.All this spending has been a major contributor to inflation in the west.  This inflation has led to economic problems in the west, as well as political instability due to debates over that spending.  Russia has caused a pretty significant economic crisis in the west without having to even directly engage.If Trump makes it clear that the gravy train is no longer running, I think that will end it pretty quick.
